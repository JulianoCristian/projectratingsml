F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the proposed project is to increase access to sustainable water and sanitation
services in selected rural and urban areas.
This will contribute to the achievement of the water and sanitation Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). The proposed project will achieve its objective by (a) facilitating access to services
through programs for improving and extending water production and distribution systems and
urban sanitation networks, constructing social water and sanitation household connections, public
standpipes, and on-site sanitation facilities and (b) consolidating the achievements of the urban


                                                       ii
water reform, supporting the rural water subsector reform and strengthening capacities to deliver
and manage water and sanitation services.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The Project Development Objective (PDO) was not revised.

The September 2013 restructuring operated a reshuffle between (a) the initial custom PDO
indicators related to access and sustainability and (b) sectoral and corporate core indicators that
were initially monitored as intermediate results indicators. The indicators listed below are drawn
from the last ISR and reflect the indicators’ classification at completion (see section 1.3 of the
report for additional information).

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      At the time of project appraisal, Senegal’s water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector was
one of the most developed in Sub-Saharan Africa. Still, the sector faced three challenges:

        (a) Disparities in access and use of WSS services between urban and rural areas 1 and
            between water and sanitation

        (b) The need to improve the sustainability of rural water services, which encountered
            problems linked to the centralized maintenance of motorized boreholes and multi-
            village piped water systems

        (c) The need to consolidate reforms and the financial viability of the sector

2.       To address these challenges, the Government of Senegal had formulated a three-pronged
strategy consisting of (a) developing equitable access programs which have been successfully
tested on a large scale in urban areas; (b) reforming the maintenance and management of rural
facilities; and (c) developing a comprehensive strategy and long-term planning to reach the sectoral
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

3.      The Water and Sanitation Millennium Program (Programme d’Eau Potable et
d’Assainissement du Millénaire, PEPAM), which was adopted in July 2005, constituted the
instrument through which the Government intended to achieve the MDGs in the WSS sector by
2015. The PEPAM provided a global programmatic framework to coordinate interventions in the
sector. In urban areas, the PEPAM strategy aimed to ensure the successful implementation of
reforms as a continuation of initial reforms initiated in 1996. In rural areas, the PEPAM strategy
marked a profound shift in project planning methods, organization, and management of water
services and of private sector participation. This strategy was supported by a ‘unified intervention
framework’ made up of a common reference of tools and rules applicable to all interventions in
the subsector. The MDG targets with regard to access rates are listed below, along with the
situation prevailing before the approval of the project:

4.     For more than 15 years, the Bank has been Senegal’s leading partner for the development
of WSS services in urban areas as well as for water resources management, through the Water
Sector Project and the Long-term Water Sector Project (LTWSP). The latter project provided IDA

  Urban and rural areas regroup 43 percent and 57 percent, respectively, of the Senegal population, which was
estimated at 14.7 million people in 2014.


                                                     1
funds to support the process of formulation of the PEPAM, and Bank staff actively participated in
all consultation and validation workshops.

5.      When the LTWSP closed in June 2009, the Government requested further assistance from
IDA, with a larger scope that would expand into rural areas and could constitute a strategic means
to expedite the coalition of other donors’2 efforts around the PEPAM. Besides direct investments
with regard to infrastructure to develop access to WSS services in rural areas, IDA’s involvement
was justified by the pivotal role it has been playing in the reform of the urban water sector. The
quality of the sectoral partnership with the Bank and the trust it has generated are key elements in
assisting the Government in the reform of the rural water sector, particularly the gradual transfer
of the maintenance of motorized boreholes and the expected participation of private operators in
the management of multi-village water supply schemes.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

6.     The objective of the project was to increase access to sustainable water and sanitation
services in selected rural and urban areas.3

7.     Key performance indicators selected for measuring and monitoring progress toward
achieving the project development objective (PDO) included the following (as stated in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) and the Financing Agreement):

            The access rate to piped water in rural areas of intervention

            The access rate to piped water through private connections in urban areas (Dakar and
             other urban centers)

            The access rate to improved sanitation services in rural areas of intervention

            The access rate to improved sanitation services in Dakar

            The rate of availability of rural water supply (RWS) facilities in the Northern Zone of
             Senegal




2
  The sector’s external partners then included Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Japan, the Netherlands, the Nordic
Development Fund, Spain, Islamic Development Bank (IDB), African Development Bank (AfDB), European Union
and the European Water Facility, West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), the Saudi Development
Fund, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF),
and decentralized cooperation partners.
3
  This is the PDO as set out in the PAD, as well as in the Financing Agreement. The PAD explains further: “This
will contribute to the achievement of the water and sanitation MDGs. The proposed project will achieve its objective
by (i) facilitating access to services through programs for improving and extending water production and distribution
systems and urban sanitation networks, constructing social water and sanitation household connections, public
standpipes and on-site sanitation facilities, and (ii) consolidating the achievements of the urban water reform,
supporting the rural water subsector reform and strengthening capacities to deliver and manage water and sanitation
services.”


                                                         2
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

8.      The PDO was not modified. Overall, the list of indicators monitored under the project was
not modified, with the exception of the addition at project restructuring of the number of latrines
constructed under the project (core indicator). However, their classification either as PDO
indicators or intermediate indicators was modified at the time of the restructuring to reflect the
Bank’s shift to core sector indicators. The WSS core indicators of access to services (measured by
the number of people provided with access under the project), as well as the corporate core
indicator of direct project beneficiaries, replaced the custom access rates as PDO-level indicators
and the latter were shifted to intermediate results, as well as the indicator on monitoring the
availability of RWS facilities in the Northern Zone. The classification before and after
restructuring is provided in section F of the Data Sheet.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.     The project was designed to primarily benefit urban and rural households by providing
them with access to piped water and improved sanitation facilities. Poverty in Senegal4 is mostly
prevalent in rural areas targeted by the project, whereas the social connections programs to be
implemented in urban areas targeted peri-urban neighborhoods where most of the low-income
urban households resided. The original number of individual beneficiaries was as follows:

                                          Table 2. Project Beneficiaries
                                                        Individual Beneficiaries

Note: †Including 7,000 children who were expected to benefit from improved sanitation facilities in rural schools.

10.   In addition, the project would help establish 127 associations of water users (Association
d’Usagers de Forage, ASUFOR) which would be in charge of operating rural water systems.

1.5 Original Components

11.     The project had five key components that are detailed below.

12.    Component A: Rural water supply (US$25.08 million). This was the largest investment
component, the activities of which were regrouped under two parts: (a) Development of Access,
which was to be implemented by the Directorate of Water (Direction de l’Hydraulique, DH) in the
Senegal River Basin (regions of Saint-Louis and Matam and the department of Bakel), and
included the construction of 29 multi-village water supply systems and 15 water distribution

 Poverty remains highest in rural areas, where 57.1 percent of the population was poor in 2011 compared to 26.1
percent in urban Dakar.


                                                         3
network extensions and (b) Systems Improvement, which was to be implemented by the
Directorate of Operation and Maintenance (Direction de l’Exploitation et de la Maintenance,
DEM) in the same areas, as well as in the Central Zone, to facilitate the transfer of maintenance to
private operators and included the rehabilitation of boreholes, water storage facilities, pumping
equipment, and the provision of water meters and 10,000 service connections. This component
also included the provision of consulting services for planning, design, and supervision of works,
as well as support to the establishment of ASUFORs.

13.    Component B: Urban water supply (US$6.65 million). This component was to be
implemented by the National Water Company of Senegal (Société Nationale des Eaux du Sénégal,
SONES) throughout the country and included the supply and installation of 19,100 social water
connections and the construction of 100 km of secondary and tertiary water distribution network
extension.

14.     Component C: Rural sanitation (US$10.40 million). This component was to be
implemented by the Directorate of Sanitation (Direction de l’Assainissement, DA) in the regions
of Saint-Louis, Matam, and the department of Bakel. It included the construction of 17,500 latrines
and 70 school sanitation facilities, technical assistance to project management, hygiene education,
and outreach and training activities.

15.   Component D: Urban sanitation (US$7.80 million). This component was to be
implemented by the National Sanitation Agency of Senegal (Office National de l’Assainissement
du Sénégal, ONAS) in the peri-urban areas of Dakar. It included the expansion of sewerage
networks, the construction of a wastewater pumping station, a wastewater treatment plant
(WWTP), and 7,900 household sewerage connections, as well as consulting services for design
and works supervision, hygiene education, and outreach activities.

16.     Component E: Institutional strengthening and capacity building (US$6.63 million).
This component was to be implemented by the Program Coordination Unit (PCU) of the PEPAM.
It included support for the sector reforms, capacity building and support to project implementation
agencies, water resource management, and miscellaneous studies and support for coordination and
project management.

1.6 Revised Components

17.     The project components were not modified. However, the implementation of the urban
sanitation subcomponent in Thiaroye (in the vicinity of Dakar) encountered difficulties related to
the rejection of wastewater treatment facilities by some of the population (see section 2.2). The
Recipient accordingly requested the cancellation of the implementation of this subcomponent and
the redeployment of the project activities to the cities of Saint-Louis, Louga, and Thiès where a
high unsatisfied demand for household sewerage connections existed. This change was made
effective in the project restructuring of September 2013.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

18.     The project restructuring also included a reallocation of project funds to take stock of the
project savings in Components B (urban water supply) and C (rural sanitation), which amounted


                                                 4
to the equivalent of US$4.15 million. IDA funds were mainly reallocated to Components D (urban
sanitation) and E (institutional strengthening and capacity building) as follows:

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

19.     The project design was based on a sound analysis of the urban and rural water and
sanitation sectors and on lessons learned from projects implemented in a similar context. A
qualified team with the required skills was in charge of the project preparation, which benefited
from the experience and sector knowledge accumulated during the implementation of the Water
Sector Project and the LTWSP and particularly from the assistance provided to the Government
in the preparation of the PEPAM (see section 1.1).

20.     Project design, objectives, and implementation arrangements took into account the
complexity of activities. Project preparation took into consideration the inherent complexity of
the project, with multiple activities5 scattered throughout the country and implemented by six
agencies. The project design gave a clear priority to the rural components taking up most of the
credit amount but also aimed at assigning a significant impact to the urban components and
ensuring that the ongoing sector reforms would be deepened. Implementation arrangements were
designed to accommodate the capacities of the various implementing agencies (IAs). The project
approach to develop access to WSS services in urban areas replicated the experience of successful
social connections programs executed by the private water operator, Senegalese Water Utility
(Société des Eaux du Sénégal, SdE) and by ONAS under previous IDA-financed operations,
whereas the rural water works were straightforward and commensurate with the recorded
experience of the DH in implementing new water systems and the DEM in implementing
rehabilitation works. The experience of the DA in implementing on-site sanitation programs in
rural areas was somewhat limited and the project accordingly relied on the use of a contract
management agency (CMA), replicating the previous experience of the LTWSP in the Dakar
region. In addition, the former PCU of the LTWSP, which had proved to be efficient in project
monitoring, reporting, and financial management (FM), as well as in the quality control of

 The PAD lists 35 subcomponents (16 for RWS, 2 for urban water supply, 5 for rural sanitation, 9 for urban
sanitation, and 3 for institutional strengthening and capacity building).


                                                         5
procurement, had been officially vested with the overall coordination of all PEPAM-related
operations, including this project.

21.     Beneficiaries and stakeholders were part of the planning process and closely involved
in the demand-generation activities. In accordance with the PEPAM’s Unified Intervention
Framework, the planning and design of rural WSS facilities was decentralized with the preparation
of local water and sanitation plans (Plans Locaux d’Hydraulique et d’Assainissement, PLHA) at
the level of districts (communes), which elicited the needs expressed by communities and elected
officials. In urban areas, the design of social connections programs relied on demand-generation
outreach activities to select areas in which tertiary networks would be constructed and identify
households who would benefit from service connections.

22.     Risks and mitigation measures were correctly identified at the project level, but the
likelihood of a change in the Government’s commitment on the reform process was
overlooked. In accordance with the practice prevailing at the time of project preparation, the risk
analysis focused on operation-specific risks and the Government’s commitment to the project
appeared strong, as well as its agreement with the reform process. It is noteworthy that since their
inception, the reforms of the WSS sector in Senegal have been entirely carried out at sector level
without the interference of the highest level of Government, which had always endorsed the
options and decisions made at ministerial department levels. However, the implementation
experience showed later on that the expectations that a consensus achieved at the sector level
would continue to prevail were overestimated.

2.2 Implementation

23.    The project implementation, as demonstrated by the remarkable conformity of actual
disbursements to the PAD forecasts, generally validated the options made at the preparation stage.
The project was never at risk and the September 2013 restructuring, which followed the midterm
review (MTR) of the project, operated only minor changes and a reallocation of funds.

24.      MTR. The Recipient and the Bank conducted an MTR of the project on time in April 2013
as initially planned and assessed the overall progress of the project toward achieving its
development objectives. Based on the results of the MTR, the Recipient and the Bank agreed upon
recommendations for the second term of the project, particularly for (a) redeploying part of the
urban sanitation activities outside of the Dakar area; (b) replacing the initial PDO indicators by the
Bank’s core indicators of access; (c) speeding up the implementation of on-site rural sanitation
facilities; and (d) reallocating funds. The MTR findings served as the basis for the Government’s
request for project restructuring.

25.     Adjustment of RWS activities. The DH and the Bank agreed in 2011 to slightly modify
rural water activities by giving priority to the development of new rural systems over the execution
of some rehabilitation activities (water storage tanks) that were not expected to substantially affect
performances. In addition, it was decided to reduce the number of water treatment plants from 19
to 13 and instead create multi-village systems to optimize investments and operating costs.

26.   Redeployment of urban sanitation activities. The only issue encountered in the
implementation of urban infrastructure was in relation with the construction of a sanitation system


                                                  6
in Thiaroye. First, after the signing of the contract for the construction of a condominial network
serving 1,200 households, a pumping station, and a WWTP, it appeared that the initially selected
construction site for the WWTP was no longer available. This was addressed with the cooperation
of the municipality, which helped relocate the WWTP in April 2012. However, further difficulties
emerged afterwards, with the opposition of some riparians to the planned location of the sea outfall
of the treated effluents from the WWTP. Although the municipality again offered conciliation, the
conflict was not solved at the time of the MTR. ONAS and the Government then proposed to
redeploy this activity in cities where an unsatisfied demand for sewerage connections existed,
which was eventually agreed so that this redeployment had no impact on the achievement of the
PDO.

27.      Initial delay in the implementation of rural sanitation activities. The implementation
of the rural sanitation component was delayed at the beginning by the termination of two works
contracts (one contractor was unable to provide a final performance bond). In addition, it appeared
that a significant number of households were unable to complete the superstructure of the latrines,
as this was their responsibility. A consultant was contracted to develop low-cost solutions for the
construction of the superstructures, which were successfully disseminated by the CMA.

28.     Government decisions and the reform process. In May 2011, the minister in charge of
water informed the sector donors that the President had signed a memorandum of understanding
with the SdE for the preparation of a full concession contract of the urban water and sanitation
services. At the same time, the Bank team was informed that the Presidency objected to the transfer
of the maintenance of motorized boreholes to a single private contractor in the Central Zone, as
contemplated in the project, and would rather see the maintenance transferred to local artisans.
Those decisions, which were taken without prior consultation, froze the reform process that was
previously agreed with all sector actors. However, the election of a new President in March 2012
and the appointment of new ministers considerably modified the Government’s vision of the
sectoral reforms. In addition, the business plan prepared by the SdE for the full concession
highlighted that a full concession would entail a 30 percent increase of the water tariffs, which was
socially unacceptable. Following a fruitful policy dialogue with the Bank team, it was then agreed
(a) to give priority to the finalization of the reform of the rural water subsector, including the
establishment of a new parastatal, the Rural Boreholes Agency (Office des forages ruraux, OFOR),
which would replace the DEM and play a role similar to the one of SONES in urban water supply,6
to resume the preparation of the bidding for the maintenance in the Central Zone and prepare
competitive bidding for the operation of multi-village water systems with the support of the Water
and Sanitation Program (WSP) and (b) prepare a road map for a comprehensive study of the
second-generation reform and, pending completion of the study, extend the current affermage
contract with the SdE.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

29.    M&E design. The project’s M&E system was based on the comprehensive system
developed for the monitoring of the PEPAM with the assistance of the Bank. The PEPAM system

6
 All rural water facilities were to be transferred to OFOR, a holding company which would be in charge of
managing assets, gradually delegating the operation and maintenance of facilities to private operators and
monitoring their performances.


                                                         7
provided detailed information on access to WSS services at the national and subnational levels.
This data which was available on the PEPAM website was used for the joint annual reviews of the
program conducted by the Government with external partners of the sector. In addition, WSP
assistance had helped develop a pilot database of rural facilities accessible at the local level, with
cellphones to monitor and update the actual state and availability of rural water systems. These
data were complemented by the information on access collected by SONES/SdE and ONAS in
urban areas. In accordance with the PEPAM’s practice, the PDO indicators focused on percentage
access rates in the project’s areas of intervention. The availability rate of rural water facilities was
considered as the main indicator of the sustainability of rural services. The intermediate results
indicators also monitored, among other things, the number of people provided with access to
services under the project, which are the Bank's core indicators.

30.     M&E implementation. All indicators have been collected on time and reported on by the
PCU during project implementation. It soon became apparent that there was a disconnect between
the evolution of the PDO indicators and the actual progress of the project, which was attributable
to the impact of projects financed by other donors in the same (urban and rural) areas. The Bank
supervision missions accordingly relied on the Bank’s core indicators of access rather than on the
percentage access rates to monitor progress. The MTR endorsed this shift and the core indicators
became the PDO indicators at project restructuring.

31.    M&E utilization. Outcome and intermediate (output) indicators were essentially used by
the Bank team to assess progress toward the PDO, detect lagging subcomponents, and provide
recommendations for speeding up implementation. This is particularly true for the sanitation
components and for the rural water activities linked to the provision of water service connections.
In addition, the project helped to set up a real-time monitoring system of the availability and
performances of rural water systems that will be used to monitor the rural operational conditions.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

32.     Environmental and Social Safeguards. The implementation of the project’s
Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) was coordinated by safeguards specialists
attached to the PCU and monitored by a national focal point and the regional offices of the
Directorate of Environment with the participation of Regional Monitoring Committees.
Implementation’s compliance with the ESMP was regularly assessed by Bank safeguard specialists
during supervision missions and found Satisfactory. The final assessment of the ESMP was carried
out in July 2014 and the overall safeguard compliance was rated as Satisfactory. The assessment
found that the initially planned activities had been fully implemented, albeit the documentation
related to the land ownership of the sites of some rural facilities needed to be completed.

33.      In hindsight, this assessment could have also considered the lessons to be drawn from the
cancellation of the sanitation activities in Thiaroye and the need for an in-depth evaluation and
mitigation of the possible reluctance of the urban population to accept wastewater treatment
facilities in their vicinity.

34.     Fiduciary compliance. Fiduciary compliance has been monitored by the Bank specialists
based in Dakar. The recommendations of the periodic reviews were implemented by the PCU. The
final procurement assessment (including a post review of procurement activities) found that the


                                                   8
project’s procurement performance was Satisfactory. The final FM assessment found that the
overall FM performance was Highly Satisfactory. Reporting and audit covenants were complied
with. The final disbursement rate (in SDR) is 99.3 percent.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

35.    Urban water and sanitation investments. The operation of the urban WSS facilities
constructed under the project is straightforward as they are managed by experienced utilities (SdE
and ONAS).

36.    Rural water investments. The arrangements for operating and maintaining the rural water
investments constructed under the project are as follows:

       (a) The 30 new systems of the Northern Zone supplied by groundwater are managed by
           ASUFORs. These have been established and supported by the project (provision of
           technical and management training, equipment, and consumables).

       (b) The 13 new systems supplied by surface water (with water treatment plants) and the
           complex system of Faboli are provisionally managed by caretakers and technicians
           trained under the project; competitive bidding is being prepared for their transfer to a
           private operator. The contract is expected to be awarded by January 2016.

       (c) The maintenance of the systems of the Central Zone that have been rehabilitated under
           the project is being transferred to two private operators. Bidding documents are being
           prepared for the transfer of the maintenance of the systems rehabilitated in the Northern
           Zone.

37.     The contracts provide key elements for operators’ accountability with appropriate risks
allocation between the parties, as well as performance incentives (remuneration based on
measurable performance indicators. In addition, the project has financed the establishment of a
real-time monitoring system in OFOR, including an asset database, a call center, and a smartphone
application, for controlling the functionality and operating performances of the rural water
systems.

38.     Follow-up operation. A follow-up project, the Senegal Urban Water and Sanitation
Project (UWSP) has been prepared with the support of this project and approved by the Board on
June 15, 2015. The UWSP, focusing on the construction of urban WSS infrastructure, will also
provide (a) support to the finalization of the next generation of reforms of the urban water and
sanitation sector, including the bidding for a new affermage contract with increased responsibilities
of the private operator in financing investments, the pursuit of synergies between water and
sanitation services, and the reinforcement of sector regulation and (b) additional support to OFOR
in implementing the rural water sector reform initiated under this project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Overall Relevance Rating: High

Relevance of Objective
Rating: High

39.     The project objective was consistent with the development priorities and circumstances at
the time of project preparation. The key objective—increasing access to sustainable water and
sanitation services—was highly relevant at that time and remains so. The underpinning Country
Partnership Strategy (2013–2017) sets out as its second pillar the improvement of access to basic
services, including water and sanitation. The PDO is also fully aligned with the recent country
vision to achieve economic emergence as formulated in the Emerging Senegal Plan, whose second
focus area seeks to meet basic social needs, which will require improving access to water and
sanitation services.

Relevance of Design and Implementation
Rating: High

40.     The project design built on the experience of successful water and sanitation operations in
urban areas of Senegal to replicate them in rural areas. The design of the infrastructure components
provided adequate solutions to boost service coverage, including the provision of affordable water
connections and adapted sanitation facilities in rural and urban areas. The design of Component E
addressed the sustainability challenges by paving the way for introducing private sector
participation in rural areas to improve the management and reliability of rural water systems, and
by helping deepen the reform of the urban water supply sector. The complexity of the project has
been successfully mitigated by implementation arrangements that were tailored to actual
capacities. The results framework was appropriate to monitor progress in the development of
access and the steps taken in the reform processes.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

PDO Efficacy Rating: High

41.     All PDO indicators have exceeded their end-of-project (EOP) targets. At completion, the
total number of direct beneficiaries amounted to about 658,000 people, representing 113 percent
of the EOP target. The number of people provided with access to services under the project
exceeded the EOP target by 33 percent for RWS, 8 percent for urban water supply, 7 percent for
rural sanitation, and 7 percent for urban sanitation. Similar results are recorded when using the
percentage access rates initially used as PDO indicators, the values of which are impacted by
parallel projects. In that respect, it is noteworthy that universal water service through household
connections has almost been achieved in Dakar (connection rate: 99 percent).

42.     The sustainability of rural water services has improved substantially, as (a) the availability
rate of water systems (proportion of rural systems that are actually functioning) increased from


                                                 10
83.5 percent at project inception to 97.1 percent (EOP target: 87.5 percent) and (b) the project
helped establish an entirely new institutional framework, including the creation of OFOR, and a
transparent contractual framework for the maintenance and management of rural water facilities
by fully accountable private operators.

43.     The above achievements are confirmed by the key output indicators measuring the number
of water and sanitation service connections in urban areas, the number of household and school
latrines in rural areas, and the number of ASUFORs established and supported by the project (see
annex 2 for the detailed output indicators per component). A detailed list of project activities, as
planned and as actually completed, is provided in the appendix to annex 2.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: High

44.     An ex post economic analysis has been carried out using a methodology similar to the one
used in the PAD (see details in annex 3). As in the PAD, the ex post analysis consists of (a) a cost-
benefit analysis of the water supply components (representing 61 percent of the total project costs)
for which quantifiable benefits can be measured (b) and a cost-effectiveness analysis of the
sanitation components.

45.     Water supply. For all subprojects (urban and rural) related to the development of access,
benefits result from the incremental sales of water, valued with the operators’ tariffs, and the
consumer surplus accruing to the consumers who previously obtained water from vendors or
standpipes and now benefit from private connections or standpipes. For other subprojects, which
are related to the improvements of the operating conditions of rural piped water systems
(rehabilitation, renewal, and electrification), benefits result from costs savings on energy costs,
maintenance costs, and replacement costs. Costs include investment costs (without taxes and
including the design and supervision costs), incremental operating costs (energy, chemicals,
commercial costs and labor costs) and renewal costs. The results of the cost-benefit analysis are
given in table 4, together with the results of the previous analysis (see details in Annex 3).

           Estimates                                PAD                           ICR

           10% discount rate

46.    The ex post EIRR is satisfactory and slightly above the PAD estimate.

47.     Sanitation. The cost-effectiveness analysis compares the annualized (with a 10 percent
discount rate) investment costs per capita of the sewerage option selected by the project, with
alternative options that could deliver similar environmental benefits in terms of wastewater and
excreta disposal. Alternatives options consist of (i) condominial solutions; and (ii) on-site
sanitation (soakaway pit and sludge treatment). The expansion of sewerage services through social
connections programs in urban centers already equipped with a sewerage system (primary sewer
network and wastewater treatment plant) is competitive, with regard to annualized investment cost


                                                   11
per capita (US$11.80 in Dakar and US$11.49 in other urban centers), with the on-site sanitation
solutions, as well as the condominial solutions that were implemented on a large scale under the
LTWSP (US$13.67 and US$11.41, respectively). In addition, sewerage connections enable
beneficiary households to save about US$27 per year on the cost of emptying conventional latrines.
The unit costs of the household latrines constructed in the rural areas (US$46 per capita) compare
favorably with the parallel projects carried out under the PEPAM in Senegal.

48.    The project efficiency is rated High, in view of:

          the satisfactory results of the economic analysis;

          the benchmarking of unit costs of the social connections programs, both for water and
           sanitation, which are the lowest in the sub region; and

          the administrative efficiency of the project management, which enabled completion of
           the project within the proposed time frame.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

49.     The overall outcome of the project is rated Highly Satisfactory since (a) the PDO, its
design, and implementation are highly relevant; (b) all key indicators related to the PDO, as well
as all output indicators, have achieved or exceeded their targets; and (c) the project has achieved a
high level of efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

50.     The most recent surveys of the situation of urban water supply show that social connection
programs supported by the project are highly beneficial to the poor. Urban households belonging
to the first quintile spend, on average, about CFAF 4,300 monthly with a social connection (for a
consumption of 50 liters per capita per day [lpcd]) and about CFAF 6,400 if they are not connected
(with a much lower consumption of 22 lpcd). In the case of rural households, it is estimated that
connected beneficiaries spend, on average, CFAF 2,700 per month (with a consumption of 45
lpcd), while households supplied by standposts spend CFAF 1,500 (with a consumption of 20
lpcd). Before the project, these households spent CFAF 2,400 for a consumption of 8 lpcd of
generally unsafe water.

51.    The final assessment of the ESMP points to the following impacts of the project on gender
inequalities:

          The provision of access to safe water substantially decreases (and eliminates in the case
           of household connections) the burden of water hauling, a time-consuming and
           physically stressful task, which mostly falls on women and girls (although boys are
           also involved in water fetching tasks in pastoral areas).



                                                 12
          The provision of (rural) household sanitation facilities eliminates disadvantages
           specific to women and girls as compared to men and boys.

          The (urban) sewerage connections provide safe household sanitation facilities, as well
           as adequate and convenient solutions to wastewater disposal—another task falling
           exclusively on women.

52.     Communities and elected officials actively participated in the formulation of the PLHA.
The involvement of communities in the outreach activities was a key element of success of the
social connections program managed by the SdE and ONAS. Similarly, beneficiaries’ feedback on
the rural sanitation facilities proposed by the project helped in exploring affordable solutions for
the construction of latrine superstructures.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

53.     The project eventually enabled the setup and implementation of a substantive reform of the
RWS subsector, which: (a) largely exceeded the institutional changes contemplated at appraisal
and (b) enabled demonstration that the private sector was ready to engage in rural areas. The joint
efforts of the Bank team and the WSP during project implementation brought about a consensus
over the possibility of replicating the institutional setup of the urban water supply sector in rural
areas, with the termination of the direct involvement of the DEM in the maintenance of facilities
and the creation of an assets-holding public company that will in turn delegate the operation and
maintenance of the rural piped water systems to private operators. These arrangements have
effectively materialized with the establishment of OFOR in January 2014, and the feasibility of
attracting private operators has been successfully tested with the award of the contract for the
management of two regional rural water systems serving 200,000 people to a joint venture of
Dutch, Rwandese, and Senegalese operators and award of the contract for the maintenance of 590
motorized boreholes in the Central Zone to two Senegalese operators. Other calls for bids to
delegate the management of rural water systems following the model developed under the project
are being prepared.

54.     The second-generation reform of the urban water sector has not yet materialized. However,
the SdE affermage contract was extended and amended to include additional responsibilities of the
operator in funding some investments. In April 2015, the Government issued a Framework Note
detailing a road map for the reforms that have been taken into account in the preparation of the
follow-up IDA project (UWSP) which includes a component supporting the next round of reforms.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low


                                                 13
55.     The risk to development outcomes is Low. The sustainability of the urban facilities built
under the project is not questionable as they have been incorporated into the general operations of
the SdE and ONAS, which have a satisfactory performance track record. As mentioned above,
rural water facilities are either operated by ASUFORs or are being transferred progressively to
private operators that have no record of operating performance. However, the establishment of the
real-time monitoring of the operating condition of rural systems and the substantial improvement
already observed in the availability rate of rural facilities (proportion of rural systems that are
actually functioning) under the project augur well for future performance.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

56.     The project was highly relevant to the country priorities and the Country Assistance
Strategy and its design built on sectoral policies that had been successfully tested to promote
efficiency in the development and delivery of water and sanitation services. The design of the
implementation arrangements addressed the complexity of the project, was carefully tailored to
the capacities of the various executing agencies, and rightly emphasized the necessity for a strong
PCU. M&E arrangements and tools were readily available. The project preparation also built on
the satisfactory fiduciary compliance demonstrated under the previous projects. As mentioned
above, the strict adherence of the actual disbursements to the PAD disbursement profile, together
with the timely completion of all project components, gives a posteriori a measure of the quality
of project design.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

57.     There were a total of 11 supervision missions over the five years of implementation. The
Bank task team leader (TTL) was based in a neighbouring country, with a team comprising (a) a
WSS specialist based in Dakar, who conducted field reviews and attended the PEPAM annual
review meetings and (b) fiduciary and safeguards specialists based in Dakar. As recorded in the
aide mémoires, the supervision missions focused on the development impact, with particular
attention given to performance indicators in assessing the implementation performance. Aide
memoires, back-to-office reports, and Implementation Status and Results Reports were produced
on time and reported candidly on implementation while providing detailed assessments and
recommendations.

58.     The Bank team proactively answered issues that arose during implementation, particularly
regarding the sector reforms, by (a) pushing the envelope of the reform of the rural water sector
beyond what was initially contemplated, with the assistance of the WSP, which provided valuable
inputs and (b) helping rebuild consensus on the next generation of reforms in the urban water
sector, through a fruitful policy dialogue with the Government and in coordination with other
donors. The long and strategic presence of the Bank team in the sector and the level of trust and


                                                14
confidence that had been reached with the Government and stakeholders was key in putting the
reform process on the right track. The team also effectively addressed the cost overrun problem by
proactively restructuring and reallocating funds.

59.     Project implementation also gave an opportunity for the Bank team, in conjunction with
other external partners of the sector, to insist on a reform of the urban water tariff policy. For some
time, in approving the periodical tariff revisions, the Government had decided to freeze the water
rates applicable to private customers and to compensate the freeze by instead increasing the rates
applicable to public users. Not surprisingly, this policy, which actually created a hidden subsidy
to water tariffs, did not translate into adequate budget allocations for the water bills of
administrations and led to accumulation of arrears in public water bills. The Bank team regularly
insisted on the discontinuation of this policy and on the need to compensate cross-debts between
SONES and the Government. Cross-debts were actually settled in 2012, 2013, and 2014 and the
Government eventually agreed in March 2015 to a revision of tariffs, including a reduction of
public rates and an increase of the rates applied to domestic customers.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

60.    In view of the above ratings of quality at entry and of supervision, the overall Bank
performance is rated as Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

61.   The project was high in the country’s priorities and the Government’s commitment to the
PDO and to the implementation of reforms appeared very strong. The Government performance
was Highly Satisfactory during project preparation.

62.      At an early stage of project implementation, the highest level of Government conveyed a
vision of the sector reforms that was substantially different from the consensus achieved at the
ministerial level and took steps to implement it. A fruitful dialogue resumed after the 2012
presidential elections, which enabled to implement the rural water sector reform beyond initial
expectations, extend and amend the current SdE contract, and formulate the guiding principles of
the next round of reforms of the urban WSS sector, for which the Government requested Bank
assistance under the follow-up UWSP. As mentioned above, the Government’s unsatisfactory
tariff-setting policy was eventually adjusted as a result of the sectoral dialogue. Otherwise, the
Government continuously expressed support to the PEPAM as the program to achieve the water
and sanitation MDGs and its performance during project implementation is rated Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

63.    The performance of the IAs is assessed separately.



                                                  15
64.    The implementation performance of the PCU, SONES, and DH was Highly Satisfactory.

65.      The PCU carried out its coordinating role and its implementation responsibilities regarding
the Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building component highly satisfactorily. The PCU
effectively carried out its monitoring and reporting responsibilities and its fiduciary
responsibilities, including procurement quality control. In addition, the PCU played a decisive role
in facilitating the dialogue over the rural water sector reform process and designing the road map
for the next generation reforms of the urban water. The leadership changes that occurred in the
PCU at an early stage of project implementation did not impact its performance.

66.     The implementation of the urban water supply component by SONES was swift and
efficient, and its partnership with the SdE, which handled the social connections program,
functioned effectively.

67.     Similarly, the implementation of the new rural water systems by the DH was highly
satisfactory. Procurement was efficient and led to significant savings.

68.     The performance of the DEM, DA, and ONAS was Satisfactory. The agencies completed
the activities on time after correcting problems that emerged during implementation.

69.      The DEM effectively managed the activities related to the rehabilitation and improvements
of rural water systems. However, its processing of the transfer of maintenance lagged and was
initially influenced by some reluctance to totally disengage from maintenance. This attitude was
eventually corrected after the creation of OFOR, which took over the DEM’s responsibilities.

70.     The appointment of the CMA to handle the rural water sanitation activities on behalf of the
DA took longer than initially expected. Implementation was further delayed by the need to
reinforce outreach activities and the early termination of two works contracts. Afterwards, the
CMA and DA proceeded with the necessary adjustments to complete on time the implementation
of the school sanitation program and the on-site household sanitation facilities.

71.     ONAS satisfactorily implemented the urban sanitation program. It appeared during
execution that ONAS had underestimated the quantity of secondary and tertiary networks required
to complete the sewerage social connections program. The reallocation of funds at project
restructuring enabled to cover the corresponding cost overruns. However, sewerage investments
eventually appear quite cost-effective and compare favorably with previous projects.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

6. Lessons Learned

72.     The highly satisfactory outcome of the project was primarily driven by the dedication of
the implementing agencies (IA) and was largely facilitated by the quality of project design, the
effective implementation arrangements, the quality of the policy dialogue with the Government
and the close collaboration between the IAs and the Bank team. Beyond the project performance,
various lessons emerged, which are outlined below.



                                                16
73.    The project confirmed the relevance and efficacy of social connections programs as the
best way of achieving the water and sanitation MDGs. The results achieved in the Dakar area
regarding urban water supply show that universal access to safe water through household
connections is a feasible and realistic goal in Sub-Saharan Africa.

74.      The project demonstrated that rural systems can attract professional operators, if the
institutional and contractual context is clear and transparent and if the scope of activities offers
real business opportunities. Whereas contracting a host of small local operators with limited
experience and capacities for managing single rural water systems often results in disappointing
outcomes, it is possible, as demonstrated by the project, to attract professional operators in rural
areas, provided that their scope of intervention is expanded to a sizable number of rural systems
guaranteeing a profitable business. This experience also demonstrates that the public-
private/urban-rural opposition on delivery of water services is part of an artificial debate. The most
important issue to be addressed is not the nature of the operator or the localization of the business
but the existence of critical conditions for operators to deliver on their commitments. These
conditions include the existence of a clear institutional framework between the Government,
communities, and operators, driven by the basic principles of transparency (clear definition of
roles, responsibilities), accountability (appropriate risk allocation between actors), and incentives
(remuneration of operators based on measurable performance indicators).

75.     The project demonstrated that project complexity, as regards the diversity of activities
and the number of IAs involved, is not a systemic impediment to success. Implementation
efficiency is not systematically affected by the complexity of a project and by the multiplicity of
IAs when implementation arrangements (a) are based on a sound assessment of capacities; (b)
include concrete mitigation measures (without relying solely on technical assistance and training)
to address the lack of experience of the IAs; and (c) rely on a strong PCU as an effective tool for
coordinating multi-agency programs. Using a CMA proved to be a good option for the execution
of large-scale community-driven projects like the rural on-site sanitation program that was
successfully implemented under this project.

76.     As outlined in the Borrower’s contribution, it is preferable to package rural waterworks
contracts on a geographical basis rather than on a technical basis, particularly in the case of
systems including water treatment plants. It would have been more efficient to have a single
contractor working on all activities in a given area rather than to have to coordinate several
specialized contractors. Under the project, some water treatment plants were completed while civil
works for storage tanks and pipe laying were lagging, which prevented commissioning earlier the
whole system.

PAD. The project was subjected to a cost-benefit analysis of the water supply components and a
cost-effectiveness analysis of the sanitation components.

Water Supply
2.      Benefits. The PAD provided a cost-benefit analysis of the water supply components of the
project, taking into account as benefits:

       (a) For all subprojects (urban and rural) related to the development of access.
           Benefits result from the incremental sales of water, valued with the operators’ tariffs,
           and the consumer surplus accruing to the consumers who previously obtained water
           from vendors or standpipes and now benefit from private connections or standpipes;
           consumption and water prices before and after project are as follows

       Source: SdE (for urban water) and OFOR/technical studies (for rural water).
       (b) For other subprojects, which are related to the improvements of the operating
           conditions of rural piped water systems (rehabilitation, renewal, and
           electrification). Benefits result from costs savings on energy costs, maintenance costs,
           and replacement costs.

3.     Costs. Capital expenditures include investment costs (without taxes and including the
design and supervision costs) and renewal costs as needed over the period of analysis (30 years).
Incremental operating costs are as follows

Sanitation

5.      Urban sanitation. The economic analysis of the sanitation component is based on the cost-
effectiveness of the service option (sewerage) that was adopted by the project. The unit cost per
capita of this option is compared to other options that will deliver the same level of services with
regard to disposal of wastewater and excreta, as proposed for instance in the LTWSP. It should be
noted that the feasibility of the various options is also contingent on other considerations, such as
the soil conditions (permeability), the proximity of existing sewers, and hydraulic conditions. The
comparison is made on the basis of annualized costs, taking into account the lifespan of the various
options, which are given in Table 3.4.

6.      The above results demonstrate that the sewerage option is cost-effective in the project
context, where the social connection programs were deployed in cities already equipped with
primary sewer networks and WWTPs. The sewerage option is also cost-effective at the household
level, as sewerage connections enable beneficiary households to save about US$27 per year on the
cost of emptying conventional latrines.

7.      Rural sanitation. The average cost per capita of the household latrines constructed under
the project amounts to US$46 (including outreach, IEC and supervision costs and the cost of the
superstructure directly financed by the household). This cost is competitive with the values
observed in other sanitation programs carried out under the PEPAM.

1.      FOREWORD

The Credit Agreement No. SE 46780 between the Bank and the Government of Senegal was signed
in April 2010 with an amount of US$55 million. The agreement was made effective on June 21,
2010 and represents the IDA-financed component of the PEPAM, which was set up by the
Government to achieve the 2015 MDGs.

2.      CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT

The objective of the PEPAM-IDA was to increase access to improved water and sanitation
services (a) in rural areas of the Saint-Louis and Matam regions and the department of Bakel and
(b) in the urban centers served by the SdE. This would help achieve the water and sanitation
MDGs through (a) improving and expanding water production and distribution systems and
facilitating access to services with standposts and household service connections; (b) installing
social connections in urban areas and constructing on-site household sanitation facilities and
latrine blocks for schools in rural areas; and (c) consolidating the reform of the urban water sector,
transferring the maintenance of rural motorized boreholes to the private sector and strengthening
capacities. The specific objectives of the project were the following:

     (a) To increase access to safe water:
            in rural areas from 51 percent in 2008 to 73 percent in 2014 in the project area, which
             translates into 320,000 additional people having access to water, of which 130,000
             are under the project and 190,000 under operations of other actors.
            in urban areas: (i) in the Dakar region, from 82 percent in 2008 to 92 percent in 2014
             through household connections, which translates into 330,000 additional people
             connected to water, of which 81,900 are under the project and (ii) in other urban
             centers, from 68 percent in 2008 to 76 percent in 2014, which translates into 260,000
             additional people connected to water, of which 90,000 are under the project.

     (b) To increase access to improved sanitation:
            in rural areas from 27.5 percent in 2008 to 38.5 percent in 2014 in the project area,
             which translates into 374,941 additional people having access to improved sanitation,
             of which 175,000 are under the project;
            in urban areas: in the Dakar region, from 79.6 percent in 2008 to 83 percent in 2014,
             which translates into 275,000 additional people having access to improved sanitation,
             of which 79,000 are under the project.

     (c) To support the implementation of sector reforms:
            in rural areas, by setting up an enabling environment for planning and implementing
             investments and for the sustainability of services through (i) the creation of 127 new
             ASUFORs (corresponding to 50 percent of boreholes or surface water treatment
             facilities of the regions covered by the project) and (ii) support to the transfer of
             maintenance of rural facilities in the Northern Zone and Zone Centre.
            in urban areas, by supporting the process of strengthening the institutional reform.

3.         ASSESSMENT OF THE OBJECTIVE, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF
           THE PROJECT, AND THE OUTCOME OF THE POST-PROJECT
           OPERATIONAL PHASE
     3.1       Assessment of the Project Objective
     The water-related MDG and the project’s specific objectives were achieved.
     (a) In rural areas of project intervention, the water access rate reached 75.2 percent in 2014,
         exceeding the target of 73 percent, which translates into 320,000 additional people having
         access to water, of which 172,375 are under the project and 147,625 under operations of
         other actors.
     (b) In urban areas,

              in the Dakar region, the connection rate reached 98.9 percent in 2014, exceeding the
               target of 92 percent, which translates into 330,000 additional people having access to
               water, of which 81,900 are under the project; and
              in other urban centers, the connection rate reached 79.2 percent in 2014, exceeding the
               target of 75.8 percent, which translates into 260,000 additional people having access to
               water, of which 90,000 are under the project.

     Although the sanitation-related MDG was not reached at the country level, the Government is
        satisfied that the specific objectives of the project have been completed.
     (a) In rural areas of project intervention, the improved sanitation access rate reached 38.7
         percent in 2014, exceeding the target of 38.5 percent which translates into 341,941
         additional people having access to improved sanitation, of which 193,770 are under the
         project.
     (b) In urban areas, the improved sanitation access rate in Dakar reached 83 percent in 2014,
         thus achieving the target, which translates into 87,000 additional people having access to
         improved sanitation, of which 84,450 are under the project.

     3.2       Assessment of the Project Design
The project design is rated very satisfactory by the Government. The design was based on a review
of the experience of projects implemented after the 1996 sector reform (Water Sector Project and
LTWSP), the first PEPAM subprograms (financed by the AfDB), and the experience of the
nongovernmental organizations in rural water and sanitation. The project preparation was
participatory to assess needs, and the location of activities and investment options were optimized.

The design gave substantial importance to rural sanitation in view of the low access rate to
sanitation (26 percent) at the beginning of the PEPAM. In addition, the project design emphasized
the environmental aspects; a safeguards specialist was recruited to assist in the execution of the
Environmental and Social Management Framework and the Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF), which were validated by the DEEC.

During implementation, the initial design was adjusted to adapt to external and internal
circumstances that could jeopardize the achievement of the basic objective. Thus, the project was


                                                   31
restructured after the April 2013 MTR (a) to reallocate US$3.2 million for improving the level of
services in the project area and (b) to redeploy urban sanitation activities in Saint-Louis, Louga,
and Thiès after the cancellation of the works contemplated in Thiaroye.

The restructuring also included the introduction of the Bank ‘core indicators’ as outcome
indicators; those indicators monitor the additional number of people served under the project. The
EOP targets were not modified.

   3.3     Relevance of Project Objectives to the Global Development Objectives of the
           Sector
Following the international community, the Government of Senegal has incorporated the
achievement of the MDGs in its development strategy, by setting up the PEPAM, which is to
implement the 2005 Sector Development Policy Letter and an investment program amounting to
CFAF 677 billion over the 2010–2015 period.

   3.4     Assessment of Project Implementation
The project implementation is rated very satisfactory by the Senegalese Party, as it enabled the
following activities:
   (a) To ensure continuity with previous interventions
The continuation of the social connections policy initiated under the IDA-financed Water Sector
Project and LTWSP, which was adopted by the project to improve access to water and sanitation,
ensures the consistency of interventions in the sector.
   (b) To complete the interventions of technical and financial partners
Under the PEPAM, the Government seeks a balanced geographical location of the interventions
of the sectoral partners to ensure consistency of investments with the reduction of inequalities in
access to services, particularly for the rural population. Accordingly, and in view of the
interventions of other partners in rural areas, IDA’s intervention was directed over the North-East
in the regions of Saint-Louis, Matam, and (partly) Tambacounda (district of Bakel), bordering the
Senegal River.

In urban areas, the selected activities mainly reinforced IDA’s leadership in preparing the
institutional evolution of the water and sanitation sector while other donors—French Development
Agency (Agence Française de Développement, AFD); European Investment Bank (EIB); and West
African Development Bank (Banque Ouest Africaine de Développement, BOAD)—relayed IDA
in funding the expansion of major physical assets.
   (a) To strengthen the institutional framework
The project followed the Unified Intervention Framework recently developed for the sector in the
selection of IAs, the preparation of PLHA, and the dissemination of the principles of the reform
of the management of motorized boreholes (réforme de la gestion des forages motorisés,
REGEFOR) in rural areas, including the support to ASUFORs. The project relied on the PEPAM’s
implementation manuals and the sectoral M&E system to select the areas of intervention and
monitor performances.



                                                32
   (b) To empower the implementing bodies
The project was implemented by the following agencies:
   (a) Access to water. The water components were implemented, on behalf of the Ministry in
       charge of Water as follows: (i) for rural water supply, by the Directorate of Rural Water
       (DHR), the DEM, which was disbanded before the end of the project and replaced by
       OFOR, and the Directorate of Management and Planning of Water Resources (DGPRE);
       and (ii) for urban water supply, by the Directorate of Urban Water (DHU), which was
       further merged with the DHR into the DH, and SONES.
   (b) Access to sanitation.  The sanitation components were implemented, on behalf of the
       Ministry in charge of Sanitation as follows: (i) ONAS for urban sanitation—ONAS directly
       managed technical and financial aspects and a consulting firm was recruited to implement
       outreach and education activities and (ii) the DA, for rural sanitation—however,
       implementation was delegated to a CMA, namely AGETIP, with required competencies
       and experience in technical and social aspects.
   (c) Institutional support and strengthening of capacities. This component was
       implemented by the PCU of the PEPAM.

Moreover, the subnational units of the ministries (regional water divisions, the DEM’s wells and
boreholes teams, and regional sanitation divisions) were used in implementing rural water and
sanitation activities, as the interlocutors of the beneficiaries (rural communities, population, and
ASUFORs) and regional stakeholders. However, their involvement could be improved in the
future by setting up sufficient budgetary resources to cover the planned monitoring activities.

An effective partnership was established with the DEEC at the national and regional levels for
monitoring the social and environmental aspects, with the appointment of a national focal point
and the recourse to Regional Environmental Monitoring Committees, the capacities of which were
strengthened.

   3.5      Assessment of the Post-Completion Operation of Facilities
         3.5.1   Sanitation

The service connections function without problems. ONAS’ teams are adequately equipped to
maintain the sewerage networks. The Guediawaye sewage pumping station is operated with diesel
generators, pending the connection to the SENELEC grid.

         3.5.2   Water Supply

The rural water systems supplied by groundwater are currently managed by ASUFORs, with
selected technical operators. ASUFORs were trained in FM to ensure an acceptable quality in the
delivery of services. However, these arrangements are provisional; in accordance with the agreed
road map of the reform, they will be replaced within a few months by private operators selected in
the Northern Zone.

Provisional arrangements were also set up for the systems supplied by surface water and for the
Faboli water system, with teams comprising a technical operator and a manager, who were


                                                33
specifically trained. With IDA’s concurrence, the PCU purchased inputs and equipment covering
three months of operation of the systems. Inputs include fuel, chemicals for water treatment and
safety, and water quality control equipment. A bidding process is being prepared for the selection
of a private operator who will manage these systems and other systems in the area.

4.         ASSESSMENT OF IMPACT AND RESULTS IN VIEW OF THE INITIALLY
           AGREED TARGETS
     4.1     Major Results at Mid Term
Progress toward the achievement of the development objective was rated Satisfactory at the time
of the MTR. By March 31, 2013, 299,660 people had benefited from improved water and sanitation
services (51.5 percent of the EOP target). Beneficiaries included 206,160 urban people (108
percent of the target) with access to water through social connections and 35,000 people with
access to improved sanitation (44 percent of the target) in the peri-urban areas of Dakar.

The construction of rural water systems had begun to affect the access rate, with 27,380 people
gaining access to safe water (21 percent of the target).The reliability of rural systems had
substantially increased with only 2 percent of facilities out of service, compared to 15 percent in
2008. Rural sanitation works had begun and 31,120 people gained access to improved sanitation
(18 percent of target). All works contracts had been awarded.

Around 125 ASUFORs had been established (98 percent of target). The rural water sector reform
process was being implemented with (a) the finalization of the bidding documents for the transfer
of maintenance in Zone Centre and (b) the ongoing (WSP-financed) study of the full management
of rural facilities in view of the creation of OFOR, which was expected at the end of 2013.

With regard to the reform of the urban water sector, a five-year extension of the SdE affermage
contract was being negotiated and the current contract had been extended for one year, pending
the completion of the negotiations. In addition, the Government agreed to launch a feasibility study
of the delegation of the management of urban wastewater to a private operator, with the support
of the European Union. The Government also contemplated relaunching the studies of the next
round of reforms, in accordance with agreed guidelines, with a 2018 deadline.

     4.2     Major Results at Completion
The project satisfactorily achieved its development objective. At project completion, 654,520
people (112 percent of target) had gained access to improved water and sanitation services (details
by component are given in section 3.1). The percentage of motorized boreholes out of service is
stabilized at 3 percent.

The project helped establish 140 ASUFORs (110 percent of target) and accelerate the reform of
the rural water sector, particularly through the following activities:
     (a) Private sector participation: (i) the management of the Notto-Diosmone-Palmarin system
         was awarded to the joint venture GEAUR/AQUANET/AQUAVIRUNGA. The joint
         venture set up a Senegalese company named SEOH (Société d’Exploitation d’Ouvrages
         Hydrauliques), which started operating on July 2, 2015; (ii) the maintenance and the
         management of water production facilities in the Central Zone was awarded to two joint


                                                34
       ventures for the regions of Thiès, Diourbel, Kaffrine, and Kaolack; bidding for another
       group of facilities in the region of Fatick was unsuccessful and may be later directly
       contracted to one of the existing operators; (iii) consultants are being recruited to prepare
       the bidding of the Northern Zone; and (iv) expressions of interest are being sought for the
       bidding of the management of the systems supplied by surface water and of the Faboli
       system.
   (b) The creation of OFOR. The law creating OFOR was approved by the National Assembly
       on January 30, 2014 and published on February 28, 2014. The Presidential Decree
       organizing OFOR was signed on April 24, 2014. OFOR’s Board and general manager have
       been appointed and its staff is operational.

The five-year extension of the SdE’s affermage contract was signed on December 30, 2014. The
Government has defined the main orientations of the next round of reforms, in consultation with
the sector partners. The reform will be supported by a follow-up project (the UWSP).

The impact of the various components of the project is reviewed below.

   (a) Water resources
          Better knowledge of water resources, particularly for the Faboli aquifer, which was
           assessed as sustainable for water supplies
          Economic impact: generation of employment and income

   (b) Access to safe water in urban and rural areas
          Economic impact: Generation of employment and income.
          Health impact: Reduction of diarrheal and skin diseases, as the population supplied
           with safe water no longer use raw river water or shallow wells.
          Hygiene: Better knowledge/application of hygiene rules facilitated by the availability
           of safe water at home and in schools and public facilities.
          Education: Girls are no longer obliged to fetch water and gain time for education; this
           is also true for boys in the pastoral zone, who had to devote time for fetching water for
           cattle.
          Governance: Improvement of local governance of water services with the creation of
           ASUFORs.
          Gender: Alleviation of the workload of women and girls and involvement of women in
           management committees.
          Human rights: The project helped the population’s right to safe water materialize, with
           a very strong demand for household connections.

   (c) Urban and rural sanitation
          Social impact: Better internalization and observance of hygiene practices through
           educational activities
          Economic impact: Generation of employment and income and savings in the household
           expenditures associated with the periodic emptying of urban on-site sanitation facilities
          Environment: Better living conditions
          Education: Better school attendance


                                                35
              Health: Reduction in morbidity with the decrease of open defecation practices

5.         BORROWER’S ASSESSMENT OF ITS OWN PERFORMANCE
The project has been implemented with an optimal empowerment of the Senegalese Party, which
set up performing arrangements for the IAs, with the PCU of the PEPAM as facilitator, as this was
the case under the previous IDA- financed projects.

     5.1       Review of Project Implementation
Activities implemented by the DH. All works related to the 30 new water systems and the system
extensions have been completed and commissioned. The works related to the 13 systems supplied
by surface water and the Faboli system were completed with some qualifications which are being
addressed. A provisional management system has been established, pending further transfers to
private operators.

Activities implemented by the DEM/OFOR. The five contracts related to the electrification of
pumps, the installation of meters and pumping equipment have been completed and fully settled.
Around 140 ASUFORs have been established and benefited from training. Works related to the
construction of household connections have been completed; the strong demand for connections
led the PCU, in coordination with OFOR, to meet the needs of the Bakel and Faboli population
with materials purchased under contracts procured under another (AfDB financed) project.

Water resource management activities. All activities have been completed, including (a) the
monitoring campaigns, (b) the supply and installation of piezometer equipment, and (c) the
construction of five piezometers and five testing boreholes. Hydrogeological studies of the sand
aquifer between Bakel and Kidira and the Falémé aquifer have been completed and will facilitate
the preparation of water supply projects in these areas.

Urban water component implemented by SONES. This component was completed in 2012 and
considerably exceeded the initial target.

Rural sanitation component. The DA and AGETIP implemented 19,800 latrines (104 percent of
target) at a pace reaching 1,000 latrines per month in the period preceding the closing; cost savings
enabled construction of 1,800 additional latrines. The deposits made by beneficiaries are
reimbursed once the superstructures are built by households.

The school sanitation activities helped equip 72 schools with latrine blocks, in close cooperation
with sanitary districts, school management, and local authorities. Around 43 schools have been
connected to water services with the assistance of the DEM and SdE.

Urban sanitation component. All activities implemented by ONAS have also been completed
despite difficulties that emerged at project inception and continued until the MTR. These activities
include (a) the study of the Sanitation Master Plan of Joal-Fadiouth; (b) sanitation works in
Guédiawaye and Parcelles Assainies; and (c) sewerage connections in Saint-Louis, Louga, and
Thiès following the cancellation of the sanitation subcomponent in Thiaroye.




                                                  36
Institution building and strengthening of capacities. The project was also instrumental in the
detailed formulation and implementation of the reform process of the rural water subsector, which
was initiated in 1996 with the REGEFOR project and confirmed under the PEPAM orientations,
the 2005 Sector Policy Letter, and the 2008 Water and Sanitation Services Law. The reform
primarily aimed to improve the quality of rural water services by (a) transferring the maintenance
of production facilities to the private sector; (b) professionalizing the management of services
delivered by major rural systems; (c) defining and implementing regulation arrangements to set up
a monitoring and governance framework of the relationship with stakeholders; and (d) establishing
a public agency in charge of managing rural water assets, organizing and contracting the
maintenance, and planning and implementing the renewal of state-owned infrastructure (boreholes,
water storage tanks, and networks).

The project helped in recruiting consultants (a) for the technical audits of the performance contracts
between the Government and SONES and between the Government and ONAS, the findings of
which will be used in the next round of reforms and (b) for preparing a catalog of technical options
and standards for rural water treatment plants, which will be used in the design of future facilities
to be constructed on the Senegal and Falémé Rivers.

The project also helped ONAS finance a community-based organization for carrying out
sensitization and outreach activities in Guédiawaye and Parcelles Assainies to accelerate demand
generation and facilitate the siting of sewerage service connections.

Finally, the project helped procure vehicles and IT equipment. Additional needs were expressed
by the DA, DH, DEM, and the Directorate of Management and Planning of Water Resources
(DGPRE). The training program agreed with the IAs was fully executed for an amount of CFAF
116,745,000.

   5.2     Review of Financial Management
The FM of the project was rated Satisfactory by all semiannual reviews carried out by supervision
missions. These reviews aimed to assess FM and the accounting system and the reliability of
internal controls. The main findings of the reviews were as follows: (a) the FM team was effective
and provided with adequate management tools and procedures (the planning, budget, and
execution arrangements were adequate); (b) accounts were on time (arrangements for data
collection, processing, and preparation of financial information were simple and effective); (c) the
quarterly interim financial reports were satisfactory and produced on time; (d) the disbursement
rate at project closing (99.3 percent) is satisfactory; and (e) audit reports were produced on time
and auditors’ recommendations have been implemented.

The project accounts were audited by KPMG from the start to calendar year 2012. The 2013 and
2014 accounts have been audited by Cabinet Mayoro WADE, which will also audit the 2015
accounts. The auditors provided clean opinions on the accounts. The Annual Budgets and Work
Plans were produced on time and approved by the Bank. The disbursement forecasts proved to be
realistic.

   5.3      Final Review of the ESMP Results
In accordance with the Bank’s Guidelines and article L 48 of the Senegal Environmental Code, an
Environmental and Social Management Framework and an RPF have been prepared. The project
triggered the following Bank’s operational policies:
        OP 4.01 - Environmental Assessments
        OP 4.12 - Involuntary Resettlement
        OP 7.50 - Projects on International Waterways
The safeguard documents were validated by the Bank, certified by the Ministry in charge of
Environment, and published at the Bank’s InfoShop. The PCU and the IAs were to carry out the
ESMP, including the screening of activities, the mitigation plan, and capacity building. They set
up technical resources (one environmental specialist in the PCU and integration of environmental
and social monitoring in supervision and social outreach activities).

This section summarizes the final assessment of the ESMP. The assessment was carried out in
June 2015 by an independent consultant appointed by the Ministry of Environment and aimed to
(a) review compliance of the project execution with the ESMP and (b) assess the actual
environmental and social impact of the project, in consultation with stakeholders and beneficiaries.
The assessment included (a) a review of all project documentation related to the execution of the
ESMP (baseline, screening, monitoring, and follow-up by environmental consultants and local
committees) and (b) field visits (12 sites of water facilities and 8 sites of sanitation facilities) and
interviews of stakeholders and beneficiaries.

Compliance with the ESMP. The main findings are as follows:

        The project complied with the screening requirements.
        The project satisfactorily complied with the RPF guidelines (documentation provided by
         the consultants in charge of social outreach and monitoring, but the institutional changes
         in the locally elected bodies somewhat hampered the finalization of administrative
         documents).
        Contractors generally complied with the hygiene, safety and environmental clauses with
         some deviations on the use of safety equipment (52 percent of the sites were certified in
         compliance in that respect).
        Corrective measures were taken during implementation, with regard to (a) the
         reinforcement of works supervision and sensitization activities; (b) the involvement of
         regional divisions; and (c) the improvement of the quality of on-site sanitation facilities.
        All activities related to the technical assistance to local environmental monitoring
         committees have been implemented, as well as the provision of water quality control
         equipment to the DEEC and the National Hygiene Service.

   5.4          Preliminary Findings

         Almost all project subcomponents were completed ahead of schedule. Some exhibited
          significant delays.
         There were no cost overruns. This was made possible by a close monitoring of contract
          execution, which enabled to proceed with the necessary adjustments on time.
         The Procurement Plans were regularly updated and submitted to IDA.
         The financial contributions of beneficiaries were mobilized as needed.
         Contract amendments and budget allocations took into account the financial envelope and
          were dictated by the dedication to achieving objectives. Overall, the financial execution of
          the project was clearly efficient.

   5.5          Lessons to be Drawn from the Project

         Contract packaging should be optimized to minimize costs and reinforce the consistency
          of works while facilitating works supervision.
         Technical design and outreach activities should be programmed to avoid contracting works
          before completing the selection of consultants in charge of supervision and of community
          mobilization.
         For rural water works, and particularly in the case of systems including water treatment
          plants, it is preferable to package contracts on a geographical basis rather than on a


                                                      39
         technical basis. It would have been more efficient to have a single contractor working on
         all activities in a given area rather than to have to coordinate several specialized contractors.
         Under the project, some water treatment plants were completed while civil works for
         storage tanks and pipe laying were lagging, which prevented commissioning.

6.       ASSESSMENT OF BANK PERFORMANCE DURING PROJECT PREPARATION
         AND IMPLEMENTATION, INCLUDING THE QUALITY OF RELATIONSHIP,
         AND LESSONS

        The Credit proceeds were partly on-lent to SONES (US$5 million) as equity to alleviate
         the impact of the financing conditions on urban water tariffs.
        The regular timing of Bank supervision missions facilitated the dialogue and helped as a
         reminder of the parties’ obligations.
        An efficient allocation of responsibilities between the TTL and team members helped
         obtain ‘no objections’ on time and facilitated the monitoring of activities.
        There was a permanent dialogue with the Government on the major issues related to the
         participation of the private sector to the management of rural facilities, the establishment
         of OFOR, and important Bank contributions in monitoring the financial equilibrium of the
         urban water and sanitation sector.
        The Bank showed flexibility in agreeing to allocate cost savings to finance (a) network
         extensions to enable a further increase of the access rates in the project areas; (b) the audit
         of the safety of the Dakar water supply system, following the September 2013 break of the
         transmission line near Keur Momar Sarr, which led to obtaining funds from AFD in
         support of SONES investments; and (c) technical preparatory studies of the follow-up IDA-
         financed intervention (UWSP).
        The semiannual supervision missions and the various consultations with the Bank have
         been quite useful. They helped improve donors’ coordination with the Government.
         Missions were carried out in a consensual manner, and the Ministry of Finance cosigned
         all mission aide mémoires, and there were no difference of views between the Government
         and the Bank on the progress of the project and the results of reforms.
