Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The objective of the proposed project is to increase access to sustainable water and sanitation services in selected rural and urban areas. This will
 contribute to the achievement of the water and sanitation MDGs. The proposed project will achieve its objective by (i) facilitating access to services
 through programs for improving and extending water production and distribution systems and urban sanitation networks, constructing social water
 and sanitation household connections, public standpipes and on-site sanitation facilities, and (ii) consolidating the achievements of the urban water
 reform, supporting the rural water subsector reform and strengthening capacities to deliver and manage water and sanitation services.


 Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project has achieved its objective as proved by the development impact noted on the ground. In urban areas, 206,160 people, representing 108%
 of the end-of-project-target (EOPT), have gained access to piped water and 82,260 people (104% of EOPT) have had access to improved sanitation
 services. In rural areas, 172,370 people (133% of EOPT) have gained access to safe drinking water, while 193,730 additional people (111% of the
 EOPT) have gained access to improved sanitation services. Notable results have also been registered on the rural water sector reform supported by the
 project: (i) 140 water users associations (representing 110% of EOPT) have been established in the project intervention area, (ii) the rural water Asset
 Holding Company (OFOR) has been established and is fully operational, and (iii) the process to select private operators for the management of rural
 water systems in the central region is well on-track and will be completed by July 2015. The high operational performance of the urban water sector is
 maintained as well as the financial equilibrium of the sector that will be strengthened by a recent tariff adjustment.
