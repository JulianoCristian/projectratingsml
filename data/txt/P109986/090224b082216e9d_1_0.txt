                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the proposed project is to increase access to sustainable water and sanitation services in selected rural and urban areas. This will contribute to the
                         achievement of the water and sanitation MDGs. The proposed project will achieve its objective by (i) facilitating access to services through programs for improving and
                         extending water production and distribution systems and urban sanitation networks, constructing social water and sanitation household connections, public standpipes
                         and on-site sanitation facilities, and (ii) consolidating the achievements of the urban water reform, supporting the rural water subsector reform and strengthening
                         capacities to deliver and manage water and sanitation services.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project implementation progress is satisfactorily and significant development impacts are noted on the ground. In urban areas, 206,160 people, representing 108% of the end-of-
                         project-target (EOPT) have gained access to piped water and 50,000 people (63% of EOPT) have gained access to improved sanitation services. Rural water supply works are being
                         actively implemented, with 69,735 additional people (representing 54% of EOPT) having gained access to safe drinking water. Since the previous ISR, performance has significantly

                         improved in rural sanitation with the construction of 32 blocks of school latrines and 10,290 on-site sanitation facilities, benefiting to 102,900 people (59% of the EOPT, compared to
                         18% in April 2013). According to the updated implementation plan, all the civil works contracts initially planned should be completed by June 2014, one year before the project closing
                         date.

                         Notable progress has also been registered on the sector reform supported by the project: (i) 134 rural water users associations (representing 105% of EOPT) have been established
                         under the project, (ii) the bidding process for the management delegation of the rural water systems which took a while to be prepared, has been finally launched on November 28,
                         2013, (iii) the urban water affermage contract was extended for five years, after six months negotiations with the private operator, and (iv) the arrears in the payment of the
                         Government 2011 water and sanitation bills have been cleared through a cross compensation process signed in May 2013.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Key recommendations of the December 10, 2013 supervision mission are the following: the Borrower: (i) to follow-up closely the implementation of on-going contracts so that all civil
                         works can be completed by June 2014 as planned, (ii) to avoid any delay in the selection of private operators for the management of rural water systems so as to complete the
                         process by December 2014 the latest, (iii) to launch the studies and technical support activities remaining under the institutional development and capacity building component,
                         particularly studies related to the preparation of the second generation reform.
