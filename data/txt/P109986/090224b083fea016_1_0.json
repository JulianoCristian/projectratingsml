outcomes\n            were highly satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            low, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the highly satisfactory outcome of the project was primarily\n            driven by the dedication of the implementing agencies (IA)\n            and was largely facilitated by the quality of project\n            design, the effective implementation arrangements, the\n            quality of the policy dialogue with the government, and the\n            close collaboration between the IAs and the Bank team. The\n            project confirmed the relevance and efficacy of social\n            connections programs as the best way of achieving the water\n            and sanitation millennium development goals (MDGs). The\n            project demonstrated that project complexity, as regards the\n            diversity of activities and the number of IAs involved, is\n            not a systemic impediment to success. As outlined in the\n            Borrower\u2019s contribution, it is preferable to package rural\n            waterworks contracts on a geographical basis rather than on\n            a technical basis, particularly in the case of systems\n            including water treatment plants."}, "docdt": "2015-12-17T01:03:03Z"}
