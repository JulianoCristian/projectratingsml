                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the proposed project is to increase access to sustainable water and sanitation services in selected rural and urban areas. This will contribute to the
                         achievement of the water and sanitation MDGs. The proposed project will achieve its objective by (i) facilitating access to services through programs for improving and
                         extending water production and distribution systems and urban sanitation networks, constructing social water and sanitation household connections, public standpipes
                         and on-site sanitation facilities, and (ii) consolidating the achievements of the urban water reform, supporting the rural water subsector reform and strengthening
                         capacities to deliver and manage water and sanitation services.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project implementation progress is satisfactorily and significant development impact is noted on the ground. In urban areas, 206,160 people, representing 108% of the end-of-
                         project-target (EOPT) have gained access to piped water (result already achieved in March 2013) and 65,980 people (84% of EOPT) have gained access to improved sanitation
                         services. In the project intervention rural areas, 87,971 additional people (representing 68% of EOPT) have gained access to safe drinking water, and 16,657 household sanitation

                         facilities benefiting to 166,570 people (95% of the EOPT) have been constructed).

                         Notable progress has been noted on the sector reforms supported by the project. As of June 30, 2014, 138 water users associations (representing 109% of EOPT) have been
                         established in the project intervention area, the rural water Asset Holding Company (OFOR) has been established, and the process of selection of private operators for the
                         management of rural water systems is well on track. Arrears in the payment of the Government's water bills have been cleared, but the financial equilibrium of the urban water sector
                         is threatened by the non-regular payment of public agencies water bills which represents 30% of the sector revenues.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Main recommendation of the July 2014 supervision mission: to adjust the urban water tariff so as to maintain the financial equilibrium of the sector, and revise the tariff structure to
                         restore the right balance between the rates of private consumers and public agencies.
