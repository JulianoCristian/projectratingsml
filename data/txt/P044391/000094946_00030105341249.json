The\n            key lessons learned include: a) The project demonstrated\n            that a strong Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within the\n            beneficiary can bring about successful and timely project\n            implementation. Factors contributing to the effectiveness of\n            the PIU were : appointment of highly qualified staff to\n            manage the PIU; adequate quality, quantity, and continuity\n            of staff; and sufficient autonomy. b) Adequate attention\n            needs to be provided to financial and institutional\n            objectives under emergency projects to ensure these are\n            achieved. This requires the involvement of Government in\n            identifying how it can best help achieve these objectives\n            and its support for the overall financial and institutional\n            development of the implementing agency."}, "docdt": "2000-01-28T00:00:00Z"}
