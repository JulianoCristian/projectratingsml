In\n            addition, the project will help improve the quality of power\n            supply and accelerate the country's regional\n            electrification. It will also contribute to the institution\n            building efforts to strengthen JEA, and help improve energy\n            sector planning and coordination. The project, which is a\n            part of JEA's power system development program for\n            1982-1986, has the following components: (i) a\n            seawater-cooled steam power station at Aqaba comprising two\n            130 MW oil-fueled generating units and accessories; (ii) a\n            320-km long transmission line from Aqaba to Amman; and (iii)\n            consultant services for engineering, erection, supervision,\n            and initial operation. The principal benefits of the project\n            will accrue to the industry and to the hitherto unserved population."}, "docdt": "1982-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
