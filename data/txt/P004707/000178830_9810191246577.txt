APPRAISAL OF THE IRRIGATION PROJECT XI
1. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.01      The Royal Thai Government has requested the Bank to assist in
financing Irrigation Project XI. The proposed project would improve and
extend existing irrigation facilities covering 66,000 ha in the Meklong
Basin and provide new facilities to serve 15,000 ha in the Pattani Basin.
Both project areas will be served by Bank-financed multipurpose dams, Ban
Chao Nen (Ln. 977-TH) and Pattani (Ln. 1485-TH). The proposed project would
allow effective utilization of water from these dams for year-round
irrigation by improving and completing main canals, laterals, drains and
on-farm development. Some 30,400 farm families would benefit from the
improved water control and year-round cropping potential afforded by the
project.
1.02      The project was prepared by the Royal Irrigation Department (RID)
with the assistance of ILACO (Netherlands) and Sverdrup and Parcel Interna-
tional, Inc. (US). Feasibility studies carried out in the past for each of
the project areas have been recently updated to reflect present conditions.
1.03      This report is based on the findings of a preappraisal mission in
January/February 1979 comprising Mr. J.G. Stemp, Ms. N.K. Hill (Bank),
Messrs. R. Campbell, C.G. Gonzales, J.W. Robins and P. Judd (Consultants) and
an appraisal mission in April/May 1979 comprising Messrs. Stemp, Campbell and
Robins.
The Agricultural Sector
1.04      Thailand's agricultural sector, contributing 30% of GDP, has been
one of the most dynamic in Asia. Agricultural GDP grew at an annual rate of
5% between 1960 and 1977, and the sector continues to provide the largest
part of the country's export earnings: 90% in the early 1960s, dropping to
around 70% at present. It employs 75% of the country's labor force with
employment growing annually at 1.5%.
1.05      Increases in the value of production have largely resulted from
diversification into upland crops, including maize, sugarcane, cassava,
tobacco and rubber, whose rapid production increase has offset the decline
in cotton, coconut and other minor crops. Crop diversification has been
mainly the result of additional land being brought under cultivation rather
than crop substitution.  While the area plantea to paddy increased by about
2% p.a. from 1959-61 to 1973-75, the acreage under upland crops increased by
more than 7% p.a. Paddy land as a proportion of total area under major
crops, therefore, declined during this period from 71% to 64%. Land planted
to rice accounted for 85% of total area in the North, 60% in the Central
Region, and 76% in the Northeast.



1.06      Growth in agriculture has been the result of an active and flexible
farming community which has responded to favorable world market opportunities
and an effective and highly competitive marketing sector. For instance, in
the 1950s, it was the outward-looking private sector that recognized new
export possibilities for maize and kenaf and actively encouraged their pro-
duction. From 1972/73 to 1975/76 when the price advantage of kenaf over cas-
sava diminished, and kenaf acreage declined by 72%, rice and kenaf merchants
in the Northeast quickly diversified into cassava drying and chipping, thus
extending the crop from its traditional area in the Eastern Region. The
private sector also participated in the world sugar boom (1973-75) by greatly
expanding processing capacity into new production areas of western Thailand.
1.07      The public sector's contribution to agricultural development has
been mainly in the provision of physical infrastructure, especially roads and
irrigation facilities, and crop research, with particular emphasis on rice
breeding. Nearly 60% of the public investment in agriculture, which has fluc-
tuated between 7% and 10% of total Government expenditures, has been in irri-
gation development. Expansion of irrigation facilities has been a major
factor in maintaining Thailand's comparative advantage in rice production,
particularly through the construction of storage dams and major irrigation
projects in the Chao Phya Basin. Road construction has provided access to new
lands and has been the main stimulus for diversification into upland crops.
1.08      The potential for expanding the cultivable area, a major factor in
the past growth of agriculture, has now been almost fully exploited and
further growth must depend on more intensive use of existing farmland and
higher yields. The area in agricultural use at present is about 20 million
ha of which about 14 million ha is cropped annually (a cropping intensity of
about 70%). Land use is already fairly intensive in areas devoted to corn
and sugar cane, mostly in the Central Region where soils are generally of
above-average fertility, but there is scope for higher yields. In the
South, most of the good land for rubber is in use, but productivity could be
increased by replanting with higher yielding varieties.
Irrigated Agriculture
1.09      Most of the irrigable areas in Thailand are in the flood plains of
the major rivers where a combination of heavy rainfall and flooding precludes
the cultivation of crops other than paddy in the wet season. In the Chao Phya
Plain, heavy soils predominate and paddy is the preferred crop in the dry
season as well. The situation is similar in the coastal plains in the south.
Dry season cropping is more diversified on the alluvial soils of the Northern
Region, and in the small areas so far developed for irrigation in the North-
east. In the wet season, the harvested area of rice averages about 7.7 mil-
lion ha of which the irrigated areas account for some 1.8 million ha. Close
to 0.5 million ha of rice is irrigated in the dry season. Since virtually
all land suitable for rice is now cultivated in the wet season, any major
gains in rice production will have to come from higher yields in both rainfed
and irrigated areas, and increases in the area cropped in the dry season.

1.10      Throughout Thailand there are wide seasonal variations in river
flows. In October, with the end of the Southwest monsoon, the river flows
fall sharply and continue to decline until the beginning of the wet season
in May. Year-round irrigation for intensive double cropping is, therefore,
dependent on storage dams to conserve wet season runoff. Without storage,
irrigation for a single wet-season crop is a viable proposition only on the
large rivers with a reasonably dependable wet-season flow.
1.11      Until the 1960s, irrigation development in Thailand was concentrated
in the area of greatest potential and highest level of economic development,
the Chao Phya Basin, which covers large areas in the North and Central
Regions. Major developments outside of the Basin in the last 15 years
include the initial stages of a project to develop the Meklong Basin, second
in size to the Chao Phya Basin; the construction of six large dams on the
principal rivers of the Northeast region; numerous medium-scale schemes in
the South and a start on development of the Pattani Basin. A brief histori-
cal review of water resource development in Thailand's major regions and
river basins, and the contribution of Bank projects is presented below,
followed by a look ahead at future possibilities for Bank lending for irri-
gation.
1.12      The Chao Phya Basin covers an area of some 180,000 sq km.  Four
northern tributaries, the Ping, Wang, Yom and Nan run together about 200 km
north of Bangkok to form the Chao Phya. After following a single course for
60 km, the river splits into three branches which flow across the Chao Phya
Plain to the Gulf of Thailand. There is a long tradition of irrigation on
the small streams feeding the Chao Phya's northern tributaries where several
thousand private schemes (People's Irrigation Projects) serve some 200,000
ha. The first large-scale water control projects were begun in the southern
part of the Chao Phya Plain in the 1890s as private enterprises. In 1904,
the RID was formed as the agency responsible for water resource development
throughout Thailand. Although no longer responsible for hydroelectric
development, which is now handled by the Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand (EGAT), RID is responsible for all irrigation in Thailand except
for the People's Irrigation Projects in the North managed by farmers'
groups. RID's first major undertaking was the completion of a network of
navigation/drainage canals over 500,000 ha in the southern Chao Phya Plain,
an area subject to deep and prolonged flooding. The canals were designed to
spread the seasonal floods more evenly over the Plain and to provide access
to large tracts of uncultivated land. RID later turned its attention to the
construction of a gravity irrigation system of 600,000 ha in the northern
Chao Phya Plain where drought is more of a constraint to rice production
than floods. A key element in this system, the Chainat Diversion Dam,
together with a number of major canals, was financed by the Bank in 1950
(Ln. 36-TH). This was the Bank's first loan to Thailand for irrigation
development.
1.13      Since 1950, the Bank has been closely involved in development of the
Chao Phya Basin's land and water resources. Of particular importance were the
Bank-financed multipurpose dams on the northern tributaries; Bhumipol Dam on



- 4 -
the Ping completed in 1964 (Ln. 175-TH) and Sirikit Dam on the Nan completed
in 1973 (Ln. 514-TH). These projects, which exploited the only two major
reservoir sites in the Basin, have firmed up the wet-season flows and greatly
increased water availability for dry-season irrigation. The projects are
also major sources of hydroelectric power and energy. In the 1960s, it
became apparent that higher standards of water control within the irrigated
areas were needed to fully exploit the Basin's irrigation potential. The
extensive mode of development followed by RID had been successful in pro-
viding vast areas with reasonable security against flood and drought risks
for a low-yielding wet-season paddy crop. The Bank-financed "Ditches and
Dikes Project" in 1963 (Ln. 328-TH), therefore, aimed to serve some 1.5
million ha with a simple system of tertiary canals. This was a considerable
advance over the semi-controlled field-to-field flooding from the main and
secondary canals. As new high-yielding rice varieties were introduced and
rice prices began to rise, further improvements in water control became
economically feasible. The Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement project,
financed by the Bank in 1973 (Cr. 379-TH), pioneered on a large-scale
(15,000 ha) an intensive mode of on-farm development comprising tertiary
canals, drains, farm roads and land leveling. A follow-up project for
60,000 ha was financed in 1976 (Ln. 1468-TH). Another major Bank project in
the Basin, the Phitsanulok Project (Ln. 1149T-TH), consists of a new system
for 95,000 ha downstream of the Sirikit Dam; this is the first Bank-financed
project in the Northern Region.
1.14      Nearly 1.3 million ha in the Chao Phya Basin benefit from water
control works in the wet season. About 450,000 ha are now irrigated in the
dry season, compared to less than 100,000 ha before the Sirikit Dam was com-
pleted. There is no further scope for increasing dry-season flows to the
Chao Phya Plain since there are no additional large reservoir sites on the
tributaries. However, improved efficiency of water use in both seasons
would allow some increase in dry-season irrigation. There is also
considerable potential for raising wet-season paddy yields through higher
standards of on-farm development.
1.15      The Meklong Basin, situated immediately to the west of the Chao
Phya Basin, covers an area of 27,700 sq km. The Meklong's two main
tributaries, the Kwae Yai and Kwae Noi join together to form the main river,
some 90 km from the sea. Construction of the first stage of a project which
would eventually serve nearly 120,000 ha of the 400,000 ha Basin's irrigable
land began in 1964 with Bank assistance (Ln. 394-TH). The extensive mode of
irrigation development current in the 1960s was adopted for the first stage
and in subsequent areas developed by RID. There were delays in selecting a
site and in the decision to proceed with a dam on the Kwae Yai. However,
construction of the Bank-financed Ban Chao Nen multipurpose dam (Ln. 977-TH)
began in 1974 and dry-season water became available in 1978. Construction
of a dam on the Kwae Yai, probably with Bank financing, is scheduled to
begin in 1981. The stage is now set for a considerable expansion of year-
round irrigation in the Meklong Basin which has by far the greatest potential
for increased production of any of Thailand's river basins.  To exploit this
potential, major emphasis will be placed on on-farm development in conjunc-
tion with upgrading and extending the main irrigation and drainage systems.



1.16      The Northeast is poorly endowed with water resources; full control
of the region's rivers would irrigate less than 10% of the 3.5 million ha of
paddy land. The region is bordered by one of Asia's largest rivers, the
Mekong, which forms the international boundary between Thailand and Laos.
Several hundred thousand hectares could be irrigated from the Mekong if the
Pa Mong Dam were built, but this would involve resettling over 300,000 people
living in the reservoir area. In the 1960s, RID with bilateral assistance
embarked on a major program of dam construction in the region. Six large
dams and nearly 200 small dams were built, but there was a considerable
time-lag between construction of the dams and subsequent construction of the
irrigation system. In general, the systems were poorly designed and on-farm
development was lacking. RID is now engaged in a program to improve irriga-
tion systems downstream of the large dams with loans from various sources,
including the Bank (Cr. 461-TH and Ln. 1630-TH). Completion of these works
will bring year-round irrigation to 160,000 ha, more than half of the
region's irrigation potential.
1.17      In the South, existing developments are concentrated on the east
coast which has close to 90% of the region's 600,000 ha of rice land. About
75,000 ha are served by numerous projects consisting of diversion dams and
canals. Some of these are still to be developed and the service area is
expected to increase to about 95,000 ha. The main purpose of these diversion
projects is to provide supplementary irrigation for the wet-season rice crop.
Dry-season cropping is limited by the low flow of the rivers to about
10,000 ha, of which about one-half is paddy. About 45,000 ha in the low-lying
coastal areas benefit from "conservation projects" which consist of drainage
systems and control works to prevent salt water intrusion. Three large
projects have been studied: two involve multipurpose developments of the
Pattani and Ta Pi-Phun Duang River Basins, and a third would use the
Songkhla Lake as a source of irrigation water. The total irrigation
potential of the three projects is close to 160,000 ha. The most advanced
is the Pattani project, which includes a dam and power plant on the Pattani
River financed by a Bank loan in 1977 (Ln. 1485-TH).
1.18      A notable feature of Bank-financed irrigation projects in recent
years has been the introduction of improvements in agricultural extension,
such as the training-and-visit system, introduced in 1973 in the Chao Phya
Irrigation Project. In 1976, the Government requested Bank financing for a
National Agricultural Extension project which would cover 33 provinces. A
loan for a second National Agricultural Extension project which will cover
the remaining 39 provinces was recently approved.
1.19      In 1976, Bank staff undertook a review of the irrigation subsector
at the request of the Government. As a starting point, estimates were made
of the required increase in paddy production needed for Thailand to meet
growing domestic demand and to maintain its share of the world market. It
was estimated that production would have to increase from 15.1 million tons
of paddy in 1976 to 22.7 million tons in 1990. Assuming a yield increase of



- 6 -
20% in rainfed paddy areas, irrigated paddy production would have to more
than double from 5.5 million tons to 12 million tons. The review outlined
a program to be carried out in the period 1977-90 to meet this demand.  It
comprises improvement of existing systems (710,000 ha), extension of existing
systems (290,000 ha) and new projects (315,000 ha). Although this is an
ambitious program, it should be noted that a start has been made on some major
elements of the program such as the improvement of existing systems in the
Northern Chao Phya and Northeast Thailand, and a major new project,
Phitsanulok. Although the proposed program is reasonably well distributed
between the four major regions, it should be noted that irrigation by itself
has only limited scope for redressing regional income inequalities due to
the need to select projects in areas with suitable soils, topography, water
supply and production potential.
1.20      As a follow-up to this review, Bank staff has assisted RID and other
government agencies in identifying in further detail individual projects, to
be initiated in the period 1980-84 and which would be suitable for external
financing. The proposed project is a direct outcome of this review, and
further stages in the expansion of the Pattani and Meklong systems for some
100,000 ha are part of RID's 1980-84 program. In the Northeast, the program
includes the Nam Mun project, consisting of two storage dams and new
irrigation systems for 22,000 ha. Projects in the North would include a dam
on the Yom River to irrigate nearly 70,000 ha and the Mae Kok project for
some 20,000 ha. A nationwide medium-scale irrigation project is included (a
first phase is now being prepared) to cover new projects and rehabilitation
of existing schemes. A start would also be made on a number of schemes in
the Bang Pakong Basin to the east of the Chao Phya Basin. Some of these
projects are being prepared, and others will be prepared, with financing from
current Bank loans for irrigation.
1.21      A program of the scale referred to in para. 1.19 presents a major
challenge to RID's project implementation capacities. RID is organized in
22 functional divisions and 12 regional offices. In the past, fragmenta-
tion of project activities among various divisions and offices has caused
serious coordination problems in project implementation, since no single
individual or division has been responsible for seeing that a project
achieves its primary objective of timely and reliable delivery of water to
the farmers' fields. Progress has been made in overcoming this problem in
Bank-financed projects by appointment of Project Managers with responsibili-
ties for coordinating the inputs of the service divisions. In fact, there
has been a steady improvement in RID's performance on Bank-financed projects
in recent years. An important step towards assisting RID to strengthen its
capacities to implement and manage its expanding workload, an Administration
and Organization Study has been carried out by consultants financed under the
Phitsanulok Project and is currently under review by RID.
1.22      In summary, since 1950, Bank assistance to Thailand's water resource
development has included financing for four multipurpose dams and nine irri-
gation projects for a total of US$446 million. Three of the loans for



- 7 -
multipurpose projects were to the EGAT, thus ten loans have been made to the
irrigation subsector. Of these, six were for projects in the Chao Phya
Basin, one for the Meklong Basin, two in the Northeast, and one for the
Petchaburi project close to the Meklong Basin. The five projects undertaken
since 1973 have incorporated the higher standards of water control mentioned
above (para. 1.13). Project Completion Reports were prepared for the Siri-
kit Dam (Loan 514-TH) and the Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement (Credit 379-
TH) Projects. The former can be considered a highly successful project in
that it made a major contribution to the rapid expansion of dry season
cropping in the Chao Phya Basin and was a timely addition to the country's
power sector. The Chao Phya Project was also successfully completed and has
provided valuable exprience to the Government in implementing an intensive
,0de of on-farm development.  Implementation of current Bank projects is
satisfactory, and good progress is being made in overcoming the procurement
delays which affected some earlier projects.
Project Formulation
1.23      Meklong.  In 1964, the Bank made a loan of US$23 million for a
first stage project in the Meklong Plain (Ln. 394-TH). The purpose of the
project was to provide regulated wet-season irrigation, surface drainage, and
partial flood control to 175,000 ha on the left bank (known as the Stage I
area). The project also included land classification of the entire Meklong
Plain (390,000 ha) and a feasibility study for a Stage II project. The
feasibility study under Ln. 394-TH was completed by RID in 1968 with the
assistance of advisers from the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR).
In their report, RID proposed construction of a multipurpose dam on the Kwae
Yai and an irrigation, drainage and road system to serve the Stage II area.
1.24      Concurrently, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
(EGAT) prepared a proposal for a dam at a different site on the Kwae Yai
which was claimed to supply sufficient water for the irrigation development
proposed by RID. The Government supported EGAT's proposal and in 1974, the
Bank made a loan of US$75 million for the Ban Chao Nen Hydroelectric Project
(LMu. 977-Til). This project, scheduled for completion in 1981, will provide
a regulated flow sufficient for double cropping on over 250,000 ha. Also in
1974, the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC) commissioned ILACO
to further analyze the land use, crop production and performance of existing
irrigation works and to review the plans for future development of irrigated
agriculture in the Meklong area. This study, financed from funds provided
for consultant services under Ln. 379-TH, was submitted to the Government at
the end of 1974. Meanwhile, RID in 1970 began design and construction of
the main canals and laterals to serve the Stage II right bank area.
1.25      In anticipation of the availability of dry-season water from the
Ban Chao Nen Dam and eventually from the Khao Laem Dam where construction is
to begin in 1981, the Government took further steps to accelerate develop-
ment of the Basin. They arranged in 1977 for the Japanese International
Cooperative Assistance program (JICA) to provide consultants, Sanyu, Inc. to



- 8 -
carry out a feasibility study for on-farm development of 50,000 ha in the
Stage I area and also to prepare a Master Development Plan for the Meklong
Basin. They also requested that the Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement
Project II (Ln. 1468-TH) include funds for consultants to prepare a major
project for high priority development in the Meklong irrigation area. RID
retained ILACO, the consultants assisting in implementation of both Chao
Phya Improvement Projects, to prepare this project. The Government, in
consultation with the Bank and ILACO, determined that the project begun by
RID in 1970, involving the completion of irrigation and drainage systems for
the Stage II right bank area had the highest priority and would, moreover,
not conflict with the JICA master plan scheduled for completion in 1980/81.
To date, RID has constructed the main canals and laterals to serve about
43,000 ha out of a 66,000 ha service area. It is this project which the
Bank has been requested to finance.
1.26      Pattani.  Since 1963 various consulting firms and bilateral assis-
tance agencies have carried out studies on the hydropower and irrigation
potential of the Pattani River Basin. The current proposal for development
of the basin, including a storage dam, power plant and phased irrigation of
about 52,000 ha, is largely contained in a feasiblity report for a multi-
purpose project prepared for RID by Sverdrup and Parcel International, Inc.
(SPI) in 1969. On the basis of their feasibility report, SPI was retained
by EGAT in 1974 to prepare design and contract documents for the dam and power
plant. A Bank loan of US$50 million (Ln. 1485-TH) was made to EGAT in 1977
to assist in financing the storage dam and power plant. At the Bank's
suggestion, RID requested SPI to update the irrigation proposals for the
Stage I development of about 40,000 ha outlined in the 1969 report. This
study, carried out by SPI in association with Frederiksen, Kamine and
Associates (FKA) in 1977, and financed under the loan for the Phitsanulok
Project (Ln. 1149-TH), forms the basis for the Pattani component of the
proposed project. RID, in the meantime, awarded a contract for construction
of the Stage I diversion dam and began force account construction of the
right main canal to serve about 15,000 ha net. The diversion dam is
scheduled to be completed in January 1980 and to date about 23 km of the right
main canal have been constructed. The proposed Bank project would help to
finance the completion of the right main canal, lateral canals, and secondary
drains, and on-farm development for 15,000 ha, and detailed engineering for
the remaining 30,000 ha.

2. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.01      The two components of the project, Meklong and Pattani, are located
in the Central and Southern region, respectively. The Meklong project, on the
right bank of the Meklong River about 100 km west of Bangkok (Map 14432),
forms part of the Meklong River Basin, one of the largest river basins in
Thailand. The project is bounded on the North and East by the Meklong River
and by the provincial capital of Phetchaburi to the South. The Pattani proj-
ect is located in Pattani province in the extreme south of Thailand, about
800 km from Bangkok (Map 14431). The service area forms part of the Pattani
River delza situated in the coastaLl plain along the Gulf of Thailand. The
provincial capital of Pattani, with a population of 31,000, is adjacent to the
project area at the mouth of the Pattani River. Both areas are served by
well-developed networks of provinc:ial and district roads and are linked to
Bangkok by main roads and railways. A good all-weather road extends from
Pattani to Malaysia. Air and sea transport are also available from Pattani.
Climate
2.02      The tropical and monsoonal climate with its warm temperatures
throughout the year provides a 12--month growing season in both project areas.
The mean annual rainfall in the Meklong area is about 1,000 mm with about 85%
occurring between May and October during the southwest monsoon. However, dry
periods of up to ten days are not uncommon, especially in June and July, and
wet-season rice frequently sufferis significant yield reductions due to both
late planting and periodic drought. In the dry season, irrigation is essen-
tial to ensure a rice crop.
2.03      The rainfall pattern in Pattani differs from that in Meklong.
Pattani is affected not only by the southwest monsoon, which sweeps across
the entire country, but also by the northeast monsoon. Mean annual rainfall
is about 2,000 mm, with about 60% occurring between October and early January
(the northeast monsoon). This is followed by a short dry season until the
southwest monsoon begins in May. The southwest monsoon continues sporadically
until October with about 30% of the annual rainfall occurring during this
period. Rainfall is only sufficient for one rainfed rice crop during the main
rainy season (September-January). Significant yield reductions frequently
occur due to dry spells in September and January, and floods in November/
December. Further climatic details are given in Table 2.1.
Topography and Soils
2.04      The Meklong service area is generally flat with the exception of
terrace lands to the extreme west: and the levee soils along the right bank of
the Meklong to the east, where the topography is sometimes irregular with
ridges and depressions. The land slopes gently from north to south and from
west to east with a slight rise to the right bank levee of the Meklong, which



- 10 -
has created a natural depression. Flooding from the Meklong has been consi-
derably reduced by the construction of the Ban Chao Nen (Srinagarind) Dam /1
on the Kwae Yai River and a flood protection dike on the upper portion of
the right bank of the Meklong. The proposed Khao Laem Dam will further
reduce overflooding.
2.05      The Pattani service area is flat to slightly undulating, sloping
gradually from the mountain range along the southern boundary of the project
with a gradient of about 1:1,500, flattening out at the midpoint of the
service area to a gradient of about 1:3,000. There are some drainage problems
in the area due to the generally flat topography and frequent flooding from
the river in the wet season. However, flooding will be reduced on completion
of the multipurpose dam being built upstream 45 km from the project area.
Salt water intrusion is a problem in the lower part of the project in areas
penetrated by tidal streams.
2.06      The predominant soils occupying about 75% of the Meklong project
area are heavy clays of the Ratchaburi and Rangsit series which have a gene-
rally high nutrient status and are ideally suited to rice. Sandy loams of
the Kamphaeng Saen and Tha Muang series occupy about 10% of the project area,
mostly on the natural levees of the right bank of the Meklong. These coarser
textured soils, presently planted to sugarcane are fertile and well-suited to
a wide range of upland crops. Transitional clay loams, loams and silty loams
occupy the remaining 15% of the project area. These soils, located between
the levee soils and the lowland floodplains and along the western boundary
of the project area, are suitable for both rice and upland crops.
2.07      Soils in the Pattani project area are a complex mix of riverine and
marine alluvia. Medium-textured levee soils (clay loams) are found on higher
ground, along old meandering stream beds and adjacent to the existing rivers.
These soils, which occupy about 25% of the cultivable area of the proposed
project, are planted with upland crops, mostly tree crops of rubber, coconut
and fruit trees. Irrigation development in the proposed project area is con-
fined to the lower lying basin soils. There are medium-to-heavy kaolinitic
clays, slightly to moderately acid with poor internal drainage. These soils
are well suited to rice which is grown exclusively throughout the area to be
developed. Saline soils are found along the Nam Sai River as a result of
saline intrusion. Under the project, salinity will be reduced through the
provision of year-round irrigation, adequate drainage and the installation of
tidal gates.
/1 At the time of Bank appraisal, the dam was called Ban Chao Nen; since then
it has been renamed Srinagarind. To maintain consistency with existing
Bank documents, the original name is retained in this report.

Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.08      There are about 30,400 farm families in the two project areas,
21,500 in Meklong and 8,900 in Pattani.  With an average family size of six in
Meklong and eight in Pattani, the total population is about 200,000. The
average farm size in Meklong is about 3.3 ha. Approximately 50% of the
Meklong farmers are owner-operators and a further 40% are landowners who rent
additional land from other farmers. Only 10% are tenant farmers who operate
under various share, cash and labor exchange arrangements.
2.09       In Pattani the average paddy holding is about 1.8 ha.  Virtually all
of the farmers own at least part of their land but small farmers frequently
rent a portion of their holdings from large landowners in the area. There are
very few individually operated rice holdings in excess of 3 ha. In addition
to their paddy holdings, the larger farms have some land under rubber, most of
which is located outside the project area. The farm size distribution in
Meklong is based on independent surveys conducted by consultants (ILACO), a
Thai university consortium (1974), and RID (1975), and in Pattani on data from
selected villages. Details for both project components are given in
Table 2.2.

Existing Irrigation Facilities
2.10      Meklong.  The Vajiralongkorn Diversion Dam on the Meklong River
about 14 km downstream from the town of Kanchanaburi (see Map No. 14432)
diverts water for wet-season irrigation of about 27,000 ha in the upper part
of the project area. The dam was completed in 1970 under the Meklong Stage I
project with assistance from Ln. 394-TH. RID began construction of a main
irrigation and drainage system in the project area in 1970. To date two main
canals (1R and 2R) totaling 157 km have been built, together with 248 km of
laterals and 65 km of drains. Most of the 90 km of 1R canal and 12 km of the
2R canal are concrete lined. O&M roads have been constructed along the mains
and laterals but are in need of some improvement. About 860 km of farm irri-
gation ditches have been constructed under RID's "ditches and dikes" program
covering about 33,000 ha. However, 20-30% of the area is uncommanded; the
ditches are generally in a poor state of repair and afford very little water
control.
2.11      Pattani.  Irrigation water would be supplied from an existing diver-
sion dam on the Pattani River at Kurat, about 15 km downstream from the pro-
vincial capital of Yala. The dam is designed to divert water to a right,
center and left main canal to serve a net irrigable area of about 45,000 ha.
The first 1.5 km of main canal from the headworks to the bifurcation of the
right and center main canals is now under construction. The next 23 km of
right main canal, including about 10 km with concrete lining, have been com-
pleted but without checks or turnout structures. Parts of the lined section,
installed in 1972, are broken and the entire area is in a poor state of
repair. No laterals have been constructed in the project area. RID has com-
pleted 6 km of a 17 km main drain in the lower part of the project area.
Other drainage facilities are limited to natural water courses plus some small
ditches constructed by the farmers. Dikes have been constructed on each side
of the river upstream of the diversion dam to retain the pool created by the
dam.

3. THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01      The project would provide for construction of new irrigation
facilities and improvement of existing facilities to irrigate 66,000 ha in
Meklong and 15,000 ha in Pattani. The main features would be:
Meklong
(a) improvement and enlargement of 157 km of the existing main
canal and completion of 33 km of new main canal;
(b) improvement and enlargement of the 206 km of existing lateral
canals and construction of 103 km of new lateral canals and
service roads;
(c) completion of about 336 km of main and secondary drains; and
(d) construction of tertiary canals, drains and farm roads;
Pattani
(a) improvement of 23 km of the existing right main canal and construc-
tion of the remaining 25 km;
(b) construction of about 134 km of laterals and service roads;
(c) construction of about 165 km of main and secondary drains; and
(d) construction of tertiary canals, drains and farm roads.
3.02      In addition, the project would provide construction equipment,
operation and maintenance equipment, buildings, and consulting services to
assist in the design and implementation of project works and detailed engi-
neering for the 30,000 ha remainder of the Pattani Stage 1 development.
Project Works
3.03      Meklong.  Rehabilitation works are required to upgrade the existing
irrigation, drainage and road systems (para. 2.10) to enable efficient opera-
tion and to maximize water availability in the dry season. The 1R canal,
originally constructed with a design capacity of 66.9 cu m/s, would be enlarged
to 85.2 cu m/s to supply a service area of 50,700 ha with irrigation in the dry
season. This would be accomplished by raising the concrete lining 0.40 m in
the initial 17.4 km, installing concrete lining in 8 km of the presently
unlined section, and cleaning and reshaping 11 km of unlined section. The
capacity of the remainder of the existing canal is adequate. Cross-drainage
structures would be installed to bypass flood flows from the western catchment
area across the 1R canal. The upstream spoil bank would be shaped to provide



- 15 -
a training dike for routing the flood flows into the cross-drainage struc-
tures. The remaining 33 km of the IR canal (km 90 to 123) would be construc-
ted to serve the lower part of the project area. The existing 2R canal
capacity would be increased from 13.7 to 25.5 cu m/s and would provide full
irrigation to 14,000 ha in the dry season. A supplemental intake structure
woud be installed at the headworks, the initial 8 km of canal would be
widened and the lining replaced on the lower bank. The lining would be raised
0.60 m in the remaining 4 km of lined section, and the width and depth would
be increased in the 55 km of unlined section.
3.04      About 206 km of existing laterals would require enlargement and
rehabilitation to deliver the required peak demand at the farm level in the
dry season. About 30% of these laterals would be lined in areas where exces-
sive seepage losses and erosion appears likely. The remaining 41 km of
existing laterals and the 65 km of existing drains are adequate. About 103 km
of new laterals and 336 km of drains would be constructed. Service roads
along main and lateral canals and main drains would be 5 m wide and paved with
a 20 cm laterite surface.
3.05      The proposed type of on-farm development would be similar to that
being implemented in the Northeast Irrigation Project Stage I (Cr. 461-TH) and
"Class B" areas in the Phitsanulok Project (Ln. 1149T-TH). Tertiary canals
would be provided to serve units of about 60 ha. The maximum area served from
one farm turnout would be 4 ha and all farmers would have direct access to
irrigation water and drains. Farm roads, 3 m wide, would be provided along
about 70% of the tertiaries which, together with service roads along laterals
and drains, would provide all farmers with direct access to a road system. A
minimum amount of boundary realignment would be necessary. Rough leveling
only in the vicinity of the new facilities and boundaries would be provided;
any final leveling necessary would be the responsibility of the farmers.
Paddy land over most of the project area is reasonably level, plots are
generally large and level, and there is little fragmentation of holdings.
Studies of sample areas show that a rational layout of tertiary canals, drains
and farm roads can be achieved without recourse to the intensive land
consolidation adopted in the Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project.
3.06      Pattani.  The first 23 km of the right main canal would be repaired
and cleaned, and water regulating and delivery structures installed. The
remaining 25 km of the right main canal would be constructed without lining
except for about 2.5 km which passes through an area of permeable soils.
Eight main lateral turnouts with head regulators, plus a number of small farm
turnouts and minor structures would be provided in the new section.
3.07      The project would provide for the construction of about 134 km of
laterals which would be unlined except for about 15% which pass through areas
where excesgive seepage and water loss appears likely. Service roads would be
constructed along the main canal and laterals. About 165 km of drains would
be constructed in the project to accelerate surface runoff during and after
floods. Tide gates would be provided in drainage channels emptying into the
sea to limit saline intrusion.



_ 16-
3.08       Paddy lands irn the project area are generally level but fragmented
and interspersed with rubber trees, coconut palns, and orchards, mostly owned
by the paddy farmers. Project staff have found little support among the
farmers for any significant rearrangement of paddy holdings.  On-farm develop-
ment would be similar to that adepted for Meklong and the average size of each
tertiary unit would be about 60 ha. It would not be feasible, however, to
provide each farmer with direst access to ditches and drains, and some field-
to-field irrigation and drainage would be necessary.  Also, to minimize
encroachment on farm holdirngs9 roads would be constructed only along some 30%
of the total length of the tertfary carnals.
Water Supply, Demarnd and Quality
3.09      Meklor,..  Tne Meklong River has a catchment area of 25,600 sq km
above Vajiralongkorn diversion dam ivith a mean annual runoff of about 12,500
MCM, of which the Kvae Noi contributes about 50%, the Kwae Yai 40%, and other
tributaries 10%. With the com,pletion of the Ban Chao Nen and the Khao Laem
Multipurpose Da-ns, by 1985 about 8,860 MCM of regulated flow would be avail-
able to meet the requirements at Va.1iralongkorn diversion dam. Water require-
ments for dom,estic and industrial uses, salin-Ity and pollution control, and
navigation have been estimated at 1,600 MCM annually.  The remaining 7,260 MCM
would be available for irrigation in the Meklong area. Extensive sampling and
detailed chemical analyses have shown tine water of the Kwae Yai and Kwae Noi
to be of excellent quality for sust;alnd irrigation.
3.10       Irrigation denands for the proj ect area were calculated for the
cropping patter:ns described in Chapter 5 and the crop calendar shown in Figure
5.1.  Irrigation requirements for land preparation and crop growth (consump-
tive use minu-; effective rainfall plus percolation loss) were calculated on a
monthly basis using appropriate crop factors.  Planting periods of 42 days for
rice anid 5 months for sue;arcane were assumed.  Percolation losses for rice
were assumed at I mm/day during the dry season and 0.5 mm/day in the wet
season.  The net annual irrigation requiremients amount to about 860 MCM for
61,000 ha of doubled cropped rice, and 80 MCM. for 5,000 ha of sugarcane. The
diversion requirement was determined by applying the following efficiency
factors:
Rice    Sugarcane
Main canals and laterals          80%        80%
Farm efficiency                   75%        70%
Overall efficiency                60%        56%
Annual irrigation diversion requirements would be about 1,500 MCM, or about
one-fifth of the available regulated flow.
3.11      Pattani.  Water supply for the project would be obtained from
rainfall and the controlled discharge from the Bang Rang Dam on the Pattani
River (Ln. 1485-Ti) which is due to commence operation in 1981. Reservoir
operation studies have been carried out by EGAT to assess the capability of
the reservoir to meet irrigation demands for a net irrigable area of



- 17 -
45,000 ha. Monthly inflows for a period of 15 years (1962-77), supplemented
by correlating runoff with rainfall records for the periods 1922-58 and 1952-
65, were used in the study. Sampling and analyses at the diversion site indi-
cate the water is of good quality for sustained irrigation.
3.12      The irrigation water demand for the project was calculated for the
cropping patterns described in Chapter 5 and the crop calendar shown in Figure
5.2. Irrigation water requirements were determined in the same manner as
described for the Meklong project and the same irrigation efficiencies were
assumed in calculating diversion requirements. EGAT's operation studies
showed that with development of the full 45,000 ha in Pattani Stage I area
with a 170% cropping intensity, irrigation shortages would be confined to the
dry season and would occur in only 15 months of the 300-month study (1952-76).
Shortages would range from 5% to 10% of the dry-season demands and in many
years the supply would be adequate for an 80% dry-season cropping intensity.
In practice, it would be possible to forecast the seasonal water supply
available for irrigation from reservoir levels at the beginning of the dry
season and anticipated stream flows. Farmers would be advised at that time on
the proportion of land to crop for the season. Given that shortages would be
predictable and could be managed by predetermined cropping plans, a higher
long-term cropping intensity than 170% may be attainable. However, in view
of the relatively short period covered by the runoff records used in the
operation studies, an annual intensity of 170% has been used for project
evaluation. Further details on irrigation water requirements for both project
areas are shown in Annex 2.
Status of Design
3.13      The canal and drain alignment for both projects and designs of exis-
ting facilities were based on 1:10,000 scale maps prepared in the late 1960s.
RID's Survey Division is now resurveying both project areas and new 1:4,000
scale maps will be prepared for on-farm development designs and for detailed
designs of canals and drains. Existing designs will be checked using the new
maps. Mapping for the 15,000 ha served by the right main canal of Pattani
will be completed in 1979 and for the remaining 30,000 ha in 1980. Mapping
for 66,000 ha of Meklong will begin at the end of 1979 and will be completed
in 1982. In recent years, the Survey Division has greatly improved its survey
and mapping capability by using up-to-date techniques introduced with the help
of a Survey Adviser, whose services have been financed under previous Bank
projects.
3.14      RID has completed designs for the right main canal of Pattani, and
the remaining 33 km of the 1R canal of Meklong. Detailed designs have also
been completed for the laterals and drains to be contracted in the 1980
working season. Designs for most of the new laterals and drains to be
constructed as well as 75% of the on-farm development works will be carried
out by consultants beginning in early 1980. RID's Design Division will pre-
pare designs for the rehabilitation works in the canals and laterals, and 25%
of the on-farm works.

Project Implementation
3.15      The Meklong project would be constructed over a six-year period
starting in 1980 with rehabilitation and completion of the 1R canal (Figure
3.1). At the same time work would start on laterals and drains in the upper
part of the service area. Enlargement of the 2R canal and on-farm development
would be started by force account in the second year. Contract work on on-
farm development would start in the third year. Work on laterals, drains,
and on-farm development would progress from the upper to lower part of the
area and be completed by the end of the sixth year. Irrigation water deli-
veries would be initiated in the second year on a block of 4,000 ha. There-
after, additional blocks would be completed each year, with full irrigation
of the project area in the seventh year. With this approach incremental
irrigation benefits would begin to accrue during the construction period as
investments are made.
3.16      The Pattani project would be constructed over a five-year period
starting with rehabilitation of the existing 23 km of the right main canal in
1980 (Figure 3.2). At the same time work would start on construction of
laterals and drains in the upper part of the service area. Construction of
tertiaries for the first block of 2,000 ha would begin in January 1981.
Thereafter, on-farm development would proceed in parallel with the construc-
tion of laterals and drains.
Cost Estimates
3.17      Total project costs in January 1980 prices are estimated at
US$186 million with a foreign exchange component of US$80 million, or 43% of
the total cost. Construction costs are based on quantity and unit price
estimates prepared by RID and include about 10% for taxes and duties. Unit
prices are in line with recent bid prices for similar work in Thailand updated
to January 1980. Details of the cost estimates for the major work items are
shown in Annex 1. Physical contingencies of 15% have been added to all
civil works costs. Estimated price increases were derived by applying the
following annual rates of price escalation.
1980   1981   1982   1983   1984   1985

Equipment & services         7       7      7       6      6       6
The rates used for civil works reflect the expected rate of price increases
for local costs and the rates for equipment and services, which have a large
direct foreign exchange element, are in line with expected international price
increases. Expected price increases amount to US$37.2 million, or 25% of base
cost plus physical contingencies. A summary of project costs is given below:

Financing
3.18      The Bank loan of US$80.0 million would finance the foreign exchange
requirement of the project.  The Government's contribution of US$106.0 million
(B 2,123.5 million) would finance the balance of project costs through annual
budgetary allocations to RID. The loan would finance retroactively an amount
of $350,000 for expenditures incurred since September 1, 1979 for a contract
awarded by RID for extension of the right main canal at Meklong (para. 3.20).
Procurement
3.19      A major part of the project's civil works would be carried out by
contract in line with RID's current policy of reducing the share of its con-
struction program carried out by force account. Construction of all new
canals, most of the laterals and about 75% of the on-farm works would be
carried out by contract. Force account would be employed for most of the
drains and particularly for those works where construction needs to be coordi-
nated with operation of the existing system. Table 3.2 shows the expected
division of work between contract and force account.

3.20      The value of civil works contracts would range between US$0.5
million and US$7.0 million (including physical contingencies and expected
price increases). Construction of the main canals and laterals would be pack-
aged into contracts of not less than $5.0 million and these would be awarded
following international competitive bidding according to Bank Group guide-
lines. An exception would be a contract already awarded by RID following
local competitive bidding (LCB) under procedures acceptable to the Bank. The
size and phasing of contracts for construction of drainage systems and on farm
works are dictated largely by the rate at which mapping, detailed designs and
specifications can be prepared and right-of-way obtained. Also on-farm works
need to be coordinated with the construction of laterals and drains and
scheduled to permit farmers access to their land at least during the wet
season; these works would be carried out in blocks of about 3,000 ha. Experi-
ence in Thailand has shown that contracts of this size are of little interest
to international contractors. Therefore, these contracts would be awarded
following competitive bidding in accordance with local procedures. Contracts
would be advertised in Thai and English in the local press and documents would
be in English. Foreign firms would, however, be eligible to bid. PID's local
contracting procedures which have been followed on several Bank-assisted
projects to date, are satisfactory. Bid evaluation procedures for LCB would
follow Chapter III of the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.
3.21      Vehicles and equipment (US$15.8 million including expected price
increases) would be procured following international competitive bidding
(ICB) in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. A 15% preference margin, or



- 21 -
the prevailing customs duty if lower, would be extended to local manufacturers
in the evaluation of bids. Vehicles and equipment costing less than TTS$20,000
each and limited to a total of US$300,000, which are not practicable for
international tendering, would be purchased through normal government
procurement procedures (local competitive bidding or competitive quotations)
which ensure adequate competition.
Disbursements
3.22      Disbursements from the Bank loan would be made at the rate of 100%
against the foreign exchange cost of directly imported vehicles and equipment,
or the ex-factory price net of taxes for items manufactured locally, and at a
rate of 65% of total costs for imported items procured locally. For consul-
tants' services, disbursements would equal 100% of total expenditures. Dis-
bursements for civil works would be at 50% of total contract expenditures, to
be disbursed against periodic contractors' progress payments. In the case of
onfarm development carried out by force account, disbursement would be at the
rate of US$270/ha for Meklong and US$140/ha for Pattani. These are the fixed
rates agreed on by the Bank and RID, representing 50% of expenditures exclu-
ding depreciation of the equipment procured under the project, to execute
on-farm development works. Disbursements for on-farm development would be
made against certificates of completed work. This procedure is discussed in
Annex 5. It is expected that disbursements would be completed by June 30,
1986. Estimated schedules of expenditures, disbursements and the proposed
allocation of the proceeds of the loan are presented in Annex 1.
Project Cost Accounting
3.23      RID will maintain accounts in sufficient detail to record all
expenditures for force account construction and payments to civil works con-
tractors, equipment suppliers and consultants. RID's annual progress report
will show these expenditures, both annual and cumulative, separately for the
tieklong and Pattani components. For civil works, the expenditures will be
broken down according to the major elements of the irrigation systems, such
as main canals, laterals, drains, tertiary systems, etc. A suitable format
for the project accounts was agreed with the Bank during negotiations.
Environmental Effects
3.24      The project would have a beneficial effect on the environment by
providing a year-round water supply in an area presently dependent on un-
certain rainfall. Its adverse effects would not be significant. The project
areas are already flooded for paddy cultivation for about six months every
year so that double cropping would not greatly increase the farmers' exposure
to waterborne diseases or malaria. The canals would not be used for drinking
water since the villagers rely on wells and rainwater for domestic use.
Schistosomiasis is not present in the project area. A major emphasis in
Thailand's rice-breeding program is to produce disease- and pest-resistant
varieties; therefore, chemicals to control pests and diseases are used
sparingly by Thai farmers.

4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
The Royal Irrigation Department
4.01      The Royal Irrigation Department (RID) would be responsible for
project implementation. RID is now organized in 22 functional divisions and
12 regional offices, under a Director-General (Figure 4.1). Three Deputy
Directors General and two Chief Engineers assist the Director General in the
management of the Department. RID, together with most of the agriculture-
related government agencies, falls under the Ministry of Agriculture and
Cooperatives (Figure 4.2).
4.02      For recent Bank-financed irrigation projects, RID has adopted a
system of project management which is aimed at placing all aspects of project
implementation under the control of a Project Manager, who reports to a
Project Director. A similar system would be adopted for the proposed project.
Each of the two project components would have a Project Manager responsible
for day-to-day management and for coordination with the consultants, the
functional divisions, and other government agencies. The Project Managers
both of whom have already been appointed, would report to the Chief of RID's
Construction Division, who in turn reports to the Deputy Director General
(Construction). Work in each of the project areas would be under the super-
vision of a Project Engineer. RID also plans to establish in the near future
a Loan Projects Unit to assist the project managers and the functional divi-
sions in coordinating the implementation of all externally financed irrigation
projects. This would formalize an existing arrangement in which certain PID
staff have routinely handled, in the case of externally financed projects,
such matters as procurement, disbursements, reporting, administration of con-
sultants, and coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives.
4.03      An Administration and Organization Study carried out by consultants
financed under Loan 1149-TH has recently been completed. The consultants'
report has been reviewed in detail within RID and RID plans in the near future
to take steps to begin implementing the consultants' recommendations. The
consultants' recommendations would retain the existing organization along
functional lines but would provide a more logical grouping of the different
branches and a clearer definition of responsibilities of the Deputy Directors
General and Chief Engineers. The consultants also recommend improvements in
planning and budgeting and a closer monitoring of the implementation and
impact of irrigation projects.
Consulting Services
4.04      RID would retain consulting firms, composed of foreign specialists
in association with local consultants, to assist in the layout and design of
project features, preparation of design and contract documents, supervision of
construction, and the establishment of operation and maintenance programs.
RID would also employ consultants to assist in setting up a monitoring and
evaluation program. The estimated consultant input for Meklong would be about
150 man-months of expatriate staff and 500 man-months of local engineers and
staff. The consultants for Pattani, in addition to assisting RID in implemen-
tation of the project, would prepare layout and designs for project facilities
to serve the remaining 30,000 ha in the Stage I area. The estimated



- 23 -
consultant input would be 100 man-months of expatriate staff and 350 man-
months of local engineers and staff. The estimated cost of expatriate staff,
including travel and expenses, would average US$9,000 per man-month. An
assurance was obtained that consultants engaged by RID for project implemen-
tation and design would be employed on terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank.
Agricultural Supporting Services
4.05       Extension.  The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) is
primarily responsible for providing agricultural advice to farmers in the
project areas. The extension services of DAE are currently being expanded and
strengthened under a country-wide program in two phases. The National Agri-
cultural Extension Project I (Ln. 1393-TH) started in 1977 and is due to be
completed in 1981. The second phase project has been appraised and is
scheduled to start in 1980. These projects will provide one extension agent
for every 1,000 farm families with technical backstopping from subject matter
specialists. Farmer groups in irrigation areas will be based on the tertiary
service unit as opposed to the tambon in rainfed areas. Field extension
activities will be closely coordinated with the activities of RID's O&M staff
(para. 4.11). The program is already operative in the Pattani project area.
Only part of the Meklong project area is covered by the ongoing National
Extension Project, however, the entire project area is due to be covered by
1981 under the Second Phase project.
4.06      Research.  The Pattani and Ratchaburi Rice Experiment Stations are
located immediately adjacent to the Pattani and Meklong project areas. These
stations are supported by the main regional rice stations for the Southern and
Central regions at Khuan Khud and Suphanburi. Experimental work is focussed
on varietal screening, fertilizer trials and seed multiplication. In
addition, RID runs a small experimental station at Pattani. Both areas are
adequately provided with information on the current technology of rice
cultivation.
4.07      Fertilizers.  At present little fertilizer is used in the project
except for the small area of sugarcane at Meklong; annual fertilizer con-
sumption amounts to about 4,400 tons. A wide variety of straight and compound
fertilizers are used, although ammonium phosphate (16:20:0) is by far the most
common fertilizer used on rice. Application rates are, on average, only about
30 kg/ha. At full development the project would require about 35,000 tons of
fertilizer annually, of which 32,000 tons would be needed in Meklong and 3,000
tons at Pattani. Ammonium phosphate would account for nearly 70% of the total
requirements and urea for 24%. Sulphate of ammonia, triple superphosphate and
muriate of potash for use on sugarcane would make up the remaining 6%.
Commercial channels for the distribution of fertilizers are well established
in both project areas and private dealers and storekeepers would have no
difficulty in meeting the demand.
4.08      Seeds.  At full development the project would use approximately
6,300 tons of rice seed per annum, of which about 85% would be of high-
yielding varieties. Assuming that rice seed would be replaced every six
crops, the estimated annual seed requirement at full development would be
855 tons for Meklong and 190 tons for Pattani. The Ratchaburi and Pattani



- 24 -
Rice Experiment Stations would supply foundation seed to selected seed growers
under the supervision of the Seed Multiplication Division of DAE.
4.09      Credit.  The use of credit from institutional sources has increased
recently in both Meklong and Pattani project areas. However, under existing
rainfed conditions with the low use of inputs, the demand for production
credit is low. At present, institutional sources account for 30% and 15% of
total short-term production borrowings in Meklong and Pattani, respectively.
With the development of irrigation, the demand for short-term credit is
expected to increase from about B 34 million at present to B 300 million at
full development. The Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperation
(BAAC) would be the main source of institutional credit. BAAC has branch
offices in all districts covered by the project area. An Agricultural Credit
Project, aimed at strengthening BAAC, has been prepared for Bank financing.
An assurance was obtained that BAAC would make available the additional staff
and funds needed to meet the credit requirements of the farmers in the project
area.
Operation and Maintenance
4.10       RID would be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the
irrigation system down to the farm turnouts, the service roads, and the main
and collector drainage system. Consultant assistance would be provided to
assist RID in developing O&M procedures for the project. An amount of US$2.0
million would be provided in the loan for the purchase of O&M equipment to
strengthen RID's capacity for O&M work (Annex 1, Tables 8 and 9). The annual
cost of operating and maintaining the project facilities for which RID would
be responsible is estimated at US$15/ha on average.
4.11       Operation and maintenance of the systems below the farm turnout
would be the responsibility of the farmers, who would form water users' asso-
ciations. RID, with consultant assistance, would promote the establishment of
the water users' associations and provide them with technical assistance. The
farmers in each group would elect a group leader and a common irrigator who
would be responsible for operating the on-farm works and for ensuring that
maintenance is carried out. RID would coordinate the activities of its O&M
staff with those of the field extension staff of DAE. One set of farmers'
groups based on the tertiary service unit would be used for both water manage-
ment and extension purposes. Joint visits by O&M personnel and extension
workers would be regularly scheduled to advise farmers on irrigation and
cropping schedules and operation and maintenance of on-farm irrigation and
drainage systems. The annual cost of O&M of the on-farm works is estimated at
US$4/ha.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.12      RID would be responsible for monitoring and evaluating the project's
costs, impact and economic benefits. To date, RID has relied heavily on the
assistance of consultants and other government agencies to carry out monitor-
ing of ongoing projects. Arrangements have varied from project to project,
and there has been a lack of continuity and limited involvement of RID staff.



- 25 -
Recognizing the advantages of a properly organized in-house monitoring unit as
a tool of management, RID wishes to strengthen its monitoring and evaluation
capability. The Irrigated Agronomy Branch of RID's O&M Division is engaged in
the routine collection of crop statistics for all irrigation projects, and the
Economics Branch of RID's Planning Division undertakes agroeconomic baseline
surveys. Under the proposed project, consultants would be provided to assist
RID in developing the capacity of these two units to undertake monitoring. An
assurance was obtained that RID would not later than December 31, 1980, submit
to the Bank for review and comment their detailed proposals for monitoring and
evaluation of Bank-financed irrigation projects.

5. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Present Cropping Patterns
5.01      In Meklong about 65,000 ha of rice and 6,000 ha of sugarcane are
cultivated in the wet season. In the upper part of the project area, about
27,000 ha of the rice crop and most of the sugarcane, receive some irrigation
in the wet season from the existing system. Some 5,000 ha of the remaining
rainfed paddy area is subject to flooding in the wet season due to impeded
drainage; this area is planted in November after the flood waters recede, and
harvested in March/April. Dry-season cultivation is limited to about 3,500 ha
of pump irrigated rice. Virtually all rice is transplanted from field
nurseries onto previously puddled land. Unreliable rainfall at the start of
the wet season frequently causes delays in the planting program and trans-
planting takes place from June through September. The crop is harvested
between November and January. Dry-season rice is grown between February and
June, with transplanting in February/March and harvest in May/June. Photo-
sensitive, local improved varieties (nonglutinous) are grown throughout the
project area in the wet season. High-yielding varieties are grown only on the
small area cropped in the dry season. Sugarcane planting is restricted to the
period April-June, to correspond with the start of the rainy season. Harvest
of the plant crop takes place during the dry season between December and
April, and consequently the first crop is taken in less than 12 months,
resulting in low yields and sugar content.
5.02      About 85% of the cultivable land in the Pattani project area is
planted to a single rainfed rice crop grown in the wet season between August
and March. The remainder, located on higher ground, is planted with tree
crops, mostly rubber, with some coconuts and fruit trees. Virtually all rice
is transplanted from field nurseries onto previously puddled land.
Photosensitive, long-strawed, local varieties are grown throughout the project
area.
Future Cropping Patterns
5.03      In the absence of the project in Meklong, there would be a gradual
increase in the area of HYVs planted in the wet season up to about 20% of the
total rice area, and in the dry season the cropping intensity would increase
from the existing 5% to about 18%. Further increases in the dry season would
be constrained by the inadequacies of the existing irrigation facilities.
With the project, 66,000 ha would be provided with irrigation in the wet
season and the dry-season paddy crop would increase from 3,500 ha to 55,000
ha. HYVs would be planted on about 75% of the area in the wet season and 100%
in the dry season. With improved drainage, double cropping would be intro-
duced on the 5,000 ha presently subject to floods (para. 5.01). The cropping
intensity (excluding sugarcane) would increase from the existing level of
105% to 190%. About 1,000 ha of low-lying land currently planted with sugar-
cane would convert to paddy once a reliable water supply becomes available.
5.04      In the absence of the project, there would be no significant change
in cropping patterns in Pattani. With the project, some 15,000 ha of
currently rainfed paddy land would be provided with irrigation and the



- 27 -
cropping intensity would increase from the present 100% to about 170%.  A
reliable water supply and improved water control would enable farmers to shift
from local varieties to high-yielding varieties (HYVs). In the wet season
about 50% of the project area would be planted to HYVs.  Since some flooding
would still occur, RD13, a long-strawed, photosensitive HYV, would be grown.
This variety flowers in January after the risk of inundation has passed. In
the dry season, semidwarf HYVs (RD7, RD9) would be grown exclusively. The
expected changes in cropping patterns and production are shown in Table 5.1.
Yields and Production
5.05      Present and projected yields are shown in Table 5.2.  With good
water control, improved extension services and adequate supplies of credit and
inputs, projected yields would be reached in the sixth year after completion
of project works. Yield increases would be obtained from the provision of
irrigation and drainage, increased planting of HYVs, better quality seed,
heavier fertilizer inputs, and improved weed and pest control. In the case of
Pattani, projections are based on yields presently obtained at local research
stations, adjusted to field conditions. For Meklong, yields are based on
results from the Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project (Cr. 379-TH) where
soils and climate are similar to those in the project area. Projected yields
at full development are lower for Pattani than for the Meklong area, reflec-
ting the generally less favorable rice soils and the lack of experience in
irrigated rice culture in the area. As a result of the project, paddy
production in Meklong would increase from about 163,000 tons at present to
467,000 tons at full development and in Pattani from 22,000 tons to 78,000
tons. Sugarcane production would rise from 330,000 tons to 450,000 tons,
despite the expected decrease in area cultivated.

Cropping Calendar
5.06      Figs. 5.1 and 5.2 show proposed crop calendars for Meklong
and Pattani project areas. The main changes from existing practices are the
introduction of dry-season cropping in Pattani and the expansion of dry-season
cropping in Meklong. Some acceleration of operations would be necessitated in
both project areas by higher cropping intensities and the need to have
harvesting and threshing take place in the dryest condition available. With
reliable irrigation, sequential planting and harvesting of sugarcane would
take place during the dry season in the period December through April. The
proposed calendar allows for system maintenance in Pattani during two periods
of about three weeks duration in February/March and July/August. In Meklong,
system maintenance would be undertaken in May/June and November/December.



- 30 -
Farm Mechanization
5.07      At present about 70% of the cropped area in the Meklong and 85% in
Pattani depend on animal-drawn equipment for land preparation. With im-
proved water management, better access to fields, and the need for tighter
operating schedules to maximize water use and increase cropping intensities,
it is estimated that mechanized land preparation for both wet- and dry-season
crops would increase to about 90% in Meklong and 60% in Pattani. The
machinery, both two- and four-wheel tractors, and rotary tillers, would be
largely owned by farmers and contracted out to their neighbors, as is
currently the practice. Contract plowing with 40-60 hp tractors is already
well established in the Meklong sugarcane areas. At present, paddy is
harvested in Pattani with a hand knife and in Meklong with a sickle. With
increasing labor peaks at harvest under the project, it is anticipated that
the sickle would replace the hand knife over about 50% of the Pattani project
area. Threshing is done either manually or by mechanical threshers in Meklong
and almost entirely by hand in Pattani. Under project conditions of better
field access and better drainage, a moderate shift to mechanized threshing
accounting for about 75% of future production is assumed in Meklong and 35% in
Pattani.
Drying, Storage and Processing
5.08      At present threshed paddy is sun-dried on whatever suitable surfaces
are available. Some of the rice mills have concrete drying floors. Sun-
drying of paddy will continue under the project but additional drying floor
space would be needed to accommodate increased yields. Similarly, storage
capacity, which is ample for the present level of production would need to be
expanded in the future. Storage facilities at some of the larger rice mills
are currently underutilized, and farmers can increase their own storage
capacity without difficulty. In addition, cooperative warehouses now being
built as part of a countrywide government-sponsored program could be expected
to meet part of the increased storage requirements. There are about 680
privately owned rice mills in the project areas. Assuming a 200-day milling
season, these mills have an annual capacity of about 560,000 tons of paddy,
compared to the present project area annual-production of about 190,000 tons.
However, since these mills also cater to the needs of farmers outside the
project area, some additional milling capacity would be required at full
development. The private sector can be expected to meet any additional
milling requirements without difficulty.

6. MARKETS, PRICES, INCOMES AND PROJECT CHARGES
Market Prospects
6.01      over the past 15 years domestic consumption of rice in Thailand
increased at about 3% p.a. while production increased at around 2% p.a.  Rice
exports over the same period have averaged about 1.5 million tons annually,
fluctuating between 0.85 million tons in 1973 and 2.9 million tons in 1972.
The incremental project paddy production of 300,000 tons at full development
constitutes about 1.5% of projected national production in 1990 and should not
have a significant effect on either the domestic or export supply-demand
situation.
6.02      At Meklong, production is presently sufficient to meet consump-
tion needs of the rural population in the project areas and to satisfy part
of the demand of adjacent urban areas. The projected marketable surplus can
be disposed of in the nearby urban areas, in the adjoining sugar production
areas where most farmers grow little or no rice, and in the Bangkok domestic
and export market which is easily reached at low transport cost over a well-
developed road, rail and waterway network.
6.03      At Pattani current production is barely adequate to meet the con-
sumption demand of the rural population in the immediate vicinity of the
project. Pattani province and the adjoining provinces of Yala and Narathiwat
have a rice deficit of some 140,000 tons of paddy p.a., and without the
project the deficit would widen to about 170,000 tons by 1990. Production in
the three provinces has been increasing at about 1% p.a. whereas demand
resulting from population growth alone has been increasing at about 2.5% p.a.
over the past decade.
6.04      Incremental production from Pattani of about 53,000 tons of rice,
p.a. would be easily disposed of in the three-province deficit area. Future
surpluses of good-quality rice could be exported to Malaysia which currently
imports about 200,000 tons of Thai rice annually. Pattani rice could develop
a comparative advantage over Bangkok rice with respect to the Malaysia export
market.
6.05      At present sugar production in Thailand is slightly in excess of
total domestic and export demand, given the current export quota under the
International Sugar Agreement. Present government policy is to reduce sugar
production by promoting crop substitution in the marginal cane-growing areas.
However, most of the project land planted to sugar is agronomically well-
suited to the crop, is located close to a major sugar milling complex, and is
likely to remain in sugar. Cane producers will have no difficulty in dis-
posing of the future incremental production, which would constitute less than
1% of projected national production.



- 32 -
Prices
6.06      The price structure for rice and paddy used in the economic and
financial anlyses is presented in Table 6.1. The present and future prices
are based on the Bank's commodity price forecasts, adjusted for grade
differences, and expressed in January 1980 constant prices. The present
and future average f.o.b. export prices are US$320/ton and US$480/ton,
corresponding to financial farm-gate prices of B 2,400/ton and B 3,500/ton,
respectively.
6.07      Export prices are largely determined by international market forces,
although the composition of exports by grade depends on weather conditions at
harvest time. Government intervention in the form of the rice export premium
and other taxes, partially intended to stabilize domestic consumer prices, bas
resulted in depressed farm-gate prices. In recent years the Government has
used part of the export premium proceeds to support farm-gate paddy prices by
open market purchase and storage. For the 1978 wet season and the 1979 dry-
season crops, funds were available to purchase about 15-20% of the marketed
surplus paddy. Government policy also requires exporters to retain and store
a specified quantity and grade of rice for each ton exported. The January
1979 reserve requirement was 0.5 ton of 15% brokens for each ton of any
quality exported. This rice, which must be made available to the Government
on demand at a fixed price, is used for Government-to-Government sales or
released through special outlets in urban areas to control retail prices.

6.08      The present and future economic prices were derived by taking the
weighted average f.o.b. prices and working back to the farm-gate, excluding
taxes and the rice premium and adjusting domestic costs by applying specific
conversion factors to state all local costs in border price equivalents
(Annex 4, Table 1). The resulting economic farm-gate prices are B 3,900/ton
and B 5,900/ton for present and future respectively (in 1980 constant prices).
Farm Incomes
6.09      Farm budgets have been prepared for six farm models, representing
typical farms of different sizes and cropping systems in the two project
areas. The models for Meklong are for 2.0 ha and 4.0 ha rice farms; a
5.0 ha sugarcane farm has been included even though only about 7% of the
area would be cropped under sugarcane with the project (para 5.03). For
Pattani the budgets are for 1.0 ha and 2.5 ha rice farms and a 4.0 ha
rice/rubber farm. In the farm models it is assumed that family labor
contributes 60 man-days/month in Meklong and 72 man-days/ month at Pattani.
Hired labor is assumed only when demand exceeds the estimated family labor
supply in a given month. Hired labor is costed at B 25/man-day at Meklong
and B 20/man-day at Pattani. Project charges at the levels shown in para.
6.16 have been assumed in the farm budget analysis. The summary of the farm
budget analysis presented in Table 6.3 shows that the project would increase
farm incomes by two- to four-fold in both project areas.

6.10      In the total project area, about 45% of the farm families are
presently living on incomes at or beneath the absolute poverty level; at full
development this figure would decrease to about 15%. In Meklong, the present
per capita farm incomes range from US$130 for a 2.0 ha rice farm to US$335 for
a 5.0 ha sugar farm. The incomes for the small farms are below the estimated
per capita absolute poverty level of US$150 (1980 prices) and are less than
25% of the estimated 1980 per capita GNP of US$540 for Thailand. Analysis of
farm budgets and farm size distribution data indicates that farm families with
holdings smaller than 2.3 ha (about 24% of the Meklong project families) gene-
rally have incomes beneath the poverty level, even when their livestock, labor
and other off-farm earnings are included. With the project, the per capita
incomes in Meklong would range from US$345 to US$950, substantially above the
poverty level and representing 37-103% of the 1990 projected per capita GNP
(1980 prices) of US$925. In Pattani, about 95% of the project farmers have
incomes beneath the poverty level. The present per capita farm incomes range
from US$40 for a 1.0 ha rice farm to US$75 for a 4.0 ha rice/rubber holding.
These farm incomes are 25-50% of the 1980 absolute poverty level and represent
8-14% of the estimated 1980 per capita GNP. With the project, farm incomes
are expected to increase to US$105 to US$315 per capita. Thus, about half of
the Pattani farm families would still have incomes below the estimated
absolute poverty level at full project development.
Project Charges
6.11      Until the early 1970s, the Bank had accepted the rice premium as
an indirect form of cost recovery since it had brought the Government annual
revenues ranging from US$13 million to US$165 million.   By 1973, there was
a general consensus in the Government that more direct cost recovery measures
should be applied for intensive forms of agricultural development undertaken
at public expense. The last five irrigation projects financed by Bank loans
and credits have placed more emphasis on tertiary, or on-farm development
than in the past and lead to clearly identifiable improvements in the produc-
tivity of individual holdings. For each of these projects the Government has
undertaken to carry out studies to determine the appropriate level of charges
to recover the cost of operating and maintaining the system and a reasonable
portion of the investment cost.
6.12      On the basis of cost recovery studies carried out for the Chao
Phya I project (Cr. 379-TH), the Government calculated that an annual fee of
B 690/ha would recover without interest, 90% of the cost of tertiary
facilities and 100% of the cost of land leveling, to be collected over 11
years. Recognizing the inadvisability of imposing a different charge on
farmers in the Chao Phya II area, parts of which are immediately adjacent to
the Chao Phya I, the Government decided to keep the same annual fee for both
projects. They estimated that this fee, collected over 13 years, in Chao
Phya II would recover, with 12% interest, 13% of the cost of tertiary
facilities and the full cost of land leveling, or about 50% of the total
capital costs of tertiary development. BAAC has agreed to serve as the
collection agent for a fee of 2% of the funds collected and can commence
activities as soon as cadastral surveys are completed establishing the exact
size of each farmer's holding. In addition, an annual O&M fee of B 55/rai
(US$17.00/ha) would be collected from the project beneficiaries.



- 37 -
6.13      The existing legislation which empowers the Government to collect
fees for irrigation is contained in the Land Consolidation Act and the Irri-
gation Act. The Land Consolidation Act allows collection of up to 90% of the
cost of common irrigation works, the full cost of land leveling, and a fee for
O&M in officially designated land consolidation areas, where holdings are
fragmented and construction of project works involves boundary realignment and
land leveling. Neither component of the proposed project is being developed
in this manner. The Irrigation Act empowers the Government to collect a fee
for operation and maintenance of the system, but has never been enforced
because of the irregularity and unreliability of most of the irrigation
systems constructed in the past.
6.14      The Government is undertaking to strengthen its legislative
authority in regard to irrigation charges, particularly cost recovery, since
the Land Consolidation Act is only applicable to a small portion of irrigated
land in the central plain. They proposed under the Northeast Irrigation
Project II (Ln. 1630-TH) to submit legislation to the National Assembly by
June 1980 that would allow recovery of investment costs from beneficiaries of
all irrigation projects.
6.15      For the proposed project, RID would, under the authority granted by
the Irrigation Act, impose an O&M fee and begin collections after the first
year of operation of the system. RID would determine appropriate levels of
cost recovery after the system has been in operation two to three years and
farmers have begun to realize project benefits. A cost recovery study would
be made on the basis of farm data collected for monitoring and evaluation
purposes and would take into account incentives to farmers, capacity of
farmers to pay, size of farm holdings and other taxes and charges paid by
farmers.
6.16      Assurances were obtained that the Government would:
(a)   prepare and submit to the Bank for review and comment by June 30,
1981, proposals for the amount of O&M fee to be levied on project
beneficiaries and the mechanism by which such fees would be
collected;
(b)   subject to (a) above, impose and collect an O&M fee, under terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, one year after the
completion of the tertiary systems in blocks of 1,000 ha;
(c)   carry out a cost recovery study on the basis of data collected for
monitoring and evaluation purposes, and prepare and submit to the
Bank for review and comment, not later than December 31, 1984,
proposals for charges to be levied on project beneficiaries; and
(d)   subject to (b) and (c) above, impose and collect charges, on terms
and under procedures satisfactory to the Bank, not later than three
years after completion of tertiary systems in blocks of about 3,000
ha, sufficient to recover a reasonable portion of the cost of the
tertiary systems.



- 38 -
6.17      For the purpose of illustration, an analysis has been carried out
assuming the same level of cost recovery now proposed for Chao Phya II
(Table 6.4). Recovery of 50% of the cost of tertiary development, with 12%
interest, would result in annual charges of B 980/ha in Meklong and B 465/ha
in Pattani. In addition, farmers would pay O&M fees of B 300/ha for the main
system and B 80/ ha for on-farm works. Based on the above charges, the rent
recovery index in Meklong would range from 40 to 63%, with an average of 38%.
The high index (63%) for a 5.0 ha sugar farm reflects the combination of a
high present income, a low incremental income due to the project, and project
charges applied to relatively large individual holdings. In Pattani, the
rent recovery index would vary from 16 to 20%, averaging 17%. These indices
show that there is ample scope for introducing water charges without imparing
farmers' incentives to participate in the project. The cost recovery index
would be 15% for Meklong and 7% for Pattani.
6.18      At present the Government imposes taxes on exported rice amounting
to about B 1,600/ton (66% of the farm-gate price). For the average farm
model tested, the indirect taxes imposed on incremental production would be
four to five times as much as the cost recovery charges proposed above,
indicating that the rice premium and other export taxes could be significant
elements of decision in cost recovery policy. An analysis was carried out
taking into account the rice premium, export duty and municipal tax and
assuming that all incremental production due to the project would be available
for export. Under these assumptions, the cost and rent recovery indices
would be appreciably higher. In l4eklong, the rent recovery index would vary
between 67 and 78% and the cost recovery index increases from 15% (not
including these taxes) to 73% (with taxes). In Pattani, the rent recovery
index would range from 48 to 57% and the cost recovery index would increase
from 7 to 36%. An important element in cost recovery policy is whether the
Government would give more weight to increased farm incomes or to tax revenue
for further development. Taking into account the relative income level of the
beneficiaries (Table 6.3), the foregoing analysis indicates that the assumed
charges would be satisfactory for the 2.0 ha Meklong farm, but that there
may be scope for higher taxation on farms 4.0 ha and larger. In Pattani,
however, imposing any capital cost recovery charges may be inappropriate on
the basis of the beneficiaries' relative income position, in which case
recovery of 0 & M costs would be sufficient, and the capital costs of
irrigation could be considered a transfer payment to these farmers. Final
determination of the level of charges in both areas would be made after the
cost recovery study (para 6.15) is carried out.

7. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
7.01      The proposed project would increase cropping intensities and yields
on about 81,000 ha through the improvement, rehabilitation and extension of
irrigation works. Rice would be the major crop grown during the wet and dry
seasons and there would be about 5,000 ha of irrigated sugarcane grown in the
Meklong area. Approximately 30,400 farm families would benefit directly from
the increased production and employment. The project would generate demand
for an additional 5.2 million man-days of labor per year and would help to
meet the Government's objectives of more balanced regional growth, increased
incomes for the poorer segment of the rural population, and increased pro-
duction of food and cash crops. The incremental annual production of 200,000
tons of milled rice at full development would result in net annual foreign
exchange earnings of about US$51 million (in 1980 constant terms). The
average capital cost per directly benefited family in 1980 prices is US$4,335
in Pattani and US$4,735 in Meklong.
7.02      Distribution of benefits.  Farmers within the two project areas will
benefit from the projects roughly in proportion to the area of land they
cultivate in a given year. The distribution of benefits can be expected to be
more favorable than indicated by the size distribution of farm holdings (Table
2.2, page 12) because (a) farmers with relatively small farms are likely to
rent land from farmers with large holdings, (b) cropping intensitities are
likely to be higher on small farms than large farms, and (c) there will be a
trend towards subdivision of the larger holdings (paraticularly those above 5
ha) among adult family members or through sale to others, because of the
demanding management requirements for intensive year-round activities. The
effect of these factors cannot be readily predicted, but it is likely to be
significant. For example, in Meklong 11,000 farmers with holdings below 3 ha
(51% of the total) own just aver 21,000 ha (30% of the gross area). If these
farmers were to rent on average one additional ha, they would as a group come
close to receiving 50% of the project benefits. In Pattani, there is a more
uniform distribution of land holdings; farmers with holdings between 1 and 3
ha (60% of the total) own 60% of the land. However, farmers with less than 1
ha account for 25% of the total and own 8% of the land, in contrast to the
larger farmers (over 4 ha) who own 22% of the land. Nevertheless, a
significant shift in benefits towards the small farmers can be expected
through rental, more intensive cropping, and subdivision of large holdings.
The current rental rates in the areas developed in Bank-financed projects in
the Chao Phya Plain is B 1,200-1,500/ha ($60-75/ha), which would be about 20%
of the incremental income/ha.
7.03      Foreign Exchange.  The unit of account is uncommitted foreign
exchange in the hands of the Government, expressed in terms of local currency.
All tradeable components are valued directly in foreign exchange and converted
to local currency at the official exchange rate and adjusted for local trans-
port and handling. Specific conversion factors for a number of broad cate-
gories of goods and services produced or consumed by the project have been
used to express all nontradeable inputs and outputs in terms of the common
unit of account (Annex 4, Table 1).
7.04      Benefits. Expected future yields and production with and without the
project and prices of inputs and outputs are discussed in Chapter 5. Production
costs and returns, farm budgets and incomes, and labor requirements



- 41 -
are given in Annex 3. The expected benefits at full agricultural development
for the two components and the project as a whole are given in Annex 4,
Table 2.
7.05      Farm Labor.  There are about 21,500 farm families in the Meklong
project area, with an average family size of six. With 2.5 workers per agri-
cultural family, the total farm labor force is about 53,750, and the labor
supply, on the basis of 24 work days per month, is about 1.3 million man-days
per month or 15.5 million man-days per year. Assuming a growth in the rural
labor force of 1% per year, the labor supply at full development would be 1.5
million man-days per month or 17.9 million man-days per year.
7.06      The demand for labor in the Meklong area is strongly influenced by
labor requirements of the major sugarcane-producing areas of Thailand located
immediately adjacent to the project. The sugar milling season - from December
through April - corresponds approximately to the period of minimum labor
demand within the Meklong project at present, resulting in greater off-season
employment of the project labor force than for many other rice-growing areas.
With the project, labor demand peaks would occur in February, May, August
and November. During these months 90-95% of the project labor force would be
required. Further increases in mechanization of cultivation and harvest
beyond the assumed rates are possible and would result in lower labor demands
in peak periods. Information on prevailing wage rates for agricultural labor
in the Meklong area during different periods of the year indicates an annual
average market wage of about B 25/day. This wage is believed to reasonably
reflect the opportunity cost of unskilled labor in the project vicinity.
7.07      In the Pattani project area, there are about 8,900 farm families
with an average of eight persons. With three workers per family, the total
labor force is about 26,700. The labor supply is estimated to increase from
about 0.6 million man-days per month (7.7 million man-days per year) at
present to about 0.7 million man-days per month (8.9 million man-days per
year) at full development.
7.08      The demand for labor within the proposed service area in the Pattani
project is at present largely limited to the wet season, which occurs roughly
from August to March, but a significant off-season labor demand is generated
by the rubber-growing areas near the project area. Nevertheless, there is
considerable underemployment of the rural labor force due in part to the rela-
tively low (for Thailand) land:man ratio and low productivity, resulting in a
lower-than-average market wage of B 20/day. With the project, farm employ-
ment opportunities would increase from 1.5 million man-days per year at
present to 2.7 million man-days at full project development. In months of
peak labor demand for rice, the overall labor supply would be more than ade-
quate although larger holdings would need some hired labor which could be
provided by smaller farms. There would be no need to rely on labor from
outside the project area. Estimates of total monthly labor requirements for
both project areas are given in Annex 4, Table 3.

7.09      Project Costs.  In the economic analysis, all financial costs have
been expressed in 1980 constant values. Taxes and transfer payments have
been excluded (cost of civil works reduced 10%) and local costs have been
multiplied by the conversion factor for construction (0.74). The total
investment cost of the Meklong component is US$82.2 million, including civil
works (us$5l.5 million), equipment (US$10.2 million), engineering and admin-
istration (US$6.6 million), consultants (US$2.9 million), buildings (US$0.6
million), land acquisition (US$1.9 million) and physical contingencies
(US$8.5 million). For Pattani, the total investment cost is US$29.5 mil-
lion, comprising civil works (US$17.0 million), equipment (US$3.4 million),
engineering and administration (US$2.7 million), land acquisition (US$1.9
million), consultants (US$1.1 million), buildings (US$0.6 million), and
physical contingencies (US$2.8 million). For both components, the estimated
annual incremental cost of O&M is US$15/ha for the main system and US$4/ha
for the on-farm works.
7.10      Economic costs of land acquired for right-of-way for main canals,
laterals and drains were determined by calculating the economic opportunity
cost of the land under several categories of land use and applying the unit
costs to the area acquired. The economic cost of land lost to on-farm
development works is accounted for by an area reduction from the "without
project" to the "with project" case. The cost of flood control works not
directly related to the project has been excluded.
7.11      Development Period.  All works under the proposed project would be
completed in Meklong in mid-1985 in time for the 1985 wet-season crop and in
Pattani in mid-1984 in time for the 1984/85 wet-season crop. Beginning with
the first crop grown under project conditions, farmers would achieve projec-
ted full production levels over six years. Both project components would
achieve full development benefits with the 1990 dry-season crop.
7.12      Economic Rate of Return.  Using the foregoing assumptions and dis-
counting costs and benefits over a 30-year evaluation period, the economic
rate of return for the proposed project is 32%. The economic rates of return
for each component are 35% for Meklong and 23% for Pattani.
7.13      Sensitivity of the Economic Rate of Return.  Sensitivity analysis
has been carried out to determine which variables would be most crucial to
the success of the project. As a measure, the crossover value was used,
defined as the value of the variable tested for which the NPV discounted at
12% was zero. The crossover value may be interpreted as the value of the
variable tested, beyond which the economic rate of return would be below 12%.
The results are presented in Annex 4, Table 5 and discussed below.
(a) Project yields. The project is not very sensitive with respect to
yields. Even if yields were to be 1/3 lower than anticipated, the
rate of return would still be 12%.



_- +3 -
(b)  Dry-season cropping intensity.  It is assumed that in the future,
dry season cropping would increase to about 16,500 ha with the
existing level of irrigation facilities in Meklong and to 55,000
ha at full development of the project. With the higher yields
anticipatd in both sesons due to the project, dry season cropping
would have to be limited to less than 12,500 ha before the
economic rate of return would fall below 12%. In Pattani, wher
lack of irrigation facilities precludes any dry season cropping in
the future without the project, if a second crop were to be grown
on 1,900 ha with the project, the economic rate of return would
still be 12%.
(c)  Price of rice.  The cross-over value represents in Meklong a 55%
decrease in the forecast world market price of rice and a 45%
decrease in Pattani, which seems unlikely.
(d)  Construction costs.  The cost of construction would have to
increase to almost four times the present estimate for Meklong and
more than twice for Pattani before the economic rate of return for
either of the projects would fall below 12%.
(e)  Development period.  The development period would have to be
extended to 23 years for Meklong and 21 years for Pattani before
the ERR would fall below 12%.
7.14      Sunk Costs.  Since the proposed project represents the incremental
investment necessary to complete irrigation programs in which RID has been
involved since the mid- to late-1960s, each component has also been analyzed
to determine whether the original investment decision is still valid. Past
costs have been expressed in 1980 constant values and converted to economic
values by a conversion factor of 0.80. In Pattani, 40% of the expenditures
between 1968 and 1979 have been apportioned to the 15,000 ha served by the
right main canal. In Meklong, past expenditures have been for the main
canals and 18% of the cost of the existing headworks structures, apportioned
to the right bank system as its share of the potential area to be served by
these facilities. Investment costs have been incurred since 1964 with only
minimal incremental benefits, which have been ignored in the analyses. With
the above assumptions, the economic rate of return is 15% in Meklong and 13%
in Pattani.
7.15      Stage I Pattani.  In addition to the sunk cost analysis of the
right main canal system, the entire Stage I development of Pattani has been
studied. Future costs for the development of 33,000 ha in the Stage I area,
not included in the proposed project, have been derived from the feasibility
study update (1977) carried out by SPI and adjusted to reflect price
increases and works completed since 1977. Construction of the remainder of
Stage I is expected to begin in 1982 and be completed in 1985. Incremental
benefits at full development in 1991 have been calculated on the same basis



- 44 -
as in the 15,000 ha right main canal area of the proposed project. With
these assumptions, and including RID's past expenditures between 1968 and
1969, the economic rate of return is 14%.
7.16      Risks.  There are no unusual risks associated with the project.
The risks normally associated with irrigation projects have been accounted
for in estimating yields, cropping intensities, and rates of development. In
comparing the two components, lower yields are assumed for Pattani where
farmers have had less exposure to irrigated agriculture and the use of modern
inputs.

8. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations agreement with the Government was reached on
the following principal points:
(a)  RID would employ consultants to assist in project implementation,
operation and management, and monitoring and evaluation for each
component, and in preparation of designs for completion of Pattani
Stage I (para. 4.04);
(b)  BAAC would make available the additional staff and funds needed
to meet the credit requirements of farmers in both project areas
(para. 4.09);
(c)  RID would not later than December 31, 1980, submit to the Bank for
review and comment their detailed proposals for monitoring and
evaluation of Bank-financed irrigation projects (para. 4.12);
(d)   (i) RID would prepare and submit to the Bank for review and
comment by June 30, 1981, proposals for the amount of O&M
fee to be levied on project beneficiaries and the mechanism by
which such fees would be collected (para. 6.16);
(ii) subject to (i) above, RID would impose and collect an O&M
fee, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, one
year after operation of tertiary systems in blocks of 1,000 ha
(para. 6.16);
(iii) RID would carry out a cost recovery study on the basis of
data collected for monitoring and evaluation purposes, and
prepare and submit to the Bank for review and comment not
later than December 31, 1984, proposals for charges to be
levied on project beneficiaries (para. 6.16); and
(iv) subject to (ii) and (iii) above, impose and collect charges,
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, not later
than three years after completion of tertiary systems in blocks
of about 3,000 ha, sufficient to recover a reasonable portion
of the cost of the tertiary system (para. 6.16).
8.02      With the above assurances, the proposed project would be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$80.0 million, with a 20-year maturity including a grace
period of five years. The Borrower would be the Kingdom of Thailand.

ELEVENTH IRRIGATION PROJECT
Disbursement for Force Account Construction
1.        RID's internal cost control system is basically designed to
record expenditures incurred by its various functional divisions and is
primarily concerned with reconciling budget allocation and actual cost
expenditures. Although project specific accounts accurately record the
disbursement of loan proceeds for equipment, materials and consulting
services, difficulties are encountered in obtaining accurate cost data for
specific project works carried out by force account.
2.        Force account work for the proposed project would include con-
struction of drains, rehabilitation of existing canals, and on-farm devel-
opment (about 25% of the total area of 81,000 ha). No disbursement would
be made for drain construction or canal rehabilitation because of the
difficulties of maintaining accurate cost records for widely scattered
construction operations. Disbursement for on-farm development would be at
50% of an agreed fixed price per hectare. Estimates based on similar work
in the ongoing Bank projects and confirmed by current contract prices
indicate costs for on-farm development, exclusive of equipment deprecia-
tion of US$540/ha for Meklong and US$280/ha for Pattani. Disbursement
would therefore be US$270/ha for Meklong and US$140/ha for Pattani. In
the second and fourth years of this project, RID would maintain detailed
accounts for areas of about 500 ha in each project to check the above
agreed prices and in consultation with the Bank the prices would be
revised if necessary. Documentation to support disbursement requests would
identify the location of the completed blocks and their areas. Experience
has shown, that on Bank-financed projects, RID maintains accounts and
reliable records on the status of on-farm development works and these can be
readily verified by Bank supervision missions during field inspections.
