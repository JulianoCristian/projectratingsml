Works will\n            include the construction or improvement of main, lateral,\n            and tertiary canals and drains and construction of adjacent\n            farm roads. In addition, the project will provide\n            construction equipment, operation and maintenance equipment,\n            buildings, and consultancy services to assist in the design\n            and implementation of project works and detailed engineering\n            for an additional 30,000 ha of the Pattani irrigation\n            development. The project will directly benefit some 30,400\n            farm families, about 45% of whom have present incomes below\n            the absolute poverty line. By utilizing an assured water\n            supply from existing as well as planned hydroelectric\n            schemes, the project will, at full development in 1990,\n            almost double the yields in the project area where rainfed\n            rice is the predominant crop.
