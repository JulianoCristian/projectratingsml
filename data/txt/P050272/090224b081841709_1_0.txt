                         This is the last ISR being filed for the Ethiopia Private Sector Development Capacity Building Project (PSDCBP) that has a closing date of 31 December 2012. The PSDCB Project in
                         the amount of US$ 24 million (Credit: SDR 12.7 Million equivalent US$19 million, Grant: SDR 3.4 million equivalent US$5 million) was approved on December 21, 2004, with the
                         financing agreement signed on March 10, 2005. The Project became effective on July 15, 2005.

                         RELEVANCE: In January 2008, at the request of the Government, the Project was restructured (level one) and project closing date extended. The main impetus was to make the
                         development objective more aligned to the Government's changing policies that placed emphasis on export development and institution building capacity. In November 2008, the
                         original project funds (US$24Million) were reduced to US$17 million, with US$7 million reallocated to an emergency Global Food Crisis Response Project that was prepared to help
                         with the mitigation effort in aid of the Global food crisis. Despite the anticipated reduced activities due to the almost one-third reduction of the total project funds, the results framework
                         was not re-visited. An attempt was made to streamline the results framework in May 2011 as part of the Additional financing operation that did not reach Board approval stage due to
                         failure to reach inconclusive Negotiation. In June 27, 2012, a second 5 months' closing date extension of the project was approved, as part of a level 2 restructuring. The
                         restructuring and closing date extension was expected to help the Project fully utilize the remaining funds, that included close to US$1 million unforeseen foreign exchange savings
                         due to exchange rate fluctuations. The team used this restructuring opportunity to streamline the overdue realignment of the PDO indicators and intermediate result indicators. The
                         changes were undertaken to ensure the continuous relevance of the Project to the Government of Ethiopia’s Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP, 2010/11-2014/15) that
                         emphasizes the leading role of manufacturing industry in the overall growth of the economy, and job creation. Progress toward outcomes was captured through increased exports and
                         new jobs indicators. Equally importantly, the restructured project maintained its relevance to the new Ethiopia Country Partnership Strategy for Ethiopia that was approved on 25
                         September, 2012. A key pillar of the new Ethiopia CPS (FY13-16) is to increase competitiveness and productivity, with the focus on increased competitiveness in the manufacturing
                         sector.

                         EFFICACY: Based on the October 2012 implementation support mission, the Project made satisfactory progress towards achieving the Project Development Objectives (PDO) of (i)
                         increase in number of private sector jobs created in the participating firms (component 3);(ii) increase in private sector investments as captured by increase in total value of PE assets
                         transferred to private sector ownership (component 1); and (iii) increase in value of exports in participating firms in the ECF matching grants program (component 3). In all three
                         cases the targets were overachieved. According to the agreed upon results framework, the increase in private sector jobs was targeted to be at least 10% from the baseline; however
                         the actual increase was registered at 39%. Privatization and Public and Private Enterprises Supervising Agency (PPESA) targeted to privatize 55% of the asset values of the 55
                         SOEs slated for privatization in the PAD. To date, in terms of asset values, the privatized entities account for over 71% of the total asset value of the 55 SOEs. Lastly the increase in
                         value of exports was targeted to be at least 25%; while the actual increase was registered at 29%. It may be noted that progress under component 2 did not fare as well. As this was
                         a small component, it did not have a major impact on the overall performance of the project. Moreover, as part of the second restructuring, funds were reallocated from this slow
                         moving component two (Business environment) to the well-performing component 3 (Strengthening international competitiveness of the private sector) to maximize impact.

                         EFFICIENCY: The team commissioned a retrospective impact evaluation (IE) for the ECF component - representing the largest part - in the Project. Based on the findings of the IE
                         study (DFID-Covey International, April 2012) the efficiency of the Project (from 2008- February 2012) was assessed. According to this study, the gross annual turnover impact of ECF
                         is estimated at $35.4 million. This translates into a positive net present value (NPV) of $29.5 million and a benefit to cost ratio of 6.04. The NPV for the ECF not only far exceeds the
                         NPV projection for the ECF component (i.e. US$9.3 million) but also for the overall project that stood at US$22.6 million that was presented in the original PAD.

                         PROJECT-END DISBURSEMENT RATE TO BE REVISITED: The current disbursement rate - around 94 percent of the total project funds - is expected to be revised downward by
                         the time the Project closes. This is primarily due to a refund of close to USD 2 million that is expected back in the designated account against a withdrawal application made towards

                         Voluntary Retrenchment Program (VRP) payments (component 1). The history to this was that Public Servants Social Security Agency (PSSSA) requests PPESA based on detail
                         listings and calculations for payments to employees to be retrenched. The PPESA requests the projects PCU for the same amount and the PCU transfers funds to the PPESA for the
                         amount requested and requests WA for the same amounts for fund replenishment. Thus the funds were transferred from PCU to PPESA and PPESA will then transfer the same
                         amounts as requested to PSSA. Now, when it comes to actual payments the PSSA determines payment to employees a different amount based on a different calculation and started
                         paying the retrenched employees. The reason for this is programmatic in nature . This has resulted in an overall lesser amount of payments. Thus this saving (or what is referred to
                         over payment to PPESA) amounting close to USD 2 million was later on refunded back to PPESA by PSSA. This amount was also reflected in the period ended July 7 2011 VRP
                         audit report. Bank notified the Project team to refund this back to the Designated account for eventual refund back to the Bank. Thus, this resulted also in an adjustment in the
                         records of the project.The refund to the designated account is currently proceeding. Given that the Project is closing on 31 Dec. 2012, at this late stage, we do not envisage this
                         money being utilized.

                         With regard to the Financial Management, the FM rating has been downgraded during this period from satisfactory to moderately satisfactory (MS). But the FM risk rating remains the
                         same as M (moderate). The main reason being the fact that a refund of close to USD 2 million will be made as a result of money left over from VRP payments. The financial audit and
                         VRP audit of the year ended July 7, 2012 is progressing well and the deadline for submission of the report is January 7, 2013. The project’s last audit covering the period 10 months
                         from July 8 2012 up to the disbursement deadline date (April 30 2013) is due 6 months after the closing date (i.e. it should be submitted to the Bank by latest date of June 30 2013).

                         PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT:
                         All the planned procurement activities have been completed. The PCU has been exerting all the efforts for the successful implementation of the planned procurement activities;
                         however, there have been some challenges at the PCU in efficiently coordinating and supervising the procurement activities and contract implementation of all other implementing
                         Agencies (IAs) as the PCU is was not adequately staffed to supervise the activities of all the other IAs. The Findings of the last Post Procurement Review (PPR) report shows that
                         there were procedural gaps associated with procurement capacity limitations in the IAs and there is still were weakness in institutionalizing good practices of public procurement
                         management and performance. The lesson learnt is that there should have been a qualified and dedicated Procurement and contract expert in PCU, who could coordinate and
                         assure the quality of procurement and contract administration by the other entire participating project implementing Agencies (AAU, ECF, PPESA and MoTI). The Bank team would
                         like to comment that the Borrower needs to institutionalize the good practices of public procurement not only for the implementation of Bank financed project but also for all its
                         permanent operations and sustain the capacity gained during this project implementation. In this context, the Bank needs to provide regular procurement training to Govt. team. The
                         overall procurement performance of the Project (PSDCBP) may be rated as MS.
