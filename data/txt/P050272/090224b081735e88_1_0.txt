                         The ISR is being filed to document the closing date extension - including level 2 restructuring - of the project by 5 months that was approved on June 27, 2012. This is the second
                         and last extension of the project. The original closing date was July 31, 2011 which was extended by one year to the current date of July 31, 2012 making the cumulative extension
                         period 17 months. The Private Sector Development Capacity Building Project in the amount of (Credit: SDR 12.7 Million equivalent US$19 million, Grant: US$ SDR 3.4 million
                         equivalent 5 million) was approved on December 21, 2004, the financing agreement was signed on March 10, 2005 and it became effective on July 15, 2005. In January 2008, the

                         project was restructured at the request of the Government to make it more aligned to its changing policies that placed a greater emphasis on export development and institution
                         building capacity. Further, the original project funds (US$24Million) were reduced to US$17 million in November 2008 , as US$7 million were reallocated to an emergency operation
                         to help with the mitigation effort in aid of the Global food crisis. Given the anticipated reduced activities due to the almost one-third reduction of the total project funds, an attempt was
                         made to streamline the results framework in May 2011 as part of the Additional financing operation that was unable to reach conclusive Negotiation.

                         The team thus used this restructuring opportunity to streamline the overdue realignment of the PDO indicators and intermediate result indicators. The changes were undertaken to
                         ensure the continuous relevance of the Project to the Government of Ethiopia’s Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP, 2010/11-2014/15) that emphasizes the leading role of
                         manufacturing industry in the overall growth of the economy, and job creation. Progress towards outcomes is expected to be captured through increased exports and new jobs.
                         Equally important, the restructured project maintains its relevance to the new Ethiopia Country Partnership Strategy for Ethiopia that was approved on 25 September, 2012. A key
                         pillar of the new Ethiopia CPS (FY13-16) is to increase competitiveness and productivity, with the focus on increased competitiveness in the manufacturing sector.

                         Based on the monthly implementation review discussions with the client, the team finds the project implementation to be satisfactory, with steady progress being made towards
                         achieving Project Development Objectives (PDO) of (i) increased private sector investments as captured by increase in total value of PE assets transferred to private sector
                         ownership (component one); and increase in value of exports in participating firms in the ECF matching grants program (component 3). In both cases the targets were overshot.
                         Component 2, however continued to lag and was thus downgraded. As this was a small component, it did not have any major impact on the overall performance of the project. As
                         part of the restructuring, funds were reallocated from the slow moving component two (Business environment) to the well-performing component 3 (Strengthening international
                         competitiveness of the private sector). The proposed restructuring and closing date extension would enable the project to fully disburse the allocated funding for the project and allow
                         the project the come closer to achieving its development objectives. These changes were made to help utilize the unforeseen foreign exchange savings of close to US$1 million due
                         to exchange rate fluctuations.

                         Disbursement: To date, 94 percent of the total project funds have been disbursed. It is expected that with the extension of closing date, the remaining funds would be fully utilized.
                         The team undertakes a monthly review of the project implementation, and understands that the ECF disbursement targets remain on track.

                         Fiduciary aspects: With regard to procurement management, the performance has improved since the last ISR period. The PCU has made a concerted effort to bring to closure two
                         outstanding consultant contracts in line with the contract provisions. The procurement rating is accordingly been upgraded.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         This ISR is being filed to document the restructuring of the Project that was approved on 27th June 2012. The restructuring includes the following changes: (i) extension of the closing
                         date by 5 months to December 31, 2012; (ii) a reallocation of the available IDA credit among project components and existing categories; and (iii) revised PDO indicators and
                         intermediate result indicators to streamline the number of indicators.
