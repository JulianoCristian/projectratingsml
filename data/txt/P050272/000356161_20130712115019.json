Some lessons learned includes: one\n            of the takeaway lessons from this project is to provide\n            timely advice to the Government to restructure projects to\n            keep its relevance to emerging priorities as well as for\n            efficient utilization of resources within the project\n            period. To ensure compliance with Bank fiduciary\n            requirements, continuous training and capacity building on\n            financial management, procurement and contracts management\n            should be provided to implementing agencies to ensure\n            Bank's policies are adhered to.

The Bank team should be\n            proactive in addressing unforeseen events such as\n            reallocation of project proceeds to emergency situations and\n            ensuring compliance by project implementing units with\n            fiduciary requirements."}, "docdt": "2013-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
