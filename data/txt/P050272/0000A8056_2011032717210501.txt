                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Building on the concrete achievements to-date under the existing operation, and the activities highlighted with potential financing gap at the time of the MTR mission, it was agreed
                         that a US$15 m Additional Finance Operation would be prepared. The proposed AF would broadly support (i) the estimated shortfall in the Ethiopian Competitiveness Facility (ECF)
                         administering the matching grant scheme (MGS) for exporting enterprises; (ii) expansion of the ECF to "pilot" support to light manufacturing industries, through both matching grants
                         and technical assistance (TA) for sectoral and cross-cutting issues; the TA while administered through the ECF unit, would be coordinated through the recently established Ethiopian
                         Public-Private Dialogue Forum (EPPDF); (iii) technical assistance for development of a Special Economic Zone framework and strategy for Ethiopia; (v) the financing gap for the
                         privatization program; and (iv) strengthening of the existing Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and ECF unit for successful implementation of the AF operation.
