                         Implementation Progress: With the project's closing date of July 31, 2012, the Bank team has continued to support the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) and the implementing
                         agencies (IAs) to help meet project objectives and proactively address any issues where course correction may be needed. Progress on actions agreed during the January 2011
                         Mission were reviewed. Since the January-February 2011 Mission, the Project has made significant progress towards achieving its Development Objective (PDO) and end-project
                         outcome targets. Of the three components, #Accelerating Implementation of Privatization Program#, and #Strengthening International Competitiveness of the Private Sector and the

                         Capacity of its Representative Organizations#, continued to make good progress towards end project targets. The third and the smallest component, #Improving Business
                         Environment through Implementation of Competition Policy and Accession to WTO#, made limited progress and is expected to partially achieve its outcome indicators.

                         Disbursements: To date, the Project has disbursed US$13 million of the US$17 million accounting for 77 percent of the total project allocation. There has been an impressive
                         increase in the disbursements from the matching grants component (ECF) - disbursements have almost doubled since the last mission. This can be attributed due to the
                         implementation and completion of the benchmarking activities that comprise the bulk of the disbursed amount for this component. The privatization component has made solid strides
                         in terms of both the disbursement record and the progress towards component outcomes.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Team reported the overall good progress with regard to two out of the three Project components. With the Project's closing date of July 31, 2012, there is a need for continued
                         oversight support to ensure that the Project meets its outcomes, and proactively address any issues where course correction may be needed.
