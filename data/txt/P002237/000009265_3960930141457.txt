MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR :4.5 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA
FOR A FIRST POPULATION PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit to the
Republic of Rwanda, for SDR 14.5 million (US$19.6 million) is submitted for
approval. The proposed credit, which would be on standard IDA terms with 40
years, maturity, would help support the implementation of the National
Population Policy.
2.    Background.   With a population estimated at 7.3 million in 1989, a
population density of 279 people per square kilometer (the highest in Africa)
and a total fertility rate of 8.5 children per woman (also the highest in
Africa), Rwanda's overwhelmingly rural economy faces a major population
pressure. Almost 102 of farms are already too small to be sustainable and this
percentage is rapidly increasing. If the current annual population growth rate
remains constant (3.6Z), the total population will double in 20 years, putting
an unbearable burden on all sectors of the economy, the social infrastructure
and the environment. The prevalence of the AIDS epidemic (24S of adults in
reproductive age in urban areas are seropositive) raises the important question
of the demographic impact of this epidemic. However, recent studies conducted
in Sub-Saharan Africa indicate that population growth rates, though reduced by
the AIDS epidemic, will remain strongly positive.   As early as 1966, the
Government had expressed increasing concern about rapid population growth. At
first, effort  were mostly concentrated on the improvement of the nation's
economic produc_Lvity, but in the second economic plan (1977-81) the emphasis
was shifted from analysis to strategies aimed at reducing the population
growth.   In 1981, the Government created the Rwandese Population Office
(ONAPO), whose mandate was to collect population data, propose population
policies and develop Information Education and Communication programs tIEC) in
Family Planning (FP).   Following a long internal debate, the Government
eventually issued a National Population Policy in June 1990. This policy is
fully supported by the President of the Republic who, in his 1989 annual
address, advocated a family of 4 children by year 2000. The major objective
of the population policy is to reduce the population growth rate from the
current level of 3.6 percent to 2.0 percent by yea- 2000.
3.    Sectoral issues and strategy.  For the past years, the Government has
adopted a two-pronged strategy: the promotion of demand for PP services through
ONAPO's activities, and the increased supply of FP services under the Ministry
of Health (MOH)'s responsibility. While the IEC program implemented by ONAPO
has generated a certain level of demand for PP services, MOH has had many
difficulties in expanding these services nationwide. The main constraints are:
(a) the poor quality of PP services offered in health centers, mainly due to
insufficient training and supervision of health workers, and inadequate
contraceptive supplies ;   (b) the limited access to modern PP services of
approximately 602 of the population; and (c) the insufficient level of demand
for FP services, given the urgency of curbing the population growth rate.
4.    Rationale for IDA's involvement.   The proposed operation addresses
Rwanda"s main development constraint and constitutes a cornerstone for IDA's



-2-
lending strategy. in the absence of a reduction in the population growth rate,
ongoing adjustments efforts are unlikely to be effective in reestablishing a
sustainable growth. The project is fully consistent with the Bank's special
programs of emphasis on women-in-development and population. IDA's support has
been requested by the Government, which is now well aware of the serious
environmental and social degradation in the country brought about by
uncontrolled population growth, and of the positive conclusions of a
cost/benefit analysis of the national family planning program carried out by
ONAPO.  The limited institutional capabilities of MOH to provide the necessary
improvements to FP service delivery have led the Government to develop, with
Bank's assistance, a more forceful approach to address Rwanda's population
problems. In this new approach. IDA would support ONAPO's leading role in
implementing the national population policy and assisting MOH's efforts to
expand access to and use of FP services. IDA's resources will be used in close
coordination with other donors, in order to avoid any duplication of efforts.
5.    Proiect obiectives.  The project objectives are to contribute tot (a)
the reduction of the total fertility rate from 8.5 to about 7.2 by 1997; (b)
a decrease in maternal and child mortality and morbidity; and tc) the
integration of the demographic dimension in the overall socio-economic planning
process. The proposed operation would complement other donors contributions
to population and PP activities. The project is conceived as a comprehensive
support to the implementation of the national population policy, with a special
emphasis on improving the access to and quality of PP services.
6.    Proiect descriDtion.  Part A - Improvina the ouality and efficiency of
PP services delivered by MOB facilitles   - will consist in: (a) training
approximately 1100 MOU paramedical ageuts in contraceptive technology and
counselling, provision of PP services, and management of contraceptive
supplies; (b) providing medical equipment, furniture and contraceptives to
health centers, including NGOs facilities; and (c) strengthening the
monitoring, supervision and evaluation of PP services. Part 3 - E=Wansion and
promotion of PP services beyond the health center network - will increase
access to PP services and will stimulate the demand for these services by Ca)
developing an outreach strategy beyond the health center level; and (b)
providing support to specific IEC activities.   This will requiret (a) the
establishment and the strengthening of PP posts which, operated as an integral
part of the Health Center (RC) network, would constitute the most efficient way
of increasing the PP coverage of the population; (b) the use of about 17,500
community volunteers for stimulating the demand for FP services, referring
potential clLents to PP posts and health centers, and supplying current users
with contraceptives; (c) the redesign of certain aspects of the national IEC
program, vith a view of targeting specific ZEC activities towards neglected
population groups (such as males, young adults, women with high parity); (d)
the retraining of 1600 social workers in FP counselling; and (e) the promotion
of PP within women's groups at the communal level.   Part C - Suinortina
pooulation studies and gromoting multisectoral activities - will consist ins
(a) carrying out studies and surveys aimed at consolidating ONAPO's database
in order to improve its input in the implementation of the population policy,
including (i) migration flows; (ii) post census studies on maternal mortality;
and (iii) monitoring the impact of the PP program through periodic analysis of



-3
FP service statisticss and (b) coordinating specific multisectoral activities
with other ministries and institutions involved in the implementation of the
population policy.
7.    The  total  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  US$26.1 million
equivalent, of which US$14.4 million would be in foreign exchange. Schedule
A contains the project cost susmary and financing plan, Schedule B the amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements, as well as a disbursement
schedule. A timetable of key project processing events is given in Schedule
C.  A map showing the locations of the PP posts is attached.   The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 9233-RW, dated May 15, 1991, is being distributed
separately.
8.    Agreed actions.  During negotiations, the following actions were agreed
with the Government as conditions of credit effectivenesss (a) the recruitment
of a full-time local project coordinator, a long-term technical advisor and key
project local staff; (b) the submission of a master training plan which will
incorporate comments already made by IDA on the subject: and (c) the initial
deposit of funds in the project account representing the Government's
contribution to cover three months of local expenditures.
S.    Other agreements includes (a) the submission by ONAPO of a quarterly
report on the status of project implementation and related expenditures:
(b) the submission by ONAPO of a detailed annual work program, plans of action
and budget for the following year by December 31 in each years (c) the review
of curricula for the family planning training of health personnel; (d) a
comprehensive mid-term evaluation to be carried out in 1994 to assess progress
made and make necessary changes; (e) the organization of annual meetings of
donors to review the implementation of the population policy: and Cf) the
application of the collaboration mechanisms agreed upon between ONAPO and MOH
at the central and regional levels for the implementation of VP related
activities.
9.    Benefits.  The project is expected to generate both individual and
macroeconomic benefits. Birth spacing will reduce maternal and child morbidity
and mortality. In the longer term, the reduction In fertility levels, which
will ultimately translate into declines in the rate of population growth, will
have benefits at the national level, by alleviating population pressures on
scarce land resources, fostering food security, generating cost savings in
economic and social services and improving prospects for entrants into the
labor market.
10.   lisks.  The first risk is that ONAPO's managerial capabilities could be
overstretched by this operation.   ONAPO's past performance,  in term  of
financial and administrative management of other donor projects, has been
uneven.   To address  this risk,  a project administration unit will be
established before credit effectiveness to assist ONAPO's management in all
administrative, procurement and disbursement matters. In addition, a long term
technical advisor will be responsible for train'ng key local staff in program
planning, management and monitoring. The second risk is that coordination
between ONAPO and MON would not be close enough, with the consequence of
inefficiencies  in  project  implementation.    To  address  this  risk,  the



-4-
implementation of mechanisms agreed upon during project preparation, aimed at
strengthening the collaboration between ONAPO and MOH has been included in the
credit  agreement.    In  addition,  many  managerial  decisions  have  been
decentralized to the regional level where KOS and ONAPO staff have already
developed, at least in certain regions, a good working relationship. Finally,
a third risk relates to the capacity of Rwanda to find appropriate solutions
to the lingering problems of Rwandese refugees in neighboring countries.
Reinsertion of these refugees in Rwanda requires careful planning and a major
support from the international communAty.
11.   Recommendatlon.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
