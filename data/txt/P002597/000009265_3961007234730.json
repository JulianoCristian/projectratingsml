Research, Extension and\n            Training Project (ARETP) in Sudan. The Agricultural\n            Research, Extension and Training Project (ARETP) was well\n            conceived and its objectives were attainable within the\n            country context; it focused on the \"core\"\n            activities necessary to: (a) consolidate the achievements of\n            previous Bank interventions; and (b) encourage the\n            development potential of Sudan's agriculture sector.\n            ARETP, thus, aimed to improve the performance of the\n            irrigated subsector through the introduction of improved and\n            sustainable management practices, supported by strengthened\n            and reorganized research and extension services, and\n            comprehensive training at all staff levels. The importance\n            of strengthening the technological base to provide relevant\n            extension messages aimed at achieving immediate results and\n            benefits was stressed. The key findings and lessons of ARETP\n            were as follows: (i)short overseas visits to successful\n            research/ extension projects helped develop managerial\n            commitment to the T&V approach, and may have been more\n            beneficial than formal training in methodologies; (ii) a\n            notable achievement of ARETP was the significant level of\n            effective collaboration with several IARCS; (iii) the\n            project's extension component, was established\n            gradually, on the basis of the delivery capacity of the\n            extension service. Only those fieldinspectors who\n            demonstrated a commitment to the system were transferred to\n            the extension service.Additionally, the extension system was\n            designed to be flexible. Messages were transmitted only\n            whentheir technical content had been fully tested; thus,\n            effective research/extension linkage was developed.\n            Extension was successfully carried out through informal\n            farmer groups, which promoted a wider sense of ownership and\n            acceptability; (iv) another notable achievement, relates to\n            the attempts at cOst recovery/sharing by project\n            beneficiaries (APCs and farmers), at New Halfa and Rahad;\n            (v) the prolilnms arising in ARETP's implementation\n            should have been analyzed and prompt corrective action\n            wakento address these issues; and (vi) in retrospect, a\n            general but crucial lesson relates to the combinled impact\n            of Bank-assisted agricultural research projects, focusing on\n            the irrigated sub-sector."}, "docdt": "1995-02-05T00:00:00Z"}
