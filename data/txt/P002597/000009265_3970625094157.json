training. Over a 6-year period,\n            the project will strengthen the technological base required\n            for higher production, reform the subsector extension\n            system, and upgrade the skills of field personnel.  The\n            project will (a) rehabilitate and strengthen agricultural\n            research at five regional stations in the irrigation areas;\n            (b) upgrade the skills of field inspectors and establish\n            programmed extension services at New Halfa and Rahad\n            Corporations; (c) strengthen the National Extension\n            Administration; and (d) strengthen the in-service training\n            capabilities of the University of Gezira."}, "docdt": "1985-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
