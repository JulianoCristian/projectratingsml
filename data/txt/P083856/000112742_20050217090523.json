support to the Government\n            of Ecuador's (GOE's) multi-year program of reforms\n            in a single tranche operation. The medium-term objectives of\n            the project are consolidating the Non-Financial Public\n            Sector (NFPS) fiscal position, reducing the country's\n            debt, upgrading creditworthiness, improving competitiveness,\n            and enabling high growth for poverty reduction.  Specific\n            objectives are to: (a) support a non-discretionary fiscal\n            policy and improve tax administration; (b) reverse\n            expansionary spending and improve budget transparency; (c)\n            strengthen control of the public payroll; (d) improve public\n            debt management and promote a simple and transparent\n            management of the oil revenue fund FEIREP; (e) support trade\n            reform; (f) promote competitive pricing and regulatory\n            policies; and (g) increase labor flexibility.  The project\n            will concentrate on fiscal consolidation and faster growth\n            with competitiveness, deepening the progress achieved in the\n            first FCCGL."}, "docdt": "2005-02-14T00:00:00Z"}
