This is a Project Completion Note for the Second Fiscal Consolidation and Competitive Growth
Loan to Ecuador (FCCGL II). The Loan was approved by the Board on March 10, 2005, but was
not signed prior to the Closing Date contemplated in the operation's Legal Agreement (Article II,
Section 2.03). This date was December 31, 2005. As a result the World Bank proceeded to cancel
the operation and to notify the Government of Ecuador of such cancellation on March 15, 20061.

This note briefly discusses the background and content of the FCCGL II, as well as the reasons
leading to its cancellation. The note is structured as follows:

    1. Background
    2. Description of economic reforms under the Palacio's administration
    3. Impact of economic reforms and risks
    4. World Bank strategy

1. Background

The US$100 million FCCGL II was approved by the Board on March 10, 2005. The program, as
described in the Project Document, focused on (i) fiscal consolidation with debt sustainability,
and (ii) higher economic growth with improved competitiveness and enhanced markets
flexibility. Specific objectives were to: (i) support a non-discretionary fiscal policy and improve
tax administration; (ii) reverse expansionary spending and improve budget transparency; (iii)
strengthen control of the public payroll; (iv) improve public debt management and promote a
simple and transparent management of the oil revenue fund FEIREP; (v) support trade reform;
(vi) promote competitive pricing and regulatory policies; and (vii) increase labor market
flexibility.

Early in April 2005, Alfredo Palacio replaced Lucio Gutierrez as the President of Ecuador
following significant social unrest. Shortly after taking office the Palacio's administration
proceeded to implement a series of economic reforms including changes in the Fiscal
Responsibility and Transparency Law (FRTL) and the FEIREP. These changes partially
dismantled the institutional structure supported by the FCCGL series and which had been put in
place by the previous administration to ensure fiscal discipline.

A brief description of these reforms is provided below, together with a discussion on their impact,
both on Ecuador's overall macroeconomic performance and on the fiscal and economic program
supported by the FCCL II.

2. Brief description of economic reforms under the Palacio's administration

Reforms to the Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law (FRTL) and the FEIREP

The FRTL was approved by Congress in 2002 with the objective of promoting prudent fiscal
management and debt sustainability. Two features of the new law were particularly important for
this purpose: (i) the introduction of a legal limit to the growth of real primary expenditures, which
was set at 3.5 percent, and (ii) the creation of the Oil Stabilization Fund-FEIREP.

The FEIREP was to be financed using public revenue from oil exports, and the resources
accumulated in the fund were earmarked as follows: (i) debt repurchases at market prices or

reduction of central government (CG) debt with the Ecuadorian Social Security Institute (IESS),
70 percent; (ii) transfers to the Economic Stabilization Fund, 20 percent up to 2.5 percent of
GDP; and (iii) promotion of human development through the Ministries of Health and Education,
10 percent.

During the 19 months it was operational the FEIREP accumulated a total of US$1,070.4 mn, of
which US$688.2 million were allocated to different uses leaving a positive balance of US$382.2
mn (Table 1).

The main changes to the FRTL approved by Congress in June 2005 included:

1. An increase in the growth ceiling for real capital expenditures from 3.5 to 5.0 percent,
    combined with the elimination of any growth ceiling for capital expenditures on
    infrastructure projects, equipment, and financial investments considered to increase the
    government net worth;
2. The substitution of the FEIREP with an account operated by the Ministry of Finance (MEF),
    CEREPS, together with a change in the allocation rules for resources in this account. These
    rules estipulate that 40 percent of the CEREPS is to be devoted to productive investment (i.e.
    credit to agricultural producers and micro and small enterprises), service of the CG debt with
    IESS, and debt repurchases; 30 percent is to be devoted to social investments (15 percent in
    the education sector and 15 percent in the health sector); 20 percent, up to 2.5 percent of
    GDP, is to be devoted to economic stabilization through the FEP; and the remaining 10
    percent is devoted to R&D;
3. The reclassification of oil revenues as current revenues for budgetary purposes.

Other reforms

Congress has also passed significant reforms in the areas of Social Security funding and taxation
during the last few months and is currently considering approval of a new legislative package for
the banking sector. A law instructing IESS to return the funds accumulated in individuals
accounts (fondos de reserva) to its affiliates led to disbursements by this institution for a total
US$365 mn during 2005. An additional US$370 mn is expected to be disbursed this year. The
law also stipulates that in the future employees will be reimbursed for their contributions to
individuals accounts every three years. In addition Congress approved a new law that grants
generous tax exemptions for investments in various sectors, ranging from agriculture to electricity
generation. Finally a proposal to regulate the cost and allocation of credit by private banks is
currently under discussion.

3. Implications of reforms and risks

Fiscal framework and debt sustainability

The reforms described above have weakened Ecuador's framework for fiscal policy in a number
of ways. Changes in the FRTL and the FEIREP make it harder for the Government to control
overall expenditure growth, while increasing its dependency on oil revenues to finance current
expenditure and undermining its saving capacity. Although the authorities are attempting to
restrain recurrent spending in their 2006 fiscal program to make room for larger capital and social
spending while maintaining an overall primary surplus of at least 4.7 percent of GDP, this goal
may prove hard to obtain as pressures to increase expenditures increase due to the upcoming
elections. The NFPS non-oil deficit, which remained below 3 percent of GDP in past years, is
projected to increase to 5 percent, driven by the growing cost of fuel (combined with fixed
domestic prices) and the continued rapid expansion of current expenditures. The central
Government (CG) non-oil balance is also expected to deteriorate significantly in 2005/6 (Table
2).

Note: Ecuador oil prices are assumed to be US$23.7 per barrel in 2006.

The ability of the Ministry of Finance to significantly reduce the stock of public debt has
diminished as the percentage of funds allocated to debt repurchases has dropped from 70 percent
under FEIREP to, at most, 40 percent under CEREPS2. Under current oil price projections,
however, the authorities program is consistent with an increase in the NFPS surplus to 2.2 percent
of GDP and a decline in public debt to 40 percent of GDP by end of 2006 (Table 2).

In addition changes in IESS financing and in tax policy are expected to have both short and
medium-term impacts on fiscal management. The devolution of the fondos de reserva to IESS


2According to projections by the Ministry of Finance, the CEREPS will accumulate US$526.7 mn, of
which at most US$184.3 mn can be used for debt repurchases. This amount is less than 50 percent what
would have been allocated to this end under the FEIREP, namely US$368.7 mn.

affiliates has forced the Central Government to rely more aggressively on more expensive
domestic debt to manage short-term liquidity constraints in the Treasury account. Similarly the
introduction of significant tax exemptions will erode the country's tax base, which the Servicio
Interno de Rentas, the tax collection agency, has worked so hard to expand in recent years.

Finally there has been little progress over the last few months in the implementation of structural
reforms needed to address economic vulnerabilities, despite favorable external conditions.
Consequently, the medium term macroeconomic projections remain vulnerable to external and
internal conditions, including policy changes. The Ecuadorian authorities have a unique
opportunity to implement long-due reforms in the fiscal, financial and oil sectors, taking
advantage of the favorable external conditions which currently prevail. But there is a risk that
unsteady domestic policy, linked to the political pressures from upcoming elections, may hamper
progress. The most important risks are those of increased spending pressures, a potential decline
in oil prices and the possibility of misguided reforms to bank sector regulations.

Implications for FCCGL II disbursement

Both the FRTL and the FEIREP were key elements of the FCCGL II. The approved changes
represent a policy reversal with respect to the program supported under the operation. In
particular the changes directly contradicted action 5 in Schedule 3 as follows:

         Action 5: The borrower is implementing its debt reduction plan including the allocation
         of 70 percent (70%) of the funds accumulated as of September, 2004 in the FEIREP
         (legally established as a trust fund with the BCE) to implementation of such plan, and the
         dissemination of FEIREP's operations on MEF website [...]. The approved changes to
         the FEIREP terminated its existence as a trust fund and reduced the percentage of
         resources that can be allocated to debt reduction from 70 to, at most, 40 percent of total
         FEIREP revenues.

More broadly changes to the FTRL are in contradiction with the macroeconomic scenario
underpinning the FCCG II program, in particular in what regards the fiscal sustainability
component. In this respect the changes in the FEIREP, even if implemented alone, would have
already raised doubts as to the government's capacity to implement countercyclical economic
policy and sustain its debt reduction plan; but when paired with the elimination of the 3.5 percent
real growth limit for capital expenditures, they pose a real threat to medium-term fiscal discipline
for the reasons outlined above.

Under Article IV in the Loan Agreement, the two events described above (policy reversal and
inconsistency with overall macroeconomic framework) constitute sufficient reasons for the World
Bank to suspend the operation. Rather than proceeding directly to cancel the loan, however, the
World Bank agreed with the Government of Ecuador (GoE) on a technical strategy aimed at
discussing the overall compatibility of the government `s program with the objective of the FCCL
series. This strategy and its implementation is described in the next section.

4. World Bank proposed strategy

Following the approval by Congress of the changes to the FTRL and the (partial) devolution of
the IESS funds, the World Bank (WB) sent an official communication to the Minister of Finance
in Ecuador on August 25, 2005 (Annex 1). By means of this letter the WB informed the GoE of
the decision to delay the signing of the loan in light of recent policy developments, and invited



                                                  4

the government to argue that such development were compatible with the program supported by
the FCCG series, if it so desired, by preparing a new Letter of Development Policy.

In response to this letter a delegation of GoE representatives visited Washington, DC in October,
2005 with the objective of discussing the government's fiscal and economic program with the
country team. A one-day work session was organized for this purpose, during which the
Ecuadorian authorities presented their budgetary proposal and structural reform plan for 2006.
Fiscal projections for 2006 correspond to the figures presented in Table 2, and hence exhibited
the vulnerabilities already discussed above, while the structural reform plan appeared to be very
ambitious and, most likely, difficult to implement during an election year.

Given this it was agreed that the WB and the GoE would explore the possibility of identifying
potential compensatory measures. These measures should respond to the principles
underpinning the program supported by the loan; namely (i) strengthening the Central
Government (CG) and the Non-Financial Public Sector's (NFPS) fiscal stance (as measured by
the overall primary balance), (ii) diminishing fiscal dependency of oil revenues (as measured by
the non-oil balance), and (iii) reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio.

To achieve these goals the WB suggested that the GoE focus on measures aiming to reduce
expenditures because they appear to be relatively more actionable and easier to monitor and
evaluate in the time horizon under consideration--notwithstanding the WB's willingness to
consider alternative measures of equivalent magnitude and spirit. One such measure could be the
reinstatement of the discipline and control over total primary expenditure growth that existed
under the previous versions of the LTRF--i.e. by imposing a cap on overall primary expenditure
growth and not just current expenditure growth, e.g. 3.5% in real terms. Additional measures
could include the (partial) elimination of certain subsidies. In this respect three different subsidies
were considered and their potential impact quantified: (i) the elimination of the fuel subsidies, (ii)
the elimination of the electricity subsidy, and (iii) the elimination of the CG contribution to the
pension system. The elimination of all fuel subsidies (GLP and diesel) would have the highest
impact, followed by the complete elimination of the pension subsidy and, lastly, the complete
elimination of the electricity subsidy (Table 3).

The WB did not receive any further communication from the GoE regarding these proposals or
any other issue related to the FCCGL II after the October discussions. Consequently, once the
cancellation date of December 31, 2006 contemplated in the Loan Agreement elapsed, the WB
proceeded to notify the GoE of the institutions decision to cancel the FCCGL II and to drop the
FCCGL III from the WB's pipeline. This communication was issued on March 15, 2006 (Annex
2).
