Borrower:                          Republic of Ecuador.
Amount:                            This is a single-tranche operation of US$lOO million.
Terms:                             Fixed spread loan in US. dollars with seventeen years maturity,
                                   includinga five-year grace period with repayment dates of April 15 and
                                   October 15.
Commitment Fee:                    0.85 percent per annum on undisbursedloan amounts for the first 4 years
                                   and 0.75 percent thereafter.
Objectives and Description:        The proposed loan provides continued Bank support to the Government
                                   of Ecuador's (GOE's) multi-year program of reforms. The medium-term
                                   objectives of the FCCGL-I1 are consolidating the Non-Financial Public
                                   Sector (NFPS) fiscal position, reducing the country's debt, upgrading
                                   creditworthiness, improving competitiveness, and enabling high growth
                                   for poverty reduction.      The second phase is justified by reaching
                                   benchmarks and further actions agreed with the Bank in the first
                                   operation. The FCCGL-I1preserves two pillars of structural reform: (a)
                                   fiscal consolidation with debt sustainability, and (b) higher economic
                                   growth with improved competitiveness and enhancedmarkets flexibility.
                                   Specific objectives are to: (a) support a non-discretionary fiscal policy
                                   and improve tax administration; (b) reverse expansionary spending and
                                   improve budget transparency; (c) strengthen control of the public
                                   payroll; (d) improve public debt management and promote a simple and
                                   transparent management of the oil revenue fund FEIREP; (e) support
                                   trade reform; (0 promote competitive pricing and regulatory policies;
                                   and (8) increase labor flexibility. These objectives are complemented by
                                   a parallel programmatic operation for the social sectors and by an
                                   investment operation on institutionalreform.

Benefits:    The main benefit of the loan is to contribute to poverty reduction in
             Ecuador in two complementary ways. First, the reform program will
             maintain the fiscal accounts on a sustainable path and bringthe country's
             debt sustainability and creditworthiness to levels that should allow
             Ecuador to regain access to private creditors and international capital
             markets in 2005.       Most of the completed measures carry fiscal
             implications, which are estimated to have produced annual net fiscal
             savings o f about 1 percent o f GDP in 2004. Fiscal reforms will also
             strengthen countercyclical fiscal institutions and rules, improve tax
             collection, control the wage bill, implement an innovative civil service
             reform, strengthen budget and FEIREP management, and promote civil
             society's participation in the budget process. Fiscal discipline will also
             reduce country risk, which would induce a fall in domestic interest rates,
             have a lasting impact on economic recovery, and create additional fiscal
             space for financing poverty reduction programs. Second, the reform
             program will accelerate economic growth through structural changes
             aiming to increase productivity and deepen input and output markets,
             especially the labor market. The proposed measures will help lay the
             groundwork for Ecuador to take full advantage o f the benefits o f WTO
             commitments and a Free Trade Agreement with the United States.
             Specifically, the loan will contribute to trade liberalization and fighting
             corruption in Customs, and increasing private participation and
             investment in basic infrastructure (water, power, telecommunications,
             and oil) attracted by a more competitive framework, a more open
             economy, sound pricing and regulatory policies, and more flexible
             markets.


Risks:       There are five domestic and external risks associated with the program.
             First, political risk. The recent Supreme Court reshuffle in November
             2004 could raise uncertainty, threatening to break up the fragile coalition
             that supports President GutiCrrez in Congress. Moreover, the decision to
             have a referendum could strengthen the political opposition, thus
             increasing pressure on President GutiCrrez. Alliance parties may also
             request delays in policy reforms in exchange for support. To reduce this
             risk, the GOE is working to broaden an alliance with the opposition
             parties and deepen dialogue with members of Congress, political forces
             and indigenous organizations. Second, social unrest risk. The GOE's
             two years of fiscal restraint may have contributed to "adjustment fatigue"
             and political and social unrest could prevent the government from
             implementing some additional reforms. To reduce this risk, the GOE,
             with the support o f the Bank, i s implementing social programs to protect
             the poor and vulnerable and i s broadening dialogue with civil society
             regarding the budget and the free trade negotiations. The GOE has also
             approved small and selective salary and pension adjustments targeted at
             strategic groups. Lastly, support for government policies will solidify
             when reforms begin to bear fruit in terms o f higher growth and
             employment creation, increased fiscal space to finance social spending,
             and enhanced targeting and delivery o f basic public services. Third, &
             implementation capacity risk. This risk results from a continuous
             turnover o f public officials and poor training, which could affect the



                                  11

                          implementation of reform programs. To reduce this risk, the GOE, with
                          support from the Bank, i s combining several instruments, such as
                          technical and investment assistance, grants for building capacity,
                          increased supervision, joint missions with multilaterals, and analytical
                          and advisory activities and training.      Fourth, external shocks risk.
                          Dollarized regimes face external shocks differently than non-dollarized
                          regimes do. Given the absence o f monetary policy, the fiscal situation,
                          and no meaningful lender o f last resort for the banking sector, external
                          economic shocks-especially a severe decline in the price or volume of
                          oil-might     make a deflationary fiscal adjustment in Ecuador socially
                          unbearable, and put the fragile banking recovery and the dollarization
                          regime at risk. To reduce and mitigate this risk the GOE, supported by
                          the Bank, i s strengthening fiscal balances, promptly paying debt,
                          repurchasing and restructuring domestic debt and (planned for 2005)
                          issuing bonds to private creditors or to international capital markets.
                          These measures will enhance the GOE's capacity to respond to shocks
                          by replenishing the oil stabilization fund and increasing reserves and
                          liquidity in the banking system.       Further measures aim to reduce
                          vulnerabilities to external shocks by increasing the share of non-oil fiscal
                          revenues,     diversifying non-oil   exports,   strengthening   prudential
                          regulations, increasing labor market flexibility, and encouraging
                          competitiveness and private participation in key sectors. Finally, the
                          debt overhang risk. High debt service i s absorbing significant public
                          resources and limiting fiscal space for social programs. This situation
                           could produce social pressures to divert debt service payments to other
                          purposes.     To mitigate this risk the GOE i s finalizing bilateral debt
                          reduction agreements with the Paris Club,             strengthening     debt
                          management, and transparently managing FEIREPresources.

1.     This program document proposes a Structural Adjustment Loan for Fiscal Consolidation
and Competitive Growth 11(FCCGL-11) to the Republic of Ecuador for US$lOO million. This
operation will continue World Bank support to the country's fiscal adjustment and structural
reform agenda initiated by the first, single-tranche FCCGL. Continued support i s based on the
Government's achievements in implementing benchmarks and other actions within the multiyear
framework designed for the first FCCGL. This i s a fixed spread loan in US dollars with
seventeen years maturity and a five-year grace period. This operation i s part of the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy to respond to the Government of Ecuador's (GOE's) request for
assistance. A parallel second programmatic operation in the social sectors i s being prepared to
protect the most vulnerable groups, and a complementary investment operation in institutional
reform was approved to support budget institutions. The Government continues to be engaged in
an austerity planto consolidate fiscal balances, and to support the design and implementation of
structural reforms intrade, governance, and the productive and social sectors.


                                 I.BackgroundandRationale

A. Economic Performance

2.      The GutiCrrez Administration proposed to deepen and strengthen the reform
agenda needed to sustain dollarization when it took office in January 2003. Since 2000,
dollarization has brought price stability, growth, and a restored confidence in the financial
system, and has lifted the monetary veil that preventedthe country from seeing the serious fiscal,
real, and financial imbalances that negatively affected the economy. Real salary levels and
unemployment rates are back to 1998 levels. More fundamentally, the fiscal discipline required
by a dollarization regime sets up a policy framework for dealing with the interlinked problems of
instability, stagnant per capita growth, heavy debt burden, severe social gaps, and poor
governance. Five years after dollarization, Ecuador i s at an important juncture in which it can
reap the benefits of a monetary system that entails low rates of inflation and predictability for
medium-term planning and investment, but requires continuous commitment to fiscal discipline
and structural reforms.    The Gutitrrez Administration committed itself to completing such
reforms. Its development program i s also supported by an Intensified Surveillance Mechanism
(ISM) with the International Monetary Fund(IMF) (Annex B) and by structural reform programs
with multilaterals dealing with fiscal consolidation, competitive growth, and social and
governance reforms. FCCGL-I and I1are centerpieces inthis effort.
3.      In2004, macroeconomic performanceunder FCCGL-I1was outstanding.




                                                 1

     Growth reached 6.6 percent, among the highest in the Latin America and the
     Caribbean Region (LAC), inflation declined to international levels of about 2 percent,
     open unemployment was around 10 percent, and the urban poverty rate fell to 25
     percent. The outlook for 2005 looks positive due to continued robust growth, reaching close
     to four percent, low inflation of around two percent, and a stronger external position.

     The Non-FinancialPublic Sector (NFPS) primary surplus increased from 4.3 percent of
     GDPin2002 to 5.4 percent in2004. This has allowed almost atripling of the overall fiscal
     surplusto about 3 percent of GDP.
     The debt ratio fell from 58 percent to 48 percent of GDP between 2002 and 2004, and
     the country is well on track to meet its target reduction of 16percentage points in2002-06
     and on its way to reach a sustainable ratio of 40 percent of GDP contained in the Fiscal
     Transparency, Stabilization and Responsibility Law (FTSRL).
     The international reserve position improved from 4.1 percent of GDP in 2002 to 4.6
     percent in2004. This is mainly the result of a surplus inthe current account balance.
     The EMBI+ (Emerging Market Bond Index Plus) spread fell more than 1,000 basis
     points between 2002 to 2004, thus allowing Moody to upgrade the rating of Ecuadorian
     debt from Caa2 to Caal, and Standard and Poor's from CCC+ to B-. Authorities intend
     to bring the EMBI+ spread below 400 basis points this year, to regain access to international
     markets.
         The GOE has prepared a new program for continued oversight by the IMF. The
IMF did not complete the second review of the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), despite the fact
that the macroeconomic situation was broadly sound and most quantitative criteria were on track
by end-2003. Delays in compliance with some structural reforms+specially            those requiring
Congressional approval or actions beyond the Executive's control-justified      SBA suspension by
early 2004.     Following lengthy discussion on the appropriate form of Fund engagement in
Ecuador, the Government and the Fundstaff have since reached an agreement whereby the staff
will closely monitor the authorities' macroeconomic program under an ISM. The Program was
prepared by the Authorities and the role of Fundstaff is focused on its quarterly follow-up. The
Program i s the object of an initial Assessment Letter that supports the present operation (Annex
B). Quarterly assessments-based       on compliance with quantitative targets-will   guarantee close
monitoring by the Fundand the Bank during 2005. Moreover, under this operation, Authorities
have committed to adopt offsetting measures in the case of significant deviations from targets,
i.e., above 10percent or duringtwo successivequarters.
5.       While the country's economic performance has been positive, reforms will remain
incomplete until the over 7 million Ecuadorians living in poverty benefit with improved
living standards. Ecuador's declining poverty rates are consistent with its commitment to reach
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (Annex G). However, according to the recent
Public Expenditure Review (PER) by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB), the present fiscal stance i s inconsistent with a poverty reduction strategy. Low
expenditures on education and health, reduced fiscal space to finance social programs, and
poorly targeted social spending are major constraints. This operation helpsincrease fiscal space,
while the parallel social sectors operation deals with the other two constraints.          The PER
recognizes that selected MDGs in education and health are within reach, especially if supported



                                                  2

by additional social expenditure, well targeted and focused on low-cost programs linked to
specific outcomes.
6.      Ecuador's recovery is fragile. Its stability and growth are promising, but its fiscal and
external positions, although in surplus, remain vulnerable. These vulnerabilities are due to its
rigid response to extemal shocks-typical      of dollarized economies with only fiscal policy as an
instrument-in     a context of volatile, oil-dependent fiscal revenues, pressure for expansionary
spending, and still heavy debt burden. Through this operation, the country seeks to meet the
preconditions for sustained dollarization, including a solid fiscal position, a sustainable public
debt, sufficient international reserves to accommodate capital outflows, flexible factor markets to
improve competitiveness, and an attractive investment climate.

B. ProgramBackground

7.      All eleven benchmarks under FCCGL-I, now considered as prior actions for
FCCGL-11, have been met, and in all cases exceeded. Inparticular, on revenue management,
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) increased tax collection above 12 percent during 2004,
significantly surpassing its target 7.5 percent. Customs revenue also increased by 17 percent,
more than tripling its target of 5 percent. On wage bill control, the Ministry of Economy and
Finance (MEF) completed staffing reviews in five key ministries that, following the approval of
the Civil Service and Administrative Career and Wage Unification and Harmonization of Public
Sector Remunerations Law, allowed unifying and standardizing salaries from 21 grade categories
to 14, and keeping constant the Central Government's payroll and goods and services share at
8.2 percent of GDP for three consecutive years. On budget transparency, the MEF created a
website to publish regular reports on executed expenditure; promoted the design and piloted an
e-procurement system, known as CONTRATANET, and published off-budget expenditures and
audited fiscal accounts for the first time. On debt management, the country made sound use of
oil windfalls, by setting apart and assigning at least 70 percent of the Fund for Stabilization,
Investment, and Public Debt Reduction (FEIREP) resources for debt buybacks.              On power
reform, tariffs have continued to be adjusted and on average are equivalent to their economic
costs, and a transparent subsidy now covers the deficit in generation revenues. On telecom
reform, the telecom strategy led to finding a private operator to manage the new cellular phone
company, TELECSA, and to operational surpluses in both telecom companies, ANDINATEL
and PACIFICTEL in the last two years. Finally, on labor market reform, a National Labor
Commission was created, thus endorsing critical reforms to the labor regime in the context of
free trade negotiations. Finally, no backtracking has been observed in actions adopted prior to
FCCGL-I.
8.      In addition to specific benchmarks for FCCGL-11, there has been significant
progress on most complementary reform milestones. Only three milestones were unmet, due
to lack of political support (see Annex C for details): A tax reform bill was rejected twice by
Congress, but its near-term importance diminished in the context of exceptional fiscal revenues
from oil. Further adjustments to local telephone rates and gasoline prices were both deferred by
the Executive facing an extremely difficult political environment. To offset this, additional
milestones were achieved by the authorities: strengthening FEIREP, trade and labor market
reforms, and water and oil environment management (see Annex D).

C. Rationale for ContinuedProgramSupport

9.       Building on the FCCGL Iand 11, a third operation will strengthen stability and
economic recovery, while consolidating the medium-term structural reforms. Ecuador has
benefited from three years of exceptional oil windfalls and steady foreign remittances to achieve
high growth and low inflation. Hence, there are reasons for optimism in 2005 and beyond.
Moreover, the full-year operation of the new heavy crude oil pipeline (OCP) should help double
oil production levels in a few years, raise growth forecasts to around four percent, bring public
debt ratios to more sustainable levels, and further reduce unemployment and poverty. As the
country improves its debt ratios, the Government aims to regain access to international credit
markets in 2005. In this context, consolidation of economic recovery will depend on tackling
fragile areas. Reversing previous expansionary spending and consolidating the increase in tax
revenue are priorities. Continuous fiscal discipline will also help to reduce domestic interest
rates, which are high for the standard of dollarized economies; reactivate domestic private
investment and credit; and prevent an appreciating real exchange rate, which has recently
somehow benefited from dollar depreciation in the foreign markets and promoted double-digit
export growth. On the structural side, the country (together with Colombia and Peru) i s expected
to sign a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States. Reaping full benefits from it,
though, requires complementary structural reforms.
10.      The proposed FCCGL-I1has been prepared in the context of strong international
support and in close collaboration with the IMF. It has benefited from an active engagement
across institutional boundaries within the Ecuadorian government and at the local level, and has
been designed parallel to a 2005 macroeconomic program under an IMF-ISM. The Funds
Assessment Letter was transmitted on December 29, 2004 and it confirms the goal of the
Government's program of fiscally stabilizing the economy, while supporting high-quality growth
with key structural reforms under multilateral support, a policy framework that i s consistent with
dollarization.
11.      The loan is timely to consolidate Ecuador's ongoing recovery from an emergency
fiscal situation, and to prepare it to reenter international financial markets and to sign a
Free Trade Agreement with the United States.                Ecuador has made significant efforts to
recover from the critical fiscal stance it inherited from the previous administration, but recovery
i s fragile and threatened by a difficult sociopolitical situation, which limits the space for reforms.
A disciplined commitment to its fiscal rule in the use of oil proceeds and an extremely reduced
fiscal space also limit the country's ability to invest in its social agenda. Two years after taking
office, the Government announced a strong continued commitment to stability and structural
reforms, but highlighted new efforts it would make to implement social and governance reforms.
The overall policy reforms supported under this operation are a balanced mix of the fiscal and
growth agendas. Officials are aware that the credibility of their economic program does not
depend merely on dollarization, but on gradually increasing social spending, while preserving a
sound and comprehensive policy framework that would be robust in the event of future internal
and/or external shocks.
12.      The move toward a second stage is justified by continuing strong performance and
new policy accomplishments suited to Ecuador's present situation and needs. The Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on May 27, 2003 foresaw a second operation
infiscal year 2004. A single-tranche, multiyear approach was adopted for the FCCGLs, because



                                                   4

adjustment lending had not been successful in Ecuador in the 1990s, and an Operational
Evaluation Department (OED) study found that, at a minimum, further fast-disbursing lending
should be extended only when major reforms have reached the "sticky hard-to-reverse stage"
with clearly accomplished milestones, policy requirements, and monitoring indicators.         The
continuation under a single-tranche approach derives from lessons drawn in the first operation
and the need to preserve reform momentum within the multiyear framework, while allowing
flexibility in a country that presents high risks.       The reform program i s laid out in the
Government's Letter of Development Policy (Annex E) and i s summarized in the multiyear
matrix of policy andinstitutional reforms (Annex D).


                   11. RecentEconomicDevelopments and Prospectsfor 2005

13.     Dollarization, a favorable external environment, and a commitment to fiscal
managementhave helped stabilize the Ecuadorian economy following its exchange rate and
banking crises at the turn of the century. In 1997, following the Asian crisis, oil prices
plummeted, causing the fiscal accounts to deteriorate. Soon after, the weather phenomenon El
NiAo decimated Ecuador's shrimp and agricultural exports. The underregulated banking sector,
which inthe boom years prior to the crises had lent imprudently, faced high levels of defaults on
its agricultural loans. As a result, nearly half the banking sector collapsed and was taken over by
the government. Adding to the banking and fiscal crises, the currency went into a tailspin and
inflation rose swiftly. The fiscal crisis resulted in a debt default in 1998, further pushing the
currency down until the government officially dollarized on January 9, 2000. The impact on the
social side was considerable; unemployment rose from 10 to 15 percent, half a million people
emigrated to findjobs abroad, and another half million moved into marginal urban areas. It i s
estimated that the poverty rate increased by 7 percent duringthe crisis (1998-99).
14.      In the five years since dollarization, the country has recovered price stability and
pre-crises employment and poverty rates. Since end-2003, inflation has rapidly declined to
single digits, reaching international levels by mid-2004, after reaching nearly 100percent during
the crisis (Figure 1). This i s also a significant improvement over its 30 percent average levels
prior to the crises. Some tradable sectors are even showing monthly deflation numbers. More
significantly, urban poverty rates declined substantially from 46 percent in 1999 to 25 percent in
2004 (Figure 2). Open unemployment has remainedsteady in the 10 and 11percent range.
15.      Growth has strongly recovered, driven principally by the oil sector, but medium-
term growth prospects remain average. In 2004, the economy grew at an estimated 6.6
percent (Table l),  which translates into per capita growth close to 5 percent. Most, but not all, of
this growth is accounted for by the oil sector. Private companies have rapidly responded to the
oil windfall by increasing their own production-private         oil production levels averaged 53
percent higher in 2004. Even the more sluggish non-oil sector grew at 2.5 percent. Labor-
intensive industries, including manufacturing and commerce, also had modest growth, which
explains the limited gains inemployment. Growth i s projected at 3.9 percent of GDP in 2005.
16.      The external position improved considerably, mostly due to the windfall in oil
exports. The trade balance i s projected to be in surplus in 2004. Projected petroleum exports
rose about 75 percent, and offset the 4 percent decrease inexports of manufactures and processed
goods and the 10 percent decrease in nontraditional exports. Consequently, the current account

balance also reversed to an estimated 0.6 percent of GDP surplus, from a 1.7 percent deficit in
2003.        The current account was further helped by a 3 percent increase from 2003 in the
remittances from emigrant workers.                          Strong growth was also reflected in a projected rapid
increase in imports, which rose by 29 percent due to strong consume demand for nondurable
goods and oil derivatives, and for constructionproducts and capital goods. Overall, international
reserves increased to US$1.4 billion, an 18 percent annual increase over 2003. Reversing its
appreciation trend following dollarization, the real exchange rate depreciated 6 percent between
2002 and 2004, as a result of lower domestic inflation and dollar depreciation in international
currency markets. Both trade and current account balances are projected to be in surplus,
slightly above this year levels, in 2005.

 17.       High oil prices and fiscal discipline contributed favorably to the fiscal accounts.
Higher export revenues and a cautious fiscal program brought about a record Non-Financial
Public Sector (NFPS) primary surplus of about 5.4 percent of GDP for 2004, bringingthe NFPS



                                                                    7

overall balance to a surplus of 2.7 percent of GDP. On the revenue side, oil income climbed
steadily for a second consecutive year, increasing by almost 20 percent from 2003. On the
expenditure side, the combined Central Government wage bill and spending in goods and
services remained constant at about 8.2 percent of GDP, offsetting a limited number of modest
and selected salary increases agreed in 2003. More structural steps were also taken to control the
wage bill in the medium term with the passage of the Civil Service Reform bill and its ensuing
amendments.        Increasing operational surpluses by the Ecuadorian Social Security Institute
(IESS), PetroEcuador and TELECOM companies also contributed to this positive fiscal
performance. Fiscal primary surpluses and balances are projected at 4.9 and 2.2 percent of GDP
in2005 (Table 1).
18.     Higher fiscal surpluses reduced financing needs, and almost fully cleared remaining
domestic arrears inherited from the previous administration. The financing gap for 2004
was a low US$113 million, but this sum excluded US$655 million in domestic arrears and
unidentified financing from subnational governments that were rolled over, and external
commitments that were fully repaid (Table 2). Short of exceptional financing, Ecuador had net
negative external flows of US$457 million. The financing gap for 2005 i s estimated at US$380
million, or about 1.2 percent of GDP.

19.     Public debt ratios have improved as the debt repurchasing program has started, but
have concentrated on domestic debt. While the debt level remains burdensome, it continues to
decline in terms of GDP. Ecuador's public debt has fallen from 53 percent to 48 percent of GDP
in 2004, which representsa marked improvement over its 58 percent ratio in2002. The decline
in2004 was the outcome of acombinationof higher GDP, increased oil revenues, and significant
amortization payments to multilaterals.        The Government achieved debt reduction despite
significant political pressures for deviating oil revenues to added expenditures. The downward
trend i s consistent with the target reduction of 16 percentage points in 2002-06 and i s on track to
reach a sustainable ratio of 40 percent of GDP contained in the Fiscal Transparency,
Stabilization and ResponsibilityLaw (FTSRL). The law requires the use of 70 percent of the oil
revenues accumulated in the newly created Fund for Stabilization, Investment, and Public Debt
Reduction (FEIREP)to repurchase debt. The debt buyback program has already started but, due
to liquidity constraints, has concentrated on repurchasing (and rolling over) expensive domestic
debt and issuing new domestic debt with enhanced financial conditions regarding maturities and
interest. For 2005, the Government's goal i s to reach a public debt to GDP 44.1 percent ratio.
To this end, it has prepared a comprehensive Public Debt Restructuring Plan that includes
external debt repurchases. The Plan has four components: (a) further repurchase of debt
(preferably external); (b) swaps of Global Bonds in order to extend maturities and reduce interest
rates; (c) regained access to intemational capital markets with successful placement of T-bills
with foreign investors; and (d) debt relief from bilateral debt swaps with France, Germany, Italy,
Norway, and Spain. In addition, Authorities have indicated their intention to use exceptional
financing resources obtained from multilateralspari passu to an adequate debt management.
20.      As a consequence of the sound macroeconomic stance, Ecuador's risk spread
continued to decline in 2004. Overall, the EMBI+ spread fell from 1,800 at the end of 2002 to
690 at the end of December 2004 (Figure 3). Despite the robust performance of the fiscal and
external sectors, the spread has been negatively affected by continuous political instability over
the past two years. Authorities expect that the EMBI+ will decline to LAC levels (below 400
basis points) by end 2005, based on the sound macroeconomic program, continued commitment
to fiscal rules, and progress on the ongoing structural reforms, including those supported by this
operation.

21.     The financial sector has strengthened, liquidity is loosening, and interest rates have
significantly decreased. In 2004, deposits in the banlung system rose by about 20 percent from
2003 (Figure4). Confidence in the system is still fragile as 70 percent of deposits are in savings
and current accounts, and only 30 percent are in term deposits, and of those the majority are no
more than 60 days. However, the liquidity crunch of past years i s easing: credit grew by about
21 percent in 2004, well above its 4.5 percent growth rate in 2003. Borrowing has also become
cheaper, as the referential lending rate decreased from 11.2 percent in 2003 to 7.7 percent in
December 2004. The spread between deposits and loans halved from 5.7 percent in December
2003 to about 3 percent in late 2004. Still, a significant portion of the portfolio-8        to 9
percent-remained    past due, mainly in the commercial sector, but increasingly in consumer
loans also. The government still needs to sell the restructured debt by the Deposit Guarantee
Agency (AGD), to sell real estate assets contained inthe Filanbanco liquidation trust fund, and to
manage the pending liquidation of three out of eight closed AGD banks, actions agreed under the
SBA conditionality, but still under implementation.
22.     Ecuador has requested an Intensified Surveillance Mechanism (ISM) by the IMF' of
its macroeconomic program.          Authorities do not wish to move toward a formal Fund
arrangement. This new form of engagement with the Fundwill support efforts to preserve fiscal
discipline while Authorities take full ownership and control of the structural reform agenda.
Reluctance to enter into a formal arrangement i s due to the fragile status of the Government's
coalition in Congress, demonstrated by the political difficulty and uncertainty when the
Executive submitted new legal initiatives as part of the conditionality of a Fund. The Fundhas
limited its role to an ISM that will provide the complementary critical support required for
moving forward with the structural reform program.
23.     Compliance with the program under I S M will be monitored by the Fund through
close supervision of performance of five quarterly quantitative performance benchmarks.
Selected targets are: the CG non-oil balance (floor), NFPS non-oil balance (floor), CG primary
expenditure (ceiling), stock of registered central government net debt (ceiling), and net
accumulation of external arrears (ceiling).   Its monitoring will provide the basis for periodic
assessment letters to be delivered to the World Bank and IDB policy loans under request. In
addition, the Bank will calibrate compliance with the program using two additional criteria: (a)
the presence of "significant" deviations, that is, deviations of 10 percent above or below the
target or occurring during two successive quarters for the same indicator; and (b) the estimated
effects of compensatory measures adopted by Authorities to correct any deviation from target, as
indicated inthe Assessment Letter. The I S Mends on December 31, 2005.

A. The Program

24.      The Government's strategy is to bring Ecuadorian citizens together in a concerted
fight against poverty, through coordinated economic, social, and governance advances.
This strategy is described in the Program for Economic Restructuring and Human Development
(PERHD) (Box 1). On the economic pillar, the PERHDis committed to fiscal consolidation and
comprises reforms to stimulate production and commerce, improve basic infrastructure,
strengthen financial markets, and create more flexible and competitive input, especially labor

markets. On the social pillar, the PERHD aims to reform social assistance, education, health,
and social security to better fight poverty. On the governance pillar, the GOE's commitment i s
to fight corruption, improve public service delivery and transparency, and increase overall
security, which i s broadly defined also to include judicial and environmental aspects. The
PERHDalso affirmed the GOE's intention to comply with the FiscalTransparency, Stabilization
and Responsibility Law (FTSRL), thus strengthening its overall credibility.                           The actions
supported by FCCGL 1-11are anchored inthe economic and governance pillars.


Box 1. The Program for Economic Restructuring and Human Development (PERHD)
The new Administration announced the PERHD upon taking office on January 15, 2003. The PERHD
recognized the precarious fiscal situation and the urgent need for short- and medium-term structural reforms to
sustain economic recovery and reduce poverty. It targeted 11social indicators for 2003-07.

    Short-term economic policies encompass: (a) austerity measures supported by Presidential Decrees, "Norms
    for Patriotic Savings," which restrains public expenditure to attack the immediate liquidity problem; budget
    consistent with such austerity norms; and an initial increase in fuel prices; (b) tax policy and administration
    reform; (c) a restructuring of the corruption-prone Ecuadorian Customs Corporation; and (d) the setting up of
    FEIREP for debt reduction and a countercyclical fiscal policy.
    Medium-term structural economic policies including: (a) civil service reform; (b) completion of the financial
    sector reform; (c) creation of a Banking Liquidity Fund; (d) full liquidation of closed banks; and (e) new
    incentives to attract foreign investment, in particular in telecommunications, electricity, and the oil industry,
    starting with tariff adjustments.
    Social policies include: (a) the raising of the Bono Solidario (cash subsidy) from US$11.5 to US$15 per
    month; (b) the increase of retiree pensions; (c) the approval of a minimum pension of US$15 per month for
    people over 68 years of age who were not receiving the Bono Solidario; and (d) budgetary protection to
    selectedsocial programs and actions inthe social security system, benefiting indigenous and rural populations.
    Institutional reforms contain: (a) anticorruption policies, (b) modernization of the state, and (c) pro-
    transparency and citizen participation programs. To achieve these objectives, the GOE has organized Mesas
    de Didlogo, and has also announced its intention to revise the decentralization framework, while engaging
    civil society inthe design and monitoring of the public budget.

Two years later, the GOE has refined the PERHD with a clear view to implementinglagging reforms on the
economic (structural), social, and governance fronts. InJanuary 2005 President GutiCrrez conducted a review
of the PERHD's first two years. Main achievements in price stability, short-term fiscal consolidation, and
redistributive policies were underscored. However, President GutiCrrez recognized perceivable delays in attracting
foreign investment, in passing telecommunications and power state companies to a private manager, and in social
security reform. Hence, in January 2005, the GOE announced three upcoming legal initiatives: (a) a new law for
the oil sector to effectively attract foreign investment into high quality state oil fields currently controlled by
PetroEcuador; (b) a new law for the power sector to set up an Electricity Sector Fund (FONSEL) that would
guarantee payment for private companies wishing to invest in the sector, with provisions for settling bills with
priority given to generators, thus bringing down electricity costs and encouraging new generation with increased
private investments; and (c) a new law for social security reform to allow the CG to assumethe IESS actuarial debt
and establish a trust fund to be capitalized from fiscal savings and ensure coverage for future amortizations of
government bonds issued to the IESS. In this scheme, the GOE's 40% co-contribution toward pensions could be
converted to bonds.

25.      Progress in the Government's Program during 2003-04, supported by FCCGL 1-11,
was broadly positive in the areas of fiscal consolidation and faster growth with increased
competitiveness. The main results are summarized in Table 3, and described indetail below.

                              percent of public servants went under a unified and standardized salary scale. The
                              number of redundant public personnel for 2004 was capped at 1 percent of the
                              economically active population (about 5,000 public workers).

26.     Despite this good progress, a significant reform agenda remains to consolidate the
fiscal stance and foster competitive growth based on rising productivity. Dollarization
centers macroeconomic management in sound fiscal policy, and rising medium-term
productivity. Ecuador has limited options in the face of possible external shocks. With no
control over monetary or exchange rate policy, and no ability to "hide" fiscal imbalances and
alter relative prices by depreciating the domestic currency, Ecuador needs to ensure
macroeconomic stability through debt solvency and fiscal stability. These are essential to create
room for financing pro-poor social programs and to sustain economic recovery. For their part,
structural reforms are critical not only for correcting internal and external macro imbalances, but
for introducing flexibility in goods and services to strengthen competitiveness.

1. The Challengeof Consolidatingthe FiscalStance

29.     Fiscal Framework. Before dollarization, the lack of an explicit and coherent fiscal
framework undermined the credibility of fiscal management in Ecuador and left it vulnerable to
constant political pressures for expanded government spending.            Ensuing procyclical and
discretionary policies resulted in volatile revenue, expansionary spending, declining primary
surpluses, and little transparency in fiscal management. The Fiscal Transparency, Stabilization
and Responsibility Law (FTSRL), passed by Congress in June 2002, sought to impose such a
framework, but the Government at that time did not issue the regulations that would make it
effective. The Law was approved by end-2002.
30.     The overall net impact of the fiscal measures considered by the Multiyear
Government Program generated annual savings of about US$310million, equivalent to 1
percent of GDP (Table 4). This net fiscal impact combines additional revenues from tax
administration and savings from expenditure, civil service reform and interest savings, with
offsetting costs arising from measures that reduced the overall g;~-ossimpact of the program.
Offsetting measures were selected salary, transfers and pension increases, new hiring of teachers,
army and policy, in part inherited by the previous administration, emergency subsidies to
electricity thermal generation, and the implicit subsidy on constant fuel prices. The estimated
savings of the new bill on civil service and wage unification are marginally positive, since the
fiscal costs of severance payments and adjustments arising from the conversion of the 21-grade
to the minimum wage in the 14-grade category will be absorbed from 2005 onwards and small,
since it will partly be financed from ministries' own budgets.
31.     UNDER    FCCGL-I, in January 2003, the Government published an Executive Decree
containing the norms (RegZamentos) of key components of the FTSRL: (a) quantitative targets
for fiscal variables (real primary expenditure growth, non-oil Central Government deficit, and
the ratio of public debt to GDP); (b) a Public Debt Reduction Plan, (c) management of the
resources saved in the oil stabilization fund, FEIREP; (d) multiyear budgeting; and (e) budget
transparency and citizen control. Puttingthe FTSRLinto effect was a substantial step forward in
establishing meaningful budgetary guidelines and providing a framework for analyzing the
macroeconomic impact of public finances.         UNDER     FCCGL-11, the GOE has had a mixed
performance under the FTRSL. In budgeted terms, it complied with the quantitative targets of
the FTRSL inthe 2003 and 2004 budgets. However, in executed terms, real primary expenditure
growth has been larger than expected and the non-oil deficit has remained constant, thus falling
short of the spirit of the law. The principal sources of expenditure growth have been increases in

pensions, new hiring of police and military forces approved during 2002, and selected salary
increases, also approved in 2002, but made effective in 2003 to teachers, police, and security
forces. The GOE has also defined the technical proceedings that allow calculating the exact
amounts to be transferred to FEIREP and allocated them to repurchase public debt in accordance
with the Law and implementeda comprehensive Transparency Plan (see below).

32.     Prospectsfor 2005. Ecuador has a macroeconomic program that will allow itto comply
with the quantitative targets of the law and reach a 4.9 percent of GDP floor primary surplus (and
2.2 overall balance surplus) and those from the program under intensified surveillance from the
Fund. The floor primary surplus ratio is considered as the minimumrequiredfor preserving the
declining trend in debt sustainability. Key targets considered in this loan to achieve this include
a 7.5 increase in real terms in tax revenue, which would allow it to reach 12 percent of GDP
floor tax ratio and a reduction of 0.1 percent each in CG expenditure in wages and in goods and
services, which will allow them to remain inside an 8 percent aggregate ceiling. In addition, it
will continue with its public debt reduction plan, allocating 70 percent of FEIREP resources for
debt buybacks, and reaching a public debt-to-GDP ratio below a 44.1 percent of GDP ceiling
ratio.
33.     Tax Policy and Administration. Tax revenues have been low and volatile due to weak
tax administration, insufficient audits and crosscheclung, a small tax base, and an excessive
number of tax exemptions, earmarkings, and taxes with minimal revenue. The low collections of
non-petroleum taxes i s a consequence of the low level of the value-added tax (VAT) and the
excessive number of exemptions, particularly on the VAT and the income tax (ISR).                           The
variability of oil prices gives fiscal receipts a procyclical nature. The excessive number of
earmarked (preassigned) taxes (over 50)2 and nuisance taxes (more than 80) impede a more
efficient collection and use of taxes, and rob the system of its transparency and equity.
34.     UNDER      FCCGL-I, the GOE submitted to Congress a draft Law of a Simplified Tax
Regime that would have broadened the fiscal base. The law, however, was not approved in the
second reading, and the GOE decided to integrate it with a broader tax reform proposal. In tax
administration, the IRS raised tax revenue in the first quarter of 2003 by no less than 7.5 percent
compared to the first quarter of 2002. UNDER                FCCGL-11, the IRS had a remarkable tax
collection of 12.6 percent in 2004, well above its benchmark of 7.5 percent, thus consolidating
its positive performance of the last two years. This outcome resulted from a combination of
rapid growth in the oil and non-oil economy and key administrative measures such as intensive
audit of large taxpayers (especially telecom and oil companies), initial crosschecking of taxpayer
databases with Customs, and impressive efforts to broaden the tax base by the R S through the
registration of 100,000 new active taxpayers.
35.     Administrative measures should consolidate in 2005: SRI intends to register 80,000 new
active taxpayers, coupled with no less than 12 ex-post audits of large taxpayers per month.
Moreover, the GOE also attempted tax reform under several drafts of a Tax Rationalization and
Simplification Law (TRSL), but it failed to obtain Congressional approval. Inthe near term, tax
reform i s less pressing because of exceptional fiscal revenues associated to the oil windfall,
coupled with tight spending and sound management of oil resources. Following consultations
with civil society led by the Government, the Authorities and Bank staff agreed to postpone this
measure, settingno specific deadline for it (Annex R).
36.     Customs Modernization. Customs is also affected by low collection and inefficiencies.
A central focus of corruption, Customs is also a major constraint on competitiveness: the time



2. In view of its impact on environmental protection, and the small size of the amounts involved, the principle of
   earmarking revenue is, however, appropriate for keeping an adequate amount put aside for the maintenanceof the
   protected areas.

37.    UNDER    FCCGL-I, a draft Customs Modernization Law was submitted to Congress.
Among other things, the draft law sought to improve the collection of customs duties by
strengthening the role of the IRS in cross-checking import bills and taxpayer information,
restructuring the Ecuadorian Customs Administration (CAE), imposing stiffer penalties for the
under-invoicing of imports, and improving border controls. Despite Customs being administered
by the Army since early 2003, it has shown no improvement, but rather a 3 percent decline in
revenues. This decline reflected continuous tax evasion through smuggling, and a massive shift
of import classifications to the zero-rate category and to duty-free zones. UNDER     FCCGL-11,
the Customs Law was approved, albeit watered down in a number of key provisions. Customs
collection reached an impressive 17 percent in 2004, well above its 5 percent target. This
performance results from a Modernization Plan (Annex L) that includes: personnel removal-
more than 24 officials belonging to Customs surveillance have been dismissed+ontinuous       staff
evaluation, intensive ex post auditing, and valuation database.
38.     Proposals for privatizing some Customs services are also in process.             Customs
restructuring has also been slow because of preventive actions of the outgoing administrators to
dismantle the existing information system. Consequently, the military's mandate, which was
originally to end in October 2003, has been extended. In the future, the challenge to the
Government i s to inform the citizens about these issues and mobilize those who will benefit from
the proposed changes to overcome the traditional and well-organized resistance to reform. For
this reason, this operation includes the creation of a Customs Reform Observatory, composed of
civil society organizations. The Customs Observatory would track the implementation of the
Modernization Plan through a set of indicators and benchmarks, and would deliver reports to
their constituencies and media, and to customs authorities and the MEF.
39.     Public Expenditure Management. The government's ability to manage public
expenditures i s severely compromised by inertial rigidities that, according to the joint World
Bank-IADB PER, leave as little as 4 percent of the total budget subject to discretionary
decisions, and by an unsustainable growth of current spending. In 2004, the servicing of the
public debt accounted for 30 percent of total expenditures, the Government wage bill absorbed
about 32 percent, and transfers to social security and subnational governments and other pre-
commitments absorbed another 34 percent. As a result of large increases in wages and benefits
agreed by the previous administrations, the CG wage bill increased significantly, from 4.4
percent of GDPin2000 to 6.9percent of GDPin 2002 (Table 2), or about US$1.7 billion.
40.     UNDER   FCCGL-I,the GOE implemented an emergency austerity Decree in 2003. Key
measuresof the Decree public servant wage freeze, the suspension of overtime allowances, and a
10 percent salary reduction of civil servants earning above US$l,OOO. These measures led to
savings in non-wage primary spending for covered ministries and institutions and prevented the
CG wage bill from increasing from 6.9 percent in 2003. UnderFCCGL-11,the Government has
extended and tightened the austerity decree to 2004 and 2005. Hence, it has not only preserved
the salary freeze, excepting teachers, police, and military, but the 2005 austerity decree has
established the principle that any new hiring or salary increase by a public institution should be
financed within its same payroll envelope. The decree also affects entities regulated by special
collective contracts. Additional measures enforced are voluntary retirement of up to 5,000
employees, effective cuts of no less than 10 to 15 percent in goods and services budgets, and


                                                 17

periodic reporting requirements. The Government will have to use considerable political capital
to maintainthese austerity measures.
41.     Controlling the Wage Bill. Ecuador is'developing a civil service reform that can
become a model for Latin America. The Government inEcuador hadlost effective control of the
wage bill. Individual ministries, agencies, and government-owned enterprises were granted
considerable autonomy to set their own pay rules and/or to lobby for tailored wage benefits. The
result was a bewildering array of more than 50 salary components of varying types and
descriptions, including payments linked to the post (for example,                                bonificacidn de
responsabilidad, gastos de residencia, bonificacidn por circunstancias geograficas); to the
occupant of the post (for example, years of service, subsidiofamiliar, bonificacidn professional);
or other entitlements granted to most or all public employees (for example, 15" salary,
bonificacidn comisariato, bonificacidn trimestral).
42.     UnderFCCGL-I,the GOEtook a crucial step to start regainingcontrol of the wage bill.
The Law on Civil Service and Administrative Career and Wage Unification in the Public Sector
was publishedinthe Official Register on 6 October 2003 (Annex H). First,it consolidated salary
supplements into monthly base pay, and then proscribes most salary supplements. The new
distributivos de sueldos produced by the MEF's Budget Department now reflect the actual
remuneration received by the employees of these mini~tries.~Second, salary unification
strengthened the financial position of the Ecuadorian social security system.                         By law, tax
withholdings for IESS are calculated only on base pay, thus the majority of public employees'
earnings escaped IESS taxation. Third, the Organic Law established a new autonomous body
within the Presidency (the National Secretariat for Remunerations, SENRES)-while                        eliminating
the previous one known as the National Commission of Remunerations (C0NAREM)-with
responsibility for issuing all civil service regulations and determining any salary increases,
within the parameters set by the MEF.
43.     For FCCGL-11, the GOE has consolidated its control of the wage bill. Staffing
reviews-required        to harmonize pay scales-were               completed in 2003 for the ministries of
Agriculture, Education (administrative personnel only), Health, Public Works, and Social
Welfare. Additionally, an updated wage scale was published in November 2004, resulting in a
wage increase effective from January 2005 for those staff whose unified salaries are below the
new norms. The additional cost of the new scale will be roughly US$30 million in 2005.
Further, the Central Bank has, in coordination with MEF, designed and implemented a
consolidated inter-banking payment system (IPS), producing                          a database of all Central
Government employees and their cumulated benefits, processing their payments, verifying the
existence of "ghost" workers, and guarding against the return to public jobs of workers
previously dismissed and indemnified. These new legal and institutional measures will help the
GOE to limit wage bill increases, have adequate information on the number and placement of
public employees, and overhaul civil service management. A risk still exists, however, because
about half of public employees (teachers, police, armed forces) are not covered by the Organic
Law.



3. Several key employment groups are still not covered by the law, most notably teachers, police, and the armed
   forces. In the aggregate, the law covers approximately half of civilian Central Government employees and 44
   percent of all public servants. Despite its partial coverage, the gradual application of the law has raised positive
   expectations about its future effects and created a sense of precedencefor public employees still left uncovered.

44.     Achieving a Sustainable Debt Reduction with FEIREP Proceedings. The solvency
and liquidity of Ecuador's public external debt have improved, but remain delicate. Under the
fiscal rule the GOE aims to reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio below a benchmark 40 percent.
A Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) (Annex F) concluded that: (a) to reduce the debt to
40 percent of GDP in 2006, Ecuador needs sizable primary surpluses during 2005-06; and (b) to
close the financial gap in 2005, it requires fiscal support of around 1.2 percent of GDP (Table 2).
The DSA i s robust, showing that even if oil prices fall to US$18 per barrel in the next two years,
the Government could still reach its public debt-to-GDP 40 percent benchmark, but two or three
years later.
45.     Under FCCGL-I, the GOE cleared 100 percent of all external public debt arrears
accumulated up to February 2003, and 100 percent of all domestic bonded public debt arrears
accumulated up to March 2003. The Government also successfully concluded negotiations with
the Paris Club on all external arrears. Furthermore, plans for reducing debt obtained new
impetus from the opening of the OCP-projected             to boost oil exports by more than 50 percent in
less than five years-and       the initial proceeds replenishing FEIREP in 2004. In compliance with
the FTSRL, 70 percent of oil export proceeds should be devoted to reducing the stock of public
debt, 20 percent to the FEIREP, and 10 percent to financing spending on education and health.
Given traditional governance problems in Ecuador, the risk of misusing these resources i s high.
Thus the definition of many operational, technical, and policy issuesregarding the debt buyback
strategy, the rules in allocating resources, and the transparency of these operations have been
essential (see Annex J).
46.      Under FCCGL-11,the GOE has completed the design of a Debt Reduction Plan (DRP)
and realized the first debt buyback operations with FEIREP, while establishing a few key norms
for FEIREP management and opening a website for its operations. First, the DRP establishes a
medium-term framework for public debt reduction, placing constraints on new borrowing by the
Central and local governments. As part of the DRP, the GOE cleared its remaining external
arrears; made domestic debt repurchases that could amount to US$400 million; and made a
proposal for settling the value of its debt with the IESS(US$540 million over 10 years). The
GOE also announced its intention to issue a US$750 million international bond and swap its
expensive debt in Global bonds; both with the support of from investment banks chosen
following technical advice from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); and to
swap its bilateral debt. Second, it has allocated 70 percent of total cumulated FEIREP proceeds
up to September 30, 2004-a             total of US$479 million-for         debt buybacks and repurchased
public debt for higher amounts-US$381.6              million by December 2004 (see Annex J).4 Third,
jointly with the technical secretariat of FEIREP, it defined debt buyback policies and FEIREP's
reporting procedures. Lastly, it agreed to a transparent communication strategy toward capital
markets, including, among other things, the opening of a website for reporting of FEIREP
operations.
47.      Budget Transparency and Participation. Ecuador has a severe problem of corruption,
according to Transparency International's corruption perception index (2004). For Ecuador,
some studies have estimated that for the 1990s, corruption related costs mount to 10 percent of


4. It is important to realize that there is a close to a three-month period that the National Commission for
   Stabilization, Social and Productive Investment and Reduction of Public Debt (CEIREP) has ruled inpractice for
   converting allocated FEIREPfunds into effective repurchased debt. See Annex J for details.


                                                        19

the GNP, that i s 40 percent of the state budget.' While some improvements were made in the
late 1990s, the budget system i s still plagued by a lack of transparency, weak or inexistent
control over transfers to and expenditures of subnational governments and other autonomous
public institutions (NFPS), deficient procurement systems and inefficient and unaccountable
customs, all of which contribute to corrupt practices and public expenditure leakages.
48.     Under FCCGL-I, and as part of the FTSRL, new regulations guarantee free public
access to the national budget and public expenditure information and require MEFto establish an
on-line public information system that can serve as the basis for citizen monitoring of public
expenditures. Inaddition, the Congress approved the Access to Public Information Law in 2004,
which gives additional leverage to civil society organizations and citizens-at-large to demand
public information. Information on projects in the National Public Investment System has also
been made available on the MEF website. However, the law contains some gaps that hinder its
full effectiveness and enforceability.         For instance, it does not specify the quality of the
information requiredto be made publicly available, does not impose sanctions on inappropriate
retention of information, and does not provide specific time frames for the delivery of requested
information. Similarly, the MEF's website provides consolidated reports on public expenditures
by sector, but does not disaggregate by program, locality, or executing unit, malung it in practice
very hard for citizens to monitor specific expenditures and make cross-references. As well, the
Ministry has not been able to establish a clear institutional channel through which citizens can
direct their requests for information and their complaints. In addition, the GOE agreed to
implement a set of changes in public procurement entailing: (a) the review of a draft
procurement reform law; and (b) the implementation of the first phase of CONTRATANET for
setting up an online mechanism publishingupdated information on public bids, and databases of
providers and public bidders.
49.     UnderFCCGL-11,the GOEhas made progress inits Transparency Plan (Annex I).                     Key
outcomes of the Plan are the opening of a MEFbudget transparency website (portal),publishing
monthly disaggregated information on Central Government fiscal and subnational accounts, and
the Comptroller's external audits of 2002 public accounts. The GOE has also published tax and
expenditures earmarkings, subsidies, and transfers, and off-budget activities in the 2005 Budget
Law. In addition, in an effort to increase public transparency and demystify budget information,
the MEF, with support from a Bank trust fund and the Gesselscha. fier Technische
Zusummenarbeit (German Technical Cooperation, GTZ) grants, is developing dissemination
booklets on national budget formulation and execution, which will be distributed to the public
and made available on its website. Furthermore, the GOE has committed to allowing continuous
participation of the Fiscal Policy Observatory (an independent nongovernmental institution
created to monitor fiscal policy) in the discussion of the annual Budget and its implementation.
Finally, the MEF has enforced website publication, for the first time in 2004, of financial
accounts by Petroecuador, all electricity and telecommunications public enterprises grouped in
the Solidarity Fund, and part of the Regional Development Organizations (RDOs). Through
grants and as a complement to this loan, the Bank will help the GOE engage with civil society
organizations, improve the design and implementation of the portal, and to reach out to ordinary
citizens and local communities with accessible budget and fiscal information. It i s foreseen that
by April 2005, the MEF would have launched a new interactive portal that would import

50.     Under FCCGL-11,reforms in procurement have also continued. CONTRATANET' s
first phase is now completed and operational. It addresses the needs of both civil society and
local business community members for increased public access to information on public
procurement, and represents an improvement in procurement transparency and efficiency. As of
30 November 2004, 226 public agencies and 3,661 providers were reported as already registered
in the system. CONTRATANET's website reports 254,265 hits. The GOE has prepared a draft
Procurement Law, scheduled to go before Congress by March 2005. On Congressional passage
of the new Procurement Law, allowing electronic procurement, CONTRATANET would be able
to launch its second phase, consisting of a transactional system through which public bidders and
providers would transact goods and services by way of a transparent and efficient electronic
procurement mechanism.


2. FosteringGrowthandCompetitiveness

51.     ImplementingStructuralReformsfor Competitivenessand Trade. Ecuador has had
a mixed performance implementing structural reform.              On one hand, it has faced severe
constraints in Congress to push its legal agenda of promoting private participation in oil, power
and telecom, as well as of social security reform. On the other hand, advances in trade and labor
markets,which do not require legalreforms, have exceededthe original expectations of this loan.
Its decision to join Peru and Colombia in the negotiation of a FIA with the U.S. has made
improvements in competitiveness essential. In 2004, Ecuador ranked 90thout of 104 countries
evaluated in terms of global competitiveness during the World Economic Forum, with the
highest relative percentage for innovation and the lowest interms of business climate and respect
for countries and for laws. A 2004 Bank survey on Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) found
critical shortcomings for Ecuadorian firms, including regulatory policy uncertainty, highcosts of
financing, macroeconomic instability, corruption; anticompetitive practices, and the poor
quantity and quality of infrastructure services. Further, Ecuador's trade regime has high tariff
rates, a multiplicity of non-tariff barriers-especially import licenses and technical norms-some
of them out of compliance with WTO commitments, and cumbersome and costly Customs
procedures. The Government i s well aware of these bottlenecks, and has placed reforms to
competitiveness and trade in this loan at the center of its plan to generate higher growth and
poverty reduction.
52.     UnderFCCGL-I,the GOE preparedtwo draft bills, one on a Law of Competition Policy
and another on a Law of the Ecuadorian Quality System. The former defines noncompetitive
policies and practices and creates a regulatory entity in charge of competition practices, and the
latter establishes the policies, principles, and institutions in charge of Ecuadorian trade standards
for goods and services in line with its international trade obligations.              Approval and
implementation of these bills will be supported by an incoming Trade and Competitiveness
Investment Loan that i s under preparation. Trade reform measures included reversing selective
import tariff concessions made at the end of 2002 by the outgoing administration and working
toward the simplification of tariffs to five rates: 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 percent. This was
considered only an initial effort, with the ultimate goal as tariffs of 10percent or below. Second,




                                                   21

the GOE unified multiple import licenses and prohibitedissuance of duplicative ones. Third, the
GOE issued a directive to prohibit issuanceof any new non-WTO- compatible technical norms.
53.     Under FCCGL-11, the renewed emphasis of actions has become accelerating trade
reform with a view toward supporting World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments and
preparation for the signingof Free Trade Agreements, inparticular the one with the U.S. in 2005.
First, it has designed and implemented a trade strategy that is compatible with WTO
commitments andFTA negotiations. This policy paper has been priceless to unify Government's
views and, once posted on the website, provide full information about and allow total
transparency of the Ecuadorian position vis-&vis the FTA. Second, Ecuador has eliminated a
total of about 14 percent-210    out of 1,471-previously    existing import licenses, and set up a
pilot electronic system to simplify import licensing and increase its transparency, while reducing
processing time from 60 days to as little as 10 days. The system became operational in all
licensing institutions on 15 August 2004, and compulsory on 1February 2005. Finally, the GOE
dismantled about 30 percent-262     out of 885-of  previously existing obligatory technical norms
that did not comply with WTO regulations.           Further elimination of import licenses and
compulsory norms i s expected under the FTA with the U.S..
54.     Water and Sanitation Sector Reform. Ecuador's water and sanitation sector faces a
range of problems, including low levels of coverage; poor quality of service; low cost recovery
and high dependency on Central Government transfers to cover the cost of operation and
maintenance and investment; and an incomplete legal and regulatory framework that leads to
overlapping functions among Central Government institutions and among different tiers of
government. Nationwide, coverage i s only 82 percent for water and 39 percent for adequate
sanitation.   Only about half of all water supply systems have working installations for
disinfection. Tariff revenue covers only about two-thirds of the cost to operate and adequately
maintain water supply and sanitation systems.          In 2003 alone, the Central Government
transferred about US$70 million in subsidies to water companies and municipalities using
proceeds from a 10percent surcharge on telephone services.
55.     Under FCCGL-I, the GOE approved the restructuring of the Subsecretariat for Water
Supply, Basic Sanitation and Solid Waste (SAPSRS) under the Ministry of Urban Development
and Housing (MIDUVI), changing its role from a direct executor of water and sanitation
investments to a sector leader and promoter of investments carried out by municipalities. Under
FCCGL-11, MIDUVI has assigned staff to the organizational structure previously approved to
redesign internal processes for SAPSRS. In addition, the President i s issuing a Decree linking
Treasury transfers to water companies and municipal water departments to a set of performance
indicators that provide incentives for improved sector performance. This linkage i s expected to
provide the incentive municipalities need to (a) raise tariffs and reduce operating costs thereby
generating the operating income that will allow them to expand service to the unserved poor in
peri-urban areas, and (b) adopt efficient (public or private) models for autonomous water supply
service provision that will reduce political interference in system operation.        In addition,
MIDUVIalso intendsto prepareadraft Water andSanitation Law to be submitted to Congress.

56.     Electricity Sector Reform.      The electricity sector has gone through an incomplete
reform process since 1996, and i s operationally inefficient and financially unsustainable.
Following failed attempts in 1999-2002 to obtain private participation in distribution companies,
the Solidarity Fund (FS) and local government owners of power distribution companies have



                                                22

failed to upgrade their management, permitting average losses of one-third of energy generated,
as a combination of distribution losses and insufficient bill collection. The government has
prepared genuine reforms in the sector to mobilize badly needed private investment and to
achieve sustainable efficiency improvements.

57.     The Government program for the sector aims to: (a) improve and consolidate the power
sector reform model; (b) stabilize the financial situation; (c) improve the efficiency; (d)
strengthen sector policy and regulatory entities; (e) promote the use of natural gas from Peru; (f)
establish financial mechanisms to promote private investments in generation; and (g) review and
improve the tariff structure setting mechanisms. The Bank's PROMEC, approved in 2001 to
modernize electricity and telecommunications services in rural areas, i s assisting with the
regulatory framework, particularly in the wholesale market, and with electrification for poor
rural households, as well as energy conservation through GEF support. Since 2000, National
Electricity Council (CONELEC) applies a limited cross-subsidy mechanism wherein households
consuming more than the average consumption are charged an additional 10 percent (except in
Guayaquil consumers that are charged 5 percent) and this amount i s proportionally distributed
among households below the average. Since this i s a cross subsidy, no Treasury transfers are
involved. This program i s expected to be maintained and deepenedin2005.

58.     Under FCCGL-I, in 2003, the GOE resumed tariff adjustment for low customers, with a
gradual adjustment of 1.64 percent per month. A cross-subsidy mechanism was applied to low
residential consumers.     Under FCCGL-11, tariff adjustment continued in such a way that
economic costs were reachedfor all customers in October 2003, while maintaining the subsidy to
low residential consumers. CONELEC updated the 4-year reference generation price in October
2004, and, due to a high cost of thermal generation during an emergency year, MEFintroduced a
transparent subsidy to cover the resulting differential between referential and actual generation
costs. In parallel, cross-debt settlements have been enforced among public institutions with the
support from the PROMEC project.

59.     Telecommunications Sector Reform. The telecom sector continues to be challenged by
low and unsustainable local rates, precarious financial balances in state telephone companies,
and a deficient regulatory framework. The previous Government decided not to raise tariffs; So,
in 2003, all commercial tariffs were adjusted to levels that eliminated cross-subsidies. However,
the prices for residential local calls-about 75 percent of total users-remain   subsidized by high
long-distance and international calls, which hamper Ecuadorian competitiveness.                The
Government recognizes that these rates need to be adjusted to eliminate cross-subsidies and to
promote competitive long-distance rates that will, in turn, increase Ecuador's international
competitiveness.    Consequently, CONATEL signed with ANDINATEL and PACFICTEL
concession contracts that authorized tariff increases to the price cap limits issued in December
2001, but the companies have not applied them. ANDINATEL and PACIFICTEL are inefficient
due to weak management. PACIFICTEL, in particular, incurred high debts during 1998-2001.
Finally, the current telecommunications law i s obsolete and has many contradictions, due to its
multiple revisions. This regulatory framework i s a disincentive for investors, because it gives
existing regulatory entities-CONATEL        and SUPTEL-excessive discretion with respect to key
decisions.




                                                 23

60.     Under FCCGL-I, in a move to increase competition in the mobile phone market, a third
mobile phone license was awarded to Telecsa (a cellular phone company created by
ANDINATEL and PACIFICTEL), to provide services in Ecuador. The Government prepared a
strategy for attracting a private operator to manage it, as well as to manage ANDINATEL and
PACIFICTEL, and devised a strategy to eliminate cross-subsidies in one year. Under FCCGL-
11, the GOE had positive results in the implementation of its strategy. ANDINATEL and
PACFICTEL closed 2003 and 2004 with small financial operational surplus, and the GOE was
able to award a management contract to Swedtel AB (a subsidiary of Telia AB-a                major
operator in Sweden) to manage Telecsa during its first two years of operation.           The new
company offered very low introductory rates to attract new customers, thus forcing the two main
cellular operators, Porta and Bell South, to lower their rates to compete with Telecsa. Despite
this progress, and after several bidding attempts, the GOE failed to find a qualified operator
interested in managing both companies, reportedly due to excessively unattractive conditions
established in the proposed contract. The GOE also prepared a draft new telecommunications
law, aimed at having a single sector authority, simplifying entry into the market, and eliminating
the regulator discretionary faculties. Given the fragile coalitions in Congress, the probability of
its presentation to and approval by Congress i s slim.
61.     Oil Sector Reform. The oil sector is key to accelerating economic growth inEcuador.
However, the government must address a set of distortions constraining the sector, including: (a)
low production of the oil fields with the greatest reserves; (b) price and tax distortions on
combustible fuels, which in turn have caused investment in exploratory activity to flatten or
decline; (c) judicial and fiscal instability under the sector's outdated legal and institutional
framework; and (d) inadequate planning and management by Petroecuador. Petroecuador's
monopoly, nondiscriminatory treatment-which         would normally facilitate the access of foreign
companies to markets-has      discouraged foreign investment flows and refinery modernization,
depreciated product quality, and elevated commercialization and marketing costs. New private
investment and transport capabilities could easily enhance Petroecuador's production, especially
in the fields operated by them where important oil reserves have been found. Since the current
Law of Hydrocarbons already contains provisions that would allow private enterprises to
participate with Petroecuador, complementary legislation i s recommended to end Petroecudor's
monopoly, to promote greater competition, and to provide incentives to invest in refineries and
new distribution and marketinginstallations.
62.     During2003 and 2004, high international oil prices provided revenues larger than those
originally budgeted, allowing for easier fiscal management and the creation of the FEIREP.
Meanwhile, the decisions to readjust domestic prices, liberalize the supply chain, and reduce
Petroecuador inefficiencies were postponed. Petroecuador's production of crude oil and refined
products has decreased by more than 8 percent each year. Imports of diesel are increasing,
whereas fuel oil exports are diminishing. The opening of the OCP in November 2003 has,
however, permitted an increase of oil production from private companies thanks to their past
investments. The GOE has confirmed its intention to allow greater private participation in the
sector. However, major issues remain. Congress has rejected several legal initiatives. The
conflict over the VAT reimbursement to a number of oil companies has become a constraint on
foreign companies to increase investment and expand capacity, in spite of the expanded transport
capacity through the OCP.

63.    Under FCCGL-I, the GOE adjusted the liquid fuel (gasoline) prices to market levels,
while maintaining the liquefied petroleum gas subsidies. It also cut Petroecuador's budget by
US$100 million (equivalent to 0.4 percent of GDP). Under FCCGL-11, it has further reduced
the Proforma budget to Petroecuador by no less than US$lOO million. To increase transparency,
Petroecuador recently opened a website, and MEF published subsidies to the oil sector, while
reclassifying oil revenues as capital spending in the 2005 Budget Law. Similarly, and as a short-
term response, the President declared by Executive Decree the Hydrocarbon Reactivation Plan,
which aims to increase oil production to 900,000 barrels per day until 2010, incorporate new
reserves to maintain a reserve/production ratio of 25 years, and reduce the cost of fuels supplies
to the domestic market. Crucial to this strategy i s an increased contribution from the private
sector. The main components of the plan are described in Annex M. The GOE has also
completed the economic audit of Petroecuador, which makes important recommendations to
reactivate oil production. Its recommendations, however, have barely started to be applied. If
the launching of the Hydrocarbon Reactivation Plan meets early success, by 2005 the production
from Petroecuador fields could increase up to approximately 18,000 barrels per day. Under the
plan, the first year would be mainly dedicated to bidding procedures, greater output increases
would be reflectedonly from 2006 onward.
64.    Enforcing Environmental Regulations in the Oil Sector.               Weak environmental
management within the oil sector continues to constrain sustainable development activities. New
oil exploration and production must incorporate state-of-the-art technologies developed by
private companies, consultations with local communities, participatory monitoring and follow-
up, and the best available environmental practices in order to prevent serious adverse
environmental impacts. The previous measures are being complemented by proper enforcement
of required environmental regulations.       Ecuador has an adequate legal framework for oil
environmental regulations. The Law on Environmental Management was approved in July 1999
to regulate the execution of industrial projects. Moreover, the Environmental Regulations on
Hydrocarbon Operations were approved in February 2001 to regulate the development of
petroleum industry activities involving environmental and social management.             Its main
modification was the raising of environmental standards to international levels, with special
emphasis on the injection of formation waters, emissions monitoring, environmental remedies,
and auditing procedures.
65.     Regulations for the Consultation and Participation of the Indigenous Populations in
Hydrocarbon Activities were approved in December 2002. These clarify the rights of local
communities, particularly indigenous people, to be consulted prior to the biddingprocess for new
oil exploration and exploitation contracts, and before executing the activities for each
hydrocarbon phase prior to delivery of the environmental impact study to the Undersecretary of
Environmental Protection. The consultations intend to (a) compile the concerns of the affected
populations about the prevention of environmental damage, mitigation, control, compensation,
and rehabilitation, and the positive impacts that the project might bring to their area; and (b)
assess the social and environmental implications of new oil projects through the preparation of
an Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan in a tripartite dialogue
among government, industry, and communities.               A participatory assessment of the
implementation of regulations during its first year i s strongly advised. These regulations cover
all new contracts to be developed by Petroecuador andor private-foreign            or domestic-
enterprises established in the oil industry, and are to be enforced by the Ministry o f Energy and
Mines and the Ministry of Environment.


                                                 25

66.     Under FCCGL-I, the Government agreed to prepare and publish the environmental
studies and management plans required by such regulations under a consultative and
participatory framework.      Significant progress has been achieved in compliance with these
regulations (see Annex M). Under FCCGL-11, in 2004, the Ministry of Energy and Mines
(MEM) approved and published a total of 273 required environmental impact studies and
environmental management plans prepared by Petroecuador and/or contractors for new oil
investments. N o fewer than 104 stakeholder consultations processes were held by Petroecuador
and/or contractors for new investments.            MEM and Petroecuador have also updated their
websites and established procedures to periodically include environmental studies, plans, and
consultations with stakeholders. MEF i s expected to publish a social environmental audit of
Petroecuador on its website. In the future, MEM is expected to verify that no less than 25
percent of the problems of the environmental management plans for new oil sector investments
required by Ecuadorian environmental regulations have been properly resolved. Efforts to
improve environmental management procedures and to start a constructive dialogue with the
indigenous organizations are achieving a proper social climate for allowing larger investments.
67.     IncreasingLabor Market Flexibility. Dollarization requires special attention to labor
market flexibility and wage levels. Growth indicators show that in 2004 there was continuous
recovery from the impact of the end-of-century crises. Formal employment declined until 2000,
but has gradually risen to around the 1998 level. This recovery is partial, however, and does not
reflect migration. Half a million Ecuadorians (the most economically active population) have
immigrated to other countries, and there i s continual internal migration from the country to the
cities. The underemployment rate remains three times higher than in 1998, which reflects that a
growing number of workers work less than 40 hours a week (visible underemployment), or are
paid less than their stipulated wages (invisible underemployment). About 90 percent of private
employment is now considered as outsourced (informal). Such outcomes are partly a result of
the Economic Transformation Law, because it simplified wage policy in the private sector and
introduced new and more flexible forms of hiringthrough hourly and temporary contracts.
68.     However, the system continues to have rigidities. First, the minimum wage, established
by the National Wages Council (Consejo Nucionul de Salaries, CONADES), involves
compulsory automatic wage indexing which, in case the parties-private              sector, unions, and
Government-do       not reach an agreement, permits the Ministry of Labor to grant a minimum
annual increase above the inflation rate projected for the following year by the Central Bank.
This "exceptional" mechanism has been the rule for the last three years, but the lowering of
inflation rates has allowed smaller salary increases close to the realized inflation rate (in 2004,
the approved salary increase was 4.6 percent, slightly above the average annual inflation rate of
4.4 percent). Second, there exists Sectoral Tables that determine minimumwages per sector, and
their annual increases. Minimum wages applied for each Sectoral Table roughly follow the
adjustment rate of the national minimum wage. These increases not only have nothing to do
with productivity, but also are hardly a reasonable basis for additional increases negotiated
within each sector or as part o f collective agreements. This indexing mechanism has helped
control inflation and although its relevance for competitiveness has diminished with declining
inflation rates to international levels, still i s an obstacle to competitiveness. Third, the severance
payment system i s one of the most expensive in LAC, providing 1.25 monthly salaries per year
worked (up to 25 years), and allowing any worker hired for no less than three months a
severance payment with a surcharge of 25 percent. Finally, workers share 15 percent of the



                                                      26

firms' profits. The latter two factors are additional incentives for informal employment, and the
Government intends to reconsider them.
69.     Under FCCGL-11, last March, the GOE created a tripartite National Labor
Commission-Government,        Workers, and Businessmen-as          the consultative body regarding
labor regulations. It has also drafted a new labor code, consistent with FTA negotiations, while
approving new tertiarizacidn and hourly hiring regimes. Finally, it has approved a national
salary increase for the private sector of 2 percent, in line with the projected average inflation rate
for 2005. This work has been supported by a Labor Market study, with support from the World
Bank and IDB. Proposed reforms to the labor code would cover a few additional topics:
informal labor policy, salaries linked to labor productivity, profit sharing, training, manager
retirement, workers' pensions and indemnization, collective contracts, and bargaining methods.
Reforms should bring further labor flexibility. For instance, if future wage increases are linked
to productivity, this would simplify the wage negotiation process by no longer revising wages
according to predicted inflation only, but according to other criteria; thus minimizing the role of
the TablasSectoriaEes as reference indicators, in establishing a single minimumwage.

C. The Medium-Term Macroeconomic Outlook
70.      Over the medium term, the Bank expects Ecuador to preserve stability and growth
at about 4.0 percent from 2005 onward (Table 5). The economic cornerstone i s the new oil
pipeline, which should significantly raise oil production, exports by private companies and
government oil revenues in the next three years, helping to boost economic growth and the fiscal
accounts in the near term. Inflation fell to 2 percent in 2004, and i s expected to remain low.
According to a Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (see Annex J), high primary surpluses and
successful deployment of FEIREP funds to steadily repurchase debt will reduce public debt
ratios to approach the benchmark sustainability ceiling ratio set in the law of 40 percent by 2006.
This will remove a source of uncertainty in the economy, particularly in light of future
exogenous shocks. Lower debt and lower country risk will reduce interest payments, allowing
for more fiscal space for social expenditures. Investment and national saving ratios should
remain high at around 27-29 percent of GDP. Improvements in oil and non-oil sector
investment should raise production, while remittances and higher domestic savings should
increase national savings. Productivity gains and increased non-oil exports propelledby the FT'A
should lead to further improvements in growth, as well as on trade and current surpluses, though
remittances flows are projected to steadily decrease over time with declining migration.

71.     Continuing the economic program is critical to build a cushion against external
shocks and stimulate growth and competitiveness,while sustaining dollarization. Analysis
under the DSA are robust. If oil prices fall to a US$lS/barrel, and lower primary surpluses are
obtained, the target debt-to-GDP ratio would still be reached, but two or three years later.
Stringent fiscal and policy efforts are needed to sustain a competitive dollarized economy,
including maintaining macroeconomic stability combined with prudent government fiscal
management to improve government creditability, reduce the country risk factor, and help spur
investment.
72.     Bringing more oil production online and complying with the FEIREP debt
repurchase program has critical implicationsfor the macroeconomic outlook. With the new
oil pipeline operating, Ecuador has the potential to double its oil exports from 400,000 barrels
per day (bpd) to over 900,000 bpd, and to increase public oil revenues significantly. In 2004, in
the first year of the OCP operation, driven by higher oil prices and a 15 percent rise in output,
government oil revenues rose from US$1.7 billion to US$2.1 billion. However, just over 50
percent o f the total pipeline capacity has been used. Private investment in 2003 was lower than
expected, mostly due to legal disputes between the private firms and the government over the
application of the drawback (VAT rebate), but has recovered in 2004 inresponse to the opening
of the oil pipeline. Judicial insecurity i s also commonly cited for holding back investment.
Therefore, the rate at which the second pipeline fills up will depend on the business environment
that the government creates to encourage private sector investment in oil. Even with higher
production levels, as Ecuador's oil reserves are finite, repurchasing debt with the extra oil
revenues, rather than usingit to finance increased and unsustainable government consumption, i s
critical to maintaining the country's economic assets for future generations.
73.     In the near future, the country is at risk to adverse external shocks that could
change the macroeconomic outlook. The Ecuadorian economy remains vulnerable to external
asymmetric shocks or domestic risks that, should they materialize, could affect the economic
program. Dealing with shocks under dollarization i s different than under a non-dollarized
economy. On the one hand, due to the absence of any meaningful lender of last resort, a higher
degree of liquidity in the banking sector i s needed to reduce its vulnerability to systemic liquidity
shocks and preserve its credibility. This risk i s in part mitigated by the fact that the oil windfall
has allowed the country to build a comfortable cushion in international reserves, which would
help fend off a threat of systemic illiquidity should there be a major adverse shift in market
sentiment.    Beyond this, however, the country should study alternative ways of ensuring
protectionto the payments system in the admittedly low-probability event of a major squeeze on
banking system liquidity. On the other hand, negative external shocks might leave the real
exchange rate significantly overvalued relative to its equilibrium level. Under dollarization, the
real exchange rate correction towards equilibrium would entail a deflationary adjustment with
potential unemployment if input markets are not flexible. This raises the question of whether
such a correction would be politically infeasible, thereby threatening dollarization. This risk
would be mitigated to the extent that Ecuador continues to make progress towards achieving
nominal flexibility in fiscal spending, financial contracting, and wages. Even assuming that such
a deflationary adjustment of the real exchange rate were politically possible, the associated
change in the relative prices of tradable to non-tradables would adversely affect the solvency of
debtors in the non-tradable sectors, thus threatening banlung system solvency. The greater the
flexibility in financial contracting, the more this type of risk would be mitigated.          Possible
external shocks are


                                                 28

     0  Drop in commodity prices. The economy is most susceptible to a sharp decline in oil
        prices, which through the fiscal accounts could hurt the real economy. However, in
        coming years the stabilization fund, if functioning properly, should be able to partly
        offset drops in oil prices. In addition, the Government i s making efforts to increase its
        non-oil revenues. Aside from oil shocks, and to a lesser extent, the economy i s also
        vulnerable to non-oil terms-of-trade shocks, particularly for its other key commodities
        such as bananas and shrimp.
     0  Exchange rate appreciation. The weaker dollar since the second half of 2003 has helped
        counter Ecuador's real appreciation that occurred between 2000 and 2002; however, a
        retum to a strong dollar could hurt the economy's ability to export.             Likewise,
        competitive depreciations by neighboring countries would also affect extemal
        competitiveness, and be more damaging because Ecuador produces several of the same
        products as its neighbors. In a country preparing for a regional FTA with the United
        States, containing wages, boosting productivity with technology and skills training, and
        gaining ground in governance are essential to maintain extemal competitiveness over the
        medium term.
     0  High international interest rates. Recent hikes in international interest rates have put
        pressure on the cost of domestic credit. However, so far, reduced domestic inflation rates
        have offset these increases and allowed a reduction in real domestic interest rates.
     0  Tougher migration policies in labor-recipient countries like the United States and Spain
        could also reduce remittance inflows, which currently are the second-largest foreign
        currency eamer after oil. Nevertheless, remittances have shown a significant degree of
        resilience.


                                      IV. The Proposed Loan

A. Rationale for Bank Involvement

74.     The Bank has long experience in supporting Ecuador's structural reforms, and
dollarization makes them essential for price stability and economic recovery. Political
constraints and adverse circumstances have at times prevented several administrations from
makingEcuador a good performer. The dollarization of the economy has given Authorities a
unique opportunity to change the previous poor country record, and they are taking it. Not only
i s responsible fiscal policy the single policy instrument available to deal with exogenous shocks,
but sound structural' reforms are the only tools to obtain and preserve gains in productivity, and
bringflexibility to the factors of production, especially labor, while preparingto face an eventual
slowdown of the economy or enjoy full benefits from an FTA with the United States.
75.     The previous loan, FCCGL-I, endorsed the new Government's agenda, and
contributed to the design of the basic framework for fiscal sustainability and faster and
competitive growth. The FCCGL-I was a one-tranche adjustment loan of US$50 million. The
objectives of the GOE's Program are reflected in FCCGL-1's two main pillars, now preserved
under FCCGL-11. The first is achieving fiscal consolidation through: (a) a rules-based fiscal
policy; (b) improved tax administration; (c) austere expenditure management with transparency
and accountability, including tight control of the wage bill; and (d) prudent, rule-based, and
transparent debt management. The second i s promoting faster growth with competitiveness



                                                  29

based on (a) trade reform policies, (b) solid pricing and regulatory policies to attract investment
in key basic infrastructure sectors, and (c) increased labor market flexibility.                      The actions
supported in the first stage were initial steps for laying the institutional foundations of deeper
reforms that would be neededover the next several years if Ecuador i s to realize its development
potential. Given the weakness of the legal and institutional framework in place after years of
political conflict and poor governance, and the short time span after the arrival of the new
authorities, the FCCGL-I necessarily emphasized process measures: it focused primarily on
strategy and policy formulation; the preparation of key laws, regulations, and actions; and the
initiation of institutional reforms and needed price adjustments, rather than concrete outcomes.
FCCGL-I1 builds upon these measures, consolidates those processes, regulates approved laws,
and shifts the focus of the programtoward obtaining initial results on the ground.
76.       According to the Implementation Completion Report (ICR), the FCCGL-I has
made significant inroads in the implementation of the structural agenda In fact, a number
of its specific objectives were carried over from uncompleted components of the Structural
Adjustment Loan (SAL) approved in 2001,6or complemented a few structural benchmarks of the
previous SBA between Ecuador and the IMF(Annex Q). Obviously, reforms on these fronts are
still ongoing, and their full results still have to materialize, but they are now well grounded and
heading in the right direction. The ICR also recognized that "the Government could be more
proactive inbuildingthe public consensusand gaining the political support it needs to achieve its
reform objectives."        The proposed FCCGL-I1 now assures continued progress, building on
Ecuador's early positive results on fiscal consolidation and deepening of structural reforms. It i s
expected that future reforms along that path will be supported through this and the subsequent
operation.

B. Objectives and Sequencing

77.       The proposed adjustment loan will continue supporting the Multiyear
Government's Program adjusted below (Table 6 and Annex D) and in the Letter of
Development Policy (Annex E). The loan i s based on structural reform measures that have
been implemented by the Government prior to Board presentation. The medium-termobjectives
of the FCCGL-I1remain to: (a) correct an unsustainable fiscal position, (b) reduce the country's
high debt levels, (c) upgrade its creditworthiness, (d) improve its competitiveness, and (e)
achieve high growth for poverty reduction. The continuity to a second stage i s well justified by
significant progress achieved in the implementation of benchmarks and further actions agreed
with the Bank in the comprehensive matrix of policy reforms of the first operation (Annex C). In
the short term, this fiscal support would helpcontinue clearing the remaining short-term liquidity
fiscal problem, while supporting the trade reform agenda that the country needs inits negotiation
of an FTA with the United States, and creating fiscal room for smoothing the social costs of


6. The 2001 S A L achieved little or no progress in three critical areas: tax reform, expenditure control, and private
   participation in telecommunications and electricity. Severe policy slippages occurred: the approval of large
   increases in the wage bill and social security benefits, the granting o f new revenue earmarking and discretionary
   tax cuts, and the freezing of electricity and telecommunications tariffs in April, also prevented the signing of a
   new SBA with the IMF, led to the suspension of the loan in the first semester of 2002, and finally led to the
   cancellation of two floating tranches of the S A L geared to tax reform and public enterprise reform. Only upon
   arrival of the new Government did the country comply with the remaining conditions for disbursement, and the
   final trancheof the S A L was disbursedinearly 2003.

adjustment both in this operation and in a parallel Programmatic Human Development Sector
Loan.
78.        In support of completion of the Multiyear Government's Program, and as part of
the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the Bank envisions a third adjustment operation,
to be prepared over the next year. While the first phase of the Government's Programfocused
on short-term adjustment aspects required to put the economy on a path of fiscal sustainability
and debt solvency, the second phase-supported                  by this operation-is                 consolidating and
deepening the structural reforms in the areas of fiscal and debt management and transparency,
labor, trade reform, and pricing, and regulatory policies needed to attract private sector
participation. To keep a sound track, FCCGL-I1 also defines benchmarks for a third operation.
Insupport of the third (and last) phase, FCCGL-I11 also foresees continuingto provide intensive
technical assistance in the design and implementation of each sector policy and strategy, the
adoption of the legal and regulatory framework that completes the framework for reforms, the
realizationof consensus-building activities with civil society, and the upgrade of policy tools that
will facilitate achievement of a transparent and participatory budget and FEIREP management,
procurement and Customs modernization reform, and swift implementation of the FTA with the
UnitedStates.

C. LoanStages and Components

79.        The overall Government program covers the two areas discussed above: fiscal
consolidation and faster growth with competitiveness. Although the program has specific
measuresassignedto both areas, as indicatedinthe Letter of Development Policy (see Annex E),
there i s a reduced set of key prior actions adopted for this operation, and benchmarks among
an anticipated set of actions under the third phase of the Multiyear Government's Program.
Those actions are interrelated and represent the blueprintof core policy actions to be taken by the
overall Multiyear Government's Program. The list of other future policy actions (milestones)
may be modified as the Government faces constraints through further implementation of its
reform agenda (see Annex D).
80.        More specifically, the first phase of the Government's Program, supported by
FCCGL-I,emphasized fiscal sustainability becauseitwas most urgent for price stability. It
defined an overall macroeconomic framework and a comprehensive program that was consistent
with budget constraints. Specific policies on the revenue side focused on modernizing tax and



                                                              32

Customs administration. On expenditure management, reforms to address the liquidity fiscal
problem led to an emergency austerity Executive Decree and obtaining from Congress a 2003
budget that was consistent with its norms. Because the austerity Decree was insufficient to halt
the main cause of expansionary spending, the wage bill, Congress also approved a Public Wage
Unification Law and its amendments submitted by the Executive. On public debt, the clearance
of external and domestic arrears accumulated up to February and March 2003 contributed to
successful Paris Club negotiations last year. To complete fiscal measures, officials prepared a
Transparency Plan that produced, in 2003, preliminary reporting of executed expenditure, and
allowed, from 2004 on, the opening of an MEFwebsite (portal)of CG accounts. This operation
also supported structural changes in the            areas of trade reform,       electricity, and
telecommunications.     With respect to trade reform, the Government reversed decisions that
raised tariff dispersion and effective protection by end-2002. It unified all import licenses, and
committed to eliminating those that have been unused for several decades, a critical measure for
complying with WTO standards.          With respect to electricity and telecommunications, the
Government adjusted power rates, and prepared a strategy to increase the efficiency of the public
telephone companies.
81.     The second phase of the Government's Program, supported by this operation,
deepens progress achieved in FCCGL-I, and sets the stage for consolidating not only the
fiscal stance, but structural reforms in the medium term. On the revenue side, measures to
broaden the tax base, improve tax administration, and modernize Customs have contributed to
remarkably raising their collection in real terms. On the expenditure side, the austerity measures
have been extended and broadened to 2005, with a salary freeze prevailing in most sectors. In
parallel, the Government reached a major milestone in public wage and human resource
management reform, by passing a new civil service and wage unification law, completing the
staffing reviews of ministries accounting for about half of the Central Government's labor force,
unifying salary benefits, and standardizing salary categories, all this with little or no fiscal
impact.    The transparency and debt-reduction components of the loan were strengthened.
Officials implemented their transparency plan satisfactorily. They also complied with the fiscal
rule by allocating 70 percent of resources transferred to FEIREPto debt reduction, thus resisting
strong populist attempts to modify the rule during 2004. On the growth and competitiveness
front, trade reform measures continued to be adopted, preparing a trade strategy to guide FTA
negotiations, eliminating the number of import licenses, and opening an electronic import
licensing approval system that has significantly reduced the time devoted to their processing
from up to two months to less than two weeks. Power tariff adjustments continued, leading to an
average tariff that now reflects the economic cost, while preserving a cross-subsidy for poor
household consumers. In addition, a private company was hired to manage Telecsa, the new
mobile phone company.       Finally, the Government, under a consultative process, created a
National Labor Commission that has spearheaded the implementation of labor market reforms,
all in agreement with the FTA.
82.     The third phase of the Government's Program would emphasize maintaining a
sustainable fiscal stance and deepening structuralreforms for competitiveness and growth.
Complying with the program i s essential for Ecuador to build credibility, build a cushion against
an eventual fall in oil prices and re-enter international capital markets. B y end-2005, on the
fiscal consolidation front, it i s expected that the GOE would have executed the budget in
compliance with the quantitative targets set up in the program under the Intensified Surveillance
Mechanism and the austerity norms. Tax revenue i s projected to grow at least at a 7.5 percent


                                                 33

annual increase and current spendingin salaries and goods and services represents no more than
8 percent of GDP. Debt sustainability would be strengthened by devoting, again, no less than 70
percent of resources transferred to FEIREPto debt reduction, with a view to reach a public debt
to GDP ratio at or below 44.1 percent of GDP. A LAC innovative civil service reform would
have controlled and stopped an expansionary payroll. Budget management would also be fully
transparent under participatory processes and improved websites, thus contributing to reduce
corruption. .On the structural front, the trade strategy would be under full implementation with
the expected conclusion of negotiations of the FTA with the United States, the electronic
approval system for import licenses would be fully operational, power tariffs would continue to
match their average economic cost, while conditions for a lower subsidyand increasedefficiency
are set up. The Labor Ministry would continue linking salary adjustments to the inflation rate
and a modem labor code will bring further flexibility to the private labor market. All actions
would have a renewed emphasis on accountability, transparency, and promotion of civil society
participation, including an upgraded role for the Fiscal Policy and newly to be created Customs
Observatories.

D. Linksto the CAS and other BankOperations

83.      The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ecuador has identified three pillars of the
Government's agenda: (a) consolidating the macroeconomic framework to lay the foundation for
diversified and sustainable growth and poverty reduction, (b) making needed structural reforms
socially sustainable and mitigating their impact on the poor and the vulnerable, and (c)
strengthening governance and helping officials build an accountable and efficient government
the services of which are accessible to all Ecuadorians. The present operation fits in the first
pillar, the parallel Bank Programmatic operation on Human Development Sector Reform fits in
the secondpillar, and both operations propose measures to address institutional constraints (third
pillar) that are supported by a recently approved Institutional Reform Project. The CAS was
approved by the Boardon 27 May 2003.
84.      The Programmatic Loan on Human Development Sector Reform has objectives
complementary to this operation. It aims to protect the most vulnerable during adjustment,
and to support the design and implementation of structural changes in the social sectors, to
increase the effectiveness and efficiency of basic social programs, and promote consultation,
transparency, and accountability inthe social sectors and priority programs. More specifically, it
assures minimum levels of budgeted public spending in priority social sectors-education,
health, and social welfare-and    programs; extends coverage and improves targeting of social
services; and improves transparency in the administration of resources, and facilitates access to
information by managers and usersheneficiaries.
85.      The Institutional Reform Project also has direct objectives complementary to this
operation.     It aims to create capacity building in achieving a more efficient, effective,
transparent, and accountable public service in four areas: customs, civil service, e-procurement,
and Petroecuador management.        The approved loan will thus enable the GOE to finance
complementary needs-investment       and technical assistance-embedded under both adjustment
operations-the    FCCGL-I1and the human development. These four areas also fit into a broader
program of state modernization and anticorruption efforts.




                                                 34

86.     Coordination     with    other    Bank activities     in Ecuador,      currently under
implementation or preparation, and donors will be assured. Policy-based credits would be
complemented by other instruments, such as technical assistance and investment credits directed
toward solving some other institutional problems or investment needs of the areas affected by
this loan. Two other Bank operations are related to this operation. In close collaboration with
USAID, the Public Sector Financial Management Technical Assistance project is providing
assistance in introducing improved budget monitoring and consolidation through the SIGEF-
Institutional system in several key autonomous agencies, and integrating these more fully into
the SIGEF-Global network. SIGEF has been instrumental in the opening of the MEF website.
The Bank Project PROMEC in the electricity sector i s providing assistance to the institutional
modernization o f the sector, and i s implemented in close collaboration with the IDB. The Bank
proposed Trade and Competitiveness Assistance Loan would also include actions to increase
competitiveness and reduce electricity tariffs or their subsidy, and to lower sector risks.   On
analytical and advisory activities, the Bank completed: (a) a set of Policy Notes, covering 18
topics underlying the design of the CAS and the two operations; (b) a Development Policy
Review that assesses progress of the reform agenda during its first year of implementation and
builds medium-term policy scenarios; (c) an Investment Climate Assessment that identifies
micro-constraints for private investment; (d) a Poverty Assessment, that measures recent trends
inpoverty post-dollarization; (e) a Public Expenditure Review, that explores options for creating
additional fiscal space for poverty reduction; and (f)a Labor Market Study, which has provided
the basis for consultations on labor market reform. The Government has also requested specific
Bank assistance for the groundwork for the preparation of an FTA with the United States. The
Bank has also secured funding to support budget and public expenditure transparency and civic
participation in fiscal debate through two trust funds. A Trust Fund for the Social Sectors and
Environment (TFSSED) Grant will support the GOE and the Fiscal Policy Observatory to
expand the dialogue on budget and fiscal policy issues involving civil society organizations and
media, and the enhancement of the MEF's Transparency Portal. A Japan Social Development
Fund(JSDF) Grant will fundsocial audits andfiscal literacy at the local level.
87.      Collaboration with the IMF. A detailed IMF-World Bank-IDB review of joint
responsibilities in key areas of structural reform i s enclosed (see Annex Q). This operation was
prepared in parallelto and inclose coordination with the IMF,initially with the team incharge of
the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), and later with the team that prepared the ISM. This required
an extraordinary amount of bilateral technical dialogue, coordinated views, and joint missions
between both institutions and with officials, who welcome such efforts. Topics of common
preparation have been the surveillance of compliance with the Fiscal Law, tax and Customs
reforms, the austerity measures, the Civil Service and Public Sector Wage Unification Law,
FEIREP management, and oil sector reform.              Whereas the I S M strictly focuses on the
macroeconomic program to be implemented in 2005, the GOE's Multiyear Program agreed with
the Bank brings continuity to key structural adjustment efforts over the medium term, while
identifyinginstitutional capacity and providing assistance to areas where the Bank has proper
technical and financing expertise, such as Customs and budget modernization, civil service and
labor market reforms, trade reform, and private participation in basic infrastructure and oil
sectors. Finally, close collaboration with the IMF has occurred in the areas o f (a) pension
reform through- the Bank's Programmatic Loan on Human Development; (b) financial sector
reform, through joint efforts made in the preparation of a Financial Sector Assessment Program;




                                                 35

and (c) fiscal management, through parallel dissemination of the IMFReport on the Observance
of Standard and Codes (ROSC) and PER.
88.      Coordination with other multilateral institutions.            Two other multilateral
institutions-the   IDB and the Corporucidn Andinu de Fomento (CAF)-have           also announced
their intention to contribute to financing a support package of about US$lSO million in 2005 to
fill the fiscal financing gap. The IDB is preparing two operations, one on competitiveness and
another in the social sector. The former operation aims to support capacity building for the
implementation of the FTA, bureaucratic simplifications, customs and labor market reform. The
latter operation would be prepared in parallel to the second stage of the Bank's Programmatic
operations on human development, and i s mostly focused on strengthening the social safety net,
protecting public spending in the social sectors, and promoting some structural changes in
education and in labor markets. The World Bank and the IDB have jointly prepared a Country
Financial and Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the PER. Teams from both organizations
have been working closely to assure maximum coordination between the two institutions,
including joint missions and meetings with Government officials to discuss the contents of the
tasks. The CAF has also provided fast-disbursing resources for fiscal adjustment and economic
recovery, and has closely interacted with the Bank on proposals for restructuring public debt.

E. Arrangementsfor Management, Implementation, andSupervision

89.      The Government of Ecuador would be the Borrower of the proposed Adjustment
Loan and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) would be the principal executing
agency, and would have overall responsibility for coordinating and overseeing all aspects of the
Program. The Central Bank; the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Fishing (MICIP); the
Ministry of Urban Development and Housing (MIDUVI); the Ministry of Labor (ML); the
Foreign Trade and Investment Council (COMEXI); the National Secretariat for Human
Resources (SENRES); the National Electricity Council (CONELEC); the Telecom National
Council (CONATEL); the National Council for Modernization of the State (CONAM); the
Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM); the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); and the FEIREP
Board (CEIREP) would also have key complementary roles inexecuting the program, and would
work closely with the MEF in executing program components under their respective
jurisdictions. The MEF would be responsible for providing periodic reports to the participant's
public agencies on overall program progress, and for informing the Government and the Bank.
The GOE and the Bank would consult on progress quarterly duringimplementation. The closing
date of the loan would be 31 December 2005.
90.      Ecuador has improved its record of implementing adjustment operations with the
Bank. However, a single-tranche approach to adjustment lendingis preservedfor this operation.
Itbases Bank support on actions the Government has already taken, rather than on conditions of
future actions. This provides an opportunity for the Government to continue building a track
record by demonstrating its commitment to reforms, and for the Bank to provide financial
support aligned to the strength and pace of the Government's reform. This single-tranche
approach incorporates lessons learned from previous adjustment operations, and from the
Operation Evaluation Department's 1999 Country Assistance Evaluation. Implementationof the
Multiyear Government's Program would be monitored through frequent missions (every two
months) and continuous supervision through videoconference technology facilities of the



                                                36

information system of the country office.           Although supervision has mainly focused on
fulfillment of policy results and benchmarks, the presence of policy reversals and the
implementation of other anticipated actions have continually been assessed. Moreover, ad hoc
comments on draft bills and in situ reviews have been supported by technical assistance and
advisory services carried out during supervision missions, previously requested by officials.
Immediately following disbursement of the second loan, the GOE would initiate work on the
actions contained in the third phase of its program. A detailed schedule of these activities and
budget would be prepared with the Bank's support at that time. Financing of these activities may
be sought through the Project Preparation Facility of future Programmatic or Technical
Assistance Loan (TAL) operations or, if possible, through Public Human Resources
Development (PHRD) grants to specific activities, especially inthe area of fiscal transparency.

F. Consultations with Stakeholders

91.     Consultations with civil society have taken place in stages. The preparation of the
operation has opened extraordinary opportunities for the Government to lead an ongoing
dialogue with civil society organizations on how best to involve the Bank's support in fiscal
growth and poverty-reduction programs. Consultations took place at several stages. They
                                   '
accompanied implementation of the previous S A L during 2002. Then, in January 2003, a one-
day workshop with the incoming officials, advisors, academia, the private sector, and selected
civil society representatives on the presentation of the Policy Notes provided a unique
opportunity to exchange views openly and candidly on the country's development agenda. A
week after the Government took office, the Bank's representative in Ecuador participated in the
National Dialogue that has examined some of the topics considered by this operation.               In
February-March, CAS consultations on FCCGL-Itook place with civil society in several parts of
the country, providing valuable insights about the perception of civil society about the Bank's
work and role in Ecuador. Then, in September, the wide dissemination of the CAS and the
Policy Notes led to a broad dialogue with multiple civil society representatives in Cuenca,
Guayaquil, and Quito. Finally, a two-day workshop took place during 16-17 March 2004 to
develop consultations with the private sector, NGOs, indigenous peoples, think tanks, and other
civil society representatives on FCCGL-11. Their opinions and reactions provided many valuable
contributions to the final shaping of the agenda of reforms (Annex R).

G. Environmental, Social and FinancialManagement Arrangements

92.     ENVIRONMENTAL      ASSESSMENT. operation is a structural adjustment loan. The loan
                                            This
supports fiscal and regulatory changes that do not have environmental impacts. OD8.60 applies,
 and no environmental assessmenti s required.
93.      SOCIAL ASSESSMENT.        The Bank finalized a Poverty Assessment (PA), which serves as
the background document to a broad poverty and social impact analysis for Ecuador (Annex G).
The PA primarily identifies the most vulnerable areas and provides a diagnostic of the current
 social situation, concentrated on social services and the poor. Reforms entail social and
 distributional impacts, but it i s not possible to quantify them. To calibrate the social impact, the
 loan will continue supporting an enhanced consultation with and informed participation of civil
 society in reform decisions in many areas including, inter alia, budget policy, Customs reform,
civil service modernization, free trade agreements, procurement and proposed reforms in oil


                                                    37

environment management and private participation in infrastructure.            To deal with the
distributional impact, (i) growth-with
                           higher                 a significant 5 percent of GDP increase in per-
capita income in 2004-will       consolidate the declining trend in the poverty rate; (ii)lower
inflation rates will benefit the poor; (iii)the additional fiscal space created with this operation
will contribute to increased spending in social programs targeted at the poor, with Bank support
to the GOE in improving targeting tools through the HD programmatic loan; and (iv)
compensatory measures-including        cross-subsidies in the power sector benefiting poorest
households-will    contribute to offset negative impacts of reforms in low-income groups. In
2005, and in support of the preparation of the third operation, an ongoing Bank Country Social
Analysis will make a contribution to better understand the social and distributional impact of the
actions adopted under the loans. Together with the ongoing Country Environmental Analysis, it
i s expected that their findings will be fully integrated into the next operation and placed into
discussion duringconsultations with civil society.
94.     FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. Country Financial Accountability Assessment was
                                        A
conducted in 2004 and concluded that Ecuador i s recording slow but gradual advances in
financial management reform and transparency. Nevertheless, the diagnostic identified gaps in
the quality and relevance of financial information, oversight, and overall transparency and
accountability between generally accepted performance measures and actual practices in
Ecuador. Included among the deficiencies were: (a) a fragmented legal framework due to rapid
proliferation of norms and regulations; (b) a significant volume of government activities i s not
covered by the budget; (c) lack of commitment controls during budget execution; (d) insufficient
reliable and timely information on budget execution; (e) a weak internal control framework; (f)
external audits of entities' financial statements are limited in frequency, scope, and depth; and
(8) external financial audits of budget execution and the consolidated financial statements are not
performed.
95.     The Government's program and reform agenda includes a governance pillar, which
focuses on the fight against comption and seeks to improve transparency. The program for
Public Financial Management (PFM) improvement i s fully owned and currently being
implemented, including: (a) passage in 2002 of two important pieces of legislation concerning
public financial management which have helped to strengthen the legal and regulatory
framework: the FTSRL, and the Organic Control Law (LOCGE) and their accompanying
regulations. The Organic Control Law empowers the Supreme Audit Institution with operational
independence, financial autonomy, and access to the full range of state entities; (b) reactivation
of the reform of the Integrated Government Financial Management System (SIGEF) (which i s
being financed by the World Bank under a technical Assistance Loan), in order to improve
efficiency of operations and promote transparency and accountability. Implementation of the
SIGEF has brought some order to the administrative and financial functions at the executing unit
level; (c) strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Controller General's Office through
SIGEF; (d) implementation of a Transparency Plan which i s providing virtual access to reports
of execution of budget expenditures; and (e) administration of the official bank accounts by the
Central Bank, which guarantees the Treasury authorities an adequate mechanism to control
available funds. In addition, implementation of the Single Treasury Account has facilitated an
important reduction in idle funds and has provided a mechanism for increased efficiency in the
payments to suppliers and other beneficiaries.

96.     Under FCCGL-11,two areas have been singled out for attention under this operation as
being critical to support ongoing government initiatives, and have been included as part of the

         must improve its scrutiny of government expenditure by asserting its independence.
         Hence, the Consolidated Statement of Budget Execution for 2002 was subject to an
         external audit by the Comptroller General of the Republic and published on the
         Comptroller's website. B y December 2005, a similar exercise on the 2003 and 2004
         budgets should be completed and published.

                    AUDIT. The auditing of line
         and responsibilities of internal and external audits.     In addition, the functioning of
         adequately staffed internal audit units in line ministries should be strengthened. B y
         December 2005, the Controller General in conjunction with line ministries, should
         implement a systematic approach to evaluation, management, and control of risks, by
         strengthening the intemal audit units within selected priority line ministries, providing
         them with adequate staff (numbers and profiles), and establishing procedures for
         conducting day-to-day oversight of budget execution.
97.      PROCUREMENT.      In the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)-dated         April
2000-the     overall procurement risk of Ecuador's portfolio i s rated high. The GOE accepted the
CPAR's recommendations, thereby being willing to implement specific actions to increase
transparency and fiscal savings in public procurement processes. A draft new Procurement Law
has been prepared by an inter-institutional Commission.          An update of the CPAR i s also
scheduled for fiscal year 2005. Specific actions supported by this loan are described below (see
Annex D).

H. LoanDisbursement

98.      THE ADJUSTMENT LOAN AMOUNTS TO US$lOO MILLION.                The entire amount will be
disbursedupon loan effectiveness, soon after approval. The preparation of a future operation for
the third stage, and the specification of its amount would be decided as a function of the
country's performance under the Bank's country strategy and under the Multiyear Government's
Program. The basis for the preparation of these loans will be the fulfillment of benchmarks
described in the matrix of multiyear key prior actions and future benchmarks (Table 6).
Disbursement arrangements for the present operation would follow the simplified procedures
established on the SALs/Sectoral Expenditure Credit and Adjustment Loans (SECALs) approved
by the Board on 1February 1996. The Borrower will open an account in Ecuador's Central
Bank (Banco Central del Ecuador). Once the Bank formally notifies the borrower that a tranche
i s available for withdrawal, the borrower may submit a simplified withdrawal application so that
the proceeds of the tranche are deposited by the Bank in this account, for use in accordance with
the Loan Agreement. Disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases, and supporting
evidence for disbursements i s therefore not required. The proceeds of the loan may not be used
to finance expenditures typically excluded under the Loan Agreement. Although a routine audit
of the deposit account would not be required, the Bank reserves the right to request that an audit
be conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, by an independent firm

acceptable to the Bank. If requested, the audit will be performed in accordance with terms of
reference approved by the Bank.


I.BenefitsandRisks
99.      The main expected benefits of the reform program should fully materialize in 2005,
supported the next operation. The Bank expects to achieve fiscal consolidation and complete
structural policies set up in this operation in the areas of civil service, budget transparency, debt
management, trade, electricity and labor market reforms (see Table 7).

                         fully transparent on the website.

 Trade reform            Successful implementation of the trade strategy, including reduced time to process import licenses
                         to no more than 10days, as the electronic system of import licenses becomes fully effective.

 Power sector reform     Continued transparent subsidy to electncity tanffs and consumption by poorest households, and
                         improved financial sustanability, with lower debts and reduced operational deficits of power
                         companies

 Labor market            Salary adjustments in line with the inflation rate and new norms regulating the labor markets,
 reform                  consistent with FTA negotiations



 100.    Fiscal consolidation should lead to a lower debt ratio approaching its benchmark 40
percent of GDP as indicated in the fiscal rule. In 2005, a combination of tax administration
measuresthat are expected to raise the tax revenue ratio to 12 percent of GDP, with expenditure
 measures that should continue curbing current spending in wages and goods and services at or
below 8 percent of GDP, would provide a necessary cushion against eventually lower fiscal
revenuesresultingfrom a possible fall in oil prices. The projected primary surplus of 4.9 percent
 of GDP (floor) would contribute to start the external debt buyback program and reduce the
public debt to GDP ratio on or below 44.1 percent of GDP. Inaddition, Ecuador should improve
its rankings in budget transparency, expand the use of CONTRATANET, and materialize the

savings of a successful and innovative civil service reform. Improved competitiveness and
markets flexibility should result from the implementationof policiesderived from the trade
strategy. This i s true especially in the sixteen areas covered by the FTA with the U.S., whose
negotiations are scheduled to conclude this year (see Annex K). Main expected outputs include a
significantly reduced time for processing electronic import licenses, higher operational surpluses
(or lower deficits) in power distribution companies that are approaching international standards
in billing recovery levels, and modem regulations that would increase hiring flexibility in the
private labor market.
101. All prior actions under this operation have been achieved on or before December
2004, but the future risks of external shocks or policy reversals or weak implementation of
thisMultiyear Government'sProgramare non-negligible. Onone hand, the programalready
faces a number of external risks that may pose a threat to fiscal consolidation and economic
recovery. Possible external shocks were described above (see paragraph 73). In addition to
these, there are several domestic risks that might lead Ecuador to depart from the program of
reforms agreed under this operation. Domestic risks are rooted in long-standing bad governance
and inthe highlevels of poverty and inequity still prevailing inEcuador. Inparticular:

    0   Political risk. The recent Supreme Court reshuffle in November 2004 could lead to a
        prolonged Constitutional debate that will raise uncertainty, break up the fragile coalition
        that supports President Gutitrrez in Congress. The decision to have a referendum on the
        Judicial (and political) system will also test the political opposition. It i s impossible to
        predict whether the actual political instability will last long and how it will affect the
        Government's agenda and Cabinet composition.

    0   Social risk. Three years of austerity norms could also lead to adjustment "fatigue," and
        ensuing political unrest, coupled with populist pressures for relaxing spending or
        modifying the use of FEIREP's proceeds, could prevent the government from preserving
        austerity or completing further structural change.

    0   Zmplementation risk. Given Ecuador's past performance, there might be a strong need to
        support limited local capacity of officials in developing such a comprehensive program
        rapidly and successfully. This risk could weaken prospects for complying with the
        program of reforms agreed under this or other adjustment operations, or under the
        incoming Free Trade Agrement with the United States in2005.

    0   External risks. Given dollarization and the absence of any meaningful lender of last
        resort for the banlung sector, external economic shocks-especially a severe decline in
        the price of oil, competitive depreciations by neighbouring countries, rising international
        interest rates, or partial sudden stops in capital flows to the region (see paragraph 73)-
        might make continuous fiscal consolidation socially unbearable and put the fragile
        banlung recovery at risk.

    0   Debt overhang risk. High debt service could affect fiscal sustainability and impede
        Ecuador from fully clearing past arrears, or could engender the accumulation of new
        arrears inthe near term.

102. FCCGL-I1provides buffers to mitigate these risks. Policy reversals were successfully
prevented in 2003 and 2004; however, backtracking attempts to stop swift implementation of
further stages of the Multiyear Government's Program remain likely. Mitigating actions for the



                                                 41

political risk are recent decisions that have consolidated President GutiCn-ez's open alliance with
the parties PRE, PRIAN, DP, MPD, Socialism0 and other independent Congressmen and
continuing dialogues that the GOE, with the support of the Bank and other donors, has developed
with members of Congress, political forces, and indigenous organizations on the bills or actions
submittedas part of the agenda of reforms. To mitigate social risk, the GOE approved small and
selective salary and pension adjustments and committed with union and indigenous leaders to
bringing forward the governance agenda through 2005. The government also hopes to limit the
impact of its policy actions with faster growth and higher employment and, with the
materialization of projected fiscal savings increase social spending, widen the tax base, and
enhance targeting and delivery effectiveness of basic public services, especially through
compensatory measures. These efforts are complemented by the Bank's continuous dialogue
with representatives of civil society, and close assistance to the government inreformulating and
implementing social protection programs aimed at protecting the poor and the most vulnerable
groups and in bringing full transparency on the budget and on the content of free trade
negotiations. To mitigate weak local implementation capacity, the Bank i s combining several
instruments,such as technical and investment assistance, grants for building capacity, increased
supervision, joint missions with the IMF,and analytical and advisory activities and training. To
mitigate external shocks, in the absence of monetary policy, the Government i s strengthening
fiscal balances, promptly repaying debt and preparing for repurchasing expensive Global bonds
and issuing new bonds in international markets. A Restructuring Debt Plan was announced by
president GutiCn-ez in January 2005. Moreover, it i s increasing the share of non-oil fiscal
revenues, diversifying non-oil exports, strengthening prudential regulations, increasing labor
market flexibility, and encouraging competitiveness and private participation in key investment
sectors. To offset a potential debt overhang, the Bank i s supporting Ecuador in improving its
capacity to respond to shocks countercyclically by replenishing the oil stabilization fund and
increasing reserves, and using those proceeds in accordance with the fiscal rule. Ecuador has
also enhanced debt management, completed bilateral debt reduction agreements with Paris Club
members, and defined a transparent policy framework for debt buybacks.

     n e Ecuadorian govemment remains strongly committed to the. goals of

     macroeconomic stability and fiscal prudence and sustainability. The govemment also

     attach- a highpriority to improvements in competitiveness-as   the basis for swtajned

     and solid economic growth4hrough the impkmmtation of structural reforms, and to

    the continuedstrengthening o f thefinancial system. Our economic program for 2005

     seeks to consolidate recent macroeconomic and fiscalgainswhile advancingthe process

     of structural reforms inkey areas, including inthe hancial system. We have askedthe

    InternationalMonetary Fundto monitor compliance with our macroeconomic program

    onaquarterly basis.



    The macroeconomic framework for 2005 envisages moderate real GDP growth and

    progress in reducing inflationin a context of a strongexternal position. We expect real

    GDP growthto bearound3.8 percent, drivenbyacontinued expansion, dbeit at amuch

    lower pace than in 2004, of private oil production and moderate growth inthe non-oil

    sector, including through the execution of some i&astructure    projects in the energy

    sector. Average consumer price inflation is projected t o decline to 2.2 percent-well

    below the inflation level in trading partners-which  we expect to contributeto a further

    reduction in interest rates and to increased competitiveness, favoring domestic

    economic activity. hthe extemal sector, the current account i s expected to be roughly

    inbalance.


    The government's fiscal program for 2005 would allow us to achieve a significant

    primary surplus and a continued reduction of the country's public debt ratio. The       Hri,

 program includes key measures to enhance the sustainability of Ecuador's public

 fiances over the medium term, including restraint onthe growth of central government

 wages and pension subsidies and a significant reduction in revenue earmarking. The

 program aims to keep the nonoil deficit ofthe NFPS unchangedat 4.4 percento f GDP,

 andwould be consistentwith a non-financial public sector.primary surplusofabout4.9

 percent and an overall balanceof 2.3 percent. Ecuador's public debt woulddecline from

 47 percent of GDP in2004 to 45 percent in2005, ahead of the pace envisaged.by the

 Fiscal Responsibility andTransparency Law.   '




 The fiscal financing plan envisages building up a cushion to protect against an

 unexpecteddecline inthe price o f oil, and improvingliability management.Towardthis

 end, the government plansto issuebonds to foreign banks (US$375 million) and obtain

 new multilateral financing (US$380 million). We         also planning to exchange the

 high-interest 2012 global bond for lower yielding bonds with longer maturities, and to

 buy back externaldebt with the FEIREPresources.




 In order to track performance under the program throughout the year, we have

 established quarterly benchmarks for central government and " P S nonoil balances,

 central government primary expenditure, net central govemment debt, and external

 arrears. The benchmarks are outlined in the table below. We plan to transmit monthly

 data for the fiscal accounts to the Fund s   e on a timely basis to facilitate the Fund

 staffs effective monitoring of the program. Inthe event of unforeseendeviations from

                     Annex F. A PublicDebt SustainabilityAnalysis for Ecuador

         During the last 30 years, Ecuador has been struggling to control the heavy burden of
servicing its debt. Part of the problem lies in the fiscal structure the country inherited from the
military regime: a relatively large bureaucracy coupled with dependence upon highly volatile oil
revenues, subsidies, and earmarked expenditures. However, there are other reasons: persistent,
bad fiscal management practices, including sizable wage hikes inthe public sector; inflation; and
the distorted exchange policies of the past. All of these factors have conjoined to make fiscal
accounts especially vulnerable to external crises, compelling the country to default and
restructure its debt on two occasions in the 1990s. The first was in 1994, after a seven-year
suspension of debt service, with the introduction of Brady bonds, and the second was in 1998,
when Ecuador became the first country to default on its Brady bonds, necessitating restructuring
in the form of global bonds. After the second default, inJuly 2000, Ecuador offered to swap its
Brady bonds and Euro bonds, valued at US$0.60 on the dollar, for new '12- and 30-year bonds.
The 30-year global bonds would pay an initial coupon of 4 percent, increasing by 1percentage
point annually up to a maximum of 10 percent in 2006. In exchange for an additional discount
on the value of the debt, 12-year bonds were offered at a 12percent fixed coupon. The offer was
accepted andthe debt stock in bonds dropped from US$6.5 billion to US$3.9 billion.
         When compared to other deeply indebted Latin American countries, Ecuador has limited
institutional capacity for debt management: it i s more operational than analytical, lacks
transparency, i s fragmented, and coordination between the Finance Mmistry and the Central
Bank only began to be institutionalized under the management of the Fund for Stabilization,
Investment, and Public Debt Reduction (FEIREP) proceedings (see Annex K).
         Since the crisis, high nominal GDP growth and fiscal surpluses have significantly
reduced public debt ratios, but debt service i s still burdensome. The stock of public external debt
was 91 percent of GDP in 2000, more than twice the level of exports of goods and services, and
the highest in Latin America after Argentina (before the crisis).                     In spite of the debt ratio
declining to 46 percent of GDP in 2004, the debt service burdeni s still excessive (2.7 percent of
GDP in interest and 5.2 percent of GDP in amortizations), creating continuous problems of
illiquidity. About four-fifths of total debt is external debt. Of this, some 65 percent is official
d e b t 4 0 percent multilateral and 25 percent bilateral-making                it somewhat less vulnerable to
changes in emerging markets and offsetting the country's lack of access to international markets.
Nearly two-thirds of public domestic debt consists of bonds issued by the Deposit Guarantee
Agency (AGD) and the National Finance Corporation (CFN) to cover the cost o f bank
interventions during the banlung crisis. The outlook of the three major risk-rating agencies i s
that the country's ability and desire to pay have improved with dollarization, but with B- Stable
(Standard & Poors) and Caal Stable (Moody's) ratings, Ecuador i s making progress to become
eligible for a level of investment that would allow it to issue new sovereign bonds on
international capital market^.^




'.  A risk rating of C means that the issuing institution has obvious deficiencies, probably related to the quality of
     its assets or the poor structuring of its accounts (fiscal in this case). This leads to a considerable degree of
     uncertainty andreasonabledoubts regardingits ability to confront additional problems in the future.

         Complying with the Fiscal Transparency, Stabilization, and Responsibility Law (FTSRL)
i s essential for debt sustainability. The law determines that a ratio of 40 percent of debt to GDP
i s consistent with a sustainable debt path. Barring any strong shocks, this i s achievable by 2006.
Based on several assumptions, including conservative increases in oil production declining oil
prices and compliance with budgeted primary expenditures capped at a 3.5 percent real growth
rate, the Bank's debt sustainability analysis (DSA) determines that such goal can be met with
sustained gradual efforts4 to improve the fiscal accounts, generating an overall surplus above 1.6
percent of GDP during2005-07 (Table F.l), and primary balances above 4.0 percent.


'.  Debt sustainability is achieved when the value of future streams of public sector primary surpluses matches the
     market value of public debt; that is, the long-term public sector budget constraint does not break down.
     Business cycles and long-term growth trends impinge in obvious ways on fiscal sustainability through the size

        The oil fund will have an impact on debt buyback, but could be less than initially
expected. First, although the new oil pipeline has the potential to more than double total daily
capacity to over 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the previous 400,000 bpd, delays in
investment means it will probably take until 2007 for productionto reach even 600,000 bpd. The
problems that have arisen in resolving the controversy surrounding the value-added tax (VAT)
rebate dispute between the government and the oil companies have already delayed investments
inthe oil fields. With productionnot coming online as quickly, funds for debt repurchasing will
not accumulate as rapidly.          Second, debt buybacks in the first few years will focus on
repurchases and reissuances of domestic Ecuadorian Social Security Institute (IESS) debt. While
this will lengthen the domestic debt profile, it will not lead to additional external debt reduction.
Only in 2006, do we assume significant external debt repurchasesusingdesignated debt-buyback
FEIREP funds. Our estimates indicate that during 2005-07, additional debt repurchasing funds
are expected to amount to US815 million.




    of the tax base. A reverse feedback also holds: the size and quality of public spending, and the tax system
    burden and subsidies are bound to affect long-term economic performance. A subtler linkage is the tradable-
    nontradable price ratio. It is a widely accepted stylized fact that this ratio shows a secular decline as the
    economy grows. Inthe same vein, the ratio tends to be lower inbooms and higher inrecessions.

         The 1990s: A decade of limited resources and slow progress. Ecuador experienced
slow and volatile economic growth during the 1990s, and ended the decade immersed in a deep
crisis that left the country with poverty rates that were significantly higher than those observed in
1990 and 1994, particularly inurban areas (World Bank 2004).
         Social spending declined steadily during those years-from              5.2 percent of GDP in
1992 to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2000, with the adjustment falling disproportionately on the
education and health sectors (Table G.1).

         Limited resources, combined with increasing poverty, compromised potential
improvements in social indicators during this period. Increases in education attainment and
enrolment rates were timidbetween 1990 and 2001, while the intemal efficiency of the education
system worsened (Tables G.2a and G.2b).                 Similarly, health indicators improved, but the
coverage and service quality of the public health system deteriorated (Tables G.3a and G.3b).

        As a result of underinvestment, and despite improvements in various indicators
during the 1990s' by the end of the decade Ecuador's infant mortality and stunting and
wasting rates were higher than expected given the country's development level. And, while
enrolment rates in both primary and secondary school were slightly above predicted rates,
education quality continued to be deficient (World Bank 2004).
         From 2001 to the present: A time for recovery. As Ecuador pulled out of the 1998-99
crisis and the economy stabilized, economic growth resumed, bringing with it higher incomes
and lower poverty rates (Table G.4).'

          Although the GOE has not always had the capacity to fully commit the agreed
resources, particularly in the case of the health sector, important complementary efforts to
rationalize and increase the impact of social expenditures have been made. Inparticular, the
GOE is in the process of retargeting a series of social programs, including the Bono de
Desarrollo Humano, which has a budget of around US$200 million. This process is expected to
eliminate overlap among programs and, especially, to make spending more progressive.
          The combination of stronger economic growth and higher and better-quality social
spending should soon yield positive results in terms of social indicators.               Although
information in this regard i s sparse, there i s already some evidence of positive developments.
Since 1999, enrolment rates among older children, who are more likely to drop out of school,
have increasedby 1.5 percentage points, and stuntingand wasting rates have dropped by 5 and 2
percentage points, respectively.

                  Reformof the Civil Service and Control of the Public Wage Bill
         The Government of Ecuador (GOE) has taken positive steps over the last year to
reestablish effective control over public sector employment and the wage bill. First, while
overall Central Government employment grew by 13,350 (4.7 percent) from early 2003 through
2004, personnel increases in the police and armed forces accounted for almost all of that growth.
Apart from those two sectors, Central Government personnel grew by a mere 0.5 percent (see
Table H.l). Second, a new Organic Law of the Civil Service and Administrative Career and
Wage Unification and Harmonization of Public Sector Remuneration was approved in
September 2003, with amendments in January 2004.6 The principal features of the law and their
importance are described below, following which the fiscal impacts of the Organic Law are
detailed. Finally, recent impacts of the wage bill unrelated to the Organic Law are discussed.
         Simplifiing pay.       The Organic Law consolidates into base pay the profuse salary
components to which different public employees were entitled.                       Payments linked to the
characteristics of a given post (for example, responsibility, residence, geographic location), to the
characteristics of the employee (for example, years of service, number of children, professional
title), and additional payments that benefited public employees across-the-board (for example,
15" salary, lunch subsidy, "quarterly benefit") were eliminated. As of January 1, 2004, the only
remainingelements of the wage bill apart from base pay are the 13thsalary, 14h salary, overtime,
travel expenses, and honorariums.
         Prior to passage of the Organic Law, the distributivos de sueldos (personnel salary lists)
produced for each Central Government institution by the Budget Department of the Ministry of
Economy and Finance (MEF) were of little value in estimating and controlling the wage bill,
because base wages were commonly less than one-third of an employee's total annual pay. The
Budget Department i s now able to produce distributivos de sueldos that reflect actual personnel
expenditures. It i s important to note, however, that the armed forces, teachers, and police are
excluded from the salary unification provisions of the Organic Law. Altogether, approximately
half of civilian Central Government employees are covered.
         Centralizing control over salary scales and personnel information. The GOE had lost
effective control of the wage bill. Individual ministries, agencies, and government-owned
enterprises were granted considerable autonomy to set their own pay rules andor to lobby for
tailored wage benefits. Inaddition to unifyingsalary components, the Organic Law established a
new autonomous body within the presidency, with responsibility for deciding any salary
increases (within wage bill parameters set by MEF). This National Technical Secretariat for
Public Sector Human Resource Development and Pay (SENRES) i s also responsible for issuing
civil service regulations, and i s charged with developing a consolidated electronic database to
register all public employees and their benefit^.^

        Impact on the Social Security System (ZESS). B y law, employee withholdings for IESS
are 9.35 percent of base pay.           Consequently, the growth of the wage bill through salary
components other than base pay meant that the majority of public employees' earnings escaped
IESS taxation. The Organic Law, as modified by Congress in January 2004, establishes that
IESS contributions will remain fixed at September 2003 levels in 2004 and 2005, after which the
share of consolidated base pay (that is, the unifiedsalary) subject to IESS contributions grows by
20 percent per year until reaching 100 percent in 2010. As a result, the financial position of
Ecuador's social security system has been greatly strengthenedby the new law.
        Thefiscal impact of the Organic Law. There are fiscal costs as well as savings in the
provisions of the Organic Law. Savings should accrue from better salary control, made possible
through the elimination of myriad salary components. However, that effect cannot be readily
quantified. A more direct, though modest, savings will be realized through the elimination of
annual salary increases for years of service. After the fourth year, employees formerly were
entitled to an annual salary increase of 5 percent of basepay. Table H.2 estimates the savings to
result from eliminatingpay for length of service.

        On the other side of the ledger, the Organic Law will generate additional personnel costs
for the GOEfor the following reasons:

    0   The calculation of the 13thsalary;
    0   Staff transfers to the 14-grade pay scale;
     0  Increasing employee salaries to the minimumof a new unified salary scale; and
     0  Government's increased social security contributions.

         The 13fhsalary. The Organic Law establishesthat the 13thsalary, paid inDecember, will
be equal to one unified monthly salary. Although this annual payment existed prior to passage of
the Organic Law, the effect of this provision i s to increase its value. The amount of the increase
ranges from approximately US$35 to US$105, depending on the salary grade of the employee.
The total cost of this provision in 2004 should be roughly US$4 million.
        Staff transfers to the 14grade scale. Civil servants in the ministries of Agriculture,
Education (administrative staff), Health, Public Works, and Social Welfare began 2003 classified
according to a 21-grade pay scale rather than the more generous 14-grade scale that applied in
the remaining Central Government ministries. For equity reasons, these personnel that had
lingered under the 21-grade scale had to be transferred to the 14-grade scale prior to salary
unification. Employees covered by the "Professionals Scale" were likewise transfen-edto the 14-
grade system. Bank staff estimate that the total cost of these transfers is roughly US$17.9
million. The staffing reviews that accompanied the transfer process identified vacant posts in

these five ministries, but only in the case of Public Works were posts expressly eliminated. The
cost of severance payments was cited by government as the principal reason why more posts
were not eliminated in2003. (Severancerules are discussedbelow.)

        Raising employee salaries to the minimum of a new unified scale. In accordance with
Art. 112 of the Organic Law, SENRES issued a resolution (No. 2004-000186) in November
2004 sanctioning a new salary scale for those public employees covered by the law.8 Employees
whose unified salaries currently exceed the amount specified for their grade will not have their
salaries reduced, but their salaries will be frozen until such time as the scale catches up with their
salary. For employees earning less than the amount specified in the new scale, their pay will be
increased. The Organic Law provided for a five-year transition period to adjust salaries. From
January 2005 to 2009, the salaries of those earning less than the new pay for their salary grade
would have their salaries increased each year by 20 percent of the difference between their 2004
unifiedpay and the new salary scale until their salaries are fully adjusted by 2009. Instead, as
shown in Table H.3, the SENRES resolution specifies the minimumpay levels for each grade in
each year (200549). The fiscal impact of the new scale i s zero in 2004, becauseincreases take
effect from January 2005. The cost to government of the new scale in 2005 will be roughly
US$30 million.
        Severancepayments. Prior to the Organic Law of the Civil Service and Administrative
Career, the maximum severance payment was capped at US$lO,OOO. For the vast majority of
public employees their calculated severance would reach the cap limit. Thus, in effect, the
US$lO,OOO cap was akin to a flat severance payment policy for all public employees. Under the
new Organic Law, however, a severance payment of US$l,OOO will be paid for each year of


*. Prior to issuingtheresolution, SENRES sentthe scaleto theMEFfor approval, againas requiredby law.

service, up to a maximum of US$30,000. The average number of years of service among current
public employees i s 14, according to available Integrated Government Financial Management
System (SIGEF) data. Thus, on average, an employee's severance entitlement has increased
significantly.
        The Organic Law imposes an annual limit on personnel reductions (in addition to natural
attrition) equal to 1percent of active personnel. At current employment levels, this amounts to a
limit of roughly 3,300 per year. Table H.4 shows the severance cost and salary savings that
would follow from a government policy reducing public employment by the maximum allowed
under the law.

         Wage bill impacts other than those resultingfrom the Organic Law. Table H.l shows
that the codified Central Government wage bill for 2004 (as of November 23,2004) i s US$2.059
million. The initial budget at the start of the year was US$2.027 billion, and the MEF Budget
Office projects that the 2004 wage bill will actually reach US$2.074 billion. That difference of
roughly US$47 million between the initial 2004 budget estimate i s the most recent projections
due primarily to wage increases during 2004 in the education sector (US$29 million) and health
sector (US$19 million).'
        The Proforma wage bill for the Central Government in 2005 i s US$2.180 billion. That
figure includes US$65 million for a US$S-per-month wage increase for teachers that was agreed
in2004, andthat takes effect inJanuary 2005. It also anticipates an additional US$21millionfor
the new police and armed forces personnel. However, the Proforma for 2005 does not include
an estimated US$30 million needed to meet the salary requirements for employees covered by
revised 14-grade salary scale. Thus, at the present time, with no further policy changes, the
Central Government wage bill in 2005 i s expected to be roughly US$2.210 million.




'.  A wage increase of US$20 per month was approved for teachers (Magisterio Nacional) in January 2004
    (Resolucidn No. 202 del CONAREM, R.O. No. 250, 13 de enero de 2004); workers in the health sector covered
    by the Cddigode Trabajo received a US$40-per-month increase in pay from January 2004 under the collective
    bargaining agreement; increases in both sectors also resulted from the transition of administrative employees
    from the 21-grade scale to the 14-gradescale, and from an increaseinthe 14th salary.

                       Budget Transparency and Civil Society Participation
        Inrecent years, there has been increasing demand from civil society for enhanced access
to budget information and greater citizen participation in budget formulation and monitoring of
public expenditures in Ecuador. This demand has also translated into a number of innovative
civil society initiatives to promote such activities, at both the national and local level. These are
complemented and reinforced by the actions the current Administration i s undertakmg to
increase the level of transparency of public expenditure management, which are supported by
this operation. Because of the potential impact that can be achieved through these government-
civil society synergies, this loan operation has been complemented by grant-funded activities
aimed at direct support of civil society initiatives.
        This annex describes some of the ongoing civil society initiatives to enhance budget
transparency and participationthat are currently under way in Ecuador, and shows how the Bank
plans to support some of them in an effort to complement the actions supported by this operation.

Budget Transparency and Access to Information
        In 2003, a number of so-called "Observatories"              were created as independent
nongovernmental entities to monitor budget formulation,               public spending and fiscal
transparency.    To date, there are three observatories functioning: one that monitors public
spending (Observatory of Fiscal Policy), one that monitors social spending, and one that
monitors the use of funds received from international cooperation. These initiatives were created
with the support of international donors, such as the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) andthe UnitedNations Children's Fund(UNICEF).
        The Observatory of Fiscal Policy-which        i s the one most relevant to this operation-
enjoys a high level of credibility, being composed of well-respected, qualified, and technically
competent professionals, many of whom are drawn from the Ministry of Economy and Finance
(MEF) andthe private sector. Ithas been leading several key initiatives to enhancepublic access
to and understanding of public budgets and expenditures.             In 2003, it organized national
dialogues on the annual budget, which have brought together parliamentarians and civil society
organizations. In 2004, it organized seven workshops with civil society, the private sector, and
the media on the budgetproforma. These workshops were co-sponsored by the MEFand helped
to create public awareness about budget issues. The Observatory has also published a number of
information booklets to help demystify the national budget by explaining its process and
composition. It will also supporting MEFin the launching of a website to make this information
available and user-friendly to a wider public.
        Despite its newness, this Observatory has already started playing a key role in fostering
greater public awareness about the national budget. However, its task i s severely limited by the
complexity of the national budget and poor availability of timely, accurate, and good-quality
information on public expenditures. The actions to enhance budget transparency committed to
by the Government in this loan, such as the expansion and consolidation of the Integrated
Government Financial Management System (SIGEF), the creation of the above-mentioned
transparency portal, and the national dialogue on the multiyear program, will facilitate civil
society organizations, such as the Fiscal Observatory, playing a better-informed and more
effective watchdog and advocacy role.

        Through two trust funds (TFSSED and JSDF), grant resources have been secured to
enhance the technical capacity of the Observatory. These will finance: a set of learning events
that involve the presentation of best international practices on citizens' budget analysis and
participation; workshops to set up a Customs Modernization Observatory to monitor the
implementation of the customs modernization plan; and dissemination activities for the
Observatory's analytical outputs and events with civil society organizations, including
forthcoming budget information booklets and programs in community radios addressed to poor,
rural, and indigenous communities intheir own language.

ParticipationintheDebateonthe NationalBudget

        In Ecuador, there are no mechanisms that allow for citizen participation in the
formulation of the national budget. Since 2000, attempts have been made to encourage and
facilitate dialogue on the national budget between the Ecuadorian Congress and civil society.
Although they have been limited by the fact that the discussions were held after the debate of the
budget in Congress, they have engendered greater awareness and education about budget issues
in civil society, and have increased dialogue on the budget between members of Congress and
citizens.
        In 2004, however, significant changes occurred.       The Observatory of Fiscal Policy
organized roundtable discussions with civil society and Government representatives on the 2005
budget.    The dialogues brought `together a total of 372 participants in the cities of Quito,
Guayaquil, Cuenca, and Manta in August 2004.
        The largest forum was held in Guayaquil, with 119 participants, followed by 117 in
Quito, and 101 in Manta. Cuenca had the smallest gathering, with 35 participants. Civil society
represented the largest number of participants (47 percent of the total participants), followed by
31 percent from Government (95 percent from Central Government institutions and 5 percent
from local governments), 10 percent from the media, 9 percent from academia, 3 percent from
multi-andbilateral organizations, and 1percent from the financial sector.
         Guayaquil had the strongest presence of civil society, with 62 percent of participants
coming from that sector, followed by Cuenca (54 percent), Quito (41 percent), and Manta (34
percent). Quito and Manta had the strongest government representation (38 percent) each,
followed by Cuenca (17 percent), and Guayaquil with the lowest representations (13 percent). In
Manta, there were more government representatives (38 percent) than civil society actors (34
percent). The media also had a strong presence in all cities, with the highest representation in
Manta (12 percent), followed by Guayaquil (10 percent), Quito (9 percent), and Cuenca (6
percent).
         Of the government institutions participating, representatives from the Vice-presidency
were the largest group, with 12 participants (all participating in Quito), followed by 11from the
Internal Revenue Service. The Central Bank brought 5 representatives to the Quito dialogues,
and the Ministry of Finance brought 4 representatives to the same venue, although none to the
other cities. Two members of Congress participated in Guayaquil.
        The discussion inthe four cities centered around the following issues:

    a    Options for oil andnon-oil revenues and the Law of FiscalTransparency

        Among many issues discussed, some interesting recommendations were made relating to

    0   The importance of civil society playing an active role inmonitoring public expenditures.

    0   The importance of replicating this type of event to enhance transparency around the
        budget process and public expenditures, and increase the role of social auditing
        committees, particularly with regard to public contracting and civil society audits of
        external debts.       Participants also pointed out the need for institutionalizing social
        accountability mechanisms around the issue of public expenditures in all public
        institutions.

        civil society monitoring of its functioning.
        Furthermore, in 2005, the Bank will develop a study to identify and analyze promising
experiences for civic engagement inEcuador in 2005.


InstitutionalizingCitizenParticipationinBudgetMonitoring

        The lack of publicly available information on disaggregated public expenditures makes
in-depth citizen monitoring of public expenditures at the national level difficult. However, the
efforts of the Government to enhance access to budget information through this operation will
enable civil society to play a more effective watchdog role and institutionalize it.
        At the municipal level, access to public information on municipal expenditures is even
more scarce and unreliable. Despite this, more than 50 social auditing committees have been
established around the country (veeduriassociales) with the support of the Civic Anti-Corruption
Commission (CCCC),"           to monitor mainly public investments at the municipal level. These
citizen auditing committees play a key role in creating greater awareness of citizens' rights, and
in exposing corruption. The JSDF grant resources will support the Civic Anti-Corruption
Commission inthe creation of additional citizen auditing committees.




lo.The Civic Anti-Corruption Commission was established in 1999 to combat corruption in Ecuador.            It was
    established as an independent entity not controlled by the Executive. Its president is elected by civil society
    organizations every four years under the supervision of the Superior Electoral Tribunal. It i s 95 percent
    financed by public funds, and the remaining 5 percent comes from international donors.

and Public Debt Reduction (FEIREP) i s authorized under Article 13 of the Fiscal Transparency,
Stabilization, and Responsibility Law (FTSRL) with the goals of reducing the stock of public
debt, smoothing government oil revenues, and setting aside some resources for social
expenditures.     B y statute, 70 percent of FEIREP funds must be devoted to debt buybacks.
FEIREPfunds can be used to buy back domestic or external public debt, including up to a limit
of 15 percent of the total flows devoted to debt buybacks, government debt held by the Social
Security Institute (SSI).       The Law specifically mandates that under no circumstances can
FEIREPflows be used for current, but for investment expenditures. Finally, the FEIREPcannot
issue its own debt. Under the Law, FEIREPfunds cannot be collateralized, used as guarantees,
pledged against future flows, or seized as government assets.
        Sources of Funds. FEIREP has four major sources of financing: (a) government
revenues from heavy crude oil production; (b) budget surpluses, if any; (c) 45 percent of annual
petroleum revenues of light crude production above those budgeted; and (d) all financial
revenues from the investment of FEIREP assets. The Central Bank of Ecuador intends to invest
FEIREP assets inamanner similarto international reserves.12
        Operational Features. The enabling regulations were signed in late December 2003,
making operational the FEIREP. As mandated by the Law, the Central Bank of Ecuador i s the
fiduciary of FEIREP, which i s set up as an independent and autonomous fund. Although it has
become operational, its Board decides on basic operational and policy issues, including the
decision making process on the buyback strategy, the technical evaluation of the buyback
operations, and the execution mechanisms. In December 2003, the Board issued a regulation
establishing the guidelines for the asset management of the FEIREP, in line with those
implemented by the Central Bank for reserve management.                          Additionally, the authorities
established a clear mechanism to evaluate, decide on, and perform the buyback operations.
        Structure of the FEZREP. The Law specifies that the Board of Governors of the
FEIREP is the one taking decisions on specific buyback plans, based on technical advice
providedby the Central Bank through a Secretariat, and subject to confirmation by the President.
As established in the FTSRL, the Board is comprised of the finance minister, the attorney
general, and a representative of the Presidency.                 It has the following responsibilities: (a)
overseeing the management of the fund, (b) informing the President and Congress on a monthly
basis about the financial status and operations of the FEIREP, (c) selecting and contracting
external and independent auditing firms for an annual report on the management and financial
status of the FEIREP, (d) overseeing the fulfillment of the social development projects, and (e)
overseeing the accomplishment of the debt reduction plans.
        FEZREP and Debt Buybacks. The FEIREP may engage in sizable debt buyback
operations. Oil revenues and other inflows to FEIREPare estimated to reach US$748 million by


". This section contains excerpts of the IMFreport, "Recommendation for the Debt Buyback Strategy," January
    2004.
12.Under the FTSRL (Article 16), the Central Bank should invest FEIREP funds with minimum volatility and
    returns no lower than those obtained by the investment of international reserves.

         Compliancewith the Fiscal Law. The best strategy to adopt by Authorities would be to
implement a simple, transparent, and rules-based approach, as supported by this loan. This
would have the advantage of mitigating the risks of ex post criticism that decision makers had
misused their discretionary powers.              Creditors, potential investors, and ratings agencies
increasingly evaluate countries not only in terms of numbers, but also place high value on
transparency of public sector operations and predictability of policy. Keeping priority for debt
buybacks may not be straightforward in the face of pressurefor new expenditures. However, up
to September 2004, the GOE had built-upUS$479.1 million in assets in FEIREP and allocated
US$335.4 million (70 percent) to repurchasepublic debt. As of December, the effective amount
of debt repurchased was US$381.6 million, clearly indicating that proceeds allocated in past
September had already been effectively used to repurchase domestic debt, mostly short-term. In
the same period, the remaining 30 percent resources had also been used for social investment and
emergencies (Table J.1).

         Public Debt Composition. As of end-November 2004, Ecuador's total public debt
amounted to US$14.6 billion (excluding arrears), or around 48.9 percent of GDP (Table J.2).
External public sector debt stands at US$ll.1 billion, mostly multilateral (US$4.3 billion),
commercial (US$4.3 billion), and bilateral debt (US$2.4 billion). Commercial external debt
consists mainly of two widely held external bond issues maturing in 2012 and 2030, with

        Ecuador has a small, closed, and distorted economy. It has significant potential for
growth in non-traditional exports which, despite an anti-export bias, grew from 8 percent to 30
percent of exports over ten years. A major impetus for growth has been trade preferences
granted unilaterally by the Unitedstates in 1991, and renewed in 2002, under the Andean trade
preference program which allows over 6,000 items to enter the US without tariffs.         These
preferences will expire at the end of 2006, and the United States government does not plan to
renew them. It has, instead, begun negotiations with Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru (with Bolivia
as an observer) toward an Andean Free Trade Agreement. The negotiations are expected to
conclude in the first quarter of 2005, and the resulting FTA would be a far-reaching accord
which could, over time, compel a modernization of the government and the economy and an
improvement inEcuador's international competitiveness.

Structure of trade and foreign investment

        Exports. In the decade between 1992 and 2002, exports grew two thirds-from        US$3
billion to US$5 billion-with   crude oil and petroleum and its by-products comprising about 40
percent of exports. The other principal exports in 2002-another      35 percent-were   bananas,
coffee, cocoa, shrimp, flowers, and tuna. The products with particularly strong growth over this
period were flowers (650 percent increase), tuna (480 percent), processed seafood (370 percent),
chemicals (170 percent), and other manufactured items (190 percent).         Among significant
primary products, only shrimp fell over the period, by nearly half, although declines were offset
by processedshrimpexports. Agricultural and agro-industrial exports represent about 60 percent
of non-traditionalexports.
        Zmports. The imports consist of raw materials (37 percent), capital goods (31 percent),
consumer goods (26 percent), and fuels and lubricants (6 percent).        Over time, imports of
consumer goods have increased more than others, an indication of opening.
        Trade balance. Over 1993-2002, Ecuador's imports and exports have been about equal.
Inseven years the exports were greater than the imports, but in 1998, 2001and 2002 there were
trade deficits. The largest was in 2004 when imports were US$6.4 billion and exports were
US$5 billion. Before dollarization, the government had managed its exchange rate to encourage
trade surpluses with most of its trading partners.
        Trading partners. In 2002, the US was the largest importer of Ecuadorian products
(US$3.4 billion) and the largest single exporter to Ecuador (US$1.5 billion). Ecuador's main
trading partners are USA (38 percent of exports and 26 percent o f imports); Andean Community
of Nations (15 percent and 22 percent); other Latin American Integration Association (ALADI)
and American countries (12 percent and 23 percent); and the European Union (15 percent and 13
percent).
        Foreign investment. Foreign investment totaled US$1.3 billion in2002 and went mainly
into the petroleum sector Nearly all the investment came from USA (31 percent), Canada (28
percent), Europe (21percent), or other Western Hemisphere nations (14 percent).

Trade regime
        Treaties. Ecuador has been a member of the WTO since 1995, and most of its trade
policies are affected by its membership in regional trade blocs: ALADI and, especially, the
Andean Community of Nations (CAN). Under the CAN, decisions of the Andean Commission
mustbe enforced within eachmember country.
         Tariffs. CAN maintains a common external tariff at four levels, 5, 10, 15, and 20
percent. These common tariffs have been negotiated for 62 percent of tradable products, which
covers only 33 percent of Ecuador's production, leaving the most significant tariffs to be set
unilaterally by Ecuador. Ecuador sets rates at 0,3, 5, 10, 15,20, and 35 percent, with the goal of
encouraging value added, although the largest protection results to the goods with the lowest
value added. There have been frequent changes in what i s covered at each rate based on shifting
trade agreements and commitments. The average effective tariff (tariff receipts as a percentage
of total import value) ranged between 6.5 percent and 11.6 percent during 1991-2001, falling in
recent years.
        For 12 agricultural commodities, covering 148 tariff subheadings, Ecuador uses the
Andean Price Band system. in which the tariff rate i s periodically adjusted in relation to a target
price based on the five-year world average.          The rationale for this system i s that these
commodities (corn, wheat, rice, sugar, etc.) are subsidized in industrialized countries. C A N
seeks to counter these subsidies, stabilize prices and support domestic producers, without using
subsidies. Importers pay world prices only when they are high, never when they are low. These
tariffs, added to base tariffs of 15 to 20 percent, can raise prices above world levels by 35 to 95
percent. They increase the prices of basic foods to all consumers while benefiting relatively few
land owners and farmers.
         Non-tariffbam'ers. In addition to the tariffs the Government uses an array of non-tariff
barriers to control imports:

     0   Import Eicenses. As part of the Government's program supported by the FCCGL-I,
         COMEXI issued Resolutions 182, 183 and 184 in January 2003 that established norms
         for importing products that required licenses, unified import licenses, and set norms for
         importing vehicles, respectively. About 8 percent of 1600 existing licenses-duplicated
         and mostly concentrated inthe health and agricultural sector-were     eliminated. Then, as
         part of FCCGL-11, a unification of at least 10 percent of existing import licenses was
         required. Licenses were still applied to 1,471 out of 6,707 tariff items. A total of 210-
         roughly a seventh of all tariff positions that still required import licenses-were
         eliminated: 83 as a consequence of Resolution 183, which called for their elimination in
         case there was no due justification for keeping them, and 127 as a consequence of
         COMEXI Resolution 297, which was issued on December 2004.                Authorities have
         indicated that they intend to continue making further effort in eliminating import licenses
         in the context of FTA negotiations. Before December's decision, the Ministry of Public
         Health issued about 43 percent of the licenses and the Ministry of Agriculture and
         Livestock issued 33 per cent. There are six principal institutions issuing licenses and 14
         others that administer licenses for fewer than 20 tariff items.       Importers claim that
         decisions are arbitrary, slow (two months on average), and subject to corruption.        In
         response, since August 15, 2004, also as part of the Government's reform program, the
         Internal Revenue Service has launched an electronic system to expedite licensing. It



                                                 102

                                                                                             Annex K


       requires no face-to-face contact with the ministries and, if a decision i s not rendered in 10
       days, the license i s awarded automatically. It i s too soon to judge the success of the new
       system, but preliminary reports are very positive.
   0   Technical regulations. Technical regulations are used to control the characteristics of
       products which may be imported. Presently there are 623 obligatory standards. This
       follows a reduction, under the Government's program supported by the FCCGL, from
       885 original ones.       When Ecuador joined the WTO, it officially adopted the
       Standardization Code which established that technical regulations are voluntary and must
       not constitute unnecessary obstacles to trade. The C A N has ratified the voluntary nature
       of the Andean regulations and specified that these must not be used as additional barriers
       to trade. However, importers have complained that Ecuador's regulations have been
       applied arbitrarily and incorrectly, only to imported goods, are changed without prior
       notice or public consultation, with inadequate independent local laboratories to verify
       whether the norms are met, and have been applied in response to political intervention.
       They have created large problems and obstacles, but for a small number of products. The
       preparation by MICIP of a list of technical norms to be made compatible with WTO
       standards was made by the Ecuadorian Standards Institute in collaboration with the
       private sector. As of February 2003, there were 2,318 technical norms, 885 of which
       were compulsory.       From those, 90 were converted into voluntary standards as a
       consequenceof Resolution03612 of MICIP published inthe Official Registry No. 248 of
       9 January 2004. Additionally, a group of 172 compulsory standards were also eliminated
       after careful analysis, for various reasons such as obsolescence, duplication. Compared
       to the existing total number of standards (2,179), compulsory standards still represent 29
       percent, while voluntary standards (1,556) represent 71percent.
    0  Prohibitions. Ecuador prohibits the import of some used articles-automobiles,             tires,
       clothing. These bans protect domestic producers at the expense of poor or low-income
       consumers, and Ecuador committed to eliminate them when it gained entry into WTO.

       Administering international trade.       The administration of the international trade
reinforces the deep-rooted, inward-looking policies. Importers cite the customs administration as
being the greatest impediment. Two-to-three week delays are common (compared to one-two
days for customs clearance in Chile and Colombia). The delays can be reduced or eliminated by
bribes, and contraband has been estimated as between 40 percent and 100 percent of legitimate
imports. The inspection to verify national origin adds an additional slow and costly delay for
importers.
       In preparation for negotiations on the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), there
was an extensive analysis of measures to strengthen Ecuador's trade related capacity during both
duringnegotiation and implementation. It identifies 96 separate actions, inthree priority classes
(67 priority one; 26 priority two; and 3 priority three), and in 11spheres of action (e.g., market
access, agriculture, services, investment, government procurement, intellectual property rights,
dispute settlement). The extent of the weaknesses underscores the scope for a fundamental
modernization inorder to improve the economy's internationalcompetitiveness.

The Andean Free Trade Agreement with the U.S.

       Ecuador currently enjoys access to U S markets under the Andean Trade Preference Act
which extends benefits unilaterally and at the pleasure of the United States Government. These
preferences will expire in 2006, and the free trade agreement (FTA) would replace this with a
negotiated, international treaty. The US Trade Representative notified Congress in November
2003, of the Administration's intent to initiate negotiations toward an Andean Free Trade
Agreement with Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. The first round of negotiations was in
May 2004, with a goal of concluding negotiations inFebruary 2005 and signing the FTA inJune
2005. There have been four negotiating rounds - out of an expected eight or nine - with the
venue alternating between cities in the United States and in Latin America.           The U. S.
Administration i s seeking to submit the FTA for Congressional approval under the existing
Trade Promotion Authority which will expire inthe middle of 2005.
       The United States sees the FTA as establishing a level playing field, furthering
integration of the Andean nations, and opening new markets for U S exports. For the Andean
countries it would provide secure access to US markets and it would serve as a spur to a
thorough modernization of their economies and institutions. The Free Trade Agreement will be
a far-ranging treaty encompassing not only trade in goods and services but, extended trade-
related issues. The agreement i s likely to follow the format of the Dominican Republic - Central
American Free Trade Agreement which covered 18 areas: (1) National treatment and market
access for goods; (2) Rules of origin and origin procedures; (3) Customs administration and
trade facilitation; (4) Sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures; (5) Technical barriers to trade; (6)
Trade remedies;     (7) Government procurement;       (8) Investment;  (9) Cross-border trade in
services; (10) Financial services; (11) Telecommunications; (12) Electronic commerce; (13)
Intellectual property rights;    (14) Labor;     (15) Environment;     (16) Transparency;     (17)
Administration of the agreement and trade capacity building; and (18) Dispute settlement.

                             Annex L. The Customs ModernizationPlan
        In the past decade, there were many attempts to reform Customs in Ecuador, but all
failed. Customs shortcomings are multiple and costly: The time it takes to release merchandise
i s among the highest in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region, with an average of
15 days due to the Ecuadorian Customs Administration (CAE) exclusively. Adding the time it
takes by other institutions to carry out further inspections, the average release time rises to 27
days. About 70 percent of merchandise i s physically reviewed, which i s a high percentage by
international standards. Origin valuation certificates and physical inspection done by private
inspection companies (PSIS) have not had perceivable effects in tax collection by Customs, but
represent an expensive annual cost of US$50 million paid by importers. Failures reflect the
partial automation of some foreign trade processes, persistence of certain operational problems in
Customs, and corruption. In 2003, Customs revenue did not increase, also due to a number of
additional tariff exemptions inherited from the previous administration, but this situation
reversed in 2004 thanks to a Customs Modernization Plan. The Plan had significant progress in
2004, due to the startup of valuation controls, personnel retraining, changes in administration and
other efficiency-raising measures, and a dynamic extemal trade.
        The Plan was preceded by legal changes. During 2003, a new Customs Law-the                     Ley
Orgbnica de Administracidn Financiera y Control (L0AFYC)-and                             amendments were
approved by Congress. Hence, (i)         CAE's Directory was given the power to make organic and
structural reforms, including the authority to remove employees (who receive compensation); (ii)
temporary intervention of the Army was established at the CAE; (iii) were changes in the
                                                                                  there
composition of CAE's Directory, incorporating the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS's) Director
as President of the Board, and eliminating one of the representatives of the private sector, which
has given majority power vote to the public sector inside the Directory; (iv) certain requirements
were established to assure better professional qualification of the directors and the higher
officials of the CAE; and (v) special faculties were given to the SRI for having access to the
information on extemal trade that CAE has.
        Nevertheless, the Law still lacks certain important provisions, such as giving legal
content to the electronic statements, and allowing the CAE access to information related to
activities of extemal trade in different institutions, such as commercial banks, the IRS, and
insurance offices.16 The lack of coordination between the CAE and the harbor authorities
continues to obstruct the effective action of the CAE in the control of harbor areas. This also
impedes CAE access to key information in the matching process between actual imports and
their statement (manifiestos). Moreover, Customs has performedpoorly in legal trials. A recent
independent study showed that 80 percent of the trials ended with a decision against the CAE or
the State, and more than half of them-55             percent-were      lost due to "prescription,"    when
Customs lost the opportunity to submit adequate proof and the case became "prescripted" due to
lack of evidence. Otherwise, corruption continues to be an important problem, and during 2003
an investigative process was carried out and ended in the dismissal of 26 functionaries and inthe
current trials of another 46. In 37 percent of Customs trials, there was participation by Customs
officers, especially those from the Sewicio de Vigilancia Aduanera (Customs Police).

ThePlan

         Inearly 2004, CAE, the IRS andthe Ministry of Economy andFinance (MZF),supported
by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Bank, developed a
plan whose main objectives are: to (a) further increase tax collection; (b) improve supervision to
reduce fraud and contraband; and (c) reduce foreign trade costs, especially in the process of
merchandise imports. The Customs Modernization Plan has six priority areas:
1. Establishing goodcoordination betweenthe CAE andIRS to supervise foreign trade activities
by:

0  Forming a supervisory team of great contributors comprised of CAE and IRS auditors,
   coordinated b y the IRS. The goal i s to start with three audits monthly, and, toward the
   middle of year, to perform at least nine audits monthly.
0  Expanding the use of the foreign trade base in pilot operations in the IRS, permitting access
   to the above-mentioned team, and performing crossings of information that permit locating
   profiles of risk of the contributors. The goal i s to have liquidations of taxes on more than the
    90 percent of the selected cases from the database.
0   Creating obligatory registration of importers for any importation, in which the demand i s that
    the importer be recorded in the tax registration of the IRS. Based on this registration, the
    goal of the IRS i s to audit 100 percent of those registered for the first time to the tax
    registration.


2. Advancing toward greater effectiveness of control and lower costs for those engaged in
foreign trade, by reducing valuations and gradually eliminating the existing pre-shipment
certificates. This requires:

0   Establishing a system of "risk profiles" for the selection of valuations and eliminating the
    ones performed by the inspecting enterprises. The goal i s to reduce the valuations from 70
    percent of the present operations total to 20 percent by the end of the year; and to improve
    the effectiveness of the valuations of the current 1percent present to 5 percent toward the end
    of 2004.
0   Reducing total releasetime (desaduanamiento) from an average of 15 days to no more than 6
    days inthe following 12months.17

3. Establishing a gradual plan of retirement of the inspecting enterprises, so that in 18 months
they stop performingoperations of certification of pre-shipment by:

0   Establishing infour months a valuation base that contains those items of count for 90 percent
    of the total value of the imports."
0   Establishing cross-information channels with international agencies and information-
    supplying enterprises to obtain prices and values of sensitive merchandise.



".  Currently, the average time in which customs and inspecting enterprises are responsible is 13 days. The
    remaining days are observed by other control agencies, phytosanitary inspections, narcotic control, guidelines,
    and so forth.
18. It is estimated that with 100tariff items i s obtained more than the 90 percent o f the total of the value.

4. Raising the degree of coordination between the Port Authorities and the CAE by:

0  Creating a joint commission of customs-port supervision among the Port Authority and the
   CAE (by presidential decree).
0  Studying the legal faculties of the CAE-Port Authorities and proposing a delegation andor
   complementation of faculties among both entities.
0  Joint planning of supervision.
0  Developing a plan of port security and its execution.
0  Redesigning the manifests control system and control crossed with the statements of
   importation.
0  Evaluating the financing mechanisms of the CAE and new model proposed.

5. Transferring customs administration from the military to civilians, seeking direction from
executives that have extensive management experience. A human resources program should be
carried out, of which the next activities should be the following:

0  Designing and implementing an administrative system of personnel with integral registry of
   the CAE's official information.
0  Developing a training program and its curriculum.
0  Designing a personnel performance evaluation andjob description system for CAE.
0  Preparing a voluntary retirement programfor Customs officials.

6. Encouraging strengthening internal audits and controlling corruptionby:

0  Redesigning of the Audit and Internal Affairs Units and endowment of a new unit with
   attributions and obligations on internal investigation, and preventive audits.
0  Establishing an agreement between the CAE and the CCCC to exchange information on
   cases and practices of customs corruption.
0  Designing a control system to manage cases of corruption covered by the internal
   investigation, and monitor the ordinaryjustice of the cases.
0  Designing a model of internal audit account, and a code of ethics.
0  Preparing an annual public account of audit andtransparency.


Outcomes

In 2004, progress inthe Plan led to a higher tax collection performance. On one hand, Customs
tax collection rose by 17 percent (Table L.l). This increase i s remarkable, since it was obtained
despite the absorption of a 2002 approved rise in the number of tariff-exempted imports. On the
other hand, the collections index for non-exempted consumer imports slightly increased by 24.2
percent, which can also be considered as positive.
        Besidees, and as part of the new automation processes, an electronic valuation system to
detect undervalued imports for inspected products entered into effect in April. This procedure
compare prices reported in actual import transactions with historical data on similar goods. As a
pilot case, the port of Guayaquil was chosen. Almost forty percent of all imports to this port were
subject to this control. This measure resulted in an increase in the fob value of 19 percent of all

         Another positive outcome in 2004 was the launching of the concession of Esmeraldas
port, which allowed CAE to reestablish the control of privately-owned permisionarias and
transforming them into customs warehouses. This step i s key as these private companies have
allegedly done very little to prevent smuggling and robbery. Similar port concessions are on
schedule for coming years.
         Also in the port of Esmeraldas the GOEhas completed the design of an electronic control
system (Tarja) which will permit CAE to have a better coordination with harbor authorities of
the incoming shipments. A more fluid traffic of information to the CAE by the shipping
companies i s expected to produce a better matching of the imports statements from the time of
arrival to the release from the port.
         Finally, but no less important, as part of improved efforts in Customs, the GOE has
established a system of "risk profiles," targeting on specific importers and eliminating those
performed by the inspecting enterprises. Inorder to do so, the training of CAE personnel and the
establishing of ajoint SRI-CAE inspection team are in effect. The objective for 2005 is to focus
on 270 large importers upon which ex-ante import statements are to be authorized and no
physical inspection (aforo) will be realizedon arrived merchandise.

      Annex M. The Oil Sector and the Implementation of Environmental Regulations

       The oil sector has increased production, but still operates under the same-yet
unresolved-deficiencies         and, as a consequence, production levels remain below the full
potential of its proven reserves and the available transport capacity. Moreover, the proposals
formulated to reactivate the sector have not been successfully implemented.
       In 2004, once the heavy crude oil pipeline (OCP) became operational, oil production
increased by 25 percent basically on account of additional production generated by the private
sector on past field development projects.           Coupled with high oil prices, oil revenues are
estimated at 5.5 percent higher than in 2003. Private investments, however, are not expanding as
anticipated: there was 24 percent reduction in the number of wells drilled by the private
companies. PetroEcuador production fell again by nearly 6 percent compared to 2003, and it i s
estimated that in 2005 it will drop a further 2.3 per cent (FigureM.l). Private investment i s also
affected by problems regarding VAT reimbursement, judicial stability and social conflicts with
indigenous federations that remain opposed to oil exploration and production activities in a few
regions. Likewise, the refining and marketing operations have not overcome deficiencies.
Subsidies on diesel and LPG have exceeded US$550 million. Imports of oil derivatives have
reducedthe net positive impact which the sector exerts on the country's balance of trade.

Sector Assessment


        Attracting capital and technology to improve the recovery from the oilfields operated by
PetroEcuador-holding         76 percent of the total country reserves-demands             a long lasting
solution. Inlate 2003, the GOE, jointly with the WB, IDB and CAF engaged a consulting firm to
prepare an updated assessment of the oil sector in Ecuador, particularly in regard to the
performance of the State Company."           This assessment made very important recommendations,
includingthe need for:

    Unification of data systems (EM, MEF, BCE and Petroecuador) in order to estimate
    financial flows resulting from oil production;
    Definition o f a transparent policy for the distribution of oil revenues;
    Redefinition and separation of roles between the GOE                  regarding policy-making,
    administration of mining rights and sector regulation, from productive and commercial
    operations of the national company;
    Top-notch technologies and improvements in technical efficiency of PetroEcuador, as its
    operational costs are low due to insufficient amortization of investments;
    Converting Petroecuador into a commercial firm, in a competitive environment,
    administering its revenues, and making a transparent fiscal contribution via payments to the
   Treasury of taxes, royalties and dividends;
   Downsizing of the assets portfolio operated by Petroecuador i s necessary, separating
    commercial activity from corporate operations, and upstream from downstream operations,
    and looking for co-investment in both through a more aggressive opening to private capital
    and technologies;
   Elimination of subsidies on fuels; and
    Quantification of environmental liabilities, along with the preparation of a remedial plan
    identifying responsibilities and sources for financing;

        The assessment also considered the following challenges as critical:

    Gradual suppression of subsidies on the prices of LPG, gasoline and diesel;
    Collection of debts from fuels delivered to the public sector, particularly to the electricity
    companies;
    Improvedstability of contracts inorder to minimize perceived risks from investors;
    Improvedrelations with unions, indigenous communities and NGOs, and
    Broader consensus among the different stakeholders of the society to modernize the sector,
    separatefunctions, and open Petroecuador to market competition.

PromotionPlans for Private Investment within the HydrocarbonsSector.

        On two occasions during 2004, attempts have been made at introducing partialreforms to
the Hydrocarbons Law, basically centered around a clear definition of oil contracting models.
N o effort has been made to introduce structural reforms aimed at improving the organization and
transparency of the sector. This i s due to disagreements and opposing views on the part of
representatives of the Executive and Legislative powers and of the business and labor-related
sectors.
        As a short-term response, the President has supported with an Executive Decree the Oil
Production Reactivation Plan, proposed b y the MEM. The Plan i s based on contracting models
that require no new law but only specific amendments to certain regulations to be effective by
the way of Executive Decrees. The Plan aims to increase oil production to 900,000 barrels per
day until the year 2010, incorporate new reserves so as to maintain a reserve/production ratio of
25 years and reduce the cost of fuels supplies to the domestic market. The main goals of the plan
are to:




                                                  110

                                                                                                         Annex M



    reactivate Petroecuador oilfields, with private companies entering the "good and service
    contract model." The investments for reactivation are estimated at US$595 million in order
    to produce 78,500 BPD duringthe next 24 months;*'
    initiate a bidding procedure for marginal oilfields (i.e. fields producing less of 1%of the
    national production);
    organize bidding procedures for the exploration and development new blocks, with private
    companies entering the "association contract model." An estimated investment of US$2,200
    millions i s envisaged in order to increment reserves by 1,250 million of barrels;
    initiate a bidding procedure for the Ishpingo - Tiputini - Tambococha (ET) heavy crude oil
    project, implying an investment of US$1,190 to US$4,000 million during the next 8 years,
    for a likely increment inreservesof 900 million of barrels;
    handle immediately the management of refineries to a private company, which in a second
    phase will be required to enter in upgrading investments estimated at US$2,800 millions*l
    duringthe next 10years; and
    optimize the transportation, storage and marketing stages with an investment estimated at
    US$273.5 million duringthe next 5 years.

         The marginal fields option has became an important option to attain the short-term
objectives, since it could be used in a greater number of fields now categorized as marginal, as a
consequence of an increment of national production. This option offers the advantage that it does
not require changes to the present law. To ensure the success of this Plan, in the short-term it i s
critical to have a consolidated opinion in the Executive and to move ahead with an information
campaign designed to face concerns such as:

0   the contractual models to be used, ensuring that exploration and commercial risks are
    assumedby the private operators;
0   the financing instrumentsand procedures applicable to operators inthe sector;
0   the taxation system, including the reimbursement of the IVA;
0   the potential environmental and social impacts; and
0   the compensations and participation in rents of different stakeholders, while making more
    transparent the flow of oil revenues.

         In the medium term, perhaps the most important achievement would be to introduce a
larger sector reform comprising:

0    Sector reorganization, by separating Petroecuador's role as an operator, competing with
    private companies under similar terms and conditions, from the role of the State as an entity
     setting forth policies and regulations for the sector;
0   New oil contracts and of updated regulations; and
0   Consensus among all state entities involved in regard to a statistics and cash flow control
     system that ensures data transparency and their dissemination at large.


20.   Petroecuadorhas stated that it has recorded 27 companies interested inparticipating inthe biddingprocedure
    inorder to optimize production infour oilfields comprised inthe first stage, to beopen to internationalbidin
    the coming weeks. A second group of oilfields shall be open to bid by early 2005.
21.  The invitation to bid was sent to interested companies on November 22, 2004; international bidding procedure
    i s anticipated by January, 2005 with signing of the pertinent contract by May, 2005.

         If launchingofthefirstphasesoftheOilReactivationPlanmeetsuccess,by2005the
            the
production from Petroecuador fields could increase by approximately 18,000 barrels per day.
Such year would be dedicated to bidding procedures and greater output increases would be
reflectedfrom 2006 onwards.

Statusof ImplementationofEnvironmentalRegulations
          Important environmental liabilities still persist in the oil sector. In some of the fields
operated by Petroecuador, wastewater discharge into the environment i s a problem yet to be
resolved. O f the 140,000 daily barrels of processing water used in Petroecuador facilities,
99,400 barrels (71 percent) are reused; however, 40,600 barrels (29 percent) are discharged
naturally into the environment. Furthermore, there are hundreds of petroleum waste-collecting
pools that are not being treated. An estimated US$400 million would be needed for this
remediation. Another problemi s the burningof the gas byproducts. Moreover, there i s a lack of
incentive to adopt new technologies that are more environmentally friendly. Though progress
has been made in civil society participation, more capacity is needed to hold discussions with
key stakeholders and to make consultations with and the participation of the local towns more
productive. And, although the environmental budget of Petroecuador has increased in recent
years, it still corresponds to only about 1to 2 percent of total investments.
          InstitutionalFramework Environmentaloversight of the petroleumand miningsectors
resides in the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM),in the Subsecretary for Environmental
Protection (SPA), which acts through the National Office of Environmental Protection and
through the Environmental Mining Unit, respectively. This continues to be the case even after
the creation of the Ministry of the Environment in 1996 and passage of the Environmental
Management Law in 1999, which established a system of decentralized environmental
management that recognizes the environmental responsibilities of different institutions at the
national and subnational level. Responsibility for protected areas falls under the Ministry of the
Environment, which uses regulatory mechanisms for interinstitutional coordination. In 2002,
under a newly decentralized framework for the MEM, responsibilities of the regional offices
were expanded, leading to the creation of the Regional Office for Environmental Protection.
This greatly enhanced monitoring capacity, and led to a nearly 400 percent increase in field
inspections during 2002 and 2003. In 2004 the number of inspections would be similar to 2003,
with 598 inspections reported (Table M.l).

        Environmental Legal Framework. In 2002, regulations guiding the environmental
legal framework, the Unified System of Environmental Management (SUMA), came into effect.
SUMA defines the mechanisms of interinstitutional coordination and elements of the
environmental impact evaluation subsystem22to be applied in the decentralized institutions,
including the process of evaluating environmental impact and procedures for challenging,
suspending, and revolung environmental license registrations. Under SUMA, institutions that
use an environmental impact evaluation subsystem can be accredited as an Environmental
Authority o f Responsible Application (AAAR), and therefore can head and coordinate their
environmental impact evaluation process, approvals, and environmental licensing within their
scope of responsibility.     The accreditation process helps resolve the problem of overlapping
responsibilities, and better defines norms exercised by the State, helping to resolve petroleum
companies' burdensome and sometime contradictory requirements among the Ministry of Energy
and Mines, the Ministry of the Environment, and regional governments-a                   situation that i s
aggravated when these exceed their contractual obligations or budgets. The Ministry of Energy
and Mines was accredited as an AAAR inFebruary 2004.
        As a specific environmental norm for the petroleum sector, in February 2001, the
Environmental Regulation for Hydrocarbon Operations was issued. The main reforms of this
regulation were the fixing of parameters and permissible limits for ground and air contamination.
The regulation also obliges businesses to implement internal monitoring of air, water, ground,
and final disposal of waste products; periodic presentation of monitoring reports and remediation
programs; mechanisms for citizen participation; and environmental impact studies.                       The
petroleum sector also relies on specific norms for qualifications of hydrocarbon environmental
consultants, qualification and registration of environmental hydrocarbon laboratories, fixing the
limits for emission into the atmosphere, and fixing the fees the Ministry can charge for its
services that allow it to self-finance its budget.
        ConsultationandParticipation. Before 1998, there existed a legal vacuum with respect
to the rights of consultation on and participation in activities that could cause environmental-
related impacts.       However, in the 1998 Constitution, and in subsequent legislation
aforementioned, the right of collective or specific consultation was given on matters of
environmental concern, and also recognized the need to regulate the rights of consultation and
participationof the indigenous towns and other communities on the development of hydrocarbon
activities.
        The first initiatives developed a process of consultation and a program of citizen
oversight and environmental monitoring in 11 municipalities for the construction of the heavy
crude oil pipeline. Under the 2001Environmental Regulation for the Hydrocarbon Operations,
companies had to conduct public presentations on environmental impact studies. In December
2002, the Regulation of Consultation and Participation for Hydrocarbon Activities defined
procedures and instruments to apply the collective rights of consultation and participation, such
as stages of consultation, consultation prior to issuing a tender and another prior to approval of
the environmental impact studies; objective of the consultation; the mechanisms for
participation, assembly, and dissemination of the information and collection of comments; time
limits for the consultative process; procedures for the analysis and evaluation of comments; and



22. An environmental impact evaluation subsystem covers the process of presentation, revision, licensing, and
    environmental monitoring of an activity or a project proposed.

                                                                                           Annex M


participation in monitoring.     The Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), through the
Subsecretary for Environmental Protection (SPA), became responsible for overseeing
compliance with the principles and procedures established. The regulation also proposed using
the MEM's portal to report on the process, monitoring, and dissemination of the consultations.
To date, the portal has incorporated this. Public participation has increased, as shown in Table
M.l, where the number of public presentations more than tripled between 2001 and 2004.
Congress i s also developing a proposal to redistribute the revenues set aside by the current law in
the Fundfor the Development of the Amazon Region (ECORAE). Currently, the ECORAE law
mandates that petroleum companies contribute US$0.45 per barrel for the eco-development of
the Amazon region, of which municipalities receive 60 percent, provincial counsels receive 30
percent, and ECORAE receives 10percent for direct administration. The initiative would seek to
redistribute the percentages so that the local indigenous populations would be assigned a
percentage of the Fund.
         Socio-Environmental Aspects of New Oil Investments.              To attract new private
investment in the oil sector, the government i s encouraging new tenders for several oil field
blocks. Inpreparing some of the tenders, the government uses Socio-Environmental Diagnostics
(SEDs), which serve as an inputto the consultation process. Insome cases, the SEDs have ledto
community demands for participation in monitoring, a compensation fund, and certifications of
environmental management systems. In other cases, Debt Sustainable Analysis (DSA) i s also
combined with specific environmental liability studies to better identify more complex social
liabilities, leading to an environmental guarantee and insurance to be incorporated into the
bidding documents. The application of socio-environmental diagnosis is not consistent across
the govemment's initiatives to attract private investment, but rather i s discretionary. There are
no minimum requirements of what a tender should contain, irrespective of its importance, with
respect to concrete proposals to eliminate environmental liabilities, social compensation funds,
and environmental guarantees and insurance.
         In December 2002, the regulation of consultation for the participation in hydrocarbon
activities of native towns and Afro-Ecuadorians was launched. This norm defines procedures
and uniform instruments for the application of the collective rights of consultation and
participation. A consultation prior to the tender i s established, as well as one prior to the
approval of the environmental impact study for the development of hydrocarbon, which i s prior
to the execution of the activities.     After two years of application of the Regulation of
Consultation, and a workshop on the regulation of the consultation with the native sector and on
opinions collected with the industry,the SPA i s working on a reform via Supreme Decree. The
basic points of the reform proposed are to clarify whether the prior consultation of execution
should be by project or by phase, and to diminish the time limit for the execution of the
consultations from 60 days to 30 days in the case of consultation prior to the tender, and from 30
days to 15 days inthe case of consultation prior to the execution of the hydrocarbon activities.
         The present government has drafted a document of objectives for the hydrocarbon sector.
It aims "to maximize the respect to the community and the environment inthe areas of influence
of the industry" through the following policies: complying with the laws and international
covenants; assuring that the communities receive the benefit of the ECORAE; requiring
businesses to have an I S 0 14001 certification; promoting training in environmental aspects for
the inhabitants of the Amazon region; and negotiatingthe creation of a petroleum training center
in the Amazon region. Inthe areas of operation of Petroecuador, important social environmental

liabilities exist that are not yet defined and quantified, and that represent a serious obstacle to
private investment. These liabilities need to be identified and procedures need to be established
through which they can be addressed and lifted, including them in the bases of tender if
necessary.
         Despite recent improvements, the environmental procedures applied to government
initiatives to attract private investment in the oil sector need further work.      In addition to
ensuring enforcement of the social and environmental regulations currently ineffect, and inorder
to reactivate the hydrocarbons sector, several minimum requirements in the social and
environmental aspects have been detected, which will need to be included as part of the bidding
procedures. Bidding procedures envision issues such as the obligation to: (a) carry into effect
Socio-Environmental Diagnostics (SEDs); (b) submit specific proposals to evaluate and
eliminate social and environmental liabilities, and not merely identifying such issues; (c) specify
social compensation funds that clarify the participation and concrete benefits to be received by
the local communities; and (d) identify the mandatory requirement of contracting for
environmental insurances and guarantees.
         As a consequence, in 2004 the MEM approved, published, and enforced 273
environmental impact assessments and environmental management plans, and supervised 104
consultation processes carried into effect either by Petroecuador andor by the contractors for the
new oil investments.

                      Annex R. Summary of Consultations with Civil Society

         In March 2004, a broad-based consultation process was organized by the Bank and the
 Government of Ecuador as art of the preparation for the Fiscal Consolidation and Competitive
 Growth Loan (FCCGL 11).2 Buildingon the dialogue and lessons learned from consultation on
                                f

 the first FCCGL, the consultation process for the preparation of the FCCGL I1was expanded to
 ensure greater geographical diversity and expand broader-based participation.                     Hence, the
 consultation brought together more than 150 stakeholders from civil society, academia, central
 and local governments, and the private sector in events in the capital, Quito, and the second-
 largest city, Guayaquil, to discuss the main thrust of the reforms supported by the loan. The
 consultations generated a fruitful discussion on the proposed reforms, helped assess the political
 viability of some of the measures, and assisted in identifying gaps and areas in need o f further
 strengthening. Consultations did not aim at reaching any formal agreement, but at achieving
 broad consensus among participants on the adequacy of selected loan issues and on an approach
 to tackle them followed in the design of the operations.

.Descriptionof ConsultationProcess

         A total of 300 stakeholders representing a broadrange of institutions (a total of 112) from
 a variety of sectors were invited to the consultations, of which 53 percent attended the events (in
 roughly equal numbers in both cities). O f these, 46 percent were from civil society, 27 percent
 from government institutions, 10 percent from universities and think tanks, 8 percent from the
 private sector, 4 percent from the media, 4 percent from bilateral and multilateral institutions,
 and 1percent from religious organizations.
         The organization of the meeting was straightforward, and participation was encouraged.
 A PowerPoint presentation was given about the key content of both operations.                          After
 presentations from the Government and the Bank, participants were organized into working
 groups to discuss the three main areas of the reforms supported by the two loans, respectively:
 (a) Budget, Public Expenditures, Fiscal and Tax Policy and Fiscal Transparency (FCCGL 11);
 and (b) Policies for Economic Growth: Trade Policy, Competitiveness and Labor Policy
 (FCCGL 11). The working group sessions aimed at gathering specific feedback and
 recommendations from the stakeholders on the content of the proposed reforms, which were then
 discussed among all the participants in a plenary session. The process helped in reaching some
 agreements, while divergences of opinion remained on a few sensitive issues. For instance, the
 Guayaquil Network of Jubilee 2000 distributed a document expressing disagreement with the
 current status of the Ecuadorian public debt and the intention of the Government to contract new
 loans with international financial institution^.^^ Their view, which was endorsed by a minority of
 participants, was that reforms such as the ones discussed in the consultation could and should be
 financed and implemented with Ecuadorian resources. Other participants, however, disagreed
 and, rather, expressed support for the operations and provided important feedback on their
 specific content, some of which was incorporated into the loan designs. The recommendations

resulting from the consultations have helped illustrate some of the concrete results that
consultation processescan have on Bank-supported loans.

Recommendationsand Outcomes

        For the FCCGL 11, the consultations turned out to be key to helping assess the political
viability of some of the measures proposed. They also helped to identify gaps in the proposed
reforms and pinpoint components that needed strengthening. As a result of the feedback, some
measures were eliminated from the draft matrix, such as tax reform, others were added, such as
pro-budget transparency and enhanced civil society participation in Customs reform, and some
were modified and adjusted in response to the recommendations made during the consultations,
such as those related to trade reform, in support of free trade negotiations.
        For example, in the area of tax reform, the consultation process helped the Government
and the Bank recognize that the timing was not ripe for implementing a major tax reform. This
recommendation was thus dropped from the loan matrix. The consultations demonstrated that
although most stakeholders agreed on the importance of increasing revenues and improving tax
collection, the specific measures needed in a tax reform remained the subject of strong debate in
a very volatile political context. The consultations thus helped avoid reforms being proposed
that lacked societal backing, and flagged the need to engage in further discussion about specific
policy options in order to achieve a stronger consensus.
        The consultations also revealed the general lack of knowledge in Ecuador about the
country's currently negotiated free trade agreement (FTA) with the United States, and its
potential economic and social impacts. The need for more information on these issues was
raised by many participants. This helped the Bank realize that the domestic process around the
FTA needed to take its full course, and that Bank involvement prior to that may put at risk the
outcomes of the negotiation process. The originally foreseen component on trade was thus, on
one hand, modified to accommodate the need for an overall trade strategy, and, on the other
hand, simplified to a minimumregarding the specific elimination of trade barriers, to avoid any
interference with the domestic processuntilapproval of the FTA.
        Inaddition, the multistakeholder dialogue helped the Government andthe Bank ascertain
the perceived lack of information around Customs reform and the issue of debt repurchase, and
the newly created Fund for Stabilization, Investment and Public Debt Reduction (FEIREP).
Under FEIREP, there was agreement on the need to use a significant share of the revenues
generated from the sale of heavy crude oil to repay public debt, but there was disagreement on
the specific amount. This confirmed the need to pursue efforts to disseminate information about
the use of FEIREP resources. The need for creating a website for FEIREP was therefore
reemphasized as a principal prior action of the loan.
        Finally, all stakeholders during the consultations emphasized the importance of
promoting transparency and access to information, and citizen participation on other budget,
public expenditure, and fiscal policy issues. This feedback led to expanding the transparency
and participationcomponent of the loan. The Government now has discussed the yearly national
budget with the Observatory of Fiscal Policy-a        nongovernmental organization independently
monitoring Ecuador's fiscal policy-and     committed to put in place systems and tools to provide
public access to information on Customs reform.

LessonsLearned
       The consultation process around the FCCGL I1has helped generate a number of lessons
that can contribute to the emerging body of knowledge on the topic, particularly in light of the
recent approval o f the new policy on development policy lending. Lessons were extracted both
inrelationto the management of the consultations process andonbroader strategic issues.
       Continuous dialogue with civil society as part of the Bank's strategy inEcuador has
led to a comprehensive approach of civil society inclusion into the design, monitoring, and
evaluation of reforms. The consultation process itself and the mechanisms to facilitate civil
society participation in the content of both loans illustrate how closely the Bank's civil society
strategy i s converging with the SAPRI recommendations-for             example, independent and
inclusive civil society outreach, the creation of independent civil society committees, and
accountability inthe formulation and execution of public policies.
       There are ways to minimize risks of backlash and protest inherent in opening a
reform process to public debate. Prior sector work can help to better assess the potential social
impact of the reforms (strongly encouraged in the new policy on DPLs), the political viability,
and the positions of different stakeholders. Such studies can help filter out at an early stage
measures that have little or no political viability. This was not done inthe case of tax reform for
Ecuador. Such studies would have provided for an even better-informed discussion. Another
important measure, which was not adopted in the Ecuador case, was to inform about progress in
the execution of measures committed in the first operation. However, this was partly offset by
clearing with the Government all documents that were distributed to participants prior to the
consultations on the proposed content and process for the next operation. This helped the
Government weigh the risks and take appropriate steps to propose anything that could be
considered potentially contentious. These measures assuredthat the consultations would proceed
inapeaceful, constructive way.
        The combination of focus meetings and workshops with civil society organizations
(CSOs)on specific reform issues, with consultations to solicit feedback from a broad range
of civil society actors, augments legitimacy of reforms. Technical input on the design of the
loans was obtained through targeted meetings with CSOs specializing inrespective reform areas,
and through workshops to discuss the specific content of reform components. This specific input
was complemented by civil society's general perception of the proposed reforms, thus helping to
identify potential beneficiaries of reforms, and possibilities for compensating potential losers.
This combination of technical and general debate adds to the legitimacy of the reform process.
        The consultations built channels of communication and nurtured dialogue among
civil society, the Government, and the Bank. They confirmed that the Bank was not
considering them as a one-time event, but as a trust-building process. This is particularly
important in a country prone to political protests and opposition to Bank-supported structural
reforms. Maintaining and showing a genuine commitment to dialogue around proposed reforms,
informing and explaining their objectives and possible impacts, resolving differences, and
hearing feedback, concerns, and recommendations from diverse sectors helps create a climate of
constructive and democratic debate. Central to building a climate of trust into the process was
the participation of the Government, in both the plenary and working groups, and its availability
to answer questions and provide clarifications.

        The consultations helped to further institutionalize and deepen the Bank's dialogue
with civil society on key issues, and to raise greater awareness about the Bank's internal
processes. For example, it helped dispel certain misperceptions about the Bank, the agenda of
which i s often considered on a par with that of the International Monetary Fund. The
consultations provided the opportunity to show the specificity of the agendas of each institution,
and how the Bank's program points at medium- and long-term changes, thereby allowing a more
integrated response to development issues.
        The consultation process helped to strengthen the Bank's civil society strategy in
Ecuador. It i s important to see the relationship with civil society as a continuous process in
which the Bank commits to maintaining a dialogue through its operations and the Country
Assistance Strategy. Inthis case, the consultations not only played a key role in helping identify
specific measures and mechanisms related to civil society monitoring of the loan, but also helped
identify new areas for deepening the Bank's interaction with civil society in Ecuador. Potential
civil society partners and capacity-building and technical assistance needs were identified to
which the Bank could respond. Local capacity needs to be strengthened for the application of
methodologies facilitating the independent monitoring and evaluation of public sector reforms
and the preparation and execution of budgets on both the macro and local levels. Technical
assistance will be provided for the implementation of monitoring tools that allow citizens to
provide feedback on the performance of public service providers, such as citizen report cards and
community scorecards, and to carry out independent budget analyses. Complementary grant
resources have been raised by the Bank to provide training and technical assistance focusing on
the implementation of these methodologies in parallel with project implementation. This helps
to further expand the Bank's support to civic engagement in Ecuador, and to diversify its civil
society strategy.
