     performance of the Bank and the Borrower were also rated\n            satisfactory. Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: 1) long-term Government commitment to the project is\n            central to success. Persistence and flexibility are\n            necessary for pension reform, since the success of new\n            institutions requires changes in attitudes of Government\n            officials and active and retired employees, and gradual\n            adjustments in terms and levels of benefits to attenuate\n            political and social impacts. A healthy economy that\n            generates successful investment results for the Private\n            Pension Fund (AFPs) is a precondition for shrinkage of the\n            National Pension System (SNP). Traditional public pension\n            systems lack adequate records or controls, and thus priority\n            should be given to creating an adequate information base to\n            control expenditures and project future costs; and 2) the\n            Bank should provide for ongoing supervision and follow-up in\n            pension reform which involves complex issues and requires\n            multi-year involvement."}, "docdt": "1998-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
