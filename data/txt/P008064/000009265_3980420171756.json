access to\n            long-term external financing, and provide a clear signal of\n            the Government's determination to persevere. This will\n            occur by: a) deepening pension reform; b) improving the\n            efficiency of capital markets; and c) earmarking part of the\n            privatization proceeds to back pension obligations. The loan\n            will consist of a single trance to the Republic of Peru.\n            Implementation will be shared by the Ministry of Economy and\n            Finance and agencies responsible for social security and\n            capital markets. Fifty percent of the funds will be set\n            aside to finance part of the focus of the Debt and Debt\n            Service Reduction (DDSR) agreement."}, "docdt": "1996-11-25T00:00:00Z"}
