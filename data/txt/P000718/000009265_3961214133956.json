The\n            objectives of the project were to modernize the road\n            transport industry, improve freight forwarding services and\n            customs' clearance, expand the capacity of the Port of\n            Assab, and strengthen coordination among the entities\n            operating in the transport industry. Lessons learned from\n            the project include: (i) the need for limited expectations\n            during periods of radical political change; (ii) the\n            impracticality of using  sophisticated procurement\n            techniques, such as life cycle costing, in operating\n            environments such as Ethiopia; (iii) the inappropriateness\n            of ICB techniques for the provision of trucks to private\n            sector operators and the need for a more flexible approach;\n            (iv) the difficulty of undertaking complex projects with\n            multiple objectives and implementing agencies without a very\n            strong coordination framework; and (v) the need to revise\n            audit arrangements and requirements to respond to changing\n            circumstances. The Project was rated unsatisfactory. The\n            Bank prepared a Transport Sector Memorandum as the basis for\n            future lending to the sector."}, "docdt": "1996-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
