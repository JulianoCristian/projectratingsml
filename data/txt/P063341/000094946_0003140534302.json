"The Fiscal and Administrative Reform\n            Special Sector Adjustment Loan Project, will support the\n            Government of Brazil's program to improve, fiscal\n            performance in general, and, the fiscal performance of the\n            states in particular, with an emphasis on administrative\n            reform to reduce personnel costs, and increase efficiency.\n            Fiscal performance will be improved, mainly by reducing the\n            burden of the federal, state, and municipal\n            government's wage bill, including that in the Federal\n            District. The Fiscal Stability Plan will be introduced, to\n            be initiated shortly, and, laws regulating Amendments to the\n            Constitution related to the Administrative Reform will be\n            implemented. The state's debts will be re-financed, and\n            a states facility support will be established to undertake\n            administrative reforms. While the benefits call for an\n            increased overall public sector balance, resulting from\n            reductions in the level of state personnel expenditures, and\n            reduced real interest rates from improved fiscal\n            performance, it is suggested that risks may occur due to\n            higher interest rates on the public debt, and/or domestic\n            pressures for additional expenditures, coupled with the\n            possibility of recession, preventing a smooth transition of\n            dismissed public employees, to private employment. These\n            risks are mitigated by the Government's policy\n            performance record, and the ongoing economic recovery."}, "docdt": "2000-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
