Both World\n            Bank and Borrower performances are assessed as satisfactory.\n            The lessons learned repeat wisdom common to previous\n            adjustment programs. Borrower commitment and ownership is\n            essential. A focus on outcome and performance is critical. A\n            sound banking system is at the center of a successful\n            adjustment program. Monetary policy can play a central role\n            but cannot substitute for sound fiscal policy. Cutting\n            investment expenditures during fiscal adjustment comes with\n            a heavy price. The Bank tends to underestimate the\n            difficulty of political agreements without which reforms\n            cannot happen and remain in place. Bank preparedness for\n            assisting countries with adjustment lending depends\n            critically on its conducting prior economic and sector work."}, "docdt": "2001-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
