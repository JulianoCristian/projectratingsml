second stage of an\n            irrigation scheme for the Chira and Piura Valleys. The first\n            stage assured the availability of water for the area through\n            the construction of a dam and main diversion canal. The\n            objectives of the proposed second stage project are to\n            increase agricultural production and productivity in the\n            Lower Piura area and raise the incomes of about 11,800\n            families with emphasis on small farmers and cooperative\n            members. This would be accomplished through improvement of\n            irrigation facilities, reclamation of saline soils,\n            protection against floods, assistance for farm development,\n            including credit, and provision of technical assistance. The\n            principal risks associated with the project are: (i)\n            construction delays because of on-going farming operations\n            in areas where rehabilitation and construction of the\n            irrigation and drainage systems would take place; and (ii)\n            failure to retain sufficient qualified staff to provide\n            adequate extension services to small farmers because of low salaries."}, "docdt": "1979-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
