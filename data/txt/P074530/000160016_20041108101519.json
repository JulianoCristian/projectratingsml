The Bank loan supports\n            actions to: (1) reform the legal framework for the conduct\n            of monetary and financial policy; (2) reform the financial\n            sector legal framework aimed at strengthening the regulation\n            of financial groups, creating an orderly market exit\n            mechanism, and enhancing credit risk management; (3)\n            strengthen the legal framework for bank supervision,\n            including consolidated supervision of financial groups; (4)\n            enact legislation to prevent money laundering to reduce\n            illegal activities; and (5) consolidate the banking system\n            through the restructuring or closure of insolvent banks,\n            mergers, and acquisitions. Progress in implementing the\n            reform program supported by this loan has been impressive\n            and, as a result, there has been a significant strengthening\n            of the banking sector.
