F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The broader policy objective of this loan is to assist the Guatemalan Government to implement its
Financial Sector Reform Program, aimed at bringing about a stronger and better functioning
banking sector, able to withstand external shocks and to increase prudent lending to the private
sector, opening access to groups and enterprises today largely excluded from bank financing
(micro, rural and SME financing).

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Macroeconomic Conditions at Appraisal. During the 1990s, Guatemala maintained a
respectable track record of economic growth and stability, with an average real GDP growth of 4
percent, compared to an average population growth of 2.3 percent. Inflation had declined to less
than 9 percent in 2001, after reaching a high of 59.8 percent in 1990. Guatemala had one of the
lowest levels of external indebtedness (13.7 percent of GDP) among countries at similar stages of
development. Fiscal policy was relatively stable, with central government budget deficits
averaging about 1.5 percent of GDP during the 1990s. However, persistent low levels of taxation
were inhibiting public investment in much needed infrastructure and social programs. In the run
up to the 2000 presidential elections, the Government had pursued expansionary monetary and
fiscal policies which resulted in a widening of the current account deficit, a depreciation of the
currency, the loss of foreign exchange reserves, and a credit boom due to increased liquidity in
the banking system. The deterioration in macroeconomic conditions was aggravated by adverse
terms of trade movements, particularly due to depressed coffee prices, and unprecedented weather
related conditions, including the impact of Hurricane Mitch in late 1998.

After taking office in January 2000, the Portillo Administration assigned high priority to
stabilizing the economy. Its policy of restraining expenditures and liquidity through aggressive
open market operations, succeeded in reducing the budget deficit for the combined non-financial
public sector to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2000; interest rates on bank loans had declined sharply
from an average of 27 percent in late 1999 to less than 20 percent a year later. Capital began to
flow back to the country and international reserves increased sharply to US$2.3 billion at the end
of 2001 (close to 5 months of imports). Economic growth, however, remained only slightly above
population growth in 2000, due in part to restrictive fiscal and monetary policies. The economy
suffered additional set backs in 2001, as the sharp decline in coffee prices (the main export) and
the global economic slowdown contributed to further reduce economic growth to only 2.1 percent
for the year.

Structural Reforms. During the 1990s, Guatemala had made important structural reforms,
particularly in the areas of communications, infrastructure and trade. The economy had also
gained from the dynamism of increased trade and integration in a fairly open economy with low
levels of protection. By Appraisal, the Government had introduced important additional structural
reforms, including in the area of tax revenues, with the increase in the income tax rate from 25 to
31 percent. The Government's program to reestablish a stable macroeconomic environment was
agreed with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and supported by a 21 month Stand-by credit
of US$100 million approved in April 2002. The program included policies aimed at generating a
stronger fiscal position and redirecting an ever-increasing share of public expenditures towards
the social sectors. The Government expected that with this program, the economy would grow by
more than 2 percent in 2002, and 3 percent in 2003.

Financial Sector Background. An important area of vulnerability for the Guatemalan economy
at the time, which could have undermined the success of the Government's program, was the
fragility of the financial sector. Banks off-shore and off-balance operations were not reported;
thus they were not regulated, and anecdotal information suggested that these operations amounted
to the same volume as regulated operations. The credit boom of the late 1990s had taken place in
a context of poor banking supervision and prudential regulation, and when the economy slowed


                                               6

down, a number of banks experienced a sharp increase in non-performing loans (NPLs), which
further compromised the soundness of the financial sector. A FSAP (Financial Sector Assessment
Program) jointly conducted by the World Bank and IMF in 2000/2001, had documented the
fragility of Guatemala's financial sector and identified a number of shortcomings of the financial
sector institutional, legal and regulatory framework. The FSAP had warned of the possibility of a
systemic crisis if these vulnerabilities were not addressed in the short-term.

At the time of Appraisal, Guatemala's regulated banking sector comprised 31 banks with assets
equivalent to 34.8 percent of GDP, plus 3 additional private banks (Metropolitano, Promotor and
Empresarial) which the banking authorities had to intervene in 2001. Most banks operated at the
center of financial conglomerates that included a related, unregulated, off-shore bank as well as
related financieras, insurance companies, securities brokers, and companies engaged in leasing,
factoring, credit cards, and warehouse business, which could be regulated or unregulated. The
unregulated entities catered exclusively to Guatemalan residents. Three of the regulated banks
had Government ownership: Crédito Hipotecario Nacional de Guatemala (CHN), Banco de los
Trabajadores and Banco de Desarrollo Rural (about 14.5 percent of the banking system assets).
There was also a Government owned financiera. Six banks had majority foreign ownership
(about 9.6 percent of the banking system assets). Another bank, Banco del Ejercito - Banejer,
belonged to the military.

The regulated portion of the financial sector had shown signs of stress since 1998. By Appraisal,
in addition to the three banks which the authorities had to intervene, there were six banks (one of
them CHN) that were suffering from liquidity and solvency problems and remained in operation
largely due to emergency loans from the Central Bank (BANGUAT) and deposits from the public
sector. The FSAP noted that the real financial situation of the regulated banks was obscured by
lack of information and inadequate accounting practices. Reported figures for March 2002 would
indicate that the sector was well capitalized, with capital equivalent to 14 percent of risk-
weighted assets (CAR) on average, compared to a required CAR of 10 percent; and a return on
equity (ROE) of about 10.5 percent on average. This picture hid substantial under-provisioning of
NPLs, which was 8.18 percent of all loans. If these loans would have been provisioned
adequately, several more banks would have presented severe capital shortages. The unregulated
segment was expected to be even more undercapitalized.

Shortcomings of the Financial Sector Legal and Regulatory Framework. The main
shortcomings identified by the FSAP were the following:

(a) Inadequate institutional framework for the conduct of monetary and financial policy.
Guatemala's obsolete financial sector legislation, dispersed in several pieces of legislation
approved mostly in the 1940s, was increasingly disconnected with the real situation of the
financial sector. Flaws in BANGUAT's Charter limited an appropriate formulation and execution
of monetary and financial policy. These flaws included: (i) a multiplicity of objectives, without a
clear mandate to formulate monetary policy and preserve price stability; (ii) lack of political and
operational autonomy to adopt decisions in monetary matters; (iii) lack of financial autonomy due
to the absence of a clear obligation of the State to maintain the central bank's capital over time, to
ensure its solvency and capability to conduct monetary policy (BANGUAT had a negative net
worth of about 8 percent of GDP, the result of accumulated losses in previous years generated by
the monetary, exchange and credit policies of the Monetary Board- MB); (iv) lack of
accountability and transparency regarding monetary and financial policies and inappropriate
accounting practices, and lack of disclosure of BANGUAT's income statements; (v) vulnerability
due to discretionary and unlimited lender-of-last-resort (LOLR) facilities, which threatened
sound monetary policy and led to moral hazard; and (vi) vulnerability due to flaws in the payment

                                                 7

system, which provided for the implicit guarantee of BANGUAT in the coverage of clearing
house balances.

(b) Deficient prudential regulatory framework. The legal and regulatory framework lacked clear
and stable rules of the game, allowing excessive discretion in the decisions of the regulatory
authorities. In addition, there were many unregulated financial intermediaries including off-shore
entities. Most regulated banks owned unregulated entities and were able to utilize them to
circumvent legal reserve requirements, to hide impaired assets and loans to related parties, or
generate phony capital for regulated banks. Some deficiencies of the regulatory framework
included the following: (i) deficient loan classifications rules, in which loans were classified
mainly on the basis of the length of the past-due period, without regard to the borrower's capacity
to pay, and individually (loan by loan) rather than by debtor, and no provisioning was required for
loans classified in category A which applied to about 90 percent of the system's loan portfolio;
(ii) deficient prudential norms regarding the treatment of loan losses, in which increases in loan-
loss reserves did not have to be recorded as an expenditure in the bank's income statement,
overstating the bank's profitability; (iii) flawed regulation and control of lending to related
parties, which provided inadequate penalties for non-compliance and placed the burden of proof
of related parties transactions on the Superintendency of Banks (SIB); (iv) lack of consolidated
accounting, which made capital adequacy and risk exposures in the unregulated segment of the
financial sector unknown; and (v) weak early correction system, with no framework for early
regularization and enhanced supervision of troubled banks.

(c ) Weak enforcement of prudential regulation. The supervisory capacity of the SIB was
severely affected by lack of information, poor supervisory practices, and severe personnel
shortages. SIB had reduced control over significant changes in the ownership of banks, which
debilitated "fit-and-proper" standards. Major problems included: (i) limited information due to
delays and lack of compliance of banks in providing requested information; (ii) limited
supervisory coverage, with inspections in-situ focused on troubled banks, while less troubled
banks were subject only to extra-situ inspections; (iii) inadequate legal support for SIB's
inspection activities, since it had limited authority for accessing information, and for enforcement
and sanctioning; and (iv) lack of legal protection under the law for bank supervisors.

(d) Deficient judicial framework for the resolution of insolvent banks. The Law for the
Protection of Savings (FOPA) introduced in 1999, was a powerful tool to intervene insolvent
banks, but entailed major risks, due to potentially unlimited access to BANGUAT's resources.
Bank intervention required authorization of the MB, which resulted in delays, and banks in
difficulties were allowed to remain open until liquidation was declared by a judge. This
protracted process allowed for assets stripping and increased the risks of losses to depositors and
BANGUAT. Since the FOPA Law left to the discretion of the banks the decision to create a
guarantee fund to reimburse depositors, the fund was never created.

(e) Legal and information constraints to credit expansion. Access to credit to large extent was
limited to the members of a financial conglomerate due, inter alia, to: (i) deficient legal and
judicial framework for secured transactions. Although the legal framework for immovable
collateral was reasonably good, the legal framework for the use of movable collateral to secure
credit was absent; and (ii) lack of a centralized credit information system. With bank secrecy
regulations extending not only to depositors but also to borrowers, the banks were limited in their
ability to improve their credit risk management, particularly with regards to the monitoring of
large credit exposures to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers.

The Government's financial sector reform program. One of the most important decisions by
the Portillo Administration had been to start addressing the banking sector weaknesses. The
Government had intervened in three small weak banks and two financiera in 2001, paying off
depositors in full, at an initial cost to BANGUAT of close to US$200 million. The high cost of
these interventions had convinced the Government of the need to strengthen financial sector
regulations and supervision, and of introducing a bank resolution mechanism that did not involve
the bailing out of depositors by BANGUAT. Concerned with the possibility of further bank
failures, the Government requested support from the IFIs to elaborate a new legal and regulatory
frameworks that would address the major shortcomings diagnosed by the FSAP. By Appraisal
several new financial bills of law had been presented to Congress. These laws were approved by
Congress prior to Board presentation of the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL).

Rationale for Bank Assistance. The FSAL was designed to support the Government's financial
sector reform program. Bank assistance was justified on the following grounds:

   ·     The Bank was heavily involved in assisting the strengthening of Guatemala's financial
         sector. In response to the worsening financial condition of the banks, the Bank had
         provided strong support to Guatemala's financial sector through technical advisory
         services as a follow up to the 2000/2001 FSAP, including assistance for the preparation
         of the new financial laws. The Bank was, therefore, in good position to assist in the
         implementation of this new legal and regulatory framework.
   ·     The FSAL was an important component of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
         for Guatemala. Support for financial sector legal and regulatory reform was an important
         component of the CAS Progress Report (No.24235-GU) presented to the Board together
         with the FSAL and FTAL. The CAS Progress Report considered that the reforms were
         crucial to ensure macroeconomic stability and establish the pre-conditions for growth,
         necessary for tackling poverty, and that the proposed assistance strategy reflected
         Government objectives and priorities areas for World Bank Group assistance.
   ·     The Government had shown strong commitment to financial sector reforms. This was
         demonstrated by the Government intervening in three small insolvent banks and
         Congress approval of the package of fundamental financial sector laws.
   ·     Justification for a quick disbursing operation was based on budgetary needs. The
         expected financing gap to implement during the 2002/2003 period the economic program
         agreed with the IMF, would be covered with net internal borrowing, privatization
         proceeds and external borrowings, including an IADB loan of US$200 million. It was
         estimated that approximately US$225 million in additional funds would be needed for the
         financial sector modernization process. Although the main justification for the loan was
         on budgetary grounds, Guatemala also faced a deteriorating Balance of Payments
         situation, resulting from large losses in the coffee sector (its main export), in tourism (its
         main foreign exchange earner) and uncertainty about remittances in view of uncertain
         economic prospects in the US.
   ·     The equivalent in Quetzals of the proceeds of the Bank loan were to be used to help
         implement the new bank resolution mechanism. These amounts were to be used to
         increase FOPA's funds and to fund a new Bank Capitalization Fund (FFCB), the two
         main tools that the Government needed for banking resolution, thus reducing the need for
         the Government to use budgetary resources in case of bank closures in the early years of
         the banking reform. Having these two funds well capitalized would be an important
         signal to the market that the Government would be in a position to face any possible
         banking crisis, which would help to strengthen confidence in the banking system.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

Program Development Objectives. The broader policy objective of this loan was to assist the
Guatemalan Government to implement its Financial Sector Reform Program, aimed at bringing
about a stronger and better functioning banking sector, able to withstand external shocks and to
increase prudent lending to the private sector, opening access to groups and enterprises that are
largely excluded from bank financing (micro, rural and SME financing).

The loan had five sub-objectives: (i) reform of the monetary policy legal framework for the
conduct of monetary and financial policy including the capitalization of the central bank; (ii)
reform of the financial sector legal framework aimed at strengthening the regulation of financial
groups, create an orderly market exit mechanism, enhance credit risk management and increase
access to finance; (iii) reform of the banking supervision legal framework aimed at strengthening
the autonomy of the SIB and its legal and institutional capacity to supervise financial groups and
rise banking sector regulation towards international standards; (iv) enactment of legislation to
prevent money laundering to reduce illegal activities and comply with international norms; and
(v) consolidation of the banking system through the restructuring or closure of insolvent banks
and through mergers and acquisitions.

Loan Design. The FSAL was to be disbursed in three tranches of US$50.0 million each: one
tranche upon effectiveness and two floating tranches based on compliance with agreed conditions.
The equivalent in Quetzals of the first tranche proceeds would be transferred to the newly created
FOPA to help it respond to its commitments in case of bank closures. The equivalent in Quetzals
of the second tranche proceeds would be transferred in equal amounts to FOPA and the FFCB,
and the equivalent in Quetzals of the third tranche proceeds would be transferred to the FFCB.
The FSAL paralleled a US$200 million IADB loan that supported financial sector reforms.

Since the implementation of the reform program presented considerable challenges for the
Guatemalan authorities, a Financial Sector Technical Assistance Loan (FTAL) of US$5.0 million
was designed to assist BANGUAT and the SIB. The FTAL, approved together with the FSAL,
was to finance consulting work, training and equipment; complementing an IADB technical
assistance program to the SIB supported by a US$1.0 million FOMIN facility (non-reimbursable).

Key Indicators. The design of PDO and intermediate outcome indicators was not required in the
Program Document (PD) at the time of Board presentation of the FSAL. PDO and intermediate
outcome indicators were incorporated in the 04/17/2005 ISR. The indicators, described in Annex
1, were related but went beyond the Government's compliance with tranche release conditions.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

The Program Development Objectives and Key Indicators were not revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The FSAL supported legal and regulatory reforms needed to strengthen the financial sector and
prevent a systemic banking crisis, as well as the establishment of an orderly bank resolution
process for weak banks. The policy areas supported by the FSAL are grouped under four
categories: (i) strengthening the legal and institutional framework for the conduct of monetary



                                                10

policy; (ii) reform of the financial system legal and regulatory framework; (iii) strengthening of
banking sector supervision; and (iv) establishment of an orderly bank resolution mechanism.

In November 2001 the Guatemalan Congress approved the Anti Money Laundering Law. (Ley
Contra el Lavado de Dinero y Otros Activos); and in April 2002 it approved a package of four
financial laws: the Central Bank Law (Ley Orgánica del Banco de Guatemala); the Monetary
Law (Ley Monetaria); the Banking and Financial Groups Law (Ley de Bancos y Grupos
Financieros); and the Banking Supervision Law (Ley de Supervisión Bancaria). These laws,
prepared with technical advice from the Bank, the IADB and IMF, addressed the legal and
regulatory shortcoming identified by the FSAP. The challenge for the financial and monetary
authorities was to issue the relevant regulations and implement these laws in the face of political
disunity and some reluctance among the banks to more stringent prudential norms and
supervision. The Bank and the authorities agreed on specific actions that would be taken before
each tranche disbursement of the FSAL, aimed at implementing the new legal and regulatory
framework. The conditions for each tranche disbursement are detailed in a table in Section 2.1.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Adequacy of Government's commitment. Preparation of the FSAL and FTAL took place
during the early years of the Portillo administration (01/2000 to 12/2004). The SIB and
BANGUAT authorities of the time were deeply concerned with the possibility of a systemic
banking crisis and had moved decisively to intervene in three insolvent banks, despite the close
connection of the owner of two of them with the Portillo administration. Prior to Appraisal, the
SIB and BANGUAT authorities had worked closely with the Bank, IMF and IADB in redefining
the financial sector legal and regulatory framework in line with the FSAP recommendations.
Evidence of the strong commitment of the authorities to the financial sector reform program was
that all five new financial sector laws had been approved by Congress before Appraisal.
Commitment to the financial sector reforms remained high during the rest of the Portillo
administration and continued to be high when the Berger administration took office in January
2004, despite the appointment of a new Superintendent of Bank in November 2004. The president
of BANGUAT remained in its position until completing his mandate in October 2006.

Soundness of the background analysis supporting the operation. The policy reforms
supported by the FSAL are based on the recommendations of the 2000/2001 FSAP. The Bank
preparation team was composed of a number of financial sector specialists, including the Senior
Regional Financial Advisor and a lawyer specialized in financial laws, who deepened the FSAP
analysis. The background analysis supporting this operation was accurate in assessing the
weaknesses of the financial sector and identifying the shortcomings of the financial sector legal
and regulatory framework.

Assessment of the operation's design. The operation was well designed not only in terms of the
policy actions that it supported, but also in the sequencing of the reforms, the use of the proceeds
of the loan to capitalize the FFCB and FOPA, and the design of the companion FTAL to assist the
authorities to implement the reform program. The decision to design the FSAL as a three tranche
operation to support not only the enactment of a new financial legal and regulatory framework,
but also its implementation was appropriate. Thus, while the first tranche supported the design,
approval and enactment of the new legislation, the second and third tranches were conditioned to
the actual implementation of the new legislation and the institutional strengthening of the
implementing agencies.

The decision to earmark the equivalent in Quetzals of the FSAL proceeds to fund FOPA and the
FFCB, the two main components of the financial safety net, was insightful and proved crucial for
the successful resolution of two weak banks at the closing of this operation. Since the new
financial legislation limits the Central Bank LOLR capabilities, it was important to create the
FFCB to facilitate bank resolutions under the new bank resolution scheme. It was also important
to strengthen FOPA, which at the time of loan preparation had no resources to reimburse
depositors in case of a bank closure. The existence of well capitalized FFCB and FOPA
strengthened the confidence in the banking system and may have helped prevent possible bank
runs when one bank failed in October 2006 and another in January 2007.

The FTAL was appropriately designed to assist both the SIB and BANGUAT to meet the FSAL
conditions related to the implementation of the new legal and regulatory framework. The FTAL
technical assistance focused on the following areas: (i) the establishment and operation of the
FFCB; including the design of its Operating Principles and Procedures and training of SIB and
BANGUAT staff on bank resolution procedures; (ii) drafting new financial sector legislation
concerning insurance, movable collateral and non-bank financial institutions; (iii) establishing the
CIS; (iv) strengthening the SIB to advance in the process towards risk-based, consolidated

                                                 14

supervision of financial conglomerates and AML/CTF surveillance; and (v) assisting BANGUAT
in the modernization of the payments system (complemented by technical assistance provided by
an IADB FOMIN to develop consolidated and risk-based supervision manuals).

Relevance of the risks identified at Appraisal and effectiveness of mitigation measures. The
risks associated with this operation identified at Appraisal were clearly spelled out in the PD. To
the extent that some of these risks materialized, the mitigation measures were effective in
minimizing their effect on the development objectives of this operation. One risk mentioned in
the PD was that the authorities could fail to issue the required regulations, or otherwise
implement the new financial legislation, as a result of political constraints or lack of technical
capacity. This risk did not materialize. The authorities were remarkably resistant to political
pressure and moved decisively to implement the new legislation, including requiring banks to
increase their capital to meet the new rules, and intervening and resolving failing banks utilizing
the new resolution scheme.

The PD also points to risks in the transition from the old to the new legal system, particularly the
risk that the new prudential rules could expose more clearly the weak financial conditions of
Guatemalan banks, including their off-shore entities. This would accelerate the need to capitalize
some banks and close others, at a time in which FOPA was still under-funded and unable to cover
the insured depositors. This risk materialized to some extent. Several banks were in effect
undercapitalized under the new rules, but they increased their capital at the request of the SIB.
Two banks were intervened in late 2006 and early 2007. The first one due to its no compliance
with a regularization plan agreed with the SIB and the second due to liquidity problems resulting
from imprudent credit policies and irresponsible treasury management. Both banks were
successfully resolved through P&A operations. Their resolution was helped by FOPA which had
received the equivalent in Quetzals of half of the FSAL proceeds. The uncertainty about the
capital needs of the off-shore entities remains a major risk for the financial sector. To reduce this
risk, the FTAL is providing assistance to the SIB to advance in its transition towards a risk-based
consolidated supervision approach. However, as stated in the 2005/06 FSAP Update, this is a
long process that will continue well beyond the implementation of the FSAL.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

(a) M&E Design. The Policy Matrix was effective in monitoring the main program outputs
associated with this operation. A number of PDOs indicators were designed after loan approval to
ascertain periodically whether the development objectives of the FSAL were being met.

(b) M&E Implementation. PSRs (Project Status Reports) and ISRs (Implementation Status and
Results Reports) were completed on schedule. Substantial back to office reports were produced
by supervision missions prior to the introduction of the ISRs. During supervision missions the
Policy Matrix and the corresponding sections of the legal agreement functioned as the main de
facto M&E tool. Supervision missions of both the FSAL and FTAL regularly collected data on
banking sector performance to evaluate the impact of the operation on the sector and report
progress in all the key indicators.

(c ) M&E Utilization. The information and data obtained by supervision missions on compliance
with tranche conditions, political changes that could affect the pace of implementation of some
reforms, and banking sector performance, were effectively used by staff and management to
make decisions about technical assistance needs and the ratings of the operation.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

The 2005/06 joint IMF-WB FSAP Update concluded that there is still a need for significantly
strengthening consolidated supervision, and for better risk-management practices by financial
institutions. While the recent successful resolution of two banks (one in October 2006 and the
other in January 2007) showed the adequacy of the new legal and institutional framework, their
failure corroborated the conclusions of the FSAP Update. In the aftermath of the two bank
resolutions, the SIB and BANGUAT authorities requested continuous Bank assistance and the
Minister of Finance requested a second extension of the Closing Date of the FTAL from June 31,
2007 to December 31, 2009, and the reinstatement of US$2.0 million that had been cancelled in
June 2005 (from the original US$5.0 million) for budgetary reasons. It was agreed that the
reinstated amounts would support efforts to advance in the transition to a risk-based supervision
model and enhanced consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates, strengthen supervision
of AML/CTF activities, enhance the financial safety net, and continue the modernization of the
payments system.

The programmatic series of annual Development Policy Loans (DPLs) announced in the 2005-
2008 CAS support measures to further strengthen Guatemala's financial sector. A trigger for
DPL1 was that Guatemala was taken off the list of Non-Cooperative Countries of the FATF in
July 2004. A trigger for DPL2 was improved supervision of financial groups as evidenced by: (i)
organizational restructuring of the SIB to enhance implementation of risk-based supervision; and
(ii) satisfactory progress in mapping of financial conglomerates in line with FSAP
recommendations. In light of the findings of the 2005/06 FSAP Update, the Bank and the
Guatemalan authorities agreed to shift the focus of the DPL series towards greater support for the
financial sector. Reflecting this shift, triggers for DPL3 (approved on August 2, 2007) concerning
the financial sector are: (i) further improvements in supervision of financial conglomerates; (ii)
initiation of the irrevocable resolution of two failed banks Bancafé and Banco de Comercio; and
(iii) establishment and operation of a Special Investigating Unit in the SIB responsible for the
investigation of illegal financial activities.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The objective of strengthening Guatemala's financial system to reduce the risk of a financial
crisis and stimulate prudent lending remains highly relevant to Guatemala and to the Bank
assistance strategy in that country. Despite the substantial progress in strengthening the financial
sector achieved under the FSAL and FTAL, more remains to be done. The recent bank failures,
although successfully resolved, point to the need to further strengthen supervision of financial
conglomerates to detect and prevent the type of illegal activities that led to these bank failures.
Several objectives of the FSAL remain relevant for the near future, including the objective of
moving towards a risk based supervisory approach and fully adopting international accounting
norms. Also, the objective of improving access to credit though new legislation to strengthen
creditors' rights and transparency of financial information, and establishing the institutional
framework for the capital markets and financial cooperatives remain very relevant objectives to
stimulate growth and employment creation in Guatemala.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives (explained in detail in Annex 7)

a. Achievement of the Program's Broader Development Objective

Bringing about a stronger and better banking sector, able to withstand external shocks and
to increase prudent lending to the private sector: Satisfactory Performance. A clear evidence
of the increased strength of Guatemala's financial system is its ability to withstand the failure of
two banks (in October 2006 and January 2007) with minimum risk of contagion to other banks.
Official figures indicate that after the exit from the market of these two banks, all the banks in the
system present risk weighted capital adequacy ratios (CAR) over the statutory minimum of 10
percent, with an average CAR for all the system of 13.6 percent as of May 31, 2007. Although
this level of capitalization may be overstated due to remaining under-provisioning, the
capitalization of banks has substantially improved compared to mid-2001, during FSAL
preparation. The quality of the banks' lending portfolios have improved with NPLs as a
percentage of total loans dropping from a system's average of 7.9 percent at end 2002 to 5.22
percent in March 2007. Bank profitability has also improved with an increase in the system's
ROA from 0.7 percent at end-2001 to 2.1 percent in March 2007, and of the ROE from 7.8
percent to 24.7 percent during the same period. A strengthened banking sector has also been able
to increase lending to the private sector. The portfolio of bank credit to the private sector
increased by nearly 33 percent in dollar terms between March 2006 and March 2007 (from
US$5.23 billion to US$6.96 billion); although, as typical in a banking system that has
experienced a period of crisis, much of the credit increase has been in consumer loans.

b. Achievement of the Program's Sub Objectives

Reform of the monetary policy legal framework for the conduct of monetary and financial
policy including the capitalization of the Central Bank: Satisfactory Performance. This
outcome was achieved through the enactment of new Monetary and Central Bank Laws, the
capitalization of the Central Bank (partly achieved), and the strengthening of the payments
system, which was a major source of vulnerability for the Central Bank, as described below.

Enactment of new Monetary and Central Bank Laws and their regulations. These new laws
significantly strengthened the legal framework for the conduct of monetary and financial policy.
The Monetary Law modernized the legislation in the area of exchange rate policy and guaranteed
the free convertibility of the currency and the free movement of capital. The basic principles of
the new Central Bank Law and the regulations issued before second tranche of the FSAL are
described in Annex 8.

Capitalization of the Central Bank. This outcome was partially achieved. The new Central Bank
Law establishes a mechanism to compensate BANGUAT for policy related losses to ensure the
maintenance of its capital. Capitalization of BANGUAT through the issuing of a bond to settle
past fiscal losses was a condition for the second tranche release of the FSAL. However, Congress
did not approve the request of the MFP for issuing a bond to settle fiscal losses due to political
implications. Nevertheless, this condition was considered as partially met because the expected
effect of the recognition by the MFP of the old debt to BANGUAT had already taken place. A
condition for third tranche disbursement was that BANGUAT's losses incurred after 2002 be
compensated with performing bonds. Treasury Bonds were issued to compensate BANGUAT's
losses in 2005 and 2006, establishing a precedent on using this mechanism to maintain
BANGUAT's equity.



                                                 17

Strengthening of the Payments System. The shortcomings in the payments system identified at
appraisal have been largely addressed. In 2002, BANGUAT created the Payments System
Committee to coordinate the implementation of the project for the Modernization of the National
Payments System which included: strengthening the payments system regulatory framework;
implementing a modern payments system including an electronic clearing system for banks; and a
Real Time Gross Settlement System (RGTS). The regulatory framework for the payments system
has been substantially strengthened. The RGTS has been fully operational since January 2006.

Reform of the financial sector legal framework aimed at strengthening the regulation of
financial groups, create an orderly market exit mechanism, enhance credit risk
management and increase access to finance: Satisfactory Performance. This outcome was
achieved through the enactment of the Banking and Financial Groups Law and its regulations;
strengthening the capabilities of BANGUAT and SIB to implement the new legislation through
FTAL technical assistance; and presentation for approval to Congress of second generation
financial bills to broaden access to credit, as explained below.

Enactment of a new Banking and Financial Groups Law and its regulation. This law addresses
most of the shortcomings of the previous legislation such as establishing norms for the
consolidated supervision and regulation of financial groups. The basic principles of the law and
the regulations issued prior to the FSAL second tranche release are described in Annex 8.

Legal and institutional reforms to broaden access to credit. Several bills aiming to broaden
access to credit have been presented or are expected to be presented to Congress for approval
including the draft Insurance Law that is pending final approval, the draft Secured Transactions
Law (now called the Movable Guarantees Law), and the draft Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries
Law (now called Microfinance Law).

Reform of the banking supervision legal framework aimed at strengthening the autonomy
of the SIB and its legal and institutional capacity to supervise financial groups and rise
banking sector regulation towards international standards: Satisfactory Performance. This
outcome was achieved through the enactment of a new Banking Supervision Law and its
regulations, and the progress being made by the SIB in meeting the benchmarks of its Plans of
Action to implement the new regulatory and supervisory framework, including advances in
moving towards a risk-based consolidation supervision approach.

Enactment of a new Bank Supervision Law and its regulations. This law enhances the
supervisory and sanctioning powers of the SIB. The main features of this law and the regulations
issued prior to second tranche disbursement of the FSAL are described in Annex 8.

SIB has met most of the benchmarks of its Action Plans for the implementation of the new
regulatory and supervisory framework. Evidence of the strengthening of banking supervision is
that the SIB has been able to meet most of the benchmarks of its Plans of Action to implement the
new regulatory and supervisory framework. The SIB met eight out of ten benchmarks, partially
met one, and failed to meet another one. SIB compliance with the agreed benchmarks is
summarized below and described in more detail in Annex 9.

         SIB    compliance    with   risk-management      benchmarks,  consolidated   supervision
         benchmarks, and accounting and auditing benchmarks. The SIB met all eight risk
         management benchmarks. All banks have established risk-management committees and
         adopted risk management manuals. All banks have been supervised (on and off-site) in
         accordance with the provisions of the new financial legal framework. The SIB has

                                                 18

         authorized the formation of 15 financial groups and has rated and authorized the
         operations of 11 off-shore banks, more than required by the benchmarks. An Accounting
         Manual for Bank Operations adopting international accounting norms (NICs) that was
         approved in 2006 represents a significant advance towards incorporating NICs, although
         with several differences from them, as explained in Annex 9.The SIB could not meet the
         benchmark requiring that all banks and finance companies utilize the new accounting
         norms because the new Accounting Manual will be of obligatory application as of
         January 1, 2008. A registrar for external auditors is operating within the SIB.

SIB has made progress in carrying out a comprehensive examination of the banking sector on
a consolidated basis, including off-shore entities. The first steps in moving towards consolidated
supervision were the rating and authorization by the SIB of 15 financial groups and 11 off-shore
banks. Further progress in this area has been the mapping of the interrelationships between
financial groups and subsidiaries and related parties. The SIB is starting to design specialized
supervisory tools to model the effects of some risks on regulatory capital, is undergoing an
organizational restructuring to enhance the implementation of risk-based supervision, and is
elaborating a Risk Based Supervision Manual for banks and off-shore entities.

Establishment of the Credit Information System (CIS). In 2004, the SIB issued norms to guide
the CIS, which has provided over 2.3 million consultations as of 2007. Credit registry data has
contributed in enhancing credit concentration and risk assessment. The data in the CIS has
improved and is being used by the SIB to strengthen its supervisory function.

Enactment of legislation to prevent money laundering to reduce illegal activities and comply
with international norms: Satisfactory Performance. This outcome has been achieved through
the enactment of a new AML/CTF Law and the strengthening of the capability of SIB to
implement the new law. The law established the creation of a Specific Unit Against Money
Laundering Intendencia de Verificación Especial (IVE), within the SIB. By end-2002, the IVE
was fully operational, and the GAFI Financial Action Task Force (Review Group for the
Americas) indicated that Guatemala met all 25 qualification criteria. In 2004, Guatemala was
taken off the list of GAFI's non-cooperative countries.

Consolidation of the banking system through the restructuring or closure of insolvent banks
and through mergers and acquisitions: Satisfactory Performance. This outcome was
achieved through BANGUAT's and SIB's implementation of the bank resolution mechanism
contemplated in the Banking Law of 2002 and the establishment of FOPA and FFCB (supported
by FTAL). The banking system has advanced in the process of consolidation.

Establishment of a new bank regularization/resolution mechanism. The new legislation
established a new procedure of dealing with problem banks that consists of agreeing on
regularization plan, ordering the suspension of the bank's operation in the case that the
regularization plan is unsuccessful, and transferring the bank's deposits and an equivalent amount
of its assets to willing banks in the system.

Establishment of the Bank Capitalization Fund (FFCB). The FFCB (renamed FCB) was
created by Congressional Decree with the approval of the FSAL. Its objective is to support bank
resolution transactions providing additional capital (subordinated loans) to the purchasing banks.
The FTAL supported the preparation of the Operating Principles and Procedures Manuals, which
were approved by the MFP in 2004. The FFCB continues to operate in accordance with its
principles, as confirmed by external auditors.


                                                19

Strengthening the Deposit Insurance Fund (FOPA). FOPA insures deposits for up to Qs20,000
(US$2,600) per individual or entity in a local bank or subsidiary of a foreign bank. The fund is
administered by BANGUAT. FOPA has participated in the resolution of banks in October 2006
and January 2007 and was subsequently recapitalized.

Resolution of insolvent banks. As indicated before, by Appraisal there were three small failed
banks that had been intervened by the Government in 2001 and six banks (including CHN),
which were suffering from liquidity and solvency problems. The three banks, two weak banks
(Banejer and Banoro), and CHN have been resolved.

In October 2006, the MB suspended Bancafé, the fourth largest bank, and in January 2007, Banco
de Comercio. The resolution of these two banks is very significant because they are the first rapid
resolution cases ever implemented without going through liquidation, by using the new resolution
mechanism established in the 2002 Banking Law (supported by FSAL and FTAL).The resolution
of the banks heightened the need to strengthen risk-based consolidated supervision and enhance
the effectiveness and funding of FOPA and the FFCB. Since the failure of these two banks,
domestic financial markets have remained stable with no systemic runs.

Utilization of the FFCB to support bank resolution transactions. A condition for third tranche
disbursement of the FSAL was that the FFCB support bank resolution transactions requiring
additional capital in an amount of at least US$25.0 million, including stakeholders' contributions.
This condition had not been met in late 2006, when the Government requested disbursement of
the third tranche. A waiver was granted based on the consideration that an amount equivalent to
the third tranche would be used to increase funding of the FFCB, that timely availability of these
funds would help strengthen confidence in the system, and that one of the banks that had
participated in the resolution of Bancafé had already applied for FFCB funds (with the other two
banks expected to apply).By the Closing Date, the FFCB had approved funding to all three banks.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)
Rating: Satisfactory

The FSAL and the FTAL have been crucial to support the strengthening of Guatemala's financial
sector and to reducing the risk of future financial crisis in the country. The main accomplishments
of both complementary operations are: First, the adoption by Guatemala of a modern financial
sector legal and regulatory framework that provides the basis for the conduct of an effective
monetary policy; strengthened regulation of financial intermediation entities, including off-shore
banks; and money laundering activities. Second, the strengthening of the SIB, which has enabled
it to meet specific benchmarks for the implementation of the new regulatory and supervisory
framework, with particular emphasis on transitioning to a new system of risk-based consolidated
supervision of financial groups. Third, the implementation of a new bank resolution mechanism
that does not involve the bailout of failed banks or the compensation of depositors by the
Government. Most importantly, the FSAL has made possible the implementation of this
mechanism through agreement with the authorities to fund both FOPA and the FFCB with the
equivalent in Quetzals of the loan proceeds. The existence of this fully funded mechanism has
been extremely important in allowing the authorities to deal with two recent bank failures without
losses for BANGUAT or the depositors, and with no negative systemic effects.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

This operation was not intended to have a direct impact on poverty or social development, but an
indirect one by addressing financial sector weaknesses through the strengthening of the regulatory
and supervisory framework and practices and by adopting an efficient and orderly bank resolution
mechanism. These reforms have reduced the risk of a systemic banking crisis avoiding the high
social costs associated with such crises. The international experience is that financial crises entail
huge fiscal costs that crowd out social spending with dramatic effects on poverty increase. The
fiscal cost of the 1999 banking crisis in Indonesia amounted to 50 percent of GDP. The Brazil
crisis of 1994 had a fiscal cost of about 13 percent of GDP and the Mexican crisis of 1994/1995
had a cost to the Government of about 20 percent of GDP. A study of the cost of banking crises in
56 countries during 1973-1997 found that they had generated an accumulative loss of 8.3 percent
of GDP. The strengthening of banks and increasing profitability has enabled banks to increase
lending, which is an important factor to promote economic growth.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The FSAL and FTAL have had a major impact in strengthening the institutional capacity of
BANGUAT and the SIB. BANGUAT has significantly strengthened its financial and operational
autonomy to conduct monetary policy. Particularly important has been the actual establishment of
a mechanism to ensure the maintenance of BANGUAT's capital through the compensation by the
Treasury of losses incurred by BANGUAT in the implementation of the Government's economic
policies. Also, BANGUAT has reduced the institutional vulnerabilities it faced due to flaws in the
payments system, which has been substantially strengthened. BANGUAT has also strengthened
its capability to manage FOPA and the FFCB, the two pillars of Guatemala's financial sector
safety net. The FTAL financed international consultants to prepare the Operational Principles and
Procedures Manuals of the FFCB and provide intensive training to BANGUAT and SIB in the
use of both funds to support bank resolution transactions.

The SIB has also strengthened its capability to supervise the financial system. In particular it has
been able to meet most of the benchmarks agreed with the Bank of its Action Plans for the
implementation of the new regulatory and supervisory framework, which involved moving
towards risk-based consolidated supervision of financial groups. The SIB continues receiving
technical assistance from the FTAL in this area. SIB has also created and is successfully
managing two new units: the IVE and the CIS. Most importantly, the SIB and BANGUAT have
received intensive training in the context of the FSAL and FTAL in bank resolution procedures
which enabled them to successfully implement two bank resolutions through P&A schemes,
respectively for the fourth largest bank in October 2006 and a smaller bank in January 2007.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The risk that the development outcomes of this operation will not be maintained is moderate. The
financial sector legal and regulatory changes supported by this operation were approved by
Congress after intense public consultation. From this point of view, the reforms have strong
legitimacy and political support. These reforms have been maintained through a change in
administration and changes in the positions of Minister of Finance and Superintendent of Banks.
The new bank resolution mechanism has been successfully tested and proven effective in
containing a possible sector wide crisis. An indication of the commitment of the Guatemalan
authorities to continue the financial sector reforms is that following the two recent bank
resolutions, the Guatemalan authorities requested the Bank for an extension of the FTAL Closing
Date and the reinstatement of US$2.0 million (out of US$5.0 million) of that loan that had been
cancelled due to fiscal reasons, to continue improving the regulation and supervision of financial
groups. There is the risk, unlikely in the near future, that Guatemala's economic conditions could
deteriorate due to external or internal shocks, to such an extent that would affect the financial
sector as a whole. However, the prudential regulation and bank resolution mechanism of the
current legal framework would minimize the risk of a systemic crisis.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The Bank preparation team made efforts to ensure a high quality at entry of this operation. The
policy reforms agreed with the Government were based on the recommendations of the 2000/01
FSAP. Post FSAP technical assistance by the Bank and the IMF, with the collaboration of IADB
assisted the Guatemalan financial authorities in the drafting of the four basic financial laws that
are at the core of this operation. The Bank preparation team played a very active role in
coordinating this assistance that included detailed comments at different stages of the elaboration
of the bills to be presented to Congress. It participated in discussions of the draft laws with the
MB and groups of bank managers. Most importantly, the Bank team participated in technical
discussions with the Congressional Financial Commission to explain the objectives and scope of
the reforms. In particular, the Bank team conveyed to Congressmen that the FFCB was not meant
to compensate bad bankers, but to facilitate the resolution of banks with the preservation of the
savings of all the bank depositors. These discussions were crucial to the approval of the laws.

The Bank authorities strongly supported the joint preparation of the FSAL and the FTAL, to
identify the technical assistance that BANGUAT and the SIB needed to be able to implement the
reform program supported by the FSAL. Both operations were jointly presented to the Board for
approval. A Bank quality at entry review conducted shortly after Board approval, rated quality at
entry as highly satisfactory, pointing out the chain of assistance from the FSAP to the post-FSAP
technical assistance to the adjustment operation, the close and effective coordination between the
Bank, the IMF and the IADB, and the complementation between the FSAL and the FTAL.




                                                 22

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

Bank staff remained closely engaged with the authorities in the implementation of the financial
sector reforms supported by this operation though intensive and often coordinated supervision of
the FSAL and FTAL. Bank staff showed flexibility in using FSAL and FTAL supervision efforts
to provide assistance to the Guatemalan financial authorities in addressing problems that emerged
in rapidly changing circumstances. Areas of intensive Bank assistance during supervision worth
mentioning include:

(i) Bank assistance to establish and utilize the bank resolution mechanism. Bank staff supervised
closely the work of the international consultants that elaborated the FFCB operating principles
and procedures and participated in the training provided to BANGUAT and SIB staff. The Bank
team was pro-active in suggesting and later approving modifications to the FFCB operating
principles to respond to the type of assistance requested by the banks. Bank staff was also pro-
active in seeking support from senior management to quickly disburse the third tranche of the
FSAL during the crisis without putting in jeopardy the operation's objectives. Bank staff was
intensively involved in assisting the authorities with the first two bank resolutions using the P&A
procedures, fielding technical missions in November 2006, January 2007 and Mach 2007.
Drawing from early lessons from these resolutions, Bank staff helped to identify areas for
strengthening bank supervision and resolution practices, advised the authorities on redefining the
use of the FTAL, and suggested options to replenish FOPA.

(ii) Bank assistance to move towards consolidated and risk-based supervision approach. At the
request of the Guatemalan Authorities the Bank organized an FTAL mission in June 2006 to
assist in the definition of a medium term strategy for credit risk-management and supervision.
The mission assessed strengths and weaknesses in three areas: (i) the level and sophistication of
risk management skills in the banking sector; (ii) the extent of risk based orientation and level of
capacity of the supervisory authorities; and (iii) the state of the credit information infrastructure,
including the quality of auditing and accounting standards to assess the creditworthiness of bank
customers. Based on the diagnosis, the Bank team prepared a report proposing a roadmap of a
sequence of policy actions in each of these three areas. The authorities are in the process of
implementing many of these actions.

(iii) Bank assistance to promote support for financial sector reforms. During supervision, Bank
staff organized workshops with the financial authorities and bank managers to discuss the
importance of financial sector reform. The latest workshop took place in September 2006 with the
Economic Committee of Congress to explain the importance of sound reform and provide expert
comments on the proposed Insurance Law, inviting representatives of regional insurance
regulators to share their experience.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

Bank performance during preparation and implementation has been exemplary in several respects.
First, the adjustment operation was appropriately designed to support a number of financial sector
reforms that had been identified by the FSAP as necessary to avoid a systemic financial crisis.
Second, the Bank provided intensive post-FSAP technical assistance to the Guatemalan
authorities in the preparation of the financial sector draft laws and engaged actively with


                                                23

Congress representatives to ensure their understanding and support for the reforms. Bank staff
coordinated closely with the IMF and IADB to provide consistent advice to the authorities in the
drafting of these laws. Third, the Bank provided intensive technical assistance to both
BANGUAT and SIB, to help them to implement the reform program, not only through the FTAL,
but also during supervision missions and through the organization of workshops. The Bank
intensified its assistance to help the authorities implement the new resolution mechanism when
the fourth bank in the country failed. The authorities have praised this assistance and requested
the extension of the FTAL to receive further Bank assistance.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government's performance during preparation was satisfactory. The Portillo administration
reacted positively to the FSAP recommendations and requested support from the IFIs to design
and implement a comprehensive financial sector reform program. The authorities of BANGUAT
and SIB enjoyed autonomy to act as Bank counterparts in the design of the adjustment operation.
MFP authorities were diligent in seeking Congressional approval, first of the basic financial
sector laws supported by the FSAL, and subsequently of both the FSAL and FTAL. The
Government's performance during program implementation was also satisfactory. The Berger
administration that took office in January 2005, maintained the same commitment to the reform
program as the previous administration. In a small country like Guatemala it is not surprising that
some of the owners of the banks resolved in the context of this operation had close ties with high
Government officials. Notwithstanding these ties, the Government authorities carried out
resolutions processes that implied the loss of the owner's equity.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of BANGUAT and SIB, during preparation was highly satisfactory. Both
agencies worked closely with the Bank, IMF and IADB in the design of the basic financial sector
laws and worked very hard for their approval by Congress. They were also active participants in
the design of the adjustment and technical assistance operations. Their performance during
implementation was satisfactory, as they remained committed to the FSAL development
objectives and worked hard in meeting nearly all tranche conditions. Nevertheless, there were
implementation delays that required three extensions of the Closing Date from June 30, 2004 to
March 31, 2007 (in effect the loan was totally disbursed by December 31, 2006). An initial delay,
not related to the implementing agencies, was due to the longer than expected time that Congress
took to approve the Bank loans. Additional delays occurred due to SIB difficulties in meeting
some of the benchmarks of its plan of action, particularly those related to the adoption of a
consolidated and risk-based supervision approach. In hindsight, some of these delays were to be
expected because the transition to risk-based supervision is a difficult process that usually takes
several years to accomplish. There were also substantive delays in reaching agreement on the
three draft laws that were to be presented to Congress for approval.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The FSAL has achieved its development objective of strengthening Guatemala's financial system,
reducing the risk of a financial crisis and stimulating renewed lending. This objective was


                                                24

achieved as a result of the strong and sustained commitment to the financial sector reform
program at all levels of Government during the course of two administrations. Congress did its
part by approving the new financial sector legal framework and the two Bank loans that
supported the reforms. The MFP, the MB and the implementing agencies did their part by
implementing the reforms, including strengthening banking regulation and supervision, and
resolving weak banks, even if some of these reforms affected entrenched financial interests.

6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)
i) The quality of the technical analysis underpinning a policy based operation is crucial to its
success. The FSAL policy conditionality was based on the findings of the FSAP and further
technical analysis conducted during preparation. The high quality of the technical analysis was
crucial to engage the authorities' commitment to the reform agenda during preparation of this
operation. High quality technical analysis and advice was also carried out during supervisions.
This continued technical and policy dialogue with the authorities and their technical teams was
important to maintain the authorities' ownership and commitment to the FSAL development
objectives during the course of two administrations.

ii) Policy based operations need to take into consideration that the change from a compliance
based supervision approach to a risk-based consolidated supervision approach may take longer
than usually envisaged. The Plans of Action of the SIB to implement the financial sector legal
and regulatory reforms had benchmarks that proved excessively optimistic and did not take into
account that the implementation of some of the reforms is a complex process that may include the
training of the staff of the supervisory agency and of the banks. As a result, some of the
benchmarks had to be waived. However, it could be argued that the adoption of ambitious
benchmarks was a good incentive to accelerate the reforms.

ii) The existence of a well funded Bank Capitalization Fund to support bank restructuring can be
an effective stabilizing factor for the financial system, independently of its actual utilization. A
condition for third tranche disbursement was the use of FFCB funds to support bank resolution
transactions. The third tranche was disbursed with a waiver of this condition because by the time
of tranche disbursement, in December 2006, the FFCB had not been used to support bank
resolutions. The FFCB did support bank resolutions after tranche disbursement. It could be
argued that in future operations that support this type of funds, the conditionality should be that
they are fully operational and not that the funds have been actually used in bank resolutions. Also,
the fund should be able to lend to the deposit insurance fund because both funds have
complementary roles in bank resolution processes.

iii) Policy based operations may require strong technical assistance efforts as part of the
supervision process. The FTAL provided crucial technical assistance to strengthen the capacity of
BANGUAT and SIB, to implement the reform actions supported by the FSAL. Supervision
missions of both loans also provided timely technical assistance and advisory services to the
implementing agencies including after the failure of the fourth largest bank during the second half
of 2006. This intense level of technical assistance efforts is often crucial for the success of policy
based operations, but the needed resources are not always available to Bank teams, if there is no
parallel technical assistance loan. Even if there is a technical assistance loan, it cannot be used to
fund Bank staff, which some times is the best qualified to provide the technical advice needed for
effective implementation of the loan conditions. Mechanisms are needed to fund this type of
Bank provided technical assistance in ways that do not impinge on the usually limited preparation
and supervision budgets.


                                                25

iv) Multi-tranched financial sector adjustment operations are effective instruments to support
major financial sector reforms. The success of the FSAL/FTAL shows that a multi-tranched
adjustment operation can be very effective in cases of major financial sector reforms that involve
the enactment of new basic legislation and its regulations, and the institutional strengthening of
the agencies in charge of implementing the reforms. A multi-tranched adjustment operation can
support the process of reform at different stages and respond to unforeseen challenges that could
derail the reform process. DPLs are also effective in supporting reform programs, but may not be
able to provide the hand-holding necessary for major reform processes to succeed.

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Evaluation of the Development Objectives and Design of the Operation

In the Policy Letter of 20 May 2002 the Government of Guatemala submitted to the Bank its
Financial Sector Reform Program, consisting of actions designed to optimize the banking sector,
strengthen banking regulation and supervision, and modernize the financial sector legal
framework.

Within this context, the general policy objective of the loan BIRF-7130-GU was defined as
"Support the financial sector reform program of the Guatemalan Government, oriented at
enabling a stronger banking sector, with better functioning, able to resist external and internal
shocks, and increase prudent lending to the private sector, opening access to groups and
enterprises excluded from bank financing (financing to the micro, rural and small and medium
enterprises)." The Bank loan would finance the needs of the government economic program
related to the strengthening of the financial sector.

In this sense, the Bank loan would support the elaboration and adoption of the norms and
regulations required to implement the new financial legislation and the implementation of the
mechanism for bank capitalization that supports the process of regularization and strengthening of
the banking system.

We consider that the objectives of the loan were adequately designed, since they focused on
supporting the execution of the financial sector adjustment program, therefore contributing to the
strengthening of the national financial sector. Also, we consider appropriate the establishment of
conditions prior to loan disbursements that involved actions concerning the elaboration and
adoption of the regulations required for the application of the new financial laws, as well as the
implementation of the bank capitalization mechanism to assist the process of regularization and
strengthening of the banking system. In this way, the entities involved were encouraged to
accelerate the regulation process to the extent allowed by their jurisdiction.

Evaluation of the results of the implemented actions

The results achieved with the measures established as disbursement conditions have had a
positive impact in the financial system, as commented below:

         Strengthening and modernization of banking regulation and supervision

         The Superintendency of Banks (SIB) elaborated 19 regulatory dispositions contemplated
         in the conditions prior to the second and third disbursements, which were applicable to
         the supervised entities and covered a variety of areas, among them: entry rules;
         dispositions for the verification of policies and risk committees, capital adequacy;
         management of credit risks; loan classification; constitutions of loan loss reserves;
         accounting norms, including consolidation rules; sanction norms; requirement for
         external audits; prevention of assets laundering; and other prudential rules; as well as
         mechanisms for restructuring and market exit.

         With the implementation of such dispositions, bank regulation and supervision has been
         strengthened and modernized, incorporating the focus of consolidated, risk-based


                                                 30

supervision contained in the new financial legislation and in the Basic Principles for an
Effective Banking Supervision, issued by the Basel Bank Supervision Committee.

Another aspect worth mentioning is the creation, functioning and regulation of the Credit
Information System (SIRC), managed by the SIB, which was contemplated among the
conditions prior to the loan's third disbursement.

In the application of consolidated supervision, and with the objective of verifying the
solvency of the entities that integrate a financial group, prior to the presentation to the
Monetary Board (MB) of a request for the authorization of the formation of such groups,
the SIB revised the administrative and financial areas of the entities that were not
previously supervised, such as credit card operators, and off-shore entities, obtaining--
when necessary--an increase in their capital. The MB authorized the formation of 15
financial groups, within which 11 off-shore entities were authorized. Also, the work plans
of the SIB are already being elaborated with an in-situ and extra-situ vision of financial
groups and contemplate an evaluation of all the participating entities, which includes the
consolidated financial statements and the calculation of the consolidated equity position.
The implemented measures that are mentioned in this paragraph met two of the
conditions for third disbursement.

It is important to mention that the in-situ supervision program contemplated in the
conditions prior to second tranche disbursement, was completed. As a result, in cases that
so required, entities took action to reduce their risks and/or strengthen their equity, and a
state owned bank was recapitalized, which allowed it to absorb two banks that presented
liquidity and solvency problems.

Coverage of the net deficiencies of Banco de Guatemala

According to the Organic Law of Banco de Guatemala, the net deficiencies of the Central
Bank must be covered by the State, for which they must be included by the Ministry of
Public Finance (MFP) in the General Incomes and Expenditures Budget. The mentioned
deficiencies must be covered with treasury bonds or other financial instruments at the
disposal of such ministry. In addition, the law contemplates that the State must absorb the
accumulated cost of the monetary, exchange and credit policy reflected in the balance of
the Central Bank at the close of the 2001 accounting exercise, which amounted to
Q16,834.2 million.

In the described context, the MFP issued treasury bonds in favor of the Banco de
Guatemala to cover the net deficiencies of the accounting exercises of 2003 and 2004,
respectively in August 29, 2005 for Q963.7 million and in August 28, 2006 for Q1,159.5
million.

With respect to the net deficiencies of the 2002 accounting exercise, it needs to be
mentioned that these have not been covered by the MFP because the Congress of the
Republic did not approve the Incomes and Expenditures Budget corresponding to the
2004 fiscal exercise, which contemplated the issuing of treasury bonds for Q905.3
million for that purpose.

With respect to the accumulated cost of the monetary, exchange and credit policy, it
remains pending the decision of Congress to issue the decree authorizing the issuing of
treasury bonds for Q16,834.2 million.

                                        31

Modernization of the Payments System of Guatemala

The Banco de Guatemala has advanced in the modernization of the national payments
system to make it into an integrated system with automated products and international
standards, which apply the Basic Principles for Payment Systems of Systemic Importance,
issued by the Bank for International Payments (BIS). The Central Bank has implemented
a Real Time Gross Settlement System (RGTS) with the purpose of settling high value
operations and minimizing risks inherent to the important payments systems in
Guatemala.

To that effect, the Central Bank acquired the RGTS, which initiated operations on
January 27, 2006. To this system were integrated internal systems (such as the Integrated
System for Securities, the Sistema de Cajas, and the Accounting and Financial
Information System), external systems (such as the Electronic Settlement System and the
Electronic System for Foreign Exchange Transactions--both owned by the Bolsa de
Valores Nacional S. A.), as well as the Electronic Banking Compensation Chamber and
the Electronic Mesa de Dinero Bancaria, both administered by the Bankers' Association
of Guatemala. These systems now settle their operations in gross terms and real time in
the system RGTS.

As part of the payments system modernization program, the MB approved the regulatory
dispositions for the administration and functioning of the RGTS system and the Banking
Compensation Chamber. On its part, the General Manager of the Central Bank issued the
corresponding instructions, norms, procedures, user manuals, and administrative
dispositions. It is expected that in the short term other entities of the public sector will
incorporate to the system, as well as the Automated Clearing House (ACH).

Constitution of the Bank Capitalization Fund (FCB)

The FCB was created by Congressional Decree No. 74-2002 (in effect since November
29, 2002), which established the creation of a trust (fideicomiso) in the Bank of
Guatemala for the administration of the resources of such fund. Such trust was formalized
on December 23, 2003. The regulatory dispositions of the FCB related to the Technical
Committee, the Eligibility of the Banks to be financed by the FCB, the Financial
Assistance to Banks in the System and the Sale of Assets of the FCB, as well as the
Investment Policies of the FCB Resources, were approve by the Ministry of Public
Finances by Ministerial Agreement No. 5102004 of September 24, 2004. The
Regulations related to Eligibility of the Banks and to the Financial Assistance to Banks in
the System were modified by Ministerial Agreement No. 48-2006 of December 28, 2006.

The objective of the FCB is to support financially the process of regulation and
strengthening of the national banking system, within the context of processes of bank
mergers, acquisition of assets, and processes of exclusion of assets and liabilities carried
out following the Law of Banks and Financial Groups. Also, when strictly necessary it
can support financially the FOPA.

Based on the described scheme, it is worth mentioning that the creation of the FCB
completed the national financial sector safety net with a mechanism that will contribute
to the regularization and strengthening of such system.

        Presentation to Congress of Complementary Bills of Law

        As part of the commitments made for third tranche disbursement, were presented to the
        Guatemalan Congress Bills of Law for the Insurance Activity (initiative No. 3500), and
        for Movable Guarantees (initiative No. 3588), both of which are in phase of discussion by
        the full chamber.

        When the mentioned laws are enacted, the legislation for the insurance activities will be
        modernized, and a mechanism will be provided to facilitate the use of movable
        guarantees in the financial operations of the system, which will allow access to credit to
        groups that do not have the goods that are traditionally required as guarantees, such as
        micro, small and medium enterprises.

        With respect to the Bill of Law for Non-bank Financial Intermediation, it must be
        indicates that inter-institutional commissions elaborated two bills that were sent for
        consideration of the corresponding instances, which, if they find it appropriate will send
        them to the Executive, which in turn will transfer them as initiatives to the Congress of
        the Republic.

Results of the Utilization of the Loan Resources

As indicated, the resources of the Loan Agreement were destined by the Government of
Guatemala, in their equivalent in Quetzals, for the strengthening of FOPA and the FCB, which
allowed them to carry out operations with positive results for the financial system in its entirety as
indicated below:


        Operations covered by FOPA

        According to the Banking and Financial Groups Law, the objective of FOPA is to
        guarantee to the depositors of the banking system the recuperation of their deposits up to
        an amount of Q20,000 or their equivalent in foreign exchange, per individual or judicial
        person.

        Within this context, in October 2006 and in January 2007, the MB in Resolutions JM-
        120-2006 and JM-13-2007, resolved to suspend the operations of Banco del Café S.A.
        (Bancafé) and Banco de Comercio S.A., and authorized Banco de Guatemala, in its role
        of administrator of the FOPA funds, and at the request of the Juntas de Exclusion de
        Activos y Pasivos (administrative councils for the exclusion of assets and liabilities of a
        failed bank) nominated to that purpose, to provide funds to the trusts constituted to
        exclude the assets of these banks, up to the amount of the deposits covered by FOPA's
        guarantee. Both Juntas de Exclusion requested from the Bank of Guatemala, as
        administrator of FOPA's resources the amount of Q1,960.0 million (Q1,600.0 million for
        the trust administering the excluded assets of Bancafé and Q360.0 million for the trust
        administering the excluded assets of Banco de Comercio).

        It is important to point that the resources provided by FOPA to the trusts, plus the total
        amount of the excluded assets of the suspended banks allowed for the 100 percent
        coverage of the deposits in both institutions; and that the amounts provided by FOPA
        corresponded to 23.6 percent and 37.8 percent of the total deposit obligation of the two
        banks. This mechanism allowed FOPA to utilize fewer resources (Q564.6 million less)

                                                33

         than it would have had to utilize to cover the guarantee of Q20.0 thousand per depositor,
         which favored its financial situation.

         The mentioned processes were carried out in a rapid and orderly way, in accordance with
         the legislation and the regulations issued by the monetary authorities, which contributed
         to preserve the stability of the system.

         Financial assistance provided by the Bank Capitalization Fund (FCB)

         In January 2007, the FCB provided financial assistance to FOPA for Q360.0 million. The
         three banks that participated in the process of exclusion of assets and liabilities of the
         bank suspended in October 2006 requested FCB financial assistance through
         subordinated debt, to cover the increase in their respective minimum capital requirement
         due to the acquisition of the business units that were incorporated in their balances. Those
         funding requests were answered according to the corresponding regulations and in
         February 2007 the FCB authorized two financial assistances for a total of Q104.4 million
         and in March 2007, authorized one for Q34/0 million. Up to May 2007, the FCB has
         provided Q138.4 million to banking institutions which has helped to regularize
         Guatemala's financial system.

         Similarly, it is important to mention that as of May 31, 2007, the FCB was processing
         two requests of financial assistance to cover the minimum capital requirement, one for
         the acquisition of a business unit that was incorporated in the balance sheet, and the other
         for a merger with another bank.

Performance of the Bank

During preparation and execution of the project, several Bank missions were received, to follow
up on the compliance with the conditions for loan approval and for disbursement. In that respect,
it is important to mention that the Task Manager and the functionaries that participated in the
missions always provided advice and collaboration and the necessary information for the good
performance of the executing institutions.

In addition, the Bank participated, together with the executing institutions, in events organized for
the divulgation of the mechanism of exclusion of assets and liabilities, as well as the operations of
FOPA contemplated in the new legislation and the corresponding regulations. Also, the Bank
missions provided advice and orientation to overcome obstacles related to the compliance with
some of the disbursement conditions.

For all the above, we consider that the Bank performance was satisfactory for the achievement of
the loan's objectives.

Performance of the executing entity

The executing entity was constituted by the MFP, the Banco de Guatemala and the SIB. During
preparation and execution of the loan, the three institutions carried out, in a coordinated way, the
activities required from each of them for the approval of the loan and the compliance with
disbursement conditions, for which joint meetings were carried out.

In addition, the necessary budgetary spaces for the registration of the three disbursements were
timely assigned by the MFP, and when the disbursements were made, they were duly handled in

                                                 34

the Integrated Accounting System ­SICON. That ministry instructed the transfer of the loan
resources to FOPA and the FCB according to what was stipulated in the Loan Agreement.

The institutions that comprised the executing entity, in a coordinated way, collaborated with the
Bank missions, providing the necessary logistic support, which included the organization of the
activities for the working meetings with government and banking sector functionaries. Also, the
missions were provided of the documents needed as evidence of compliance with disbursement
conditions, and their recommendations were attended with diligence.

Lessons learned

Taking into account that the objective of the program financed with the resources of the
mentioned loan were, succinctly, to strengthen and modernize the Guatemalan financial system,
the executing entity considers that the actions taken accomplished their objective. There has been
significant advances, among others, in aspects such as the application of the risk based,
consolidated supervision approach, in the strengthening of FOPA and the FCB, as part of the
financial system safety net, and in the process of implementation of the new financial legislation.

Similarly, the effective confluence of all the factors that supported the process of regularization
and strengthening of the banking system, established a very positive precedent with respect to the
strength of the monetary authority to achieve the orderly exit of the institutions that participate in
the financial system.

In general, of the process of preparation and disbursement of the loan resources, the experience
left is of the importance, on one side of having a clear vision and specific objectives at the time of
preparing a loan, because they allow the definition of specific actions aimed at meeting the
objectives; and on the other side, of maintaining close communication and coordination among
the institutions that conform the executing entity and the Bank, which permits the
accomplishment of the established goals.

Borrower's Comments to the Draft ICR

We consider that the macroeconomic conditions and the situation of the financial sector, as well
as the description of the deficiencies of the legal framework prior to the loan approval, are
described in the ICR in accordance to the situation at the time.

With respect to the different processes that had to be carried out by the World Bank, and the
Government of Guatemala, as well as the executing agencies (BANGUAT, SIB, MFP), we
consider that they have been adequately described; as well as the improvement in the financial
indicators as a result of the measures adopted to implement the new financial norms.



                                                35

It is evident that in the report the World Bank recognizes the strong commitment that the
Government of Guatemala maintained with respect to the financial sector reform program during
the course of two administrations (Portillo and Berger), supported by the Congress of the
Republic, the MFP, BANGUAT, and the SIB. These institutions implemented the actions
required from each of them at the loan preparation phase, as well as during the phase of
compliance with the established disbursement conditions, permitting with this a satisfactory
degree of compliance with the objectives.

In the same way, we confirm what the ICR reports with respect to the appropriate design of the
operation for the policy actions that it supported and for using the loan resources to capitalize the
FFCB and FOPA. Also, the design of the loan was appropriate in utilizing three tranche
disbursements, with conditions that supported the elaboration, approval and implementation of a
new financial sector legal and regulatory framework.

We consider opportune to mention that we share the opinion that among the relevant short term
objectives to strengthen Guatemala's financial sector are to move towards a risk based
supervision approach, the full adoption of international accounting norms, improvement in access
to credit through new legislation to strengthen creditor's rights, and transparency in the financial
information, as well as the establishment of the institutional framework for capital markets and
financial cooperatives.

In the same way, we share the report's opinion that although the implementation of the FSAL and
FTAL contributed to a satisfactory progress in the strengthening of the legal and regulatory
framework and the supervision of the financial sector, there is more to be done to consolidate
these achievements.

On the other hand, with respect to the implementation delays that required three extensions of the
loan closing date, we share the Bank's opinion that in future operations, it should be taken into
account that the transition of a supervision approach based on compliance to a consolidated
supervision approach based on risks can take more time than envisaged, because this is a complex
process which, according to international experience, can take many years.

Finally, we consider opportune to express that both the Banco de Guatemala and the
Superintendency of Banks, ratify what was expressed in the evaluation report from the point of
view of the Borrower, that the FSAL and the FTAL have had a significant impact in
strengthening their institutional capacity.

Annex 7. Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Achievement of the Program's Broader Development Objective

Bringing about a stronger and better banking sector, able to withstand external shocks and
to increase prudent lending to the private sector: Satisfactory Performance

A clear evidence of the increased strength of Guatemala's financial system is that it has been able
to withstand the failure of two banks (in October 2006 and January 2007) with minimum risk of
contagion to other banks in the system. Official figures indicate that after the exit from the market
of these two banks, all the banks in the system present risk weighted capital adequacy ratios
(CAR) over the statutory minimum of 10 percent, with an average CAR for all the system of 13.6
percent as of May 31, 2007. Although this level of capitalization may be overstated due to
remaining under-provisioning, the capitalization of the banks has substantially improvement
compared to mid-2001, during FSAL preparation. The quality of the banks' lending portfolios has
improved with NPLs as a percentage of total loans dropping from a system's average of 7.9
percent at end 2002 to 5.22 percent in March 2007. Bank profitability has also improved with an
increase in the system's ROA from 0.7 percent at end-2001 to 2.1 percent in March 2007, and of
the ROE from 7.8 percent to 24.7 percent during the same period. A strengthened banking sector
has also been able to increase lending to the private sector. The portfolio of bank credit to the
private sector increased by nearly 33 percent in dollar terms between March 2006 and March
2007 (from US$5.23 billion to US$6.96 billion); although, as typical in a banking system that has
experienced a period of crisis, much of the credit increase has been in consumer loans.

Achievement of the Program's Sub Objectives

Reform of the monetary policy legal framework for the conduct of monetary and financial
policy including the capitalization of the Central Bank: Satisfactory Performance.

This outcome was achieved through the enactment of new Monetary and Central Bank Laws, the
capitalization of the Central Bank (partly achieved), and the strengthening of the payments
system, which was a major source of vulnerability for the Central Bank, as described below.

Enactment of new Monetary and Central Bank Laws and their regulations. The legal
framework for the conduct of monetary and financial policy in Guatemala was significantly
strengthened with the enactment of a new Monetary Law and a new Central Bank Law. The
Monetary Law modernized the legislation in the area of exchange rate policy and guarantees the
free convertibility of the currency, and the free movement of capital. The new Central Bank Law
incorporates basic principles of modern central banking legislation following the FSAP
recommendations. The basic principles of the new Central Bank Law and the regulations issued
before second tranche of the FSAL are described in Annex 8.

Capitalization of the Central Bank. This outcome was partially achieved. The new Central Bank
Law establishes a mechanism to compensate BANGUAT for policy related losses to ensure the
maintenance of its capital. As a first step, the equity of BANGUAT was to be restored through
the issuing of a 100 year zero-coupon bond to settle the fiscal losses it suffered due to the cost of
implementing the Government's monetary policies up to end 2001, which was estimated to
amount to Qs16,873 million. The MFP requested Congressional authority to issue the bond, but
Congress refused to approve it even if it did not involve any real financial cost to the Government,


                                                39

because of the political implications of recognizing such a large debt. Capitalization of
BANGUAT through the issuing of a bond to settle past fiscal losses was a condition for second
tranche release of the FSAL. The Bank considered this condition as partially met, and requested a
waiver to its Board on the basis that the expected effect of the recognition by the MFP of the old
debt to BANGUAT had already taken place, since the accounts of BANGUAT had ceased to
show the "old debt" as accumulated losses showing instead a (differed) long-term asset (debt to
be paid by the MFP).

More important than settling the old debt was that BANGUAT's losses incurred after 2002 be
compensated with performing bonds, which was a condition for third tranche disbursement.
Treasury Bonds were issued to compensate BANGUAT's losses in the 2005 and 2006 budgets,
which demonstrates that a precedent has been established for the use of this budgetary mechanism
to maintain the Central Bank equity from eroding. Since the enactment of the new Central Bank
Law, there has no support to the banks from BANGUAT in its role of LOLR.

Strengthening of the Payments System. The shortcomings in the payments system identified at
appraisal have been largely addressed. In August 2002, BANGUAT created the Payments System
Committee to coordinate the implementation of the project for the Modernization of the National
Payments System which included: (i) strengthening the payments system regulatory framework;
(ii) implementation of a modern payments system including an electronic clearing system for
banks (Bank Compensation Chamber) and a Real Time Gross Settlement System (RGTS). The
regulatory framework for the payments system has been substantially strengthened with the
approval by the MB of the regulations for the Bank Compensation Chamber (April 2003) and the
regulations for the RGTS (November 2005); and additional regulations issued by BANGUAT
concerning the functioning of both systems. In August 2005, BANGUAT transferred the Bank
Compensation Chamber to the Bankers' Association, which in turn contracted with a private
company to operate the electronic compensation of bank transactions. BANGUAT has been
operating the RGTS since January 2006 for the electronic settlement of operations in both local
and foreign currency. Since November 2006, all the banks in the system, and since December
2006 the stock exchange, have been operating under the RTGS for clearance and settlement of
money, and foreign exchange transactions. The strengthening of the payments system has been
made mostly with BANGUAT's own funds, but was also supported by the Bank's parallel FTAL
which provided resources for: (i) strategic assistance in legal and technical area of the payments
system modernization plan; (ii) the elaboration of information material on the payment system;
and (iii) the acquisition of hardware and software for the operation of the RGTS. BANGUAT is
in the process of establishing with FTAL assistance an Automated Clearing House, an electronic
network for financial transactions that should be operational by late 2007, as well as an auction
system for a primary market of certificates of deposit issued by the central bank and a book-entry
system for secondary market transactions.

Reform of the financial sector legal framework aimed at strengthening the regulation of
financial groups, create an orderly market exit mechanism, enhance credit risk
management and increase access to finance: Satisfactory Performance.

This outcome was achieved through the enactment of the Banking and Financial Groups Law and
its regulations; strengthening the capabilities of BANGUAT and SIB to implement the new
legislation through FTAL technical assistance; and presentation to Congress for approval of
second generation financial bills of law to broaden access to credit, as explained below.

Enactment of a new Banking and Financial Groups Law and its regulation. This law addresses
most of the shortcomings of the previous legislation. Particularly important features of this law

                                                40

are the establishment of norms for the consolidated supervision and regulation of financial groups
and the equal treatment of off-shore banks, with the requirement that off-shore banks that form
part of a financial group obtain authorization to operate within six months of the law's
effectiveness. The new law strengthens prudential rules, including the establishment of a
minimum capitalization ratio (CAR) of 10 percent and the adoption of regularization plans in
cases of capital deficiencies. The law establishes the creation of a limited deposit insurance
scheme (FOPA) and the adoption of an efficient bank resolution mechanism to allow for an
orderly market exit of insolvent institutions through liquidation or P&A operations. The basic
principles of the law and the regulations issued prior to the FSAL second tranche release are
described in Annex 8. Progress in implementing the basic regulations of the Banking Law and the
new regulations being developed are explained below the section concerning the SIB Plans of
Action to implement the new regulatory and supervisory framework.

Legal and institutional reforms to broaden access to credit. Several bills of law to broaden
access to credit have been presented or are expected to be presented to Congress for approval.
The draft Insurance Law was presented to Congress for approval in July 2006. It was approved in
two reading and a third reading is pending to complete its approval. The draft Secured
Transactions Law (now denominated the Movable Guarantees Law) was presented to Congress in
December 2006. The draft Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries Law (now called Microfinance
Law) is being reviewed by the SIB based on MB's comments to an earlier draft. The laws already
sent to Congress represent major legal reforms that are expected to improve access to financial
services in Guatemala.

Reform of the banking supervision legal framework aimed at strengthening the autonomy
of the SIB and its legal and institutional capacity to supervise financial groups and rise
banking sector regulation towards international standards: Satisfactory Performance

This outcome was achieved through the enactment of a new Banking Supervision Law ant its
regulations, and the progress being made by the SIB in meeting the benchmarks of its Plans of
Action to implement the new regulatory and supervisory framework, including advances in
moving towards risk-based consolidation supervision approach.

Enactment of a new Bank Supervision Law and its regulations. This law enhances the
supervisory and sanctioning powers of the SIB, provides the SIB with greater autonomy by
establishing that the President of the Republic nominates the Superintendent for a four year term,
according to eligibility requirements, and provides legal protection of SIB staff, by establishing a
mechanism to finance the legal expenses for the defense of its officials in case of legal actions
against them derived from the exercise of their functions, and provides personal immunity to the
Superintendent of Banks and authorities of the institution. The main features of this law and the
regulations issued prior to second tranche disbursement of the FSAL are described in Annex 8.

SIB has met most of the benchmarks of its Action Plans for the implementation of the new
regulatory and supervisory framework. Evidence of the strengthening of baking supervision in
the context of the FSAL is that the SIB has been able to meet most of the benchmarks of its Plans
of Action to implement the new regulatory and supervisory framework. Out of ten benchmarks,
the SIB met eight, partially met one and failed to meet another one. Meeting the plans
benchmarks were conditions of FSAL tranche release. The FTAL provided support to the SIB in
meeting some of the benchmarks. However, the failure of two banks (in October 2006 and
January 2007) showed that there are still important vulnerabilities in the sector, and that there is a
need to accelerated reforms towards risk-based consolidated supervision of financial
conglomerates. The authorities are responding to this challenge with new regulations, the

                                               41

organizational restructuring of the SIB to enhance implementation of risk-based supervision, and
the SIB Strategic Plan for 2007-2011 aimed at strengthening its supervisory tools and authority.
SIB compliance with the agreed benchmarks is summarized below and described in more detail in
Annex 9.

SIB Compliance with risk-management benchmarks. The SIB met all the eight risk management
benchmarks. All the banks have established risk-management committees and adopted risk
management manuals (benchmarks i and ii). However, the performance of the committees varies
among banks, and there is a need to homologize procedures in the banks' risk management
manuals. The SIB reports that all the banks in the system present CAR of over ten percent as
required under the applicable regulation (benchmark iii) with an average capitalization ratio for
all the system of 13.6 percent. Although this CAR could be overstated due to remaining under-
provisioning, it is clear that the banks have substantially improved their capitalization. All the
banks have been supervised (on and off-site) in accordance with the provisions of the new
financial legal framework and sanctions are being applied to banks which do not comply with
these provisions (benchmarks iv and v).

SIB compliance with consolidated supervision benchmarks. The SIB has authorized the formation
of fifteen financial groups, more than the seven required by benchmark vi and has rated and
authorized the operations of eleven off-shore banks, more than the seven required by benchmark
vii. As part of the process of authorization of each financial group, the SIB carried out a review of
the administrative and financial areas of the entities in each group, including off-shore entities. In
some cases, entities were required to increase their capital in order to be authorized. However,
this benchmark is considered partially met because the SIB is still in the process of being able to
supervise financial conglomerated applying consolidated supervision principles.

SIB compliance with accounting and auditing benchmarks. An Accounting Manual for
Bank Operations adopting international accounting norms (NICs) was approved by the MB in
December 2006 (benchmark viii). This manual represents a significant advance towards
incorporating NICs, but contain several differences which according to the SIB reflect a more
conservative approach appropriate to the Guatemalan circumstances, as explained in Annex 9.
Despite the differences between the Accounting Manual and the NICs, the Bank considered this
condition as substantially met given the significant improvements in converging towards NICs
conventions, and that these differences are not material. Since the banks will need a reasonable
period in which to implement the new rules and adapt their accounting systems, the new
Accounting Manual will be of obligatory application as of January 1, 2008. This means that the
SIB could not meet benchmark ix which required that all the banks and finance companies are
utilizing the new accounting norms. It can be argued that the delay in meeting this benchmark is
reasonable, and the clear timetable for the Manual's implementation will ensure that the
underlying objective of the benchmark will be achieved within an acceptable period of time. A
registrar for external auditors is operating within the SIB (benchmark x) and as of November
2006, 36 enterprises and professionals had been registered. A new regulation for external auditors
is under preparation and the MB is contemplating strengthening the capacity of the SIB to review
working documents of external auditors to verify reports and deter fraud.

SIB has made progress in carrying out a comprehensive examination of the banking sector on
a consolidated basis, including off-shore entities. The first steps in moving towards consolidated
supervision were the rating and authorization of 15 financial groups and 11 off-shore banks by
the SIB. Further progress in this area has been the mapping of the interrelationships between
financial groups and subsidiaries and related parties, including presumed related parties,
implementing recommendations of the FSAP Update 2005/06. Based on this mapping, analysis is

                                                 42

being conducted on the risk of capital becoming ineffective due to concentrated lending above
regulatory limits and on the effects on the solvency of the financial groups of the incorporation or
withdrawal of related entities. The SIB is starting to design specialized supervisory tools to model
the effects of these risks on regulatory capital, is undergoing an organizational restructuring to
enhance implementation of risk-based supervision, and is elaborating a Risk Based Supervision
Manual for banks and off-shore entities, and a Chapter on Consolidated Supervision. The new
Manual will be implemented in 2008, but some procedures of its credit risk module are being
applied on a pilot basis to selected financial institutions.

Establishment of the Credit Information System (CIS). In April 2004, the SIB issued norms to
guide the CIS operations, and the CIS has been open for consultation by the banks in the system
since May 2004. As of early 2007 over 2.3 million consultations had been made. The FTAL
funded the acquisition of software for the CIS and training visits of CIS staff to credit information
systems in other countries. Credit registry data has contributed to enhance credit concentration
and risk assessment. The data in the CIS data base has improved quantitatively and qualitatively
with the newly required reporting by the banks of their evaluation of their corporate portfolios of
large debtors based on capacity to pay. This improved information is being used by the SIB to
strengthen its supervisory function.

Enactment of legislation to prevent money laundering to reduce illegal activities and comply
with international norms: Satisfactory Performance

This outcome has been achieved through the enactment of a new AML/CTF Law and the
strengthening of the SIB capability to implement the new law. The law established the creation of
a Specific Unit Against Money Laundering Intendencia de Verificación Especial (IVE), within
the SIB. By end-2002, the IVE was fully operational, and the GAFI Financial Action Task Force
(Review Group for the Americas) indicated that Guatemala met all 25 qualification criteria. In
July 2004 Guatemala was taken off the list of GAFI's non-cooperative countries. The FTAL has
provided assistance to the IVE in consulting work to develop analysis methodologies, acquisition
of hardware and software; and staff training.

Consolidation of the banking system through the restructuring or closure of insolvent banks
and through mergers and acquisitions: Satisfactory Performance

This outcome was achieved through the implementation by BANGUAT and the SIB of the bank
resolution mechanism contemplated in the Banking Law, which involved making operational and
providing funding for FOPA and the FFCB, and by the authorities' resolute actions to intervene
and resolve failed banks, as explained below. The FTAL provided technical assistance to
BANGUAT and the SIB for the establishment of both funds, as well as advisory services to carry
out the first bank resolutions. The banking system is in a process of consolidation that has
reduced the number of banks from 31 in 2002 to 24 in early 2007.

Establishment of a new bank regularization/resolution mechanism. Under the new legislation
the procedure to deal with problem banks is the following: First the banks have to reach an
agreement with the SIB on a regularization plan. If the bank fails to gain viability under the
regularization plan, the MB orders the suspension of the bank's operations and the establishment
of a committee to oversee the exclusion of assets and liabilities of the insolvent bank (i.e. the
separation of the good bank from the bad bank). The good assets with their compensating
liabilities (a business unit) are transferred to a good bank for their management; the residual
assets and liabilities are transferred to a trust fund for their liquidation. The FTAL provided
technical assistance for the implementation of this process, funding international consultants to

                                                 43

elaborate manuals for the evaluation of the banks' regularization plans and for the process of
exclusion of assets and liabilities, elaboration of standard contracts, and training of BANGUAT
and SIB staff on these procedures.

Establishment of the Bank Capitalization Fund (FFCB). The FFCB (renamed FCB) was
created by Congressional Decree together with the approval of the FSAL. The FTAL financed
international consultants to prepare the Operating Principles and Procedures Manuals and train
BANGUAT and SIB staff involved in the operation of the FFCB. The manuals were reviewed by
the Bank and approved by the FFCB Technical Committee and by the MFP through a ministerial
agreement in October 2004. The Bank later approved some modifications to the manuals to make
them more useful for the bank resolution transactions that are likely to take place in Guatemala in
the near future. The FFCB has been audited by external auditors, who confirmed that it continued
to operate in accordance with its operating principles and procedures.

Strengthening the Deposit Insurance Fund (FOPA). FOPA insures deposits for up to Qs20,000
(US$2,600) per individual or entity in a local bank or subsidiary of a foreign bank. It is a fund
administered by BANGUAT constituted by quotas paid by participating banks, returns on
investments of the fund, proceeds from liquidation of banks and Government contributions.
FOPA received the equivalent in Quetzals of US$73.5 million from the proceeds of the first and
second tranches of the FSAL, which allowed it to participate with Qs1,600 million in the
resolution of a failed bank in October 2006. FOPA also participated in the resolution of a failed
bank in January 2007, with Qs360 million provided by the FFCB. FOPA was subsequently
recapitalized through additional fiscal funds, an increase in premiums charged to banks, and
additional secured funding form banks in the system.

Resolution of insolvent banks. As indicated before, by Appraisal there were three small failed
banks that had been intervened by the Government in 2001 and six banks (including CHN), that
were suffering from liquidity and solvency problems. Several of these banks were resolved by the
authorities during loan implementation. The administrative intervention of the three failed banks
initiated in 2001 under the old banking law, ended in February 2005. At that point, the MB, at the
request of the SIB, suspended the activities of these banks and proceeded to revoke their banking
license under the bank resolution mechanisms of the new Banking Law.

Two weak banks-Banejer and Banoro-were resolved prior to second tranche disbursement of the
FSAL. The Government capitalized CHN in 2002 with Q100 million to allow it to absorb
Banejer; and with Q193.9 million in 2003, to allow it to merge with Banoro. These resolutions
were made using the old system of Government capitalization, instead of the bank resolution
mechanism of the new Banking Law, partly due to lack of experience of the authorities with the
new resolution procedures. The Government agreed with the Bank and the IMF not to follow this
capitalization procedure in the future and to conduct a strategic diagnostic of CHN. A decision
later taken by the Government to close CHN did not get Congressional support. However, the
risks posed by CHN have been lowered through actions to constrain new lending and reduce non-
performing portfolio from 75 percent to 35 percent

In October 2006, the MB suspended Bancafé, the fourth largest bank due to non-compliance with
legally established prudential norms linked to difficulties of its off-shore bank. The irrevocable
resolution of Bancafé was successfully initiated with the transfer of all deposits and an equivalent
amount of assets to three other banks, preserving the majority of the banking jobs. In January
2007, the MB suspended Banco de Comercio due to problems with its previously undisclosed off-
shore affiliate. The irrevocable resolution of that bank was also initiated with the transfer of all
deposits and an equivalent amount of assets to Banco Industrial, the country's largest bank.

                                                44

These two bank resolutions are very significant. They are the first rapid resolution cases ever
implemented with the new framework without going through liquidation. They put into practice
the resolution mechanism in the 2002 Banking Law, and verified the resilience of the bank
resolution framework supported by the FSAL and the FTAL. The failure of these banks
highlighted some important vulnerabilities in the sector, especially the existence of unsupervised
intermediation. These bank failures convinced the authorities of the need to further strengthen
risk-based, consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates, and to create a financial crimes
investigation unit to assist in the investigation of illegal financial sector activities such as
fraudulent banking practices, misrepresentation and theft, of the sort that led to these banks
failures. Also, this experience has highlighted the need to enhance the effectiveness and funding
of both FOPA and the FFCB. Although both trusts have received some additional funds from the
Government and the baking sector, there is a need to secure additional funding sources to support
possible future bank resolutions. Since the failure of these two banks, domestic financial markets
have remained stable with no systemic runs.

Utilization of the FFCB to support bank resolution transactions. A condition for third tranche
disbursement of the FSAL was that the FFCB had supported bank resolution transactions
requiring additional capital in an amount of at least US$25.0 million, including stakeholders'
contributions. This condition had not been met in late 2006, when the Government requested
disbursement of the third tranche, and Bank staff requested a waiver based on the consideration
that an amount equivalent to the third tranche would be used to increase funding of the FFCB,
and timely availability of these funds would be an important signal that would help strengthen
confidence in the system and prevent a possible contagion to other banks. Also, one of the banks
that had participated in the resolution of Bancafé in October 2006 had already applied for FFCB
funds and the other two were also expected to apply. In fact, by Closing Date in March 31, 2007,
the FFCB Technical Committee had already approved subordinated debt support to all three
banks that had taken part in the resolution of Bancafé. In addition, there was at least one more
request for subordinated debt financing to support an ongoing bank merger. In line with its
objectives, FFCB funds were on-lent to FOPA to help with the resolution of Banco de Comercio
in January 2007.

Annex 8. Reform of Guatemala's Banking Legislation under the FSAL

Between October 2001 and April 2002, prior to Board approval of the FSAL, the Guatemalan
Congress approved a package of five fundamental financial sector laws. These laws, prepared
with technical advice from the Bank, the IADB and IMF, addressed the shortcoming of the
financial sector legal and regulatory framework identified by the FSAP.

· Anti Money Laundering Law. (Ley Contra el Lavado de Dinero y Otros Activos) approved on
    November 28, 2001, and enacted on December 17, 2001.
· Central Bank Law (Ley Orgánica del Banco de Guatemala),
· Monetary Law (Ley Monetaria).
· Banking and Financial Groups Law (Ley de Bancos y Grupos Financieros).
· Banking Supervision Law (Ley de Supervisión Bancaria).

Basic principles of the new Central Bank Law

    · Clear statement of objectives: establishing that the fundamental objective of BANGUAT
        is to achieve and maintain price stability and redefines the instruments of monetary
        policy as a function of this objective;
    · Greater autonomy: establishing that while the MB maintains its role in determining the
        monetary, credit and exchange rate policies, their implementation is relegated to
        BANGUAT, the President and Vice-president of BANGUAT are nominated by the
        President of the Republic for a period of four years, they have to meet specific
        qualifications, and can be removed for specific causes;
    · Greater financial autonomy: mandating the State to guarantee the maintenance of
        BANGUAT's capital through the compensation of losses suffered by BANGUAT as a
        result of implementing Government policies;
    · Greater transparency and accountability: requiring that BANGUAT's financial
        statements comply with internationally accepted norms and principles, be audited by
        external auditors and made public, its president has to appear before Congress twice a
        year to give account of the results of the monetary, exchange rate, and credit policies; and
    · Limited Lender of Last Resort (LOLR) assistance: limiting BANGUAT's assistance to
        providing short term credit to banks solely to cover temporary liquidity deficiencies and
        precludes other lending activities including lending or providing guarantees to the State.

Regulations of the Central Bank Law issued prior to FSAL Second Tranche

    · Regulations concerning the governance of BANGUAT, including on the designation of
         BANGUAT's authorities, the Execution Committee, and the technical advisors, and on
         BANGUAT's administrative structure, and
    · Regulations concerning reserve requirement rules.

Basic principles of the new Banking and Financial Groups Law

    · Improved bank licensing provisions, with minimum entry requirements for new banks
        and enhanced authority for the SIB to deny the participation of promoters, shareholders
        or administrators who have any impediment under the law;



                                                46

   · Consolidated supervision and regulation of financial groups, establishing norms for the
       constitution, organization and functioning of financial groups, the elaboration and
       presentation of consolidated financial statements by the financial groups, and lending
       limits to related parties;
   · Equal treatment of off-shore banks, with the requirement that off-shore banks that form
       part of a financial group obtain authorization to operate within six months of the law's
       effectiveness;
   · Improved bank regulatory framework and prudential rules, including the establishment
       of a minimum CAR of 10 percent, adoption of regularization plans in cases of capital
       deficiencies; and application of accounting norms based on generally accepted
       accounting principles and international accounting norms;
   · Improved governance and transparency of banks, including the establishment of the
       rights and duties of banks' management councils and the maintenance of internal control
       systems, and empowering the SIB to determine minimum requirements and scope of the
       external audit and disclosure of information guidelines;
   · Creation of a limited deposit insurance scheme (FOPA), administered by BANGUAT
       insuring up to Qs20,000 (US$2,600) per individual or entity in a local bank or subsidiary
       of a foreign bank, and constituted by quotas paid by participating banks, returns on
       investments of the fund, proceeds from liquidation of banks and Government
       contributions; and
   · Adoption of an efficient bank resolution mechanism, to allow for an orderly market exit
       of insolvent institutions through liquidation or P&A operations.

Regulations for the new Banking Law were issued prior to the FSAL second tranche

   · Entry rules in the banking system;
   · Minimum risk management arrangements and governance principles to be adopted by
       banks;
   · Capital adequacy, loan classification and provisioning, including regulation of financial
       operations with related persons or persons that are part of a risk unit, valuation of credit
       assets and norms to determine and classify those of doubtful recovery, administration of
       credit risk, capital adequacy for off-shore entities, stock exchanges, enterprises
       specialized in financial services, warehouses, and foreign exchange offices, which are
       part of a financial group;
   · Accounting norms, including consolidation rules following international standard; (v)
       regulations related to FOPA;
   · Sanctions norms, including sanctions contemplated in the Banking Law and for obliged
       persons defined in the AML/CFT Law. The authorities are in the process of strengthening
       some of these regulations, including the recently adopted requirement that banks provide
       financial information on large debtors to the SIB and carry out analysis based on these
       debtors capacity to pay. The authorities are drafting new regulations to provision
       category A loans.

Basic principles of the new Banking Supervision Law

   · Enhanced supervisory and sanctioning powers for the SIB, including to enforce the laws
       and regulations; supervise the financial entities to ensure that they maintain adequate
       liquidity and solvency; provide instructions to overcome deficiencies; impose sanctions;
       have access to all relevant information; carry out its supervision and inspection on a

Annex 9. Compliance of the Superintendency of Banks with the Benchmarks of
its Action Plans under the FSAL

At the time of FSAL preparation, the MB's Board approved three action plans that would guide
the SIB in the application of the new legal and regulatory framework, namely: (i) transitioning to
the new system of risk management; (ii) transitioning to a new system of consolidated
supervision; and (iii) establishment of new accounting and auditing norms. The benchmarks were
used to monitor progress in the execution of the action plans. Disbursement of the FSAL second
and third tranches were conditioned to meeting these benchmarks. The degree of SIB compliance
with the agreed benchmarks under the FSAL is described below:

        Risk management benchmarks

        (i) Risk management committees in place for all of the banks of the system. Since 2003 all
        banks are required to establish risk management committees. Compliance of all the banks
        with this requirement has been verified by the SIB in reports issued annually since 2003.
        However, the performance of the risk management committees varies among banks, and
        there is a need to strengthen the performance of some of them through workshops and
        seminars.

        (ii) Risk management manuals adopted by all the banks in the system. Since 2003, the
        SIB verifies that policies and procedures for risk management are part of the banks' risk
        manuals. Banks were given up to June 15, 2004 to present their risk manuals to the SIB.
        Compliance of all banks with this requirement was certified by the SIB prior to second
        tranche release. Although banks now have risk-management manuals, more has to be
        done to homologize procedures and banks are still in the process of strengthening their
        risk management practices.

        (iii) All banks are complying with the risk-based capital requirement. As of May 2007,
        SIB reports that all the banks in the system present a CAR of over ten percent as required
        under the applicable regulation, with an average capitalization ratio for all the system of
        13.6 percent. However, as mentioned earlier, this capitalization may be overstated due to
        remaining under-provisioning.

        (iv) All banks have been supervised (on and off-site) in accordance with the provisions of
        the new financial legal framework. The SIB carries out in-situ and extra-situ supervision
        of all the banks in the system since June 2002. The scope and periodicity of the in-situ
        inspections depend on the risk profile of the entities and, in general, there is one in-situ
        inspection per year of different aspects of the banks' operations. Extra-situ inspections
        are carried out daily, weekly or monthly through the analysis of the data provided by the
        banks. The FTAL has assisted the SIB in strengthening its consolidated extra-situ and in-
        situ supervision through the acquisition of software and training of staff. The SIB has
        also received technical assistance financed by an IADB-FOMIN.

        (v) Sanctions are being applied to banks which are not complying with the provisions of
        the new financial legal framework. A report on sanctions applied to financial sector
        entities" by the SIB for the period June 2002 to November 2006 was presented to the
        Bank prior to third tranche release.



                                                49

Consolidated supervision benchmarks

(vi) At least seven financial groups have been rated by SIB and have had at least one
complete inspection applying consolidated supervision principles. The MB has
authorized the formation of 15 financial groups (since then the authorization of one of
these groups has been revoked) and the organizational structure of each of these groups.
As part of the process of authorization of each financial group, the SIB carried out a
review of the administrative and financial areas of the entities in each group, including
off-shore entities. In some cases, entities were required to increase their capital in order to
be authorized. However, the SIB is still in the process of being able to supervise financial
conglomerated applying consolidated supervision principles, as explained below.

(vii) At least seven off-shore banks have been rated by SIB or have stopped operating, or
have been summoned for illegal operations. Eleven off-shore banks have been authorized
to operate in Guatemala. One of the off-shore banks has ceased to operate.

Accounting and auditing benchmarks

(viii) An Accounting Manual for Bank Operations adopting international accounting
norms (NICs) has been approved by the MB. In December 2006, the MB approved a New
Accounting Manual for banking operations with significant advances towards
incorporating NICs, including allowing the SIB to move towards implementing
consolidated supervision. There are three remaining areas of difference with respect to
the NICs, which according to the SIB reflect a more conservative approach appropriate to
the Guatemalan circumstances, namely: (i) financial institutions will use accrual
accounting (NICs) in all their accounts except for lending operations which will be
recorded on a cash basis; (ii) some investments are registered at Cost Method vs.
Participation Method of NICs that would adjust by retained income; and (iii) potential
liability for terminating employments will be provisioned for as opposed to being kept
implicit as per NICs. Despite these differences between the Accounting Manual and the
NICs, the Bank considered this condition as substantially met given the significant
improvements in converging towards NICs conventions, and that these differences are
not material.

(ix) All banks and finance companies in the system have adopted and are utilizing the
new accounting norms. The new Accounting Manual approved in early December 2006
will be of obligatory application by banks as of January 1, 2008. The banks will need a
reasonable period in which to implement the new rules and adapt their accounting
systems. All banks are currently applying the accounting norms in the current Accounting
Manual which was modified in 2002 to reflect a number of international accounting
norms that were absent in the old manual. The delay in meeting this benchmark is
reasonable, and the clear timetable for the Manual's implementation will ensure that the
underlying objective of the benchmark will be achieved within an acceptable period of
time.

(x) A registrar for external auditors is operating within the SIB. As of November
2006, 36 enterprises and professionals had been registered in the Registrar of
External Auditors. A new regulation for external auditors is under preparation and
the MB is contemplating strengthening the capacity of the SIB to review working
documents of external auditors, a way of verifying reports and deter fraud.
