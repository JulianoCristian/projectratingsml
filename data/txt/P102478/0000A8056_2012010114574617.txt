                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project progress towards achieving its development objective is positive. As of December 16, 2011, 100,485 people, representing 92.3 percent of the end-of-project target, have
                         gained access to improved sanitation services, compared with 51.6 percent in May 2011.

                         1- ONAS continues to provide financial support to project beneficiaries to reduce the level of their contribution with additional support in CY2011. This support, in addition with a new
                         communication campaign (TV spots and radio) launched by AGETIP, has enabled to promote project activities and generate additional demand and as of October 21, 2011, the level
                         of up-front contribution paid by beneficiaries is 100%.

                         2- The project continues to be extended in additional new areas of potential demand around the region of Dakar (Kayar, Djander, Keur Mousse in addition to previous new areas like
                         Pout and Ndiass). Six new contractors have been recruited by AGETIP and are now deployed in these new areas; they have also been sub-contracted to increase the level of
                         implementation.
