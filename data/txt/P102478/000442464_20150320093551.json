"Ratings for the Supporting Access to\n            On-site Sanitation Services through Output-Based Aid Scheme\n            Project for Senegal were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was high, Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: premature cessation of donor engagement\n            can lead to a loss in momentum for major sector reform.\n            Benefits of water investments may not be realized without\n            adequate attention to sanitation. Raising tariffs only for\n            one customer group may not be effective for ensuring long\n            term sustainability.
