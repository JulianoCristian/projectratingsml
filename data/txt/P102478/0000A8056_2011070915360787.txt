                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project progress towards achieving its development objective continues to improve. As of May 17, 2011, 56,646 people, representing 52 percent of the end-of-project target, have
                         gained access to improved sanitation services, compared with 40 percent in November 2010.

                         1- ONAS is providing financial support to project beneficiaries to reduce the level of their contribution and AGETIP has launched a communication campaign,including TV spots to
                         promote project activities and generate additional demand.
