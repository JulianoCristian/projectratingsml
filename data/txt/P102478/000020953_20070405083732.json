It is hoped that this project will allow more\n            areas, including the periurban areas, to have ready access\n            to sanitation. While the project is seen as having\n            tremendous upside for the community, there are several\n            potential negative impacts resulting primarily from the\n            construction phase. The laying of the sewer mains may result\n            in damage to trees and vegetation, and as a result, there is\n            a risk of soil erosion. Noise pollution will be a problem,\n            as well as the possibility of accidents occurring during\n            excavation. Hygiene and public health are expected to suffer\n            during the period of construction. There are risks of\n            flooding and overflowing in the excavated areas."}, "docdt": "2006-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
