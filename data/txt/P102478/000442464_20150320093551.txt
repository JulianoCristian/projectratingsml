      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staffs examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome:The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently.The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, and Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to
which the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s
objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency
is the extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of
capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to
adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory,
Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) of two projects in the water
and sanitation sector of Senegal, supported by the World Bank: (i) the Long Term Water
Sector Project which was approved in March 2001 and closed in June 2009; and (ii)
Access to On-Site Sanitation Services through the Output-Based Aid (OBA) scheme,
which was approved in July 2007 and closed in December 2011. The Long Term Water
Sector Project cost US$ 254.61 million and was supported by an International
Development Association (IDA) credit of US$146.12 million equivalent. The cost of the
second project was US$5.76 and this was funded in full by the Global Partnership for
Output-Based Aid (GPOBA), which is a multi-donor partnership administered by the
World Bank. 1

The assessment is based on a review of all relevant documentation, interviews of Bank
staff at headquarters and in the country office, and the findings of an Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) mission which visited Senegal from May 15 to May 30, 2014 to
discuss performance with officials engaged with the projects, representatives of donors,
staff of the Bank resident mission and other stakeholders. The list of persons met during
the mission is attached in Annex E and their cooperation and assistance in preparing the
report is gratefully acknowledged. The IEG mission also conducted a beneficiary survey
for the on-site sanitation OBA project using mobile phone technology, results of which
are used in the analysis and the details are attached as Annex C.

In addition to detailed assessments of the two operations using standard IEG
methodology, the report includes a review of the World Bank’s assistance in Senegal’s
water and sanitation sector since 1996. Lessons learned from the assessment and such
long-term support will be used as inputs into IEG’s forthcoming review of the World
Bank Group’s assistance to the water and sanitation sector.

Following IEG practice, copies of the draft report was sent to government officials and
implementing agencies, and no comments were received.

Development and 50 percent by the Netherlands’ Directorate General for International Cooperation.

Summary
The two water and sanitation projects reviewed in this PPAR were both intended to
consolidate the results achieved through an earlier World Bank operation supporting the
sector in Senegal, but the projects differed in scope and coverage. The Long-Term Water
Sector Project (2001-2009) was a large project costing US$254.61 million financed by a
consortium of donors, including the Bank. It aimed at strengthening the infrastructure and
further promoting the reforms of the urban water sector. The GPOBA project was a small
Trust Fund-supported project, costing US$6.35 million that focused on the sanitation sub-
sector only. It aimed at increasing the population’s access to on-site sanitation facilities
by replicating the institutional model piloted in the Long-Term Water Sector Project.

The objective of the Long Term Water Sector Project was to assist the Borrower in
achieving sustainable improvements in the delivery of urban water and sanitation services
in unserved and low-income areas of Dakar and secondary cities by: (i) supporting
further institutional and regulatory reforms and policy enhancements; (ii) removing major
water production and distribution capacity constraints with the help of private sector
financing; (iii) supporting the rehabilitation of the sewerage networks and increasing the
waste water treatment capacity; (iv) implementing a community-based program for
promoting and developing on-site and semi-collective sanitation services; and (v)
supporting the development of capacities of sector agencies, communities and
households.

As a result of the project support, water production, storage, and distribution capacity
increased steadily and project targets were exceeded in most cases. By the end of the
project, the new water connections had reached 725,000 people in Dakar and 690,000
people in the secondary cities. Investments in social connections increased access to
water supply by the low-income households from 50,000 in 2001 to 150,000 in 2009, and
further to 250,000 by the end of 2012. The project has contributed to increasing the water
supply coverage from 91 percent in 2004 to 97 percent of urban population at project
closure in 2009, and to 99 percent at end-2013.

Most of the targets set at appraisal were met also for sanitation. With the extension of the
sewerage networks, sewerage connections reached about 144,000 additional people,
92,000 of whom were in Dakar and 52,000 were in secondary urban areas. The project
also provided a sustainable disposal solution for the effluents collected from septic tanks
through construction and operation of septage treatment plants. The project supported the
construction or rehabilitation of 66,000 individual facilities, 142 semi-collective
equivalent systems, 16 public latrines, and 77 school sanitation blocks, and 3 vehicles to
collect domestic sewerage sludge in Dakar. The peri-urban sanitation component
provided 583,000 people with access to improved sanitation either through on-site
facilities or through condominial systems.

While the physical water and sanitation access exceeded the targets set at appraisal, their
long-term sustainability is questionable. The public utilities have weak financial viability
due primarily to the low water tariff for private connections, and lack of proper
mechanisms to ensure maintenance of the sanitation system.
                                              x


The Objective of the Access to On-Site Sanitation Services project through Output-Based
Aid (OBA) Scheme (2009-2013) was to increase access to on-site sanitation for
households living in the Dakar region in a sustainable manner.

The project delivered a total of 11,495 sanitation facilities, and 103,450 persons were
provided with improved access to on-site sanitation in the Dakar region, reaching about
95 percent of the revised project target. According to the beneficiary survey conducted by
IEG in May 2014, the impact on the living standards for the majority of beneficiaries was
positive for all categories of facilities delivered. However, the sustainability of the
facilities, in particular those (47 percent) connected to the semi-collective sanitation
system is uncertain because of its poor maintenance.

Ratings
The outcome of the Long-Term Water Sector Project is rated moderately satisfactory.
The relevance of project objectives is rated high while the relevance of design is rated
substantial. Efficacy was substantial for the objective related to the water supply, and
modest for the objective related to the sanitation services. Project efficiency is rated as
substantial. Investments accomplished in the water and sanitation sector remain
economically sound five years after the completion of the project. Risk to Development
Outcome is rated as substantial due to the uncertain sustainability of the water and
sanitation services. Bank performance is rated satisfactory and the Borrower
performance is rated moderately satisfactory. While the implementing agency
performed well, the Government failed to ensure appropriate tariff adjustments, and to
establish an effective oversight system of the sanitation sub-sector.

The overall outcome for the project supporting Access to On-Site Sanitation Services was
rated as moderately unsatisfactory. The relevance of the project objective is rated high
while relevance of design is rated modest. Both efficacy and efficiency are rated modest.
Risk to Development Outcome is rated high, because of the institutional and financial
weaknesses in the sector. Bank and Borrower performance are rated as moderately
unsatisfactory because the key impediments related to the sustainability of sanitation
facilities were not addressed in a timely manner. The borrower did not apply the lessons
of a preceding project (the Long-Term Water Sector Project) to this operation, and a
plethora of intermediaries worsened the conditions of project implementation.

Lessons
1.      Premature cessation of donor engagement could lead to a loss of momentum
for major sector reform. The Government of Senegal had high ownership and adopted a
strategy (1995 and 2005) in the water and sanitation sector, but this has recently waned.
Through sustained commitment of IDA, the Bank was able to (i) play a catalytic role in
leveraging investment funding from other donors; (ii) smooth friction and bring a
cooperative spirit; and (iii) provide continuous support to the full execution of contractual
and regulatory obligations. However, the IEG mission found that the Bank and the donor
community have recently shifted their focus away from the relatively well performing
urban water and sanitation, to the rural water and sanitation sector. As a result, the
                                                    xi


Government slowed down on its reform agenda, as evidenced by the absence of an
updated water sector policy and non-compliance of the lease contract with the private
operator, thus potentially losing the momentum generated to sustain earlier reforms.

2.      Benefits of water investments may not be realized without adequate attention
to sanitation. Recognizing the existence of a comprehensive and integrated approach to
sanitation, evidenced by Senegal’s urban sanitation strategy which was based on the
diversification of technologies, the assessment found that more resources and more
attention were devoted to water production and distribution at the expense of the
sanitation sub-sector in Senegal. This finding is reflected in the mismatch between the
sanitation infrastructure and the country’s needs, and the lack of solutions to set up
sustainable approaches to manage public and semi-public sewerage networks and
wastewater treatment plants. According to the interviews carried out during the IEG
mission, the supply of increased urban water facilitated by the Bank’s project had led to
major pressure on the existing sewerage infrastructure. As the imbalance between the
water and sanitation investments and reforms persists, sanitation conditions may worsen,
leading to unhealthy conditions and increasing risks of water-borne diseases to the
population that benefitted from water services.

3.      Raising tariffs only for one customer group may not be effective for ensuring
long term sustainability. Since 2006, the water tariff for the private consumers had
been frozen by the Government in contradiction to the lease agreement prescribing
annual water price adjustments in line with the inflation.2 In contrast, while the tariffs
increased for the public sector entities, the exploding bills were only partially paid by the
government. As a result, arrears often accumulated and as a consequence, there were
limited resources available to fund the sector’s major financial needs. In the absence of
steady tariff increases, the sector risks a declining quality of the infrastructure and
services.

4.      Determining the right threshold of the beneficiary contribution is vital for
the successful delivery of peri-urban sanitation services. The peri-urban sanitation
component faced serious start-up problems because the required household contribution
was perceived to be too high, and the large-scale NGOs involved in outreach activities
were not able to communicate and work efficiently with the beneficiaries. Modification
of beneficiary contribution from 50 to 25 percent of the facility cost, and shifting of
outreach responsibilities to community-based organizations increased beneficiary
participation in the on-site and the semi-collective sanitation program.

5.      Complex management and institutional arrangements lead to
implementation delays. The procedures for Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid
(GPOBA) were complex and implementation arrangements were cumbersome. Obstacles
to rapid project implementation were not promptly identified and removed during trust
fund negotiation and processing. The payment schedules mandated by the GPOBA
approach were overly complex, and the Project Team took a long time to get used to the
Trust Fund procedures, leading to delays in launching and implementing the project, and
in proper establishment of sustainability enhancing measures. The lesson from this

2. The mission was informed that the Government finally decided to increase the tariffs in September 2014.
                                           xii


experience is the importance of identifying the institutional issues early and simplifying
the management and implementation arrangements to avoid delays in project
implementation. It is also important to weigh the transaction costs associated with the
funding size of GPOBA, and the institutional viability of such an approach compared to a
larger project scale initiative like the approach taken in the Long-Term Water Sector
Project that is more integrated with the government program.

1. Background and Context
Sector Background
1.1     Senegal’s water and sanitation sector was run by a private French company (La
Générale des Eaux) until the country gained its independence in 1960. The company was
nationalized in 1971 whereby the assets were sold to a newly created state-owned utility
(Société Nationale d’Exploitation des Eaux du Sénégal -SONEES). This utility was to be
in charge of supplying water and sanitation services while the State was responsible for
major capital expenditures and contracting for extension and major rehabilitation work.
The utility supplied water to the capital city (Dakar with 30 percent of the total
population), and 41 other secondary towns, but was soon plagued with problems arising
from lack of autonomy from government, chronic water shortages in the capital city, and
extreme inability to maintain and strengthen its assets.

1.2      Despite these difficulties, in 1983, the SONEES was given the responsibility for
all aspects of water and sanitation services in urban areas. However, continued low
tariffs, combined with difficulties in recovering unpaid bills from public and semi-public
sectors, hampered SONEES’ ability to function efficiently. By 1995, Dakar and other
urban centers were experiencing serious water shortages and insufficient sanitation
facilities, with only 54 percent of the urban population having access to water supply.

1.3     In the mid1990s, the Government initiated a reform program for the urban water
supply and sanitation sector whose goal was to improve the utility’s autonomy and
capability to deliver adequate water and sanitation services to urban and peri-urban
populations. Accordingly, three new entities were created in 1995 to oversee the
production, distribution, and the sanitation in urban areas: (i) the SONES (Société
Nationale des Eaux du Sénégal), a State Asset Holding Company in charge of developing
the water infrastructure in urban areas; (ii) the SDE (La Sénégalaise des Eaux) ,a private
entity in charge of delivery of water services in urban areas; and (iii) the ONAS (Office
National d’Assainissement du Sénégal), a public industrial and commercial entity aimed
to oversee the management of sanitation. The institutional framework was underpinned
by a financial model aimed at achieving a financial “equilibrium” or long-term financial
sustainability of SONES.

1.4      In 1996, a ten-year lease for the period 1996-2006 was signed between the
Government and the three stakeholders: (i) a concession contract between the
Government and SONES to oversee the investments and manage all urban water assets;
(ii) an affermage contract between the Government, SONES , and the SDE with regard to
the production and distribution of water in urban areas; and (iii) two performance
contracts, one between the Government and SONES, and another between SONES and
SDE.

1.5    This institutional framework was supported by the Bank through the Senegal
Water Project (1995-2004) costing US$290 million, which was co-financed by other
donors including the French Agency for Development, and the European Investment
                                              2


Bank. Key achievements of this project were: (i) the creation of a public-private
partnership framework driven by the basic concepts of accountability, autonomy, and
incentives; (ii) improved coverage of water services in Dakar region, from 79 percent in
1996 to 87 percent in 2003 and reduction in unaccounted for water from 31.5 percent in
1996 to 20 percent in 2003; (iii) adoption of adequate monitoring and regulatory tools;
and (iv) a new tariff structure and annual tariff increase which strengthened the financial
viability of the water sector.

Remaining Challenges
1.6     Despite the significant investments and reforms that were implemented under the
Bank-supported Senegal Water Project, the sector continued to face sustainability issues.
Although water distribution, operation, and cost recovery exhibited significant
improvement, the water resources were not sustainable since the water was pumped from
over-exploited fossil aquifers, and some of these fossil aquifers were contaminated by
salt water intrusion and therefore had to be closed. The increasing demand was not likely
to be met with the existing production volume due to the ever growing Dakar population
and that of other expanding urban centers. In addition, billing arrears were increasing to
about US$ 4.5 million or five percent of the annual turnover of the sector in June 2003,
reflecting the worsening financial viability for the sector.

1.7     The sewerage facilities were aging and needed to be replaced or repaired.
Construction was concentrated in the administrative and commercial section of Dakar,
with limited sewerage connection to the rest of the city. Moreover, the leakage of
untreated water into open spaces increased pollution. According to the 1996 willingness-
to-pay study, 64 percent of the population was not satisfied with their sanitation facilities,
rating them from fair (44 percent) to poor (20 percent). With regards to on-site sanitation,
there was a limited technology menu and neither hygiene education nor a demand-driven
approach was tested. The sector’s poor management capacity at the utility and
community-level made it difficult also to increase sanitation coverage especially in
Greater Dakar and peri-urban areas and to carry out proper maintenance.

1.8     Concerning drainage, existing facilities were often clogged and inadequately
maintained, and therefore constituted breeding grounds for mosquitoes and snails,
respectively responsible for malaria and bilharzia. The main sanitation problem was the
high level of environment pollution, arising from weak capacity of the installed
wastewater treatment plant and clogged drainage facilities, as those facilities were old
and needed to be replaced or rehabilitated. The key constraint to expanding the sewerage
system was the high costs for connecting to the sewerage system, which were beyond the
financial capacity of most low-income households.

1.9     To respond to these challenges faced by the sector, the Bank started preparing two
projects; (i) the Long Term Water Sector Project; and (ii) the Access to On-Site Sanitation
Services Through Output-Based Aid Scheme. The intention was to consolidate the results
achieved during the water and sanitation reform agenda supported by the previous projects
funded by the Bank and the donor community.

2. Long Term Water Sector Project (2001-2009)
Objectives, Design, and Relevance
OBJECTIVES

2.1      The objectives of the project are to assist the borrower in achieving sustainable
improvements in the delivery of urban water and sanitation services in unserved and low-
income areas of Dakar and secondary cities by: (i) supporting further institutional and
regulatory reforms and policy enhancements, thus consolidating and building on
achievements of the then ongoing Water Sector Project; (ii) removing major water
production and distribution capacity constraints with the help of private sector financing;
(iii) supporting the rehabilitation of the sewerage networks and increasing the waste
water treatment capacity; (iv) implementing a community-based program for promoting
and developing on-site and semi-collective sanitation services; and (v) supporting the
development of capacities of sector agencies, communities and households [Development
Credit Agreement, Schedule 2, para 1].

2.2     Project Development Objective statements in the Development Credit Agreement
and in the Project Appraisal Document were identical, with a slight difference under the
fourth activity, whereby the wording in the Development Credit Agreement emphasized
the promotion of on-site and semi-collective sanitation services.

COMPONENTS

2.3    The project comprised seven components as summarized below:

(i) Urban Water Supply for Dakar (appraisal estimate: US$117.62 million, actual
cost: US$122.42 million). This component was intended to increase production and
transmission capacity and the number of water service connections; to restructure Dakar's
water distribution network; and to increase water storage capacity.

(ii) Urban Water Supply for Secondary Cities (appraisal estimate: US$11.69 million,
actual cost: US$13.58 million). This component aimed to expand and reinforce the
distribution networks in Kaolack, St. Louis and Tambacounda as well as the production
and storage capacity; and provide water service connections and standpipes in those
centers.

(iii) Sewerage and Drainage (appraisal estimate: US$70.17 million, actual cost:
US$58.92 million). This component was to map the sewerage network in Dakar; provide
sewerage connections in Dakar, St. Louis, Louga, and Kaolack; rehabilitate and expand
treatment facilities in Dakar and the same secondary towns; and improve drainage
facilities in Triangle Sud in Dakar.

(iv) Peri-urban Sanitation Subprojects (appraisal estimate: US$29.28 million, actual
cost: US$39.09 million). This component was intended to provide grants to communities
and households in the peri-urban areas of Dakar to improve their sanitation facilities
                                             4


through the construction of household latrines; and the construction of semi-collective
sanitation systems.

(v) Water Resources Management (appraisal estimate: US$8.57 million, actual cost:
US$9.94 million). The goal of this component was to provide technical assistance to the
regulatory functions of water central administration; develop monitoring systems for
water quality and groundwater abstraction; construct small water retention structures; and
rehabilitate dykes and gates around the Guiers Lake.

(vi) Environmental Management (appraisal estimate: US$1.55 million, actual cost:
1.78 million). This component was to support the development and execution of the Lake
Management Plan; the establishment of the Environmental Mitigation Committee and the
Lake Management Commission; the rehabilitation of ecological conditions in the Ndiael;
and the preparation of rehabilitation studies for the Baie de Hann.

(vii) Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building (appraisal estimate: US$8
million, actual cost: US$8.21 million). This component was intended to increase the
efficiency of public entities involved in the water and sewerage sector by strengthening
their capacity for planning and management; restructure the sector's institutional and
regulatory framework; and develop the capacity of small private and community
enterprises to respond to the demand for services in in urban and peri-urban areas.

RELEVANCE

2.4      Relevance of the objectives is rated as high. The objectives were aligned with the
Bank’s 1998 Country Assistance Strategy which aimed at reducing poverty and
improving the living conditions of the population, including the creation of gainful
employment opportunities. This was based on a two-pronged approach: (i) supporting
policies and programs aimed at more rapid and sustained growth; and (ii) ensuring social
sustainability of the programs. The project aimed at removing the infrastructure
bottleneck for growth, and at ensuring social sustainability of basic services in urban,
peri-urban and small town areas through a demand-responsive approach and a socially-
acceptable cost recovery policy. The 2007 Country Assistance Strategy continued to
focus on improving the quality of life through better management of natural resources
and access to water and sanitation through (i) reducing environment health-related
diseases in children; (ii) improving the implementation of environmental regulations with
a focus on the highly polluted areas of Dakar as the result of uncontrolled industrial
activities; and (iii) reaching Millennium Development Goals in terms of access to water
and sanitation services by 2015, with a special focus on rural areas. Project objectives
remain relevant to the current Country Partnership Strategy (2013-2017) whose second
pillar, improving service delivery, includes increased access to water and sanitation
service in selected rural and urban areas.

2.5     The objectives are also consistent with the Government’s key policy papers. In its
2000 Letter of Sector Development Policy, the Government reiterated its commitment to
the water sector reforms and to the operational and financial autonomy of the sector. The
urban water sub-sector aimed to reach financial equilibrium, while the financial viability
of the service providers had to be strengthened, and an institutional study was to be
                                                    5


carried out to improve the legal and regulatory framework. The Government intended to
initiate the development of a national urban sanitation strategy involving all stakeholders,
which would aim to achieve: (i) demand-responsive and participatory approaches to the
delivery of services that would reach peri-urban households; (ii) maintaining the actual
capacity of the sewerage system by rehabilitating the facilities; (iii) increasing the
connection rate; and (iv) reducing pollution loads by expanding waste water and septage
treatment capacity. Finally, the Government emphasized the need to deepen the
integrated management of water resources, to provide the department in charge with
adequate financial and organizational means, and to improve the environmental
sustainability of the sector.3

2.6     The objectives remained relevant throughout the project implementation period as
the 2005 Government Policy letter continued to: (i) support effective implementation of
the management plan and institutional framework for the resource management of the
Lake Guiers water; (ii) further strengthen the financial, human, and technical resources
of the Directorate in charge of water resources planning to enable it play its role of water
resource monitoring, enforcement and control; (iii) move ahead with the reform agenda
on the urban water and sanitation front with the implementation of the "second
generation" reforms and the strengthening of the technical infrastructure to cope with
rising demand, improve and extend the quality of service; (iv) preserve the financial
equilibrium in the urban water sector reached in December 2003; and (v) the
implementation of targeted actions to fight against poverty.

2.7     Relevance of design is rated as substantial because of a strong results chain
linking objectives and expected outcomes with appropriate components and outputs. The
objective of improving the delivery of urban water services was to be achieved through
the two urban water supply components and related investments in removing the
constraints, and in targeting Dakar and the secondary cities, as well as the water resources
management component. The objective of improving the delivery of sanitation services
was to be achieved through peri-urban sanitation component and sewerage and drainage
components. The project also included institutional strengthening, capacity building, and
environmental management activities to enhance the sustainability of the improvements
made in both water and sanitation services.


MONITORING AND EVALUATION

2.8     Design: Project Monitoring and Evaluation was facilitated by the quality of the
results matrix that had quantifiable indicators, as well as the good collaboration between
the teams of the Bank and the Borrower. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements
included the following: (i) the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was tasked to collect and
consolidate information from the various executing agencies, and to prepare monitoring
and evaluation reports and indicators, (ii) supervision missions by IDA and other donors
had to conduct explicit assessments of the action plans supported by the project,
including field visits to closely monitor development impacts, and (iii) annual reviews of

                                             6


the outcome of the financial model of the urban water supply subsector had to be carried
out jointly by the key domestic stakeholders as they determined annual tariff increases.
Finally, the PCU was tasked to organize a mid-term review with all stakeholders thirty
months after the credit effectiveness.

2.9     Implementation and Utilization: The PCU effectively carried out monitoring
and reporting. Results of these activities triggered detailed recommendations to the
Government and executing agencies. Beyond monitoring project performances, the
project results were used in the preparation of the Bank’s new project: the National Water
and Sanitation Millennium Program prepared to achieve the Millennium Development
Goals. Finally, the updated financial model was used as a reference in the negotiations of
the extension of the lease contract.

Implementation
2.10 The project was approved on March 6, 2001 and closed on June 30, 2009, one and
a half year later than the original schedule to allow time for the additional works to be
executed.

IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE

2.11 The PCU, located in the Ministry of Water and Sanitation and set up in 1998 to
oversee almost all donor-financed projects in the sector, was selected to manage the
Long-Term Water Sector Project. SONES, the asset holding company, and SDE, the
private operator implemented the water components, and ONAS, the national sanitation
office, oversaw the implementation of the sanitation components with help from other
public agencies. The beneficiaries developed their subprojects with the assistance of local
non-government organizations and community-based organizations. The Management
and planning unit for water resources recruited consultants to carry out studies and
training under the water resources management component, while the Ministry of
Environment managed the components and activities supporting the environment
management plan.

2.12 ONAS and SONES carried out the financial management of their respective
components, while the PCU was in charge of project financial management on behalf of
other implementing units and retained the financial accountability for the project. A
project execution manual, which provided the necessary guidelines for all implementing
agencies, was prepared and reviewed with the Government during the appraisal mission,
and was adhered to during project implementation.

PROJECT COSTS

2.13 The actual project cost was US$254.61 million, only slightly higher than the
appraisal estimate of US$248.4 million. Parallel funding was provided by bilateral and
multilateral donors, and other private commercial sources as detailed in the table 1 below.

2.14 The IDA credit increased from US$125.00 million, estimated at appraisal, to
US$146.21 million, due principally to West African Communauté Financière d'Afrique
Franc (XOF) appreciation against the dollar, and an increase in Borrower contribution
from US$2.48 million to US$7.42 million. In addition SONES contributed US$1.71
million against US$1.60 million planned; conversely local communities contributed
US$4.98 million or 57 percent of the planned US$8.7 million.

2.15 A mid-term review in January 2005 made recommendations to re-allocate project
savings from urban water and the drainage and sewerage components to finance
additional works for Dakar water production systems. This included the doubling of the
water treatment plant (65,000 m3/d) and the expansion of the list of secondary urban
centers eligible for water works. In addition, several activities had to be modified to take
into account the actual availability of parallel funding from other sources. These changes
did not require Board approval and were authorized by the Regional Vice President.

SAFEGUARDS AND FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE

2.16 The project was classified as a Category A under OB/BP 4.01- (Environment
Assessment) requiring a full assessment of social and environment project impacts. An
Environmental Assessment was completed in May 1999 and identified three major
project impacts on the environment: (i) positive impacts on underground water resources
with a reduction of exploitation of the most fragile among them; (ii) increased use of
water from the Guiers Lake which would require careful management of the lake as well
as consideration of social and environmental issues; and (iii) positive improvements of
hygiene conditions and health of populations in the greater Dakar area, following
increased access to water and sanitation services and hygiene education.
                                             8


2.17 An environmental management plan was agreed upon between the Bank and the
Government, and an Environmental Mitigation Monitoring committee was created and
tasked to monitor the implementation of the Environmental Management Plan, and the
performance of the private operator in complying with the environmental requirements.
Ex-post assessments of the execution of the Environmental Management Plan found that
mitigation measures were carried out and that social safeguards were complied with.
Mitigation measures related to the environmental impact of the wastewater generated by
the project were also efficient.

2.18 A review of the financial management systems of project implementing entities
was carried out before project launch and concluded (i) that SONES and the PCU met the
Bank's minimum financial requirements, but required improvements in budget
monitoring; and (ii) that ONAS did not have in place an adequate project financial
management system that could provide accurate and timely Project Management Reports.
As a condition of effectiveness, ONAS had to reorganize its financial and accounting
department and establish a satisfactory financial management system, and the PCU had to
hire a financial management specialist.

2.19 Performance of the accounting, financial management, and procurement systems
was overall satisfactory during project implementation as confirmed by ex-post Bank
assessments completed in 2009.

Achievement of Objectives
Objective 1: To Assist The Borrower in Achieving Sustainable Improvements in the
Delivery Of Water Services in Unserved and Low Income Areas Of Dakar and
Secondary Cities. Rated Substantial

2.20 To achieve this objective, the project intended to improve the coverage,
reliability, quality, affordability, sustainability of water supply services in unserved and
low income areas of Dakar and secondary cities through: (i) removing major water
production and distribution capacity constraints with the help of private sector financing,
(ii) supporting further institutional and regulatory reforms and policy enhancements, and
(iii) supporting the development of capacities of sector agencies.

OUTPUTS

(i) Removal of Major Constraints to Water Production and Distribution Capacity

2.21 The project helped to double the water treatment capacity at the Keur Momar Sarr
plant (to 65,000 m3/day), constructed a 70-km pipe and replaced 22-km of transmission
pipes, rehabilitated a 5,000 m3 reservoir, and extended the distribution networks by 46
km. The 26 percent increase in total production volume over the period 2001-07
continued to increase after project closure as illustrated by the blue columns in the figure
1 below.

2.22 The project helped extend the distribution networks by 343 km in Tambacounda,
Saint-Louis, Kolda, Bambey and Mbacké. As a result, 46,546 social connections and 70
standpipes in Dakar and 51,174 connections and 97 standpipes were constructed in the
secondary cities.
2.23 Rehabilitation and replacements of networks, connections and meters have
contributed to improved performance of the water distribution network in Dakar.5
Unaccounted-for-water decreased steadily from 27.4 percent in1997 to the lowest level of
19.4 percent in 2009 (see figure 2 below). Despite the improvements made, the
contractual objective has not been met mainly because of the gap between the needs of
replacement investment and maintenance, and the implementation of planned
investments.




4. The graph shows the evolution of the total water production supervised by SDE, which comprises the
Keur Momar Sarr plant, the Nghnit plant, and all boreholes and pumping stations.
5. Unaccounted-for-water reflects the percentage of the water that is not accounted for in comparison to
the water produced in a year. When water is produced, a portion is not accounted for or paid for, because of
water leak during distribution, or poor billing and collection. In Senegal the performance target was to
reduce it to 15 percent, but current performance is around 20 percent.

(ii) Institutional and Regulatory Reforms and Policy Enhancements

2.24 The Government’s Water and Sanitation Policy Document was adopted by the
Government in 2005, and was endorsed by the donor community. The studies supported
under the project were completed in the context of the Government’s Water and
Sanitation Millennium Program, and the results led to the enactment of the Water and
Sanitation Public Service Act that was adopted in 2008.

2.25 Performance contracts, which initially only applied to the Sénégalaise des Eaux
(SDE), were extended to ONAS and SONES. The relationship between partners in the
water sector has evolved over time, and at the time of IEG mission, a new extension of
five years was being agreed upon.

(iii) Development of Sector Agency Capacity

2.26 The project supported a series of studies, training and communication activities
aimed to better understand and manage the water and sanitation sector in Senegal. The
key studies were on; (i) decision-making instruments in support of the integration of
water supply systems to be used by SONES; (ii) medium-term expenditure framework for
rural water and sanitation; and (iii) the management of storm water.

2.27 Training supported under the project were along the following themes; (i) audit of
projects, advanced financial management, hydraulic pumping and distribution, training
on techniques for water desalination of sea water; (ii) accounting and procurement; (iii)
management of human resources and payroll; and (iv) optimization of energy
consumption in water factories and maintenance of electrical installations in water plants.
                                            11


2.28 Three-quarters of the standpipes installed by the project were managed by
individual private operators, while the remainder was managed according to a public or
associative model. In some cases, managers were employees of individuals or
associations and received remuneration.

2.29 Communication activities covered: (i) promotion of sewer connections,
management and conservation of water resources and investment; and (ii) production of
leaflets, pamphlets, films, TV and radio broadcasts related to the changes occurring in the
water and sanitation sector.

OUTCOMES

2.30 Project outcomes are assessed against the set objectives, using the following key
outcome indicators; coverage, reliability, quality, affordability, and sustainability of
water supply services in unserved and low income areas of Dakar and secondary cities.

   Coverage

2.31 Coverage of population with improved access to water in urban areas increased
from 90 percent in 2001 to 98 percent in 2008 at the end of the project, and to 99 percent
in 2014 (see figure 3). The program did not distinguish the unserved population from the
rest, so it is difficult to assess whether the new connections targeted the unserved
population.

2.32 In terms of the number or people, 1,415,000 (target 1,000,000) gained improved
access and most (96.5 percent) of these people had private connections. In Dakar,
725,000 people gained access to water connections but the target of reaching 800,000
people was not met because the appraisal forecasts overestimated the population growth.
For other urban areas, the target of 200,000 people was exceeded by more than three
times, reaching 690,000 people.

2.33 The total number of beneficiaries increased by 26 percent during the project
period, between 2004 and 2009 and the trend was sustained after project closing as it had
increased by 35 percent by end 2013 compared to the 2004 situation.

2.34 In Dakar, social connections which benefitted low-income households increased
threefold from 50,000 in 2001 to 150,000 at project closure in 2009. The growth
continued beyond project closure as illustrated in figure 4 below, and by the end of 2013,
there were more than 190,000 social connections.

2.35 In the peri-urban areas of Dakar and other secondary centers, 98,000 people
participated in the social connection program. This activity accounted for about 69
percent of all project beneficiaries. The project's social connection program subsidized
                                            13


the connection cost at 80 percent on a first-come first served basis. All households in
secondary areas qualified for the social connection program, while in Dakar, only low-
income neighborhoods were qualified. Social connections were implemented primarily in
Dakar (44 percent of total) and Thies (19 percent of total), but were also promoted in
secondary cities like Kaolack and St-Louis (9 percent of total for each), as well as in the
smaller cities of Louga (6 percent), Ziguinchor (5 percent), Diuorbel (5 percent), and
Tamba (3 percent).

   Reliability

2.36 There was significant progress towards eliminating intermittent supply of water
services in the greater Dakar area. Currently, 99 percent of the population is benefiting
from 24-hour a day, 7 days a week water supply service in the capital city of Dakar. This
is a significant improvement compared to 80.2 percent at the start of the previous Bank-
funded Senegal Water Project (1995-2004), and the baseline of 91 percent at the start of
the Long Term Water Sector Project.

   Quality

2.37 In addition to reliability, the quality of water distributed increased steadily during
project implementation and beyond. As illustrated in figure 5 below, water physico-
chemical and microbiological conformity rates remained above the contractual norm for
the entire period of project life.

2.38 Water quality in the suburbs of Dakar was also confirmed to be of high level by
the results of a survey conducted annually by SDE. The beneficiaries reported an
improvement in water quality from a satisfactory rate of 65 percent of respondents in
2008 to 97 percent in 2013. Accordingly, the number of claims on water quality issues
filed by the customers has also been decreasing over time.

       Affordability

2.39 Senegal has adopted an increasing block tariff system, starting with a subsidized
“social tariff” for those consuming lower quantities of water (up to 20 m3 in 60 days), a
regular tariff for those consuming between 21 and 100 m3, and finally a dissuasive tariff
for those consuming above 100 m3. Starting 2002, the regular and dissuasive tariffs were
changed to stand at between 21 and 40 m3, and above 40m3 respectively. This block
tariff system was designed to allow cross-subsidization from those consumers in the
higher tariff blocks to the lower income category of consumers. There is also a specific
tariff category for industry and government clients, with the Government water tariff
averaging more than three times the social tariff in 2014.

2.40 The IEG mission could not find any data that showed the evolution of
affordability, based on the customers’ actual disposable income compared to the baseline
level. However, the project helped enhance the affordability of water services for low
income categories by providing social connections which subsidized 80 percent of the
total connection cost on a first–come first-served basis. Affordability did not worsen over
time because the Government froze the water tariffs during 2004-2014.

         Sustainability

2.41 Infrastructure funded by the project contributed to increased water production and
distribution, and reduction in unaccounted for water. However, lack of adequate funding
has contributed to the delay by SONES in stepping up the contractual program of
rehabilitating the water treatment plants and distribution networks.6 In order to improve
or at least sustain the level of unaccounted for water at 20 percent, there is an immediate
need to replace 12,000 connections, as well as 60 kilometers of 100 mm pipes. The
amendments to the lease agreement in 2013 identified SDE as the key institution to take
care of the above replacement activities.

2.42 Water tariffs were adjusted annually during the period 1997-2003, and this led to
improved financial situation of the three water and sanitation entities, SONES, ONAS
and SDE. From 2004 however, the tariff for the private consumer was frozen for political
reasons, while the tariff for the public sector was adjusted intermittently. The frozen tariff
did not only benefit the low income population, but also the middle and high income
groups. There were insufficient tariff revenues from the private consumers, and the
arrears from the public sector accumulated, even though they were occasionally cleared.
While SONES did manage to maintain a positive cash balance throughout the
implementation period, covering the operations maintenance expenses, debt service, and
capital expenditures, the frozen tariff strained the financial situation for both SONES and
ONAS. SDE’s financial situation was not affected as badly because its expenses,
including the fees paid to the asset holding companies, remained stable. The long overdue
tariff increase that finally took place in September 2014 (see box 1 below) is likely to
have some positive impact on the sector’s financial situation. However, the Government
subsidy remains built into the water tariffs system, as the tariff for the public sector is on
average more than three times larger than the tariff for the private consumers.

 Box 1: Salient features of the new water tariff issued by the Government in
 September 2014
    After more than a decade of frozen water price, a new tariff increase for the private consumers
     became effective in September 2014.
    There was a 4 percent increase on the social tariff and a 9 percent increase on all other categories of
     consumers. This will not only contribute to the financial equilibrium for the sector, but also reduce
     the Government’s water bills by 4.5%, representing an annual saving of 865 million XOF.
    The sanitation surcharge (collected through the water bill in urban towns equipped with sewerage
     systems) will increase by 23 percent (from 52.25 XOF/m3 to 64.27 XOF/m3) to allow ONAS to
     cover its operation costs without asking for a 1.2 billion XOF increase in subsidy.
    The Government subsidy to the private consumer will continue to be built in the tariff structure, and
     this will continue to have impact on the public finance, and the amount of arrears that the treasury
     will have to clear each fiscal year.

IMPACTS

2.43 A Government report prepared two years before project completion in 2007 found
that the vast majority (79 percent) of households acknowledged positive impacts related
to the water reform.7 These impacts were primarily the availability of water in the
household and the neighborhood (respectively 94 percent and 78 percent), shorter time in
fetching water (81 percent and 54 percent, respectively), lower water costs for households
(40 percent), and at the neighborhood level (15 percent), better hygiene (32 percent for
households) and the end of water-sharing conflicts at the neighborhood level (15
percent).

2.44 The health situation in the districts surveyed had also improved significantly,
from the status in 1995 when the water-related diseases were the leading causes of
morbidity. Due to the high subsidy for house connections, the proportion of households
using the standpipe decreased from 17.1 percent to 8.2 percent during the same period,
and the use of open wells were also down from 3.9 percent to 1 percent. Some minor
negative impacts raised by the beneficiaries were related to poor water quality, high water
tariffs, inadequate billing system, and the disappearance or bad location of some
standpipes.

2.45 The IEG mission found that the improvements in water quality and customer
satisfaction have been maintained over time. According to the 2013 SDE’s annual report,
the water quality was as follows: (i) the bacteriological quality compliance rate reached
99 percent against a contractual rate of 96 percent; (ii) the physico-chemical quality
complied was 99 percent against a contractual rate of 95 percent; (iii) the customer
satisfaction rate in the suburbs of Dakar reached 97 percent in 2013; and (iv) the presence
of chlorine residual in the network was 99 percent. The improved quality perceived by

customers was confirmed by the observed decline in the number of complaints relating to
the quality of water.

Objective 2: To assist the Borrower in achieving Sustainable Improvements in the
Delivery of Sanitation Services in Unserved and Low Income Areas of Dakar and
Secondary Cities. Rated Modest

2.47 The project aimed to improve the coverage and sustainability of sanitation
services in low income areas of Dakar and secondary cities through: (i) supporting the
rehabilitation of sewerage networks and increasing the waste water treatment capacity;
(ii) implementing a community-based program for promoting and developing of onsite
and semi-collective sanitation services; (iii) supporting further institutional and
regulatory reforms and policy enhancements; and (iv) supporting the development of
capacities of sector agencies, communities and households.

OUTPUTS

(i) Rehabilitation of Sewerage Networks and Increasing the Waste Water Treatment
Capacity

2.48 At project completion, the sewerage network was extended by 130 km, and new
9,194 new sewerage connections had been made in Dakar, against 8,800 planned, and
5,256 connections had been made in the secondary town against 5,000 planned at project
appraisal. However, the increased water volume which was materialized through
investments in water production and distribution led to major pressure on the existing
sewerage infrastructure.
                                            17


2.49 The rate of wastewater treatment, which is the ratio between the volumes of waste
water treated, and the volume of waste water collected in a given perimeter, increased
substantially from 19 percent in 2004 and reached 49 percent in 2013, but remained
below the contractual target of 53 percent set by the Government.

2.50 The “ratio of depollution”, which compares the organic pollution eliminated by
the wastewater treatment, against the total pollution generated by residents and collected
by the public sewerage system, also increased steadily, from 13 percent in 2004 to reach
37 percent in 2013 (slightly below the contractual target of 38 percent). While wastewater
performance fell below the contractual targets, its level exceeds the level achieved
elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa.

2.51 The number of additional people with access to sewerage connection increased by
144,000, exceeding the target of 140,000. There were 92,000 beneficiaries in Dakar
(target 90,000) and 52,000 in secondary urban areas (target 50,000). The additional
volume of sewage collected and treated in project areas was 11,745 m3/day (target
10,000 m3/day). The project also provided a sustainable disposal solution for the
effluents collected from septic tanks with the construction and successful operation of
septage treatment plants.

(ii) Community-Based Program for Promoting and Developing Onsite and Semi-
Collective Sanitation Services

2.52 There was construction or rehabilitation of 66,000 individual sanitation facilities
(target of 60,000), 142 semi-collective equivalent systems (target of 160), 16 public
latrines, 77 school sanitation blocks (target of 70), and 3 vehicles to empty domestic
sewerage sludge in Dakar. Construction of semi-collective systems fell short of the target,
because of the specific nature of the facility that requires the support of participants and
the set-up of an adequate management scheme.

2.53 Three activities were cancelled: (i) a contract for the construction of ocean outfall
at Camberene treatment plan was terminated early, and the works were completed with
donor’s support (French Development Agency and African Development Bank) and
Government’s budget; (ii) the construction of 3 septage treatment facilities could not be
completed within project deadline, and were planned to be funded by the successor
project; and (iii) the construction of drainage infrastructure at Triangle Sud in Dakar was
taken over by the Government, and work was duly completed thereafter.

(iii) Further Institutional and Regulatory Reforms and Policy Enhancements

2.54 The following four institutions were either created or strengthened for on-site and
semi-collective systems:

      National Office of Urban Sanitation (ONAS) whose role is to oversee the urban
       sanitation system and to define the roles and build the capacity of the agencies
       responsible for operation and maintenance of the sewerage networks and
       sanitation systems in the urban areas.
                                                  18


       52 Local Management Communities which were established to monitor and
        maintain the semi-collective networks.
       Small and Medium Sized Enterprises to maintain and manage the sewerage
        system constructed by ONAS in order to meet the criteria of a healthy
        environment, cost-effective management and financial sustainability of the
        system. The financial resources to cover the costs were supposed to come from
        the monthly contribution of households and a subsidy from the commune, but the
        project did little to support these enterprises, and support from the commune and
        the households was very limited.
       Beneficiary population. A comprehensive Information, Education and
        Communication program explaining the sanitation alternatives available for
        households, reached out to about 743,000 people, against a targeted of 400,000, as
        well as 30 counties, two rural communities and urban district. As a result, ONAS
        received more than 149,000 applications for individual sanitation facilities (at
        project closure, about 45 percent of these requests had already been attended).

(iv) Capacity Development of Sector Agencies, Communities, and Households

2.55 The project supported capacity-building of the main stakeholders with a total of
3,777 experts in soft and technical areas of onsite sanitation8. Achievements included: (i)
1,754 people trained in Participatory Hygiene And Sanitation Transformation including
community management; (ii) 1,800 people in Technology of on-site sanitation facilities;
(iii) 123 people on sanitation technology for the Semi Collective sub-sector; and (iv) 100
people on the management of sludge in collaboration with a private company.

2.56 Non-government organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations
conducted 2.2 million activities from 2002 to 2008 and exceeded the planned level of 1.4
million activities. Furthermore, 2,104 outreach activities were organized by the Local
Steering Committees and a strong involvement of women through the revolving credit
system for the acquisition of washtubs. Regarding education and hygiene promotion, 2.4
times the project target population has been reached by the Information, Education, and
Communication’s programs.

2.57 Neighborhood delegates, as well as NGOs and consumer associations played a
key role in connecting local communities and the municipal authorities, or SONES / SDE
to convey information to households.

OUTCOMES

2.58 Project outcomes are assessed on coverage and sustainability of sanitation
services in unserved and low income areas of Dakar and secondary cities.

       Coverage



8. Bilan du Programme d’assainissement des quartiers périurbains de Dakar , ONAS, 2009.
                                                     19


        The number of additional people with access to sewerage connection increased by
144,000 (target 140,000). There were 92,000 beneficiaries in Dakar (target 90,000) and
52,000 in secondary urban areas (target 50,000). A community-based program for
developing on-site and semi-collective sanitation services greatly exceeded targets. The
peri-urban sanitation component provided 583,000 people (target 400,000) with access to
improved sanitation either through on-site facilities (526,000 people) or through
condominial systems (57,000 people).

2.60 While slow, access to sanitation services has been growing steadily during 2004-
2008, as the ratio jumped from 57 percent of the Dakar population up to 62 percent. But
subsequently the increased slowed down to below the target levels (see figure 7 below),
principally because of elevated costs of sanitation infrastructure, and most importantly,
due to the freezing of the sanitation tariff since 2004.

         Sustainability

2.61 A report by a private research firm9 found (and the IEG mission confirmed) that
the management model set up between ONAS, the municipalities and other stakeholders
of the semi-collective and on-site sanitation system has not been functioning. This was
because of design flaws, misinterpretation of work undertaken during implementation,
and unclear definition of responsibilities between ONAS and the beneficiaries. The
management committees at the commune level either never existed or were never
functional, or are no longer functional. The management committees did not receive any
contribution from project beneficiaries and they are unlikely to be compensated even in
the future because the users are reluctant to make payments to them.

2.62 The sub-sector is also facing financial issues. The cost-recovery ratio of revenues
over operating expenses that was 90 percent in 2004 fell dramatically to 66 percent in
2012 (see figure 8 below). This decrease was mainly due to the freezing of sewerage
tariff since 2003, which led to increased financial shortfalls for ONAS. As a result, the
quality of sanitation services is at serious risk of deterioration.

2.63 The recent water tariff increase, announced on September 15, 2014 is expected to
have a positive impact on the financial situation of the three entities overseeing the water
and sanitation sector. In particular, the sanitation surcharge, collected through the water
bill in urban towns equipped with sewerage systems will increase by 23 percent (from
52.25 XOF/m3 to 64.27 XOF/m3), to enable ONAS to cover its operating costs without
asking for increasing subsidies from the Government.

IMPACTS

2.64 The survey results at the end of the project showed that 82 percent of latrines
were well maintained and 85 percent of households reported a significant improvement of
hygiene conditions in neighborhoods. The results in terms of local initiatives included
the set-up of 33 Local Steering Committees and 48 Management Committees and 10
municipal committees to support the program in order to ensure ownership and
sustainability.

Efficiency
2.65 At project appraisal, the Bank team conducted a cost-benefits analysis of the
water and sanitation components based on the health benefits from the reduction of
morbidity and mortality for diarrhea diseases and malaria. On this basis, the analysis
projected high economic internal rates of return (EIRR) for both the water supply
                                             21


component (32 percent) and the sanitation component (34 percent), and that incorporation
of health benefits would contribute substantially to increasing the ERRs above these
values.

2.66 When the project closed in 2007, an ex-post economic analysis was carried out,
using a methodology different from the one used at project appraisal due to the absence
of a baseline of health benefits. For this reason, the ex-post analysis followed the standard
sector methodology, and used the cost-benefit analysis for the water supply components
(representing 53 percent of the total project costs) and a cost-effectiveness analysis for
the sanitation components (38 percent of the total project costs).

2.67 For the water components, the EIRR was 12.1 percent and the net present value
(with a 10 percent discount rate) was US$24.7 million. Since there were clear health
benefits demonstrated by the customer survey results, it is likely that the EIRR with
health benefits will be much higher.

2.68 The cost-effectiveness analysis of the sanitation components, carried out on the
basis of average investments per capita shows that: (i) the strategic choice made by the
Government to develop alternatives to sewerage was more cost effective, as the full cost
of sewerage investments would have been much higher than developing condominial
systems and on-site sanitation; whereas (ii) the densification of the existing sewerage
network, through sewerage connections programs, was also economically justified.

2.69   In conclusion, efficiency is rated as substantial.

Ratings
OUTCOME

2.70 The overall outcome of the project is rated moderately satisfactory. The
relevance of project development objective is rated as high, and the relevance of design is
rated as substantial. Efficacy was substantial for the objective related to the water supply,
and modest for the objective related to the sanitation services because of their
questionable sustainability. Project efficiency is rated as substantial. Investments
accomplished in the water and sanitation sector remain economically sound five years
after the completion of the project.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

2.71 Risk to development outcome is rated as substantial. The results achieved under
the project will be in jeopardy if the risks described below are not addressed through a
concerted effort between the Government and the key sector stakeholders.

2.72 Institutional risks: The project helped strengthen the institutions (SONES,
ONAS) that oversee the water and sanitation sector. However, the risks surrounding these
two public institutions could be raised if their financial and managerial autonomy is not
ensured to allow them to perform their duties and contractual responsibilities.
                                             22


2.73 Financial risks: Since the financial equilibrium for the sector was achieved in
2003, the financial strength of SONES has been deteriorating due primarily to the
following three factors; (i) lack of tariff adjustment in a context of price evolution for the
water operator, whose indexation was specified in the contractual provisions, (ii)
increasing consumption generated by significant social connections (more than 175,000
social connections), having a negative impact on the average price and representing 40-
41 percent of water consumption); and (iii) lower consumption of the administration
having a negative impact on the average price because of the price difference.

2.74 Maintenance Risks: Weaknesses were identified in setting up a sound
mechanism to oversee the sanitation system. If these instruments are not updated and
implemented carefully, the reform agenda might be reversed, and the immense gains may
be in jeopardy. It is essential that the Government creates a favorable environment for an
effective partnership to oversee the management of the sanitation system.

2.75 Environmental risks: The investment requirements to address sanitation
challenges for the quickly-growing capital city Dakar are huge, and while there is a
comprehensive sanitation strategy that was based on the diversification of technologies,
there are concerns related to the potential stress affecting the existing sewerage networks.
. If the imbalance persists in terms of investments and reforms in water sector and
sanitation sector, sanitation conditions are likely to worsen and even the beneficiaries of
improved water services are likely to be affected by the unhealthy conditions.

BANK PERFORMANCE

Quality at Entry

2.76 Quality at entry is rated Satisfactory. The Bank had been the leading partner
together with several donors, in supporting the formulation and implementation of sector
reforms through the previous Senegal Water Project (1995-2004). The quality of the
sectoral dialogue and the trust it had generated were key factors in the decision to
continue and expand the Bank’s support to the sector.

2.77 Project preparation built on the satisfactory fiduciary compliance demonstrated
under the previous project, with the necessary adjustments required to take into account
the involvement of less experienced executing agencies. The budget devoted to
preparation was commensurate with the scope and the complexity of the operation and
reflected the level of support provided by the sector and country management.

2.78 The Project built on sectoral reforms and policies that had been successfully
tested to promote efficiency in the development and delivery of services. The Bank team
covered in-depth social and environmental aspects while properly designing technical and
financial aspects of the project. The implementation arrangements were carefully tailored
to the capacities of the various executing agencies and included participation of
beneficiaries through a demand-driven approach. However, there were shortcomings in
the design of the peri-urban sanitation component, because contributions expected from
households were too high, and NGO capacity was overestimated.
                                            23


2.79 While the project aimed at achieving sustainable improvements in the delivery of
water and sanitation services in unserved and low income areas of Dakar and in
secondary centers, the project design and the results matrix lacked specificity in
identifying the targeted population, and the magnitude of the project’s contribution in
addressing the conditions of life of urban population. Instead of setting absolute targets
(number of beneficiaries), it would have made more sense to set relative targets (in
percentage of unserved population, especially in secondary centers). Setting such kind of
targets would have helped in better assessing the coverage achieved by the project and
the needed steps to enhance the conditions of life of urban poor in Dakar and the regional
centers.

Quality of Supervision

2.80 Quality of Supervision is rated Satisfactory. A productive and trusting
relationship was built between the Bank and Borrower's teams, and this helped resolve
implementation issues as both parties were open to finding solutions in conjunction with
other stakeholders. Supervision missions were fielded regularly and the presence of the
task team leader in the field from 2002 to 2006 facilitated regular interaction with the
Government and other donors.

2.81 The team closely monitored progress, enabling the Bank and the Borrower to
make timely adjustments. For instance, the peri-urban sanitation component faced serious
start-up problems due to the fact that the households’ contribution (50 percent of the cost
of the facilities) was perceived as too high and that the large-scale NGOs involved in
outreach activities were not able to communicate and work efficiently with beneficiaries.
Modifications were rapidly brought to reduce the contribution to 25 percent and to shift
outreach responsibilities to community-based organizations which were closer to the
target households.

2.82 Staffing was appropriate, with a high level of continuity, and Bank staff was able
to participate in numerous workshops organized by the PCU. The team included a senior
safeguard specialist with in-depth knowledge of the project areas.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE

2.83 Government Performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. During project
preparation, the Government’s commitment to the development objective and to the
continuation of the water and sector reforms was unquestionable. The Government’s
commitment and leadership was essential in ensuring the unusually broad participation of
donors in this operation and involvement of all other domestic stakeholders. Counterpart
funds were provided on a timely basis.

2.84 The Government’s commitment to maintaining the sector’s financial
sustainability however was not followed through. The water tariffs were adjusted as per
the lease agreement until 2003, but thereafter the Government only raised the tariffs for
public sector entities. In addition, the government record for timely water bill payments,
                                            24


while exemplary until 2007, fell behind thereafter, straining the resources of the public
entities overseeing the water and sanitation sectors.

2.85 Government leadership in the crafting of an institutional mechanism to oversee
the sanitation sub-sector has been timid. As the management of condominial and on-site
sanitation systems deals with multiple partners, a stronger hand from the public authority
would have helped to strike the balance among competing interests, and come to closure
on what is the contribution of each stakeholder to establish a working mechanism.
Currently, leadership in this matter has been and remains weak. Finally, the project
oversight was dispersed across several ministries during the course of implementation,
weakening project planning and efficacy.

2.86 Factors that impeded smooth project implementation included: (i) the frequent
cabinet reshuffles that led to frequent changes of the general managers of SONES and
ONAS; (ii) unaffordable household contribution to peri-urban sanitation facilities (50
percent of the costs); and difficulty encountered with the beneficiary outreach activities
conducted by large-scale NGOs. Soon after the household contributions were reduced to
25 percent, and the outreach responsibilities were shifted to community-based
organizations, positive results emerged.

2.87 The IEG mission found that after project closure, the Government has been facing
difficulty mobilizing the necessary funding from the donors especially for urban water
and sanitation sector because of the absence of an updated sector policy and the
premature shift in focus from the urban to the rural water sub-sector.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY PERFORMANCE

2.88 Implementing agency performance is rated as Satisfactory. The PCU performed
well in coordinating the design and the implementation of the project, building on the
expertise and experience acquired when implementing the previous Senegal Water
Project (1995-2004). The PCU reached out to key stakeholders through dissemination of
studies and workshops to build consensus on policy options. The PCU was adequately
staffed and had in place well-established project management and accounting procedures
acceptable to the Bank. The PCU handled deftly monitoring and reporting on project
implementation progress, and oversaw fiduciary and procurement responsibilities.

2.89 SONES implemented the urban water investment program, while ONAS
managed the overall implementation of the sanitation components and delegated to the
public works implementing agency, Agence d’Exécution des Travaux d’Intérêt Public
(AGETIP) to manage the sub-projects included in the peri-urban sanitation component.

2.90 Beneficiaries of those projects developed their subprojects with the assistance of
local NGOs and Community-Based Organizations. Both the national water company
SONES and the national sanitation agency ONAS performed well in ensuring physical
implementation, procurement, and contract management related to the respective
components under their oversight. However, ONAS suffered from lack of full autonomy
and a high turnover rate of senior staff.
                                            25


2.91 The Management and Planning Unit for Water Resources supervised studies and
training under the water resources management component, while the Ministry of
Environment managed the three components of the Environment Management Plan. The
directorate of water resources planning worked effectively with the directorate of
environment to monitor the water quality of the Guiers Lake and worked with the PCU to
improve its procurement performance.

2.92 However, the IEG mission found and received feedback from the donor
community that the technical capacity of some implementing agencies remained weak
especially in dealing with the private operator’s contractual agreements, possibly due to
the non-competitive hiring conditions that could not attract qualified staff in these
agencies.



3. Supporting Access to On-Site Sanitation Services
through OBA Scheme (2007-2011)
Objectives, Design, and Relevance
OBJECTIVE

3.1    The Project Development Objective was "to increase access to on-site sanitation
for households living in the Dakar region in a sustainable manner" (Grant Agreement
page 6.) This formulation was identical to the objective stated in the Project Appraisal
Document (page 6).

COMPONENTS:

3.2    The project had two components as detailed below:

(i) Output-based subsidies for the construction of on-site sanitation facilities
(appraisal estimate: US$5.5 million, actual cost: US$4.89 million). This component
was to fund works, technical studies and supervision, social intermediation, and costs and
fees of the implementing agencies. Originally, this component aimed to provide access
to sanitation facilities for 15,100 households living in five target municipalities in the
Dakar region. It was revised during a level-2 restructuring to provide access for 12,100
households living in the Dakar region.

(ii) Monitoring and evaluation, audits, and monitoring of environmental and social
impact (appraisal estimate: US$260,000, actual cost: US$231,787). This component
aimed to establish an effective monitoring and evaluation system, audit, and
environmental and social follow-up of the output-based aid program. This component
was not modified during the restructuring.
                                                     26


RELEVANCE:

3.3     The project objective was Highly Relevant at entry and at closure. According to
the Millennium Development Goals Strategic Document for Senegal, more than a third of
the Dakar region did not have access to proper sanitation in 200410. That is why
providing increased sanitation services was a priority in the Government’s Letter of
Sector Policy of July 2005, which set out government options for sanitation in urban
centers, with a preference toward the optimal combination of sewerage systems,
condominium sanitation, and on-site facilities. The Letter also called for the development
of on-site sanitation in all the municipalities of Senegal, based on a technical package
similar to the one developed by the Sanitation Program in the suburban areas of Dakar.11

3.4     The FY07-10 Country Assistance Strategy had a pillar supporting improvement of
the quality of life through "improved access to water and sanitation" (page vii). The
ongoing Water and Sanitation Millennium Project, approved in June 2010 focuses on
expanding water and sanitation delivery in the rural areas. The recently-approved
Country Partnership Strategy for Senegal for the period FY13-17 continued to focus on
improving access to potable water and sanitations services in urban and rural areas under
one of the two Country Partnership Strategy pillars devoted to improving service delivery
in general. The Government sought the grant resources to pursue the unfinished agenda
of increased delivery of sanitation services in the Dakar suburbs because the focus of
other donors and Government’s efforts had been shifted toward improving water and
sanitation in the rural areas.

3.5      Relevance of Design was Modest. The project design, which included
components that supported output-based subsidies for the construction of on-site
sanitation facilities, and related monitoring mechanisms were consistent with part of the
stated objective, which was to increase access to on-site sanitation for households living
in Dakar region. However, the sustainability of sanitation access, specified in the
objective was not supported with any specific components. The project did not include
institutional arrangements or mechanisms for proper maintenance and management of the
facilities built under the project. While there was a component that supported monitoring
and evaluation, it focused on audits, environmental, and social impact, and neglected the
tracking of the sustainability of the sanitation facilities.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

3.6     Design: The Project Appraisal Document did not have a results framework, but
the project's monitoring and evaluation framework was designed to monitor contributions
paid, sanitation facilities built, and payments made. The Project followed the Output-
Based Aid Framework, which gave prominence to non-governmental organizations and

3.7     Implementation: Representatives of non-governmental organizations and
community-based organizations visited the target areas to collect contributions from
households joining the Project against receipts. A contractor then had to visit
participating households to determine what type of facility could be built at each site, and
build them.

3.8     Because of the complexity of implementation arrangements and delay in
launching the project, it was difficult to get information tracking daily progress of the
project during the first phase of the project. Following project restructuring, bimonthly
meetings and systematic reporting improved and provided closer monitoring of
contributions collected, sanitation facilities built and payments made to contractors.

3.9      M&E Utilization: After project restructuring, project implementation data and
information started to reach implementing agencies, and were used to better plan project
activities. The availability of specific data (broken down by area and type of facility)
resulted in more focused and targeted interventions and communication campaigns.

Implementation
3.10 The project was approved on July 7, 2007 and the original closing date was
February 28, 2010. The project went through level two restructuring in February 2010 to
extend the closing date by nearly two years, to December 31, 2011.

IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE

3.11 Implementation arrangements were complex. As illustrated in the figure 13
attached in Annex B, there were at least five echelons separating the PIU and the
beneficiaries. While each echelon of the arrangements can conceptually be justified to
ensure project execution and its monitoring and evaluation, the set-up turned up to be
cumbersome and bureaucratic during project implementation. At the time of restructuring
in February 2010, only 10 percent of the sanitation facilities had been built and during the
last 22 months, the remaining 90 percent of the sanitation facilities were built.

3.12 Project restructuring expanded the geographic coverage of the project from five to
21 neighborhoods, the number and type of facilities offered, reduced the beneficiary
contributions and introduced an in-kind contribution formula, and strengthened behavior
change activities to stimulate demand for the facilities. Beneficiary survey results have
shown that 88.6 percent of respondents were satisfied with the procedure for allocating
the facilities, while other beneficiaries were not satisfied because the work could not be
started immediately after payment of financial contribution, or there were coordination
issues among key involved institutions.

PROJECT COSTS

3.13 At appraisal, the project was estimated to be US$7.32 million but the actual cost
was US$6.35 million because the target was reduced from providing 15,100 sanitation
facilities, to 12,100 at restructuring. US$5.12 million (79 percent) was funded by
GPOBA and the remaining US$1.23 million (19 percent) was funded by the borrower
which included the government and household contributions.

SAFEGUARDS AND FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE

3.14 The project was classified as Category B under OP/BP 4.01 Environmental
Assessment because of potentially adverse environmental impacts. Environmental and
Social Assessments and related plans were prepared and found to be in compliance with
the Bank's safeguards policies. However the ICR reported that absence of qualified
personnel limited the effectiveness of social and environmental safeguard measures
adopted during project implementation.

3.15 The project had a complex financial management system related to budget,
accounting, flow of funds, financial reporting, and internal controls. Because these
practices were new, performance in financial reporting became satisfactory only in the
final months of the project. All project disbursements were cleared by the World Bank,
and AGETIP, under the supervision of ONAS, handled procurement well because of its
long experience with Bank funded projects.

Achievement of the Objective
Objective: To increase access to on-site sanitation for households living in the Dakar
region in a sustainable manner. Rated Modest

3.16 Efficacy of this project was assessed based on two outcome measures included in
this objective: (i) increased access to on-site sanitation; and (ii) sustainability of such
access.

OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES

   Increased Access

3.17 The project supported the construction of 11,495 facilities which provided
improved on-site sanitation access to 103,450 persons in the Dakar region. While the
original target of constructing 15,100 facilities set at appraisal was not met, the revised
target of 12,100 facilities set at project restructuring was almost met because the project
picked up and made significant progress during the final years of implementation.

3.18 The largest number of on-site sanitation facilities constructed under the project
was wastewater disposal, followed by mixed facilities, and excreta disposal. The excreta
disposal option had a lower than expected demand. This was possibly because the project
ended up supporting the neighborhoods that already had excreta disposal facilities, and
initially targeted poorer neighborhoods were flooded, precluding construction.

3.19 It also appears that the initial identification of preferred facilities was not
determined by the genuine needs of beneficiaries, but rather by the administrative
allocation made at the project design and the capacity for beneficiaries to provide the
financial contribution. In a survey completed by ONAS, the demand was higher for
wastewater disposal facilities (47.8 percent), and the mixed facilities (33.7 percent),
compared to the demand for standalone excreta disposal facilities (1.1 percent)12. But this

survey may have been conducted in those neighborhoods where excreta disposal facilities
already existed. Moreover, the excreta disposal facilities were eventually beyond the
purchasing power of the identified beneficiaries.

3.20 While the project had intended to target the poor, such mechanisms were not
developed fully, and therefore ineffective targeting and allocation procedures allowed
well-off households to benefit as much, if not more, from the project impact. The design
was also tentative in the identification of the nature and the number of the facilities to be
built with the grant resources, and the restructuring was also used to modify the
combination of facilities to be built, which put more emphasis on mixed facilities.

      Sustainability

3.21 The beneficiary feedback on project sustainability was collected through two
surveys completed respectively in December 2011 by National Sanitation Office, ONAS,
and in May 2014 by IEG.14 These surveys confirmed that the majority if the beneficiaries
were paying attention to maintaining the facilities in good standing. There were 88
percent of positive responses in the first survey confirming that the facilities were
maintained in a satisfactory manner, against 12 percent of negative responses. The second
survey revealed that 64 percent of beneficiaries were cleaning the facilities on a daily
basis and 7 percent of them at least once a week. Regarding the functionality, the first
survey found that 88 percent of respondents were using the facilities, against 82 percent
during the second survey in 2014.

3.22 Sanitation: For the categories of facilities (47 percent of total) that had to be
connected to the semi-collective sanitation system, their sustainability was to be
dependent upon the success of the management system supervised and subsidized by
ONAS. On their part, the households need to maintain the facilities that have been built


13. (i) Excreta disposal only included septic tanks and pour-flush toilets and soak-away pit, (ii) Wastewater
disposal facilities were composed of washing facility and soak-away pit, and shower with soak-away pit,
and (iii) Mixed facilities were a combination of a wastewater disposal facility and pour-flush toilets, and a
shower with a soak-away pit.
14. Methodology, limitations, and the questionnaire of the IEG survey are detailed in Annex C and D.
                                                  30


and empty their intercepting tanks, which were described as low-effort and low-cost for
most of the types of facilities built under the project. Due to financial difficulties, ONAS
has not yet deployed sufficient resources to operate the collection and disposal facilities
optimally.

3.23 A sanitation surcharge of US$0.05/m3 is levied by SDE on behalf of ONAS on
water customers in all cities with a sewer network. The surcharge represents six percent
of the water bill for households using 50 m3 per month of water and five percent for those
using more than 50 m3 per month15. Revenues generated by this surcharge are insufficient
to finance ONAS operations and maintain sewerage and drainage networks. As a
consequence, ONAS had experienced a XOF 484 million deficit in 1998, which deepened
further to reach XOF 1,141 billion or about 20 percent of total revenue in 2012.
Achieving financial sustainability of ONAS and finding means to devote resources for
on-site sanitation promotion and development remains a major challenge for the sub-
sector.

3.24 Drainage: A portion of the property tax was identified by the Government as one
of the resources that local governments should transfer to ONAS, through the equipment
fund for municipalities, to finance operation and maintenance of drainage facilities.
However, these resources expected from the municipalities were never made available to
ONAS. As a result, operation and maintenance of drainage facilities in Dakar remain
problematic. This situation was compounded by a confusing division of responsibilities
between the municipalities and ONAS where municipalities are expected to provide
resources for services for which they are not accountable.

IMPACTS

3.25 According to the first survey in 2011, 94.5 percent of the women were satisfied
with the utilization of the facilities because they are the most involved in the household
chores requiring the use of those facilities. Old people and handicapped persons used the
facilities the least because most facilities were not well adapted to their needs. The
survey also found that the facilities were used by neighbors in 10 percent of the
beneficiary households; but this level has reached a higher level of 75 percent in the 2014
survey. Finally, impact on the women’s work was overall positive, with 94 percent of
respondents confirming that the facilities helped to alleviate the work of women, and to
improve the work conditions of the women.

3.26 The impact on the health costs of households was positive in both surveys, having
decreased for 56 percent of respondents in the first survey and for 69 percent in the
second survey. Beneficiaries in both surveys stated that the facilities gave positive impact
on their life standards in the proportion of 77 percent of respondents in the first survey
against 69 percent in the second survey (see Figure 9 below). With regards to the impact
on living standards, both surveys confirmed that over 60 percent of respondents
acknowledged improvements due to the facilities.




15. The threshold was reduced to 40 m3 in September 2014, and the surcharge was also revised upward.

Efficiency
3.27 The economic analysis carried out at appraisal was based on the previous IDA-
financed program, “On-Site Sanitation for Peri-Urban Communities in Dakar”, which
closed in 2009, and the EIRR was estimated to be 20 percent using primarily the
estimated health related benefits.

3.28 At project closure, the EIRR was not calculated because pre-project and post-
project benefits could not be accurately determined given the recent completion of the
sanitation facilities. Besides, assessments of the health benefits of sanitation were
difficult to quantify, because it was not clear that the observed benefits in a project
intervention area were due solely to improved sanitation. As a result, a cost-effectiveness
analysis was carried out at project closure to assess the effectiveness of the unit costs of
each technological choice, and it showed that construction of a sewerage system would
have cost at least twice as much as what was spent on constructing individual or
condominium sanitation facilities. In addition, the two beneficiary surveys showed that
there were other economic benefits gained from project interventions, including reduced
money spent on healthcare expenses resulting from unsanitary practices, and time saved
especially for women.

3.29 While the selection of the technology choice supported under the project has been
demonstrated to be cost-effective and other project benefits were identified, the project
efficiency was affected by delays in project implementation due to the severe floods in
2007 and 2008, leading to nearly one-third of the project facilities being constructed in
the last three months. In addition, about 12 percent of respondents of the IEG survey in
May 2014 declared that the facilities funded by the project were no longer functional
because the capacity of the semi-collective networks connecting septic tanks to multiple
                                             32


households was too small, and some facilities were built with defective materials.
Implementation delays resulted also from the heavy bureaucracy.

3.30   On balance, the project efficiency is rated as modest.

Ratings
OUTCOME

3.31 Based on the high relevance of objective, modest relevance of design, and mixed
achievement of the project's results, and modest efficiency, the overall outcome is rated
as moderately unsatisfactory.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

3.32 The sanitation facilities were built according to a simple design and need only
regular maintenance, which involves no expenses other than excreta removal costs for
half of the facilities. Three sludge treatment facilities operated by the national sanitation
agency provide services to collect and treat waste from septic tanks. The Gates
Foundation has provided US$10.8 million to reduce the cost of sludge removal for poor
households in Dakar. Other donors including France, European Union, European
Investment Bank, Islamic Bank, and African Development Bank are following the
developments in Senegal’s water and sanitation sector, and are expressing their interest to
provide support to enhance urban sanitation. However, since the Government has not
updated its sector strategy since 2005, the donors are handicapped by the absence of a
recent plan for the sector outlining the roadmap on the way forward and the level and
type of the required support.

3.33 The failure by the government to ensure financial sustainability for the water and
sanitation sector has deprived the sanitation sector with resources. Currently, due to
financial constraints, ONAS, the implementing agency has not yet deployed sufficient
resources to strengthen the sceptic tanks of the condominiums, and to upgrade the waste
water treatment plants. This could be a threat to the maintenance of the condominium
sewerage systems. Because of the lack of sector strategy and uncertainties with regards to
the maintenance of sanitation sector, risk to development outcomes is rated as high.

BANK PERFORMANCE

Quality at Entry

3.34 Quality of entry was moderately unsatisfactory because the GPOBA procedures
were complex and the implementation arrangements were cumbersome. Instead of
conducting an assessment of the capacity and willingness of households to pay for
sanitation services, the Project adopted the same household contribution levels as those
used under the Sanitation Program in the suburban areas. This resulted in delays in
project implementation and necessitated a level two project restructuring to remedy this
situation in 2010.
                                             33


3.35 At project approval, the geographical scope for the project support was imprecise
and tentative, and could not be finalized until the restructuring phase. Similarly,
beneficiary neighborhoods and categories of facilities were not clearly identified during
the project design. Project implementation could have been faster with an increased and
clearer targeting of beneficiary neighborhoods and households, and a better specification
of the facilities to be delivered to the potential beneficiaries.

3.36 The GPOBA procedures were complex and not suited to rapid project
implementation, which resulted in nearly one-third of the project facilities being
constructed in the last three months of the Project, though floods were also a factor in the
delay. In particular, GPOBA financial mechanisms were not appropriate to work with
the AGETIP, as the latter could not get advance resources to launch the project on time.

3.37 About two years after the project approval, the project could not start because it
was not ready for implementation. As indicated earlier, implementation arrangements
were heavy and not straightforward. There were more than five echelons of
intermediaries between the national sanitation agency and the beneficiaries of sanitation
facilities. Relationships among the multiple intermediaries were unclear, and in the end,
they were not effective in solving the two key issues: effective oversight, and financial
sustainability of the sanitation system. There was a mismatch between the limited amount
of resources and the scope of the project and the overwhelming institutional framework
for its implementation.

Quality of Supervision

3.38 Quality of supervision is rated moderately unsatisfactory, because the
supervision was neglected during the first phase of the project, and the increased
supervision that took place after the project restructuring did not address the key
impediments related to the sustainability of the results. During the second phase, the
project Task Team Leader was based in the region and maintained an ongoing dialogue
with the various stakeholders, organized monitoring sessions, organized specific missions
on the fiduciary aspects of financial management and procurement. Bank staff provided a
useful interface between the client and the Bank disbursement department in charge of
disbursements. However, the supervision was limited to making sure that the outputs are
generated, but did not bring the dialogue with the client to address the key issues
besetting the sustainability of the facilities that were being built was inadequate. As a
consequence, the setting up of an efficient oversight framework of the sanitation system
was not done, and measures to resolve the funding problem of the sanitation system in a
sustainable manner were not adopted.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

Government Performance

3.39 Government performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. The
government had the opportunity to learn from the Long Term Water Sector Project under
implementation, and identify and resolve key bottle necks that are preventing the
sustainability in the sanitation sub-sector. Instead of identifying the right ministry to
                                             34


oversee the project, the institutional setting was ineffective and was not improved, and
the issues over the financial impasse were not addressed effectively.

3.40 The Government could have invested more in having the project ready for
implementation. It is only after two years when the project could not start that the
Government deployed efforts to overcome obstacles, including the pledge of about
US$200,000 to ease the burden on those beneficiaries having difficulty in paying their
contributions.

Implementing Agency Performance:

3.41 Implementing agency performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. The
key implementing agencies for this project were ONAS, the National Sanitation Agency
of Senegal and AGETIP, the Public Works Implementing Agency. Since the
Government policy to minimize sanitation taxes limited the budget for ONAS, it had
difficulty carrying out its responsibilities to properly oversee the sanitation sub-sector and
project activities. This poor financial situation precluded the hiring of competent staff and
essential studies and needed infrastructure.

3.42 AGETIP is generally an effective agency with qualified staff, with a long
experience of delivering completed works. However, it could not anticipate major
procurement delays due to the introduction of a new procurement code, and it could not
figure out the complications and specificities of the arrangements governing the
disbursements of project resources. This resulted in nearly one-third of the facilities being
constructed in the last three months of the Project.

3.43 Eventually, AGETIP spent months to decipher the project's complex financial
management system, particularly aspects related to the budget, accounting, fluidity of
funds, financial reporting, and internal controls. After project restructuring, these
problems were clarified and financial management became satisfactory in the final
months of the project.

3.44 The performance of implementing agencies was also worsened by the plethora of
other intermediaries in the project execution, including the consulting firms, the
construction companies, the NGOs/Community-Based Organizations, the technical
auditor and the financial auditor. There was a mismatch between the modest project
amount, and the array of intermediaries for its implementation.

Lessons Learned
3.45 Premature cessation of donor engagement could lead to a loss in momentum
for major sector reform. The Government of Senegal had high ownership of the
adopted a strategy (1995 and 2005) in the water and sanitation sector but this has recently
waned. Through sustained commitment of IDA, the Bank was able to (i) play a catalytic
role in leveraging investment funding from other donors; (ii) smooth friction and bring a
cooperative spirit; and (iii) provide continuous support to the full execution of contractual
and regulatory obligations. However, the IEG mission found that the Bank and the donor
community have recently shifted their focus away from the relatively well performing
                                                   35


urban water and sanitation, to rural water and sanitation sector. As a result, the
Government slowed down on its reform agenda, as evidenced by the absence of an
updated water sector policy and non-compliance of the lease contract with the private
operator, potentially losing the momentum generated to sustain earlier reforms.

3.46 Benefits of water investments may not be realized without adequate attention
to sanitation. Recognizing the existence of a comprehensive and integrated approach to
sanitation, evidenced by Senegal’s urban sanitation strategy which was based on the
diversification of technologies, the assessment found that more resources and more
attention were devoted to water production and distribution at the expense of the
sanitation sub-sector in Senegal. This finding is reflected in the mismatch between the
sanitation infrastructure and the country’s needs, and the lack of solutions to set up
sustainable approaches to manage public and semi-public sewerage networks and
wastewater treatment plants. According to the interviews carried out during the IEG
mission, the supply of increased urban water facilitated by the Bank’s project had led to
major pressure on the existing sewerage infrastructure. As the imbalance between the
water and sanitation investments and reforms persists, sanitation conditions may worsen,
leading to unhealthy conditions and increasing risks of water-borne diseases to the
population that benefitted from water services.

3.47 Raising tariffs only for one customer group may not be effective for ensuring
long term sustainability. Since 2006, the water tariff for the private consumers had
been frozen by the Government in contradiction to the lease agreement prescribing
annual water price adjustments in line with the inflation.16 In contrast, while the tariffs
increased for the public sector entities, the exploding bills were only partially paid by the
government and, as a result, arrears often accumulated and as a consequence, there were
limited resources available to fund the sector’s major financial needs. In the absence of
steady tariff increases, the sector risks a declining quality of the infrastructure and
services.

3.48 Determining the right threshold of the beneficiary contribution is vital for
the successful delivery of peri-urban sanitation services. The peri-urban sanitation
component faced serious start-up problems because the required household contribution
was perceived to be too high, and the large-scale NGOs involved in outreach activities
were not able to communicate and work efficiently with the beneficiaries. Modification
of beneficiary contribution from 50 to 25 percent of the facility cost, and shifting of
outreach responsibilities to community-based organizations, increased beneficiary
participation in the on-site and the semi-collective sanitation program.

3.49 Complex management and institutional arrangements lead to
implementation delays. The procedures for Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid
(GPOBA) were complex and implementation arrangements were cumbersome. Obstacles
to rapid project implementation were not promptly identified and removed during trust
fund negotiation and processing. The payment schedules mandated by the GPOBA
approach were overly complex, and the Project Team took a long time to get used to the

16. The mission was informed that the Government finally decided to increase the tariffs in September
2014.
                                             36


Trust Fund procedures, leading to delays in launching and implementing the project,
causing delays in proper establishment of sustainability enhancing measures. The lesson
from this experience is the importance of identifying the institutional issues early and
simplifying the management and implementation arrangements to avoid delays in project
implementation. It is also important to weight the transaction costs associated with the
funding size of GPOBA, and the institutional viability of such approach compared to a
larger, project scale initiative that is more integrated with the government program.

 Annex C. Methodological Approach of the GPOBA
 Beneficiary Survey
Introduction
As part of the PPAR exercise, the IEG field mission aimed to obtain feedback from the
beneficiaries of the sanitation facilities provided by the GPOBA project through a survey.
This survey was conducted as a pilot, using an ICT device and a team headed by a senior
statistician five university students in Senegal. The team interviewed a random sample of 400
households using a questionnaire (Annex D) that was pre-loaded on an electronic device.

Limitation
The number of constructed facilities was reported to be 11,495, but detailed information such
as the type of structure, names of the beneficiaries, their identification card numbers,
neighborhood, and geographic coordinates, were only available for 2,999 facilities. For the
purposes of this survey, feedback was received from a random sample from these 2,999
facilities.

Sample Size
Considering the homogeneity of facilities in the different areas, a maximum threshold and
pessimistic risk of non-response error equal to 50 percent of respondents were assumed. This
leads to a sample size equal to 400 individuals, corresponding to a margin of error of 5
percent.

Size Distribution of the Sample
Relying on administrative criteria, standards of living, and geographic location, communities
affected by the project were grouped into three areas: (i) urban: Wakam and Yoff; (ii)
suburban: Mbao Keur Massar, Sebikhotane / Diamniadio Diamaguène-Sicap Mbao, Malika,
Yeumbeul; (iii) and rural: Pout, Sangalkam, Yène. To select a representative random sample
of project beneficiaries, a stratified random sampling method was applied to ensure
representative samples for each of the eight zoning areas.

Drawing of Beneficiaries to be surveyed
A random drawing (using Excel) was applied on the list of beneficiary communities to
survey. This generated the list of recipients according to the number found from the method
of allocation (see table below).17




17. Taking into account the homogeneity within each of the three areas and for reasons of time and optimization
of resources, data collection was conducted in the following representative locations: i) urban: Wakam; (ii)
suburban: Keur Massar, Sebikotane / Diamniadio Diamaguène-Sicap Mbao, Malika, Yeumbeul; (iii) rural:
Sangalkam.
