a more effective flow of information between\n            university libraries which service teaching and research.\n            The project will include specialized equipment to be\n            financed by the Bank to be allocated to support: (a)\n            secondary science education centers; (b) undergraduate\n            science education; and (c) a university library network. The\n            government will finance complementary inputs related to\n            making the equipment operational and maintaining it\n            thereafter. The government will also finance staff training\n            connected with libraries' computerization."}, "docdt": "1992-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
