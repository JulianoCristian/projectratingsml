Some lessons learned included: greater attention\n            is required early in the project cycle to resettlement\n            issues for a project's affected population. Involuntary\n            resettlement is an integral part of project design and\n            should be dealt with from the earliest stages of project\n            preparation. In this project, there is clear evidence of the\n            limited focus early on to the issue of resettlement, which\n            led to delays in project implementation, an excessive cost\n            overrun, and distrust on the part of the affected families.\n            The Bank has now institutionalized early assessments as well\n            as broader policies for involuntary resettlement, and the\n            Government also has placed resettlement planning at a more\n            prominent level in the country's dam planning. Quality\n            at entry is paramount for project success. Clearly evident\n            in this project is the lack of quality at entry: there was\n            passive involvement by borrower during project preparation,\n            in part due to limited capacity, indicating limited\n            commitment and ownership; the project's magnitude was\n            not consistent with institutional capacities. Resettlement\n            particularly lends itself to active participation of\n            borrower and stakeholders but with the underestimation of\n            the affected population, participation of the stakeholders\n            was not actively pursued at the early stages of the project.\n            Rigorous analysis of project risks is required at early\n            phases of the project cycle. The institutional framework and\n            external environment are critical to a project's\n            success. In this project, a greater degree of certainty has\n            been conveyed than is warranted, hence overly optimistic\n            objectives/targets. More rigorous analysis of risks, such as\n            the implementing and financial capacity of borrower; and the\n            economic, social and environmental risks associated with\n            resettlement, should have been undertaken."}, "docdt": "1996-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
