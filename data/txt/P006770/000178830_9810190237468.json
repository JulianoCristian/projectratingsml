Guavio hydropower plant will be the\n            largest hydroelectric facility yet constructed in Colombia.\n            In addition to increasing the supply of renewable energy,\n            the Guavio Hydro Power Project will provide 15% of the\n            electricity needed in Colombia by 1988, a substantial part\n            of which will be for the city of Bogota, and its environs.\n            The project consists of: (a) river diversion, dam and\n            spillway tunnels; (b) intake and diversion of the Chivor and\n            Batatas Rivers into the Guavio reservoir; (c) pressure\n            tunnel, underground powerhouse and transformer caverns, and\n            tailrace tunnel; and (d) a 230 kV step-up substation at the\n            site, two double-circuit 230 kV transmission lines to\n            Bogota, and four 230 kV line bays at the Bogota 230 kV ring.\n            The project further includes construction of EEEB's\n            load dispatch and telecommunications center, which will\n            function as a regional satellite of the national dispatch\n            center under constrution by ISA. Also included is a study to\n            assist in adequately protecting the environment of the\n            Guavio River, and a training program. In connection with the\n            project, a substantial part of the sector will be\n            reorganized to improve its overall viability and efficiency."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
