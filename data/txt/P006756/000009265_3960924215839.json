Some of the\n            lessons learned from the project are: a) procurement of\n            goods and services has caused many delays in the past. The\n            standardization of bidding documents and procedures for\n            Bank-assisted projects in Colombia should accelerate the\n            procurement process in the future; b) as in almost all\n            Bank-assisted projects in Colombia, presentation to the Bank\n            of audited financial statements was always delayed by more\n            than eight months. The Bank must take strong action from the\n            beginning to ensure proper compliance with this condition of\n            the Loan Agreement; c) although the project had a good\n            Project Coordinator; he did not have a high rank within the\n            institution. Many issues could have been resolved early on\n            if the Project Coordinator had worked full-time on the\n            project and had had direct access to the General Manager;\n            and d) provision of technical assistance to project\n            beneficiaries proved to be expensive, mainly because it was\n            oriented to individual farmers rather than to groups of\n            farmers, but also because there was no link between\n            Instituto Colombiano de la Reforma Agraria (INCORA's)\n            extension service and Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario\n            (ICA's) service."}, "docdt": "1988-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
