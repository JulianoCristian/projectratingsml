main objectives of the Yangzhou\n            Thermal Power Project are to: (a) support power subsector\n            reforms at the provincial level, through development of\n            Jiangsu Provincial Electric Power Company (JPEPC) as an\n            autonomous company; (b) contribute to further\n            rationalization of power tariffs; (c) promote the use of\n            modern financial management techniques in transforming\n            JPEPC's accounting system; (d) provide cost-effective\n            and environmentally sustainable generation capacity to\n            alleviate an acute shortage of power and improve the quality\n            of the power supply; (e) assist in transferring modern\n            technologies for large coal-fired power plants, and in\n            strengthening institutional capabilities for environmental\n            management and monitoring; and (f) extend technical\n            assistance in management development and staff training\n            program. The project consists of: (a) construction of a\n            coal-fired thermal power plant with two 600-MW generating\n            units and associated equipment; (b) erection of two 500-kV\n            transmission lines (about 30 km long) and reinforcement of\n            the existing power transmission network; (c) provision of\n            engineering and construction management services; (d)\n            extension of technical assistance for the development and\n            implementation of improved accounting and financial\n            management information systems; (e) carrying out of\n            environmental management and resettlement programs; and (f)\n            undertaking of management development and staff training."}, "docdt": "1994-02-23T00:00:00Z"}
