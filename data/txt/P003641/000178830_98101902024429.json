When\n            constructing and operating the transmission line from\n            Yangcheng to Jiangsu, more negative impacts are expected.\n            These measures mitigate them: To reduce noise, adopt\n            soundproofing measures, avoid working at night, and use a\n            protective enclosure (afforesting switchyards). This\n            protective barrier and the sprinkling of water will reduce\n            dust. Collect water used in the switchyard and substation,\n            and let it settle before discharging and reusing it. Treat\n            sewage before discharging it. Replant trees to replenish\n            forests. Replace the vegetal cover. Return land to farm use\n            and pay compensation for agricultural land loss. Set up\n            protected sites when cultural relics are found. Educate\n            workers and nearby residents about power line safety. Pay\n            compensation for occupying land and resettle people with\n            improved public facilities and/or retrain them."}, "docdt": "1997-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
