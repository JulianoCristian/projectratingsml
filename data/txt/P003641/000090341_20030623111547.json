Yangzhou\n            Thermal Power Project were as follows: the outcome was\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was highly likely, the\n            institutional development impact was substantial, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the borrower performance\n            was highly likely. The lessons learned indicated that a\n            gradual, realistic approach to major structural change in\n            the power sector towards greater market orientation tailored\n            to country condition and incentives, can be very effective\n            in creating a solid foundation from which to launch\n            accelerated reforms. A clear, long-term vision for the power\n            sector combined with a baseline of achievable actions and\n            strategic flexibility in supervision can allow the project\n            to advance sector reform when the opportunity arises.\n            Resettlement involving a change in lifestyle requires a\n            higher participatory effort in impact and compensation\n            assessment. Initially there was an underestimation of\n            compensation for populations resettled from rural areas to\n            the town center. The approach of combining policy dialogue\n            at the Central Government level with the testing of the\n            policy through operations in selected provincial power\n            companies was a key element in successful project outcome.\n            Given the enormous size of the country-with several tiers of\n            government and varying issues among the\n            regions/provinces-the pilot testing of reform ideas on model\n            projects before moving to broad applicability, has been a\n            prudent and successful approach. A high sense of\n            environmental awareness and ownership by implementing\n            agencies and concerned authorities and detailed\n            Environmental Management Plan are required to produce highly\n            satisfactory environmental results. The introduction of\n            international competitive bidding and multiple suppliers\n            along with substantial local contracting can reduce costs\n            but requires close interfacing of engineering design parameters."}, "docdt": "2003-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
