Several\n            lessons reinforce once again the need for simple, clear\n            project design (focusing on fewer interventions would have\n            been further beneficial); for strong implementing\n            units' capacity (weak capacity at the provincial, and\n            district levels was evident); for well defined\n            implementation arrangements (particularly as it regards\n            staff training, and technical assistance (TA)); and, for\n            monitoring, and evaluation criteria, to be established\n            during preparation. Moreover, key sectoral issues, i.e.,\n            effective incentive systems, and laying the ground for\n            successful public-private partnerships, were not adequately\n            addressed. Notwithstanding, the prevailing weak\n            institutional capacity, and lack of interventions, did raise\n            awareness, among health personnel, and decision makers,\n            namely, on the quality assurance program of the Special\n            Assistance Fund, and on family doctors experience, which\n            lead to the \"substantial\" rating of institutional\n            development impacts. And, indeed, the good quality assurance\n            program not only improved the quality of care, but provided\n            empowerment, and \"best practices\", enabling staff\n            to reduce costs (e.g., reduction in drug uses as a result of\n            the rationalized drugs utilization). However, quality\n            improvements, and services utilization should be further\n            reviewed, while health center managers need further training\n            and TA, and, drug management needs renewed efforts at the\n            facility level."}, "docdt": "2001-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
