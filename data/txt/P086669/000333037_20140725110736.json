Investment Planning Project for Croatia\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the simple and flexible project design allowed for needed\n            adjustments, which resulted in achievement of project\n            development objectives despite initial delays. Even given\n            inherent difficulties with having a project implemented by\n            civil servants in line government agencies, building strong\n            public sector capacity is worth the effort as it is more\n            sustainable. Time for this type of capacity building needs\n            to be incorporated into project design from the outset.\n            Projects contemplating a huge legislative and institutional\n            transformation should plan considerable time for stakeholder\n            consultations and appropriately back-load funding and\n            disbursements. A streamlined, context-tailored results\n            framework is essential to guide implementation and measure\n            results. Potential difficulties with (often contentious)\n            procurement of medical and/or ICT equipment of large volumes\n            or high complexity should never be underestimated; intensive\n            efforts are needed from the outset to ensure sufficient\n            technical capacity and specialized skills to make it happen\n            on a timely basis and at a good quality level."}, "docdt": "2014-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
