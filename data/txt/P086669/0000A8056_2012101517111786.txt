                         This ISR reflects the findings of the implementation support mission conducted from September 3 to 7, 2012. The project has continued a steady progress toward the Project
                         Development Objectives. The number of County Institute of Emergency Medical Services (CIEMS) fully operational and reporting data has increased from 13 to 18, including Zagreb
                         (the remaining 3 are expected to be functional by October 2012). Two additional hospital EMS Departments and Emergency Services have been established, reaching 5, and
                         another will be established by December 2012. The contract for the Geographic Information System (GIS) for the Public Health Institute was signed. Procurement process is
                         launched for supporting 11 more hospital EMS Departments and Emergency Services. This will result in a total of 19 hospital EMS Departments and Emergency Services with
