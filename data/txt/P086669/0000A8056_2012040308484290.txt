                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Despite significant delays since project effectiveness (January 15, 2009), which caused the postponement of the Mid-term review (MTR) exercise by six months, there is noticeable
                         progress in the implementation of key project activities contributing to the achievement of the Project Development Objectives (PDOs). Some key results that are worth mentioning
                         are:
                          i)      The Croatian Institute for Emergency Medical Services, CIEMS (responsible for national standards of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) delivery) has been established
                         and is functioning.

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                       Report No: ISR5144



                          ii)     13 out of 21 CIEMS in the counties are now fully functional (remaining 8 are expected to be functional by June 2012);
                          iii)    The specialization in Emergency Medicine has been established at the Medical Faculty. Emergency Medicine Technicians have been recognized as medical first responders
                         to address critical staffing needs. Rulebooks on the education and skills necessary for EMS workers have been adopted.
                          iv)     A new standardized Index for Emergency Medical Assistance developed and intensive training on its utilization launched;

                          v)      128 fully equipped ambulances and equipment for EMS delivered; Training materials and equipment for the Croatian Institute for Emergency Medicine received;
                          vi)     3 hospital EMS Departments and Emergency Services established.
                          vii)    Five priority project proposals, consistent with the sector strategy, are under development as part of the capacity building activity for use of European Union funds.

                         As a result of this progress all the 5 PDO indicators are well on track and most of them exceeded the expected goal for the MTR. Nevertheless, not all the CIEMs and hospital EMS
                         Departments are fully operational and reporting data. While there were almost no disbursements until September 2011, the disbursement level has now reached over 33 percent of
                         total Project loan and further disbursement of an additional EURO 3.4 million is expected within a few weeks, bringing the total disbursements to 52 percent of total loan proceeds.
