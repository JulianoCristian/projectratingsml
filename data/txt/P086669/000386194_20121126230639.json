Development of the Emergency Medical Services and Investment\n            Planning Project for Croatia is to improve the efficiency\n            and outcomes of the emergency medical services system and to\n            strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Health and social\n            welfare to develop and implement strategic projects. This\n            closing date for project will be extended from June 30, 2013\n            until December 31, 2013. Despite initial delays to develop\n            the new legal framework related to the new framework for the\n            emergency service, the project has continued a steady\n            progress toward achieving the Project Development Objectives\n            (PDO), which is rated as satisfactory. With respect to the\n            first PDO (to improve the efficiency and outcome of the\n            emergency medical services system), a legal framework has\n            been implemented by the Government. The six-month extension\n            is necessary to implement the Geographic Information System\n            (GIS) for the Public Health Institute for which a contract\n            was recently signed. The procurement process for the\n            development of the GIS for the National Public Health\n            Institute took longer than expected (11 months). Two main\n            factors contributed to this: (a) due to the nature of the\n            products, the bidders requested seven rounds of\n            clarifications; and (b) the bid evaluation report required\n            several clarifications from our technical team. Finally, now\n            that the contract is signed, implementation is in progress\n            with an expected completion date of November 2013. This will\n            be the first extension of the project. The requirements have\n            been met: (i) the project objectives are achievable; (ii)\n            the performance of the borrower and other project\n            implementing agencies is satisfactory; and (iii) the\n            borrower has developed an action plan to complete the\n            project. There are no outstanding audits for this project."}, "docdt": "2012-11-21T00:00:00Z"}
