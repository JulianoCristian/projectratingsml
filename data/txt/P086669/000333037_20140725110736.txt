1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country Background. Croatia’s economy performed relatively well during the post-
war period from 1995, with government policies focused on successfully negotiating
accession to the European Union (EU), which Croatia joined on July 1, 2013. Despite solid
growth and low inflation before 2008, Croatia still faced challenges in achieving sustainable
growth and improving welfare of its citizens. It remained important to reduce the state’s
share in the overall economy and fiscal deficit in order to foster private sector productivity
and competitiveness as well as public sector efficiency and effectiveness.

2.      Sector Background. Since the early 1990s, the Croatian health system underwent
significant changes, but challenges remained in terms of both efficiency and financial
sustainability. The Health Care Law of 1993 consolidated the health financing system under
the Croatia Institute for Health Insurance (HZZO), following a social insurance model based
on the principles of solidarity and universality. Croatia fared relatively well on health
outcomes, though with the results achieved at a high cost and the health insurance fund
facing growing deficits. The generous benefits and exemptions established during the growth
years were politically difficult to roll back, and the complementary health insurance system
was not able to modulate unnecessary demand for health care. The main challenge in the
medium term was to maintain and improve health outcomes while stabilizing state health
spending consistent with a sound fiscal policy framework. Three observations suggested that
additional actions were required to improve the functioning of the health system: (i) the gap
with the more developed EU economies was still large, e.g., Standardized Death Rate (SDR)
associated with Motor Vehicle Accidents (MVAs) was 30 percent higher, and SDRs related
to all causes was 22 percent higher; (ii) health outcomes were achieved at a relatively high
cost for the state; and (iii) the upward pressures on spending were likely to continue due to
increasing trends in pharmaceutical spending, technological progress, and aging of the
population.

3.      On the demand side, the instruments commonly used to deter excessive utilization of
health services were not well established in Croatia. Thus, Croatia's share of co-payments in
total health expenditure was less than one percent. The policy of a flat administrative fee/co-
payment at a minimal amount of 5 Kuna per person with a cap of 30 Kuna per person per
month introduced in 2005 was reversed in 2008 because of new policies being considered to
modulate demand. In addition, the statutory co-payments regulated by the health insurance
law were exempted for a large share of the population. HZZO estimated that the revenues
foregone as a result of co-payment exemptions amounted to about 0.4 percent of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) in 2004.

4.     On the supply side, the challenges in health care provision related to the
organizational structure of inpatient and outpatient care, payment mechanisms, and the
adequacy of emergency medical services provision. Specifically: (i) the delivery system
based on extended inpatient care treatment was not addressing the health needs of the
population (average length of stay remained close to 11 days compared to the EU average of
about eight days); (ii) the hospital payment system did not offer incentives to contain

                                              1
spending (instead, the mix of case-based and bed-day system created the motivation for high
occupancy and longer stays); (iii) the system provided few incentives to support gate-keeping
functions of general practitioners (GPs); (iv) the uneven distribution of Emergency Medical
Services (EMS) resulted in unequal access across counties, inefficient spending, and sub-
optimal outcomes. In addition, the pre-hospital EMS teams faced multiple demands for non-
emergency situations, 1 with the overall emergency calls estimated at less than 15 percent of
the total number of calls. Furthermore, Croatia was behind other countries in the creation of
an EMS specialty and, contrary to the European trends, still maintained emergency reception
areas (ERA) as part of the major inpatient departments. The latter caused the ambulance
crews to look for the most appropriate ERA for their patients, presumably contributing to the
higher death rates compared to other European countries, especially for ischemic heart
disease and MVA.

5.      A multipronged approach with reforms on both the demand for and supply of health
services was required to overhaul the health sector and close the gap with EU member states.
Supported by a World Bank Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL) program, in 2006 the
Government of Croatia (GOC) adopted a new health insurance law that set a stricter benefit
package, limited exemptions, and introduced two drug lists: essential drugs without co-
payments and those with co-payments, with the co-pay coverage eliminated under the
complementary health insurance. The GOC also initiated structural reforms in the provider
payment mechanisms and supply of services. As part of the latter, the EMS reform was
intended as the first stage in restructuring the supply of services, to be complemented with
changes in the organization and financing of Primary Health Care (PHC) and a broader
restructuring of health facilities.

6.       Country Partnership Strategy and Rationale for Bank Assistance. The Bank’s
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Croatia at the time of project preparation included the
objectives of “sustaining macroeconomic stability” and “improving the quality and efficiency
in the social sectors”. 2 Contributing to these, the Development of Emergency Medical
Services and Investment Planning Project (DEMSIPP) objectives aligned well with the
country’s overarching priority of entering the EU with a competitive economy and the
institutional capacity to meet the demands of membership. Specifically, the rationale for the
DEMSIPP stemmed from (i) the high relevance of an efficient EMS system to Croatia’s
tourism-dependent economy, its potential contribution to reductions in the relatively high
mortality rate from heart diseases and traumas, the broad consensus on the need to reform the
outdated EMS systems, and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare’s (MoHSW) 3 political
and technical readiness to initiate such a reform; (ii) the GOC’s request for Bank’s assistance
in the implementation of the National Health Strategy adopted in March 2006; 4 (iii) the

  The latter included out-of-hours non-emergency primary health care (PHC) services, outpatient services in
EMS clinics, and non-emergency transportation for kidney dialysis.

4
  The Strategy goals included (i) access; (ii) quality; (iii) effectiveness/efficiency; and (iv) economic
rationality. The overhaul of the EMS constituted an important element of the National Strategy and
provided the basis for the broadly shared vision and strategy to reform the EMS system.

timely complementarity of the DEMSIPP interventions with the then ongoing PAL
measures; 5 and (iv) the Bank’s unique experience in supporting new EU member-states and
accession countries through a mix of lending, technical assistance (TA), and policy dialogue
on broader aspects of health sector reform.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.     The PDO was to improve the efficiency and outcomes of the Emergency Medical
System and to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to
develop and implement strategic projects.

8.      The achievement of the PDO was to be measured by the following outcome
indicators as stated in the results framework (Annex 3) of the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD):

(i)     Improved internal efficiency demonstrated by an increase in field calls as percent of
        total EMS calls.
(ii)    Increased allocative efficiency indicated through a decrease in cross-county variation
        of EMS teams per capita.
(iii)   Improved emergency care outcomes as evidenced by (a) better outcomes in pre-
        hospital emergency care, as indicted by an increasing percentage of (a.i) major
        trauma and (a.ii) cardiac arrest cases which survive to hospital ER admission; and (b)
        better outcomes in in-hospital emergency care, as indicated by an increasing
        percentage of (b.i) major trauma and (b.ii) cardiac arrest cases which survive 48
        hours or more after arriving alive at the emergency reception area.6
(iv)    Improved capacity to prepare and implement strategic projects as measured by (i)
        number of projects prepared by the Ministry; (ii) Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA)
        Funds leveraged; and (iii) if accession to the EU occurs, the percentage of the
        Regional Development and Human Resource Development Funds targeted to health
        related investments.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

9.      The PDO was not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.     Project investments were intended to benefit the following:



5
  The PAL program supported health insurance reform policies to modulate unnecessary demand for care
while the DEMSIPP focused on restructuring the service supply.
6
  Per main text of the PAD (para 19), the intent was to measure improved outcomes for motor vehicle
accidents and ischemic heart disease cases. The measures are captured in PDO indicators 3 and 4 in the
datasheet. 7 The indicated amounts of IBRD financing as part of the total project cost excluded the
amounts of PPA refinancing and Front-end Fee (EUR 0.23 million and EUR 0.05 million, respectively).


                                                  3
    (a) Pre-hospital and in-hospital EMS providers, such as health centers—including those in
        remote areas—and hospitals in 21 counties, through improved institutional set-up and
        human resource capacity, modernized equipment and connectivity, and streamlined
        business processes;
    (b) The authorities of the 21 counties, through improved inter-regional equity in the state
        investments in EMS, enhanced geographical access to required services, and better
        efficiency and quality in the provision of EMS services to counties’ populations and
        tourists—including those in remote areas, leading to reduced mortality and increased
        Disability Adjusted Life Years;
    (c) The MoHSW, through its strengthened capacity in planning and implementing strategic
        projects, and in leveraging additional funding for the health sector;
    (d) The Croatian population (4.4 million at appraisal), through increased availability and
        quality of EMS services, including for the elderly and those with certain disabilities,
        but without increased costs to them.

1.5 Original Components

11.      The project included the following two components:

12.      Component 1: Development of Emergency Medical Services (EUR 90.51 million
total, of which IBRD financing was EUR 16.10 million7; 90.4 percent of IBRD financing)
supported four streams of activity.

13.    Sub-component 1: Establishment of a Croatian Institute for Emergency Medical
Services that would provide overall policy guidance, set national guidelines and standards for
EMS services in Croatia and monitor the system.

14.     Sub-component 2: Reorganization of pre-hospital EMS supported country-wide
implementation of the national guidelines for service organization and standards. This
included (i) the creation of dispatch centers at the local level and integration of EMS dispatch
with the 112 call centers; and (ii) upgrading human resources, renewing the EMS vehicle
feet, and updating medical equipment of the existing fleet.

15.      Sub-component 3: Integration of in-hospital EMS supported (i) the creation of
integrated emergency medical departments in 6 to 13 major hospitals; (ii) rehabilitation of the
selected facilities, including the supply of medical equipment; (iii) training and re-training of
staff; and (iv) the development and financing of the EMS specialization for physicians and
nurses.

16.    Sub-component 4: Development of telemedicine projects to support EMS reform
supported the extension of telemedicine services to the islands and other sites, including



7
  The indicated amounts of IBRD financing as part of the total project cost excluded the amounts of PPA
refinancing and Front-end Fee (EUR 0.23 million and EUR 0.05 million, respectively).


                                                  4
through the purchase and installation of telemedicine equipment for five consulting and 20
referral sites.

17.    Component 2: Institutional Support for Strategic Planning (EUR 2 million total, of
which IBRD financing was EUR 1.72 million; 9.6 percent of IBRD financing) included three
subcomponents.

18.     Sub-component 1: Developing Priority Programs focused on developing the
strategies and projects for investing EU funds in the health sector. Such priority programs
included a health facilities master plan, a human resources strategy, and investment projects
in e-health infrastructure.

19.     Sub-component 2: Capacity Building for Accessing EU Funds supported (i) an
assessment of needs and design of an office within the MoHSW to supervise planning and
implementation of programs financed with EU funds; (ii) learning exchanges with EU peers;
and (iii) training for the MoHSW, county-level and other staff in EU related investment
opportunities.

20.     Sub-component 3: Project Management supported the execution of the DEMSIPP.

1.6 Revised Components

21.     The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

22.     Changes to the project included reallocations of funds on two occasions; one
restructuring with an extension of closing date; and a cancellation of funds.

Reallocation 8

23.     The Loan amount originally allocated for the equipment upgrade of the existing
ambulance fleet and the estimated savings from other procurement across all categories under
both components 9 were reallocated to the procurement of new ambulances (EUR 8.87
million). The original GOC funding for the latter was constrained due to the cuts in
MoHSW’s capital budget in early 2009 stemming from the limited fiscal space in the
aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.




8
  Formal restructuring was not required due to the flexible project design reflected in the Loan Agreement
(see the section on Assessment of Project Design). Therefore, the MoHSW and Bank teams handled the
reallocations through adjustments to the Procurement Plan based on mutual agreement.
9
  EUR 3.95 million and EUR 4.92 million, respectively. The latter amount originated mainly from reduced
quantities of medical equipment for in-hospital EMS Departments and remote PHC Units.


                                                    5
24.     Subsequent significant savings and unutilized funds under both components 10 were
used to: (i) equip the five pre-existing hospital EMS departments and expand the total
number of integrated hospital EMS departments to 21; (ii) procure models for clinical skills
training and automatic external defibrillators (AED) not originally envisaged; (iii) expand the
training for dispatchers and pre-hospital teams; and (iv) complete the original TA activities
and initiate new ones. 11

Restructuring

25.      A level two restructuring 12 involving a six-month extension of the Loan closing date
from June 30, 2013 to December 31, 2013 took place in November 2012. The extension was
necessary mainly to implement the Geographical Information System (GIS) for the Croatian
Institute of Public Health (CIPH), but also to complete the initiated new TA activities.

Cancellation

26.     An undisbursed amount of EUR 1.19 million was cancelled as of May 7, 2014 as
residual savings from the procurement of additional TA and equipment, and lack of time to
launch and complete any new procurement. 13 Disbursement after the four-month grace
period amounted to EUR 16.91 million, or 93.4 percent of loan proceeds.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

27.      Project Preparation was supported by a Japanese Trust Fund Grant 14 for: (i) the
HZZO capacity building and stakeholder workshops to improve the health insurance system;
(ii) studies to identify priority public health interventions and quantify the potential benefits;


10
   The savings mainly resulted from the procurement of new ambulance vehicles and medical equipment
for EMS departments, with a decrease in prices in the context of recession. The unutilized funds stemmed
from: (i) the delay in implementing the national EMS information system and adoption by several CIEMs
of the information system developed by Rijeka CIEM using their own resources; (ii) the delay in the
implementation of the GIS and funding of the second part of the split contract with GOC resources beyond
the project scope.
11
   The new activities included (i) an implementation plan for telemedicine; (ii) a functional review and
business process reengineering of the HZZO; (iii) a plan for rationalization and outsourcing of non-clinical
services; (iv) a second wave of projects for EU funding; and (v) expansion of the GIS into the Croatian
Health Business Intelligence System.
12
   Approved by the Country Director on November 26, 2012, in response to a request from the Ministry of
Finance (dated October 15, 2012). The contract signing for GIS was delayed by 11 months due to: (a) the
complex nature of the product, the bidders requested 7 rounds of clarifications; and (b) the bid evaluation
report required several clarifications from the Bank’s technical team (Restructuring Paper No. 73842 v2,
November 21, 2012).
13
   ISR No.11, September 2013.
14
   PHRD Grant (TF053150) was signed on February 11, 2005, with an original closing date of September
20, 2006, which was extended once until June 15, 2007. The Grant (US$425,000) was nearly fully
disbursed and closed on June 15, 2007. The uncommitted Grant funds intended for the analysis of survey
data collected from emergency related centers were cancelled at Grant closing.


                                                     6
(iii) assessment of providers' capacity to respond to new incentives and stakeholder
consultations to assess knowledge and attitudes toward changes in the insurance system; (iv)
support to project preparation, including capacity building in project management. A
US$352,000 Project Preparation Advance (PPA) was approved to finance further preparatory
TA. However, it remained completely unutilized due to ministerial reshuffling of staff and
late appointment of key officials following the 2007 elections, and was consequently
cancelled.15

28.     Quality at Entry. The project design drew heavily on strategic and technical
documents. In addition to the National Health Strategy 2006-2011, the PHRD Grant-
supported technical analyses underpinned project preparation, including: (i) support to the
implementation of Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG)-based hospital payment system; (ii) the
development of a specific plan for implementing quality assurance, including hospital
accreditation system; (iii) the thorough analysis of the EMS system that laid the ground for
the DEMSIPP basic design; (iv) a plan for the Hospital Master Plan development; and (v) a
Health Reform Communications Strategy. The latter was based on a public opinion survey
and focus groups with the public and health professionals and helped reach consensus on
reform solutions. In addition, the Bank’s assessment of MoHSW’s EMS reform strategy as
well as important observations and studies on the new EU member states’ experiences with
absorption of EU funds provided critical inputs for the project design. 16

29.     Quality Enhancement Review (QER) found the more narrowly defined project
design adequate and appropriate to the context of overall Bank engagement in Croatia’s
health sector, and a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) instrument appropriate to the stated
objectives, MoHSW’s capacity, and the country context. 17                 Most of the QER
recommendations, including the change in the project title to reflect the actual activities, were
subsequently reflected in the revised PAD.

30.     Assessment of Project Design. The project objectives as appraised were closely
aligned with the identified sector issues, the National Health Strategy, 18 and the Bank’s
CPS. 19 Importantly, the design was simple, consisting of only two components, which
emerged as a result of an iterative, demand-driven process and aimed to serve as a “catalyst”


15
   Acting Country Director’s letter to the Minister of Finance dated February 27, 2009.
16
   Interviews conducted for the ICR and references to the European Commission report in the PAD pointed
to the alarmingly slow rate of absorption of EU funds in both new EU member states and pre-accession
countries at the time of the appraisal.
17
   At concept stage, the project (then referred to as the Sustainable Health System Project) had the broad
objectives of increasing the efficiency and quality of the Croatian health system through: (i) changing the
financing system from input to performance-based payments; (ii) restructuring the delivery system to better
meet the needs of the Croatian population; (iii) strengthening the capacity of the health system to govern
effectively; and (iv) increasing the health system focus on prevention. During the concept review meeting
on April 11, 2006, it was concluded that conditions to use the proposed programmatic approach
(availability of clear sector program and satisfactory expenditure framework) were unlikely to be satisfied.

for the overall restructuring process and mobilization of external funds. This reflected design
realism and relevance to country needs. The project built on earlier Bank-financed
operations 20 and the PHRD Grant-supported technical analyses. The design used an
integrated and phased approach whereby the EMS system would be the first phase in
restructuring the supply of services and an important linchpin between primary and
secondary/tertiary care services. In addition, the project successfully incorporated the
principle of flexibility in the design and implementation by: (i) describing the entire project
beyond only what the Bank Loan intended to finance and avoiding an excessively
prescriptive project description in the Loan Agreement; (ii) allocating all project investment
costs in one disbursement category; and (iii) including some budget under Component 2 for
unforeseen TA needs. At the same time, while most of the results indicators remained
relevant over the life of the project, a few of the indicators were found wanting during
implementation (see Section 2.3 for further explanation).

31.     Lessons learned and reflected in the project design. The project design incorporated
key lessons drawn from the Bank’s lending history in Croatia, support to EMS reforms in the
Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Region, and experience from working with the new EU
member states. These included the following:

     •   Clear recognition of the need to support service delivery reform through appropriate
         changes in the national legislative and policy environment; and for reform
         beneficiaries to be sufficiently diverse in order to leverage broad stakeholder support.
     •   Recognition of the health sector’s potential contribution to cohesion and the Lisbon
         Agenda and, hence, the need to develop strategic plans and capacities in order to
         utilize investment opportunities presented by the EU membership.

32.     Risk Assessment. The PAD included a list of key risks to the PDO and expected
results, including potential resistance to reform measures and substantial fiduciary risk.
While most risks were mitigated as part of the project preparation and implementation, those
that partially materialized were managed during implementation (see Sections 2.2 and 2.5 for
further explanation). This includes underestimation of initial implementation capacity and the
time required to implement legislative changes to support the EMS reform.

33.     Adequacy of government commitment. The request to include the restructuring of
the EMS in the project came from the MoHSW at project identification.21 Along with the
inclusion of the EMS reform in the National Health Strategy 2006-2011, this attested to high
relevance of the EMS reform and the GOC’s commitment to implement it. Also, the EU
accession process provided a strong impetus for MoHSW’s ownership of the focus on
building the capacity to plan for and use EU funds effectively. In addition to the
establishment of the technical working groups (WGs), the GOC designated at the outset, a



20
   While the first investment loan (Health Project IBRD-38430) supported the post-war rehabilitation, the
second (Health System Project IBRD-45130) focused on supporting the public health system and piloting
certain aspects of service restructuring, including the successful establishment of an integrated emergency
department in Koprivnica county hospital and the improved computer-aided ambulance dispatch in Zagreb.

of specific reform measures.

2.2 Implementation

34.      While most project indicators and targets were achieved—and in several cases
exceeded—and nearly all of the outputs under the project’s two components were delivered
(see Annex 2), the project faced significant delays early in implementation. From
effectiveness in mid-January 2009 through September 2011 the project had a disbursement
level of only three percent. 22 This was due to the overhaul of the EMS institutional and
regulatory framework taking much longer than anticipated. 23 Specifically, the country-wide
Emergency Medicine Network was formally enacted in February 2011, and the process of
establishing Institutes of Emergency Medicine in the 21 counties was completed only in
2012. 24 This major institutional transformation required unforeseen time and effort to
convince the self-governed county authorities. Physical investments picked up following the
institutional reform. By mid-2012 implementation progress had improved to satisfactory
levels and by 2013 the project was fully satisfactory on both implementation progress and
development objective indicators.

35.    The streamlined design with embedded flexibility proved to be critical for successful
implementation. In particular, the ability to promptly reallocate funds between project
components allowed the MoHSW and Bank teams to adapt efficiently to changing needs and
keep the project moving towards its stated objectives.

36.      The use of an internal Project Management Team (PMT) staffed with MoHSW civil
servants to implement the project was important despite some reservations at the outset.
Initial shortcomings in project management stemmed mainly from: (i) the PMT’s routine
work pressures as part of an increasingly expanded portfolio of responsibilities; and (ii) the
lack of familiarity of the new MoHSW leadership (which took office after the late-2007
parliamentary elections) with the Bank’s procedures, and ensuing overly cautious approach to
procurement under the DEMSIPP. These resulted in protracted decision making and lack of
effective coordination, leading to delays in the day-to-day project management and
procurement. 25 Remedial actions included: (i) engaging the Bank’s local staff member in
WG meetings; (ii) revising the Procurement Plan and enforcing related action planning and
monitoring of the interim milestones; (iii) engaging additional experts to support MoHSW in
project management and coordination; and (iv) continuing regular problem-solving meetings
between the Bank’s Country Manager and MoHSW State Secretary. While delays related to
project management could likely have been mitigated by engaging an external consultancy
for some specific tasks, the preference was to build the capacity of the Croatian team. Once


22
   The project was classified by Bank management as a “problem project” until early 2012; project mid-
term review was postponed by six months due to the delays.
23
   The PP annexed to the Agreed Minutes of Negotiations indicated January 2009 as the expected bid-
opening date for procuring furniture and office equipment for the CIEMS and 21 CIEMs through the
shopping method.

the PMT gained the necessary experience, results in terms of swift implementation, achieved
outcomes, developed ownership, capacity, and sustainability made the approach worthwhile.

37.      The relevance of the project to Croatia’s macroeconomic context and health sector
priorities coupled with the broad stakeholder support sustained GOC’s ownership and
minimized political risks. As intended, the investments included in the DEMSIPP benefitted
from continued political support despite several changes of the government over the
implementation period.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

38.     Results Framework. The project had well-defined and achievable objectives with
an adequate number of PDO indicators, which were well aligned with the project objectives
and activities. The PAD envisaged solid monitoring arrangements, largely relying on data
already being collected by the health system, and plans to establish a national management
information system (MIS) for the monitoring of the EMS.

39.     In the event, the M&E framework however, still had some weaknesses, which
became apparent during implementation. These included: (i) the lack of baseline and/or target
values for some indicators, and outdated (e.g., 2005) baseline values for some others; (ii)
selection of indicators attempting to measure results beyond the project control (e.g., number
of project applications approved by the EU); (iii) inappropriate target for one indicator
stemming from the lack of clear definition of urban versus rural areas, and overestimated
target for another due to not taking into account uneven population distribution; (iv) unclear
indicator definition preventing sensible measurement (e.g., “multiple symptoms”); and (v)
duplication in one PDO/IO indicator.

40.     M&E Implementation. The Croatian Institute for Emergency Medical Services
(CIEMS), Croatian Institute of Public Health (CIPH), and MoHSW initiated corrective
measures in May 2010 to strengthen the M&E arrangements, introducing practical solutions
for measurement of indicators and targets. Several indicators were refined to take into
account the actual conditions and requirements of the EMS reorganization (e.g., changing
“major trauma” to “polytrauma”), and all the involved medical institutions received
structured tables and instructions/obligations to report the data to the CIPH. Furthermore,
monitoring was discontinued for the parts of the IO indicator no.7 related to multiple
symptoms, and symptoms beginning in the last 12 hours due to measurement and data
collection difficulties. The data collected in 2010 was intended to serve as the baseline due to
the delayed interventions in the EMS field and impossibility to collect historical data.
However, the resulting baselines, specifically for PDO indicators 3 and 4, were unreliable as
sample sizes were too small.26 In addition, no updated data to corroborate the progress was
available by Bank’s implementation support visit in September 2011.

41.    The M&E arrangements, particularly for the EMS component, faced several
challenges: (i) the key technical institution, the CIEMS, became operational only in 2010; 27

                                                  10
(ii) establishment of the County IEMs, whose responsibilities included data collection and
aggregation at the county level, took significant time; 28 (iii) the national MIS for EMS did
not materialize due to the WG’s failure to appropriately finalize the technical specifications
(TS) because of disagreements between the CIEMS and HZZO on the MIS functionality; and
(iv) poor reliability of and delays in the administrative data collection/provision by the CIPH,
designated as the back-up option in case the MIS was delayed. 29 The situation improved in
2012 with more regular and reliable reporting by the established CIEMs, some of which
adopted the information system developed by the Rijeka CIEM, and the CIEMS taking over
from the CIPH the responsibility to collect and analyze the EMS related data.30 In the end, it
was possible to report on all five PDO indicators—three (indicators 1, 3, and 4) were
exceeded, one (indicator 5) was partially achieved, and one (indicator 2) settled at an optimal
level even though the target was not achieved—with the result being significantly improved
emergency medical services and patient survival rates. All intermediate outcome indicators
were also measured—of the 13 original intermediate outcome indicators, four were exceeded,
seven were achieved, and two were partially achieved. A significant amount of training both
in regard to EMS and application for and management of future funds was also undertaken as
part of the project.

42.     M&E Utilization. The failure to link all the CIEMs through a national-level MIS
presented challenges for monitoring and utilizing EMS performance data. 31 Still, the CIEMS
continued efforts to monitor some key project indicators as performance indicators for the
EMS system. 32 Also, the Croatian Health Business Intelligence System (CHBIS) represents
a system-wide improvement in the decision-making capacity. It provided an advanced tool
for planning the health sector resources and analyzing data, including mortality and
morbidity indicators, at the local, regional and national levels.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

43.     Safeguards compliance is rated Satisfactory. The project’s Environmental Category
Rating was B. The only triggered safeguard policy related to the minimal environmental risks
associated with the dust and noise of the construction activities, the disposal of construction
and medical waste, and the risks associated with the handling of the waste during operation
(municipal and hazardous). Hence, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for
mitigating the associated risks was developed by MoHSW and publicly disclosed in Croatia
on November 16, 2007, and by the Bank's Info Shop on November 20, 2007. In accordance
with the EMP, hospital waste management in EMS facilities followed national regulations,
fully harmonized with the EU legislation, with compliance rated satisfactory throughout
project implementation.

44. Financial Management (FM) is rated Satisfactory. The project used the MoHSW’s
financial management (FM) system for project accounting and reporting purposes. The
existing staff of MoHSW experienced in Bank-financed projects satisfactorily performed all
FM functions throughout the life of the project. The project budget, integrated in MoHSW’s
overall budget, was prepared annually based on the project’s Procurement Plan following the
State Budget Act. The project counterpart funding, staffing, accounting, reporting, funds
flow, disbursement arrangements, as well as internal controls remained adequate throughout.
The project used an Oracle application to extract and generate Interim Financial Reports
(IFR) from MoHSW’s existing accounting software. Since the project used report-based
disbursement, the quality of IFRs improved accordingly, with IFRs always submitted on a
timely basis and found acceptable by the Bank. In February 2011, the MoHSW updated the
project FM manual approved by the Board in 2008, with the actual financial and
disbursement practices in place. The project remained in compliance with the audit
covenants, with no overdue audits and no accounting or internal control deficiencies noted in
the related management recommendation letters.

45.     Procurement is rated Satisfactory. The PMT carried out the project procurement
planning and management, with three staff experienced in civil works procurement under
Bank-financed projects dedicated to this function. Despite initial delays, the PMT managed to
complete all procurement successfully, with 35 Goods contracts and 128 Consulting Services
contracts signed during the life of the project.

46.     Delays occurred mainly due to: (i) technical capacity and coordination issues, which
resulted in lengthy preparation, multiple clarification requests and related changes to TS, with
ensuing bid amendments and deadline extensions; (ii) PMT’s initial lack of experience with
intensive procurement of goods, IT equipment and consulting services, which was aggravated
by the overall project management shortcomings. 33

47.      These issues were addressed through: (i) a procurement capacity-building action plan
for the PMT; (ii) tight monitoring plans and effective interaction between the PMT and the
Bank team, including intensive support from the Bank’s country office based procurement
staff; (iii) the Bank’s careful technical reviews and feedback to MoHSW on bidders’
requests and complaints; (iv) the engagement of additional experts by MoHSW and
shortening the schedules, where warranted; and (v) the Procurement Plan adjustments based
on the circumstances and MoHSW needs.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

48.     Transition arrangements at project closing are considered adequate, as demonstrated
by the: (i) complete institutional framework and commissioned training programs in the EMS


33
  For example, the WG failed to appropriately finalize the TS for the national EMS information system.
The telemedicine equipment procurement also faced significant delay in the preparation of the TS and a
lengthy procurement process, with seven rounds of clarifications and amendments of the Bidding
Documents followed by cancellation and re-launching of the tender. Likewise, the delivery of the GIS
suffered delays to complete the selection process, and implementation started several months from its
original plan (rf. ISRs and Aide Memoires of implementation support visits).

field, including the EMS specialty and academic program institutionalized at the Zagreb
University’s Medical Faculty; (ii) appropriate functional and funding arrangements; 34 and
(iii) solid regulatory basis for uniform EMS system functioning, including standardized call
handling and treatment procedures. In addition, the next wave of planned improvements
includes the adoption of the Emergency Medicine Act, establishing the system of first
responders, and formalizing the EMS education of nurses and medical technicians.

49.      In follow-up to this project, a Bank-supported Health System Quality and Efficiency
Improvement Program-for-Results (PforR) operation (2013-2017)) will assist the GOC to
implement its National Health Care Strategy for 2012-2020. To improve two critical areas of
the health services (quality and efficiency), the PforR will support five out of the eight
priorities of the National Health Care Strategy. 35 These priorities address the remaining
challenges facing the Croatian health sector, such as the health facility network
rationalization, health care quality improvement, and promotion of the health sector financial
sustainability. Thus, these represent a natural continuation of the work supported by the
DEMSIPP.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

50.      Objectives. The DEMSIPP objectives were and remain highly relevant. They fully
reflect the country’s current development priorities declared in the key national strategies,
including the National Health Care Strategy 2012-2020. 36 The objectives also remain
consistent with the Bank’s CPS for FY2014-17, under which a public finance pillar is
focused on rationalized health spending and an EU membership pillar aims at preparing
national reform programs for use of EU funds and strengthening the capacity of public sector
for EU funds absorption.

51.     Design. The design was and remains highly relevant. The components decisively
addressed the most pressing sector issues, including: inefficient spending, high adult
mortality, and mobilization of future EU funding opportunities. These complemented well
the demand-side reforms under the PAL and other supply side reforms (i.e., developing a


34
   The CIEMS, funded by the national budget, has the responsibility to set national standards for EMS
service delivery; integrate, direct, and coordinate activities in the EMS field; monitor key EMS related
performance indicators; maintain key EMS registers (staff, vehicles, and equipment); inform the public
about EMS reforms and functioning; and oversee professional development of EMS workers (CIEMS
Report on participation in the DEMSIPP implementation. Zagreb, October 10, 2013). The formalized
network of 21 HZZO-funded EMS Institutes are responsible for actual delivery of EMS services, assets
management, M&E data reporting, and clinical skills training for EMS workers.
35
   These 5 priorities include: (i) strengthening management capacity in health care; (ii) reorganizing the
structure and activities of health care institutions; (iii) fostering quality in health care; (iv) strengthening
preventive activities; and (v) preserving financial stability of health care.
36
   Among the priorities specified in the National Growth Strategy, National Reform Programme,
Convergence Programme for 2014-2017, and National Health Care Development Strategy for 2012-2020
are fiscal consolidation and rationalization of hospitals as well as increase of the efficiency, efficacy and
sustainability of the healthcare system.


                                                      13
quality assurance system and provider payment reform), thus contributing to Croatia’s EU
membership agenda.

52.     Implementation arrangements based on core project management/coordination
functions fully integrated in MoHSW were and remain highly relevant to the broad objective
of building the capacity of the public sector. 37

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

53.     The project contributed substantially to initiating systemic restructuring processes in
the health sector by revamping the entire EMS system in Croatia. It also catalyzed
subsequent significant reforms by initiating a dialogue and investing in strategic planning
tools and capacity as well as ground-breaking TA. The targets for nearly all the IO indicators
were achieved or partially achieved, as were most of the PDO indicators (refer to Annex 2
and Section F of the Data Sheet for details).

54.      Improving the efficiency and outcomes of the Emergency Medical Service System.
Regarding this first part of the PDO, DEMSIPP supported operationalization of the essential
building blocks of the EMS delivery system based on the key regulations implemented by
GOC. This included : (i) establishment of the CIEMS and the network of 21 County IEMs;
(ii) reorganization/standardization of the pre-hospital EMS, including creation of 21 county
EMS dispatch centers linked to the 112 call centers and TETRA system and using a
standardized algorithm for emergency calls; (iii) renewal and standardization of the
ambulance fleet and medical and communications equipment; (iv) creation of integrated
emergency departments in 16 major hospitals and equipment of pre-existing emergency
departments in another five hospitals; (v) re-training of 1,755 pre-hospital EMS workers and
343 nurses in the 21 hospitals to work based on the new delivery model, and provision of
specialized EMS training to 250 doctors (206 of whom received certification); and (vi)
development of the telemedicine implementation plan and equipment of 12 telemedicine sites
to provide consultation on emergency cases, also to health facilities on remote islands.

55.      This systemic modernization led to improvements in efficiency and outcomes of the
EMS service delivery, as reflected by PDO indicators 1, 3, and 4. Specifically, internal
efficiency improved significantly, with 100 percent of field calls being associated with
emergency cases (target exceeded), and no emergency teams being deployed for non-
emergency transportation or discharges. Forty-six percent of these calls on average are now
classified as red or yellow codes, which is a safe balance between red, yellow and green
calls.38 Likewise, PDO indicators 3 and 4—measuring outcomes in pre-hospital and hospital
emergency care—exceeded their expected targets (based on estimates in the absence of


37
   This is consistent with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and objectives of the national strategies
and the Bank’s CPS.
38
   The Croatian Index of Emergency Call Reception for Medical Dispatch Center uses the following
definitions: red code indicates a situation which is life-threatening or which could suddenly become life-
threatening; yellow code indicates a potentially dangerous condition which could endanger vital functions
or condition which requires physical examination; green code indicates a situation and a condition which
does not require emergency medical care.


                                                     14
reliable baselines). Specifically, the rates of survival to hospital emergency room admission
reached 92 percent for polytrauma and 30 percent for cardiac arrest, compared to the targets
of 90 and 15 percent, respectively. Similarly, the 48-hour survival rates after arriving alive at
the ERA reached 94 percent for polytrauma and 64 percent for cardiac arrest, compared to
the targets of 90 and 35 percent, respectively.

56.      The target value of 0.2 for PDO indicator 2 was not fully achieved, although an
optimal level was achieved since Implementation showed that the original target was
overestimated. Specifically, the distances between the counties and uneven distribution of the
population throughout the country necessitated a higher ratio for some rural and sparsely
populated areas in order to be sufficiently serviced. The average ratio of 0.33 achieved by
the end of 2012 still showed an improvement of 34 percent in allocative efficiency of EMS
human resource distribution compared to the baseline value of 0.503. Therefore, given the
peculiarities of the Croatian context, the achieved ratio was considered as an optimum level
and its further reduction was not pursued.

57.      In summary, the DEMSIPP-supported interventions in improving the efficiency and
outcomes of the EMS system in Croatia contributed positively to reducing adult mortality
rates, especially for ischemic heart disease and MVA. In addition, given the country’s
dependence on and plans to further develop tourism,39 the additional investments in extensive
basic life support training and wide deployment of AEDs contribute to making Croatia an
attractive and safe touristic destination.

58.      Strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to develop
and implement strategic projects. Regarding this second half of the PDO, with support from
project-funded TA, MoHSW’s capacity for strategic planning has increased significantly.
This is evidenced by the development and adoption of the following: (i) new Health Sector
Strategy for 2012-2020; (ii) Hospital Master Plan; (iii) Human Resources Strategy and
Investment Plan; (iv) plan for outsourcing of non-clinical services; (v) health reform
communication strategy; (vi) national health registers; (vii) telemedicine plan; (viii) business
process reengineering proposal for the HZZO; (ix) three project proposals and a Terms of
Reference for a Feasibility Study 40 for the EU funding as well as training of 74 health sector
staff in development of investment project proposals for external funding. 41

59.     PDO indicator 5 related to EU funds was only partially achieved, largely due to
timing. While a significant number of staff (74) were trained in the development of
investment project proposals and three project application documents and one terms of
reference were developed (in line with a target of four documents) the National Strategic


39
   The share of the tourism sector in GDP was 15.7 percent in 2012 and 16.6 percent (preliminary data) in
2013. The plans for “tourism embracing the entire national territory” include an increase in total tourist
expenditures from the current EUR 7.3 billion to EUR 14.3 billion by 2020 (The Croatian Bureau of
Statistics; the Croatian Tourism Development Strategy until 2020).
40
   The project applications relate to planned physical investments in three health facilities in Zagreb (Clinic
for Children's Diseases, Clinical Hospital Dubrava, and Clinical Hospital Center “Sestre milosrdnice”), and
the Terms of Reference for Feasibility study relates to Clinical Hospital Center in Rijeka.
41
   In such areas as hospital infrastructure, information technology, quality assurance, telemedicine, and
public health.

Framework and Operational Programs to be supported by EU funding were yet to be
developed at the Loan closing date. 42 Therefore, no funds were leveraged. However, the
project provided support to the MoHSW to develop upfront capacity and specific plans to
absorb EU funds once the Strategic Framework and Operational Programs are in place and
funds become available. Despite initial difficulties, MoHSW’s capacity has improved
enough to implement the PforR and to manage prospective EU-funded projects.

60.      Activities in this area played a pivotal role in initiating broader, inter-linked sector
reforms. The National Health Care Strategy, Human Resources Strategy, and prioritized
Hospital Master Plan provide a solid foundation for strategic development of the health care
network and resources—ones that would better meet the health needs of the population with
greater efficiency gains. Equally important, the flexibility embedded in the DEMSIPP design
also helped the country to develop plans and tools in the areas of provider payment and
quality improvement that are integral to the overall reform agenda. Finally, before it closed,
the project successfully supported several new, forward-looking MoHSW initiatives. The
initiatives on outsourcing non-clinical services, reengineering business processes of HZZO,
and introducing the CHBIS created the momentum and paved the way for discussion of
subsequent reform measures, which are reflected in the PforR operation.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: High

61.     The Economic and Financial Analysis (EFA) of the PAD estimated that the main
benefits from the project implementation would stem from Component 1. In particular, the
most important benefits would be reductions in SDRs due to quicker and more efficient EMS.
The technical efficiency gains are hard to quantify but undeniable. The DEMSIPP corrected a
very obvious inefficiency of the Croatian health service delivery system. Field calls—
whether urgent or not—were handled as emergency field calls. This represented a clear waste
of resources, since non-emergency calls can be handled in less resource-intensive settings
than real emergency calls. The targets were exceeded for five out of the seven indicators
directly measuring the quickness and efficiency of EMS (for one of them in qualitative terms).
In the case of the only indicator for which the target was missed, there were considerable
improvements compared to the baseline before project effectiveness.

62.     Not only did the DEMSIPP achieve the expected benefits, it did so at a lower cost
than anticipated. Out of the EUR 92.51 million that the project was initially estimated to cost
(government and Bank funds), only Euro 52.54 million (or 56.79 percent) was spent
(including approximately 80 percent of originally committed IBRD funds). This is partly due
to appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Euro during the implementation period (around
15 percent) together with large cost savings under Component 1. Cost savings were
experienced in regard to the construction/rehabilitation of premises for EMS departments
(funded by counterpart funds) and procurement of ambulance vehicles and medical
equipment; deployment of a much cheaper locally developed ICT solution for the CIEMs
instead of the national-level MIS; forgone procurement of a vehicle for CIEMS; and

Development and EU Funds and covers the financial period 2014-2020.

provision of telemedicine equipment for fewer sites than originally intended. At the same
time, the procured AEDs and models for clinical skills training, the developed
implementation plan for telemedicine, and adult basic life support training were the
additional outputs that could be afforded but had not been envisaged at appraisal (see Annex
1 for further details).

63.     Furthermore, the investments are expected to yield reasonable returns over the
coming years. While the benefits from better EMS are persistent (long-term benefits from
capacity building at MoHSW are also expected to materialize), the recurrent costs stemming
from some of the project interventions (i.e., establishment of the CIEMS, separate dispatch
center for each CIEM, integrated ERAs in hospitals) are low in comparison to the overall
public health budget. Moreover, they are likely to be lower than the recurrent costs from
unchanged and inefficient EMS services under the counterfactual of no DEMSIPP.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

64.     The overall outcome rating is based on the ratings of high for relevance and
efficiency and substantial for efficacy/PDO achievement.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

65.     The EMS reform contributed to improving the welfare of poorer households by
reducing the inequality in the distribution of health resources across the country. By making
the EMS system more efficient, it also freed up resources that could be used to support better
access to health services by the entire population.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

66.      Project investments resulted in considerable institutional development impact,
including the establishment of the CIEMS and County IEMs, which was a major achievement
in itself. The successfully formalized EMS doctor specialty and institutionalized academic
program at the University of Zagreb’s Medical Faculty is another important achievement.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

67.      Following the successful adaptation of the Norwegian Index of Medical Emergency
Assistance, the Slovenian Ministry of Health requested CIEMS’ assistance in adapting the
same Index in Slovenia. 43 The procurement savings also enabled MoHSW to upgrade
medical equipment in the pre-existing 5 EMS departments and to commission additional TA
activities that resulted in the continuation of the reform process under the new PforR
operation.

Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

68.      The complete overhaul of the EMS system, including its physical infrastructure and
institutional capacity, contribute to medium-term sustainability of the achievements. With
increased labor mobility within the EU, attracting and retaining qualified medical staff
becomes potentially challenging as this has been a common issue for the Croatian public
health system even before the country entered the EU. However, the next wave of planned
improvements in the EMS system and strategic focus on and developed capacity for effective
use of EU funding reconfirm the GOC commitment to continuing reforms. The substantial
motivation that the long-awaited EMS reform created within the EMS community also makes
for a strong cohesive and stabilizing effect. All these make the project gains unlikely to be
reversed.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69.     Overall, the Bank performed well in ensuring a demand-driven, streamlined and
forward-looking design that focused on the country’s most relevant issues in the context of
tourism-dependent, pre-accession economy. The PHRD-supported technical analyses, lessons
from the earlier EMS interventions and other pre-accession countries’ experiences, especially
related to investment planning and EU funds absorption, were incorporated into the project
design. The Bank also effectively leveraged complementarity of the PHRD funding and
policy dialogue as part of the PAL2 and project preparation to support the broader policy
agenda. However, there were some gaps in designing the M&E framework and risk analysis,
with insufficient mitigation of initial capacity constraints during the preparation phase, which
presented challenges during implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

70.      The Bank’s rigorous supervision efforts helped compensate for the significant delays
experienced under the project. This was achieved through detailed guidance and intensive
implementation support provided to the technical WGs and PMT during the early
implementation phase. The focus on results, short-term action planning/monitoring, and
flexibility in adjusting to arising needs were also critical during the subsequent period. The
Bank provided adequate technical support and fiduciary due diligence through careful
reviews of technical and bidding documents, random physical inspection visits to selected
facilities, and prompt reactions to procurement-related complaints from bidders. In addition,
the Bank’s policy advice to the GOC and facilitation of best practice exchanges as part of

                                              18
project supervision and policy-based operations led to the successful introduction of a quality
assurance system and provider payment reforms. The government and Bank teams also found
practical ways to address challenges encountered with aspects of the results framework
during implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

71.     The overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory is based on the Bank’s performance
during preparation and supervision phases, as discussed above.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

72.     Overall performance of the GOC, represented by MoF, was adequate, as evidenced
by its continued support for reforms specified in the national health strategies, in general, and
to the specific reform measures under both the project and policy-based activities, in
particular. The MoF coordinated well with MoHSW in establishing project management
arrangements and supported the policy actions aimed at ensuring fiscal sustainability of
health spending. Although fiscal space pressures constrained MoHSW’s capital investment
budget, requiring reallocations of the Loan amount at the outset, counterpart funding
remained adequate overall. In operational terms, MoF was constantly and adequately
addressing the implementation risks and constraints under the project through annual Joint
Portfolio Reviews, setting forth remedy measures for the implementing ministry. 44 The GOC
also sustained its commitment to reforms contemplated in the National Health Care Strategy
2012-2020 as reaffirmed by its support for the new PforR operation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.      The MoHSW’s overall performance was appropriate. However, early implementation
suffered significant delays due to the missed opportunities with the unutilized PPA and
initially slow decision making and gaps in project management. At the preparation phase,
MoHSW exhibited strong commitment to reforms by adopting sensible National Health
Strategy and EMS Reform Strategy and commissioning adequate counterpart teams,
including senior officials to head the WGs. The Ministry also effectively used the PHRD to
launch a challenging process for implementation of the broader policy reform agenda. It
prioritized the DEMSIPP investments to address the most relevant sector issues and followed
a prudent approach by not committing to execute a larger loan under the fiscal space
limitations. Owing to the exceptional commitment and efforts of the new MoHSW
leadership, which was appointed in early 2012 and had a strong focus on policy reform



44
  The GOC’s conclusions following annual Joint Portfolio Review included specific remedial measures for
the project in the years 2009-12.


                                                  19
issues, MoHSW successfully completed the project in a reasonable amount of time with a
93.4 percent disbursement level and the PDO largely achieved.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74.     The overall performance of the Borrower is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on
the factors discussed above.

6. Lessons Learned

75.    The following key lessons were derived from the implementation of this project:

76.     The simple and flexible project design allowed for needed adjustments, which
resulted in achievement of project development objectives despite initial delays.

77.      Even given inherent difficulties with having a project implemented by civil servants
in line government agencies, building strong public sector capacity is worth the effort as it is
more sustainable. Time for this type of capacity building needs to be incorporated into
project design from the outset.

78.      Potential difficulties with (often contentious) procurement of medical and/or ICT
equipment of large volumes or high complexity should never be underestimated; intensive
efforts are needed from the outset to ensure sufficient technical capacity and specialized
skills to make it happen on a timely basis and at a good quality level.

79.    Projects contemplating a huge legislative and institutional transformation should plan
considerable time for stakeholder consultations and appropriately back-load
funding/disbursements.

80.   A streamlined, context-tailored         results   framework    is   essential   to   guide
implementation and measure results.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

81.    As part of the due process, the draft ICR was shared with the MoF, MoH, CIEMS,
and HZZO for comment. The MoF and HZZO informed the Bank in their email responses of
June 11, 2014 of the absence of any comments on the draft ICR. In their emails of June 1,
2014 and June 11, 2014, respectively, the CIEMS and MoH informed that they found the
assessment correct. The MoH also suggested two minor editorial adjustments, which have
been incorporated in the final draft. The Borrower’s ICR is attached as Annex 7.

   The effective average exchange rate of US$ 1=EUR 0.74 (considering all the disbursements made over
the whole implementation period) was used to convert the appraised and/or actual amounts expressed in
EUR (or in US$) into the US$ equivalent (or into EUR) amounts; therefore, in tables b.1 and b.2, where the
original appraisal estimates were expressed in the PAD in US$, the US$ equivalent appraisal estimate and
EUR actual estimate amounts, respectively, are indicative only. The exchange rate implied by the appraised
amounts of the Loan (18.1 million in EUR and 28.3 million in US$ at appraisal) was slightly lower than
0.64 (though the PAD stated 0.68); the appreciation of the US$ against the EUR during the implementation
period (around 15 percent) partially explains the resulting lower disbursement rates in tables b.1 and b.2.
46
    The lower disbursement rate under Component 1 is explained by (i) large savings in the
construction/rehabilitation of premises for EMS departments (funded from the counterpart funds) and
procurement of ambulance vehicles and medical equipment; (ii) deployment of a much cheaper locally
developed ICT solution for the CIEMs instead of the national-level MIS; (iii) forgone procurement of a
vehicle for CIEMS; and (iv) provision of telemedicine equipment for fewer sites than originally intended.
At the same time, the procured AEDs and models for clinical skills training, the developed implementation
plan for telemedicine, and adult basic life support training were the additional outputs not envisaged at
appraisal.
47
   The higher disbursement rate under Component 2 resulted from the investments in additional TA for the
National Health Care Strategy 2012-2020; Implementation Plan for Rationalization and Outsourcing of
Non-Clinical Services; Business Process Reengineering of HZZO; and Croatian Health Business
Intelligence System (although the contract for the latter was split, with the second part to be financed
through government funds after the Loan closing date).
48
   This reflects the cancellation of the PPA in January 2009.

   The low disbursement rate for the Borrower funds is mainly explained by large savings in the
construction/rehabilitation of premises for EMS departments and procurement of medical equipment (the
disbursement rate increases to 44% when the effective exchange rate of 0.64 at appraisal is applied to the
appraisal estimate).
50
   The actual disbursement rate for the Loan funds is 93.43%, with part of the difference stemming from the
exchange rate of 0.74 applied to the appraisal estimate, as explained above. The lower actual disbursement
is explained by (i) the unutilized PPA amount; (ii) some investments that did not materialize (see Annex 2);
and (iii) residual savings from the procurement of additional TA and equipment.

1. Introduction

The Croatian health system had undergone significant changes since the early 1990’s, but
challenges remained in terms of both its efficiency and financial sustainability. While Croatia
fares relatively well on health outcomes, these good results are achieved at a high cost. Before the
effectiveness of DEMSIPP, the main challenge in the medium term was, therefore, to maintain
and improve health outcomes while curbing public spending on health through efficiency gains in
the provision of health services.

The adequacy of response of EMS was one of the concrete concerns about the supply of public
health services. Specifically, the unevenly distributed organization of EMS resulted in unequal
access across counties, inefficient spending, and sub-optimal outcomes. In addition, the pre-
hospital EMS teams faced multiple demands from both emergency and non-emergency situations.
Actual emergency calls were estimated to account for less than 15 percent of the total number of
calls. Croatia was behind other countries in the creation of an EMS specialty and, contrary to the
European trends, still maintained emergency reception areas (ERA) as part of the major inpatient
departments. The latter caused the ambulance crews to look for the most appropriate ERA for
their patients, which might have presumably contributed to the higher death rates in Croatia
compared to other European countries, especially for ischemic heart disease and MVA 56. The
high relevance of an efficient EMS system to Croatia’s tourism-dependent economy and its
potential contribution to reductions in the relatively high mortality rate from heart diseases and
traumas were additional compelling factors for a reform of EMS. The fact that there was broad
consensus on the need to reform the outdated EMS systems, and the Ministry of Health and
Social Welfare’s (MoHSW) political and technical readiness to initiate such a reform made the
DEMSIPP a feasible and promising intervention.

The project had two components:

     a. The development of emergency medical services. This component had four
        subcomponents. The first sub-component was intended to establish a Croatian Institute
        for Emergency Medical Services that would provide overall policy guidance, set national
        guidelines and standards for EMS services in Croatia and monitor the system. The second
        sub-component was intended to reorganize pre-hospital EMS and to support the country-
        wide implementation of the national guidelines for service organization and standards.
        The third sub-component was intended to integrate in-hospital EMS and to support the
        creation of emergency medical departments in six to 13 major hospitals. The fourth sub-
        component was intended to develop telemedicine projects that could support the EMS
        reform.
     b. Institutional support for strategic planning. This component had three subcomponents.
        The first sub-component was intended to develop Priority Programs focused on
        developing the strategies and projects for investing EU funds in the health sector. The

Analysis of the ICR.

   In comparison with more developed EU economies, the Standardized Death Rate (SDR) associated to
Motor Vehicle Accidents (MVAs) was 30 percent higher, and SDRs related to all causes were 22 percent
higher.


                                                   32
        second sub-component was intended to build capacity for accessing EU Funds. The third
        sub-component was Project Management supporting the execution of the DEMSIPP by
        (among others) financing training activities for the MoHSW Project Management Team.

The above mentioned two components improved the efficiency and outcomes of the emergency
medical services system and strengthened the capacity of the Ministry of Health and Social
Welfare to develop and implement strategic projects. Due to the direct impact of EMS on the
health outcomes (i.e. survival rates) of patients requiring EMS, efficiency gains were closely
related to lower mortality rates and better health outcomes (efficiency being only an intermediate
goal of healthcare systems, whereas better health outcomes are a final objective).

2. Assessment of the Benefits and Costs of DEMSIPP

The reform measures contained under Component 1 were expected to increase quality and
responsiveness of the emergency system. The capacity building fostered by Component 2 was
expected to generate long-term benefits for Croatia (due to a better absorption capacity of EU
Funds) and in particular the health sector (from improved capacities in strategic planning at the
MoHSW). Apart from the benefits that have already materialized, the project is expected to yield
reasonable returns over the next coming years: the benefits from better EMS are persistent and
long-term benefits from the capacity building at the MoHSW are also expected to materialize.
Therefore, the estimated benefits so far (in particular in terms of reduced morbidity) are
conservative. This review focuses on the impact of DEMSIPP most directly related to improved
EMS.

    2.1 Benefits

The benefits related to the project above all include the following ones:

            a. The separation of emergency from non-emergency transport.

The separation of emergency from non-emergency transport was stated as the foremost direct
benefit of DEMSIPP in the Economic and Financial Analysis (EFA) of the PAD. Achieving this
separation does not only constitute a crucial improvement in the allocative efficiency of health
service delivery, but due to the direct impact of EMS on survival rates of patients requiring EMS,
efficiency gains in the area of EMS are closely related to lower mortality rates and better health
outcomes. The most important indicator measuring the achievement of this objective is the
percentage of total calls received that are field calls. The PAD states that field calls refer to those
situations where an ambulance is called out to an emergency in the ‘field’ [a road traffic accident
(RTA), home accident, a collapse in a street, a workplace or school accident or acute illness etc.].
As a consequence, these situations will generally be of an emergency nature and should be dealt
with by EMS.

The baseline value of this indicator cited in the PAD was 9.7 percent as of 2005, and the target
value to be achieved by June 2013 was set at 75 percent. In comparison, the actual percentage
achieved by the end of 2013 was 100 percent. All calls received are field calls and, therefore,
mostly related to situations requiring EMS. EMS Institutes do not provide patient transportation
services any longer.

            b. Improved emergency care outcomes as evidenced by higher survival rates in pre-
               and in-hospital emergency care.


                                                  33
Improved emergency care outcomes are measured in terms of (a) the percentage of patients with
major trauma (often related to motor vehicle accidents) and cardiac arrest cases which survive to
the hospital emergency room admission. No baseline data was available for the PAD, but for both
traumas and cardiac cases the target was exceeded. By the end of 2013, the survival rate for
trauma cases was 92% (actually measured for polytraumas, compared to a target of 90%), while
the survival rate for cardiac arrest cases was 30% (compared to a target of 15%).

The second measure of improved emergency care outcomes is (b) the percentage of patients with
major trauma and cardiac arrest cases which survive 48 hours or more after arriving alive at the
emergency reception area. Again, the target rates were exceeded for both cases by the end of
2013: a survival rate of 94% vs. a target of 90% for traumas (actually measured for polytraumas)
and a survival rate of 64% vs. a target rate of 35% for cardiac cases attest to the success of the
intervention.

            c. Quicker delivery of EMS in terms of arrival in the field and treatment at the
               hospitals.

The quicker delivery of EMS is measured in terms of (a) shortened response times from the
receipt of call to time at the scene. The baseline average response time to scene stated in the PAD
is 16.8 minutes, and the target was set at 80% of response times being lower than 10 minutes in
urban areas and lower than 20 minutes in rural areas. By the end of 2013, the national average
was 10.9 minutes. However, no disaggregation of the average time by rural and urban areas was
available (see Results Framework Assessment). Given that this average includes rural areas and
accounts for 100% of cases, this clearly suggests that the target was rather exceeded than only
achieved.

The second measure of quicker delivery focuses on the elapsed time between the arrival in
emergency receiving area and hospital admission or discharge. Under the baseline, the average
elapsed time to admission/discharge was 110 minutes (and less than 60 minutes for 41% of cases),
and the target was set at an average of 75 minutes (and less than 60 minutes for 80% of cases).
The actual outcome by the end of 2013 was an average of 130 minutes (and less than 60 minutes
for 28% of cases). Despite this, one can argue that the target was effectively exceeded (in
qualitative terms): Due to the changed service delivery model of the new Emergency Centers, the
original target became inappropriate. The emergency services used to perform triage, followed by
either discharges of the non-emergency cases or compensation and transfer of the true
emergencies to hospital admission. The new Emergency Centers with capacity to treat the
emergencies do however not just compensate the cases but also provide the necessary treatment.

            d. A decrease of the cross-country variation in the EMS level

High cross-country variations in EMS were a sign of the existing allocative inefficiencies in the
Croatian EMS system. Two indicators measuring the remaining level of variation are the number
of full time EMS teams/10,000 population (on the supply side) and the county variation in field
calls per capita (on the demand side). The coefficient of variation in terms of the average number
of teams decreased from a baseline value of 0.503 to 0.33 by the end of DEMSIPP
implementation. While the target of 0.20 was missed, a considerable reduction in unjustified
variation was achieved. Given that the population distribution is unequal across the country, and
some rural and sparsely populated areas need to have a higher average in order to be sufficiently
serviced, the initial target appears to have been overestimated. The coefficient of variation
changed from 0.503 to about 0.33 by the end of 2012, and no further effort was made to further
reduce it, because it was considered to be an already optimal level. As far as the county variation

                                                34
in field calls per capita is concerned, the baseline coefficient of variation was reduced from 0.604
to 0.260 by the end of 2013 and, thereby, the reduction exceed the initial target (0.350).

     2.2 Project Costs

The eventual project costs were by almost 50% smaller than planned. Component 1 (which
accounted for the bulk of total project costs) was initially estimated to cost EUR 90.51 million,
but only EUR 49.58 million (or 54.77%) was actually spent. In terms of the overall project, only
EUR 52.54 million out of EUR 92.51 million (or 56.79%) of planned costs was spent.

In terms of recurrent costs following from some of the project interventions (i.e. establishment of
the Croatian institute of EMS, separate dispatch center for each County Institute, integrated
emergency reception areas in hospitals), these are not only low in comparison to the overall
public health budget, but they are likely to be lower than the recurrent costs from unchanged and
inefficient EMS services (e.g. no proper separation of emergency from non-emergency transport)
under the counterfactual of no DEMSIPP.

     2.3 Measures of Economic Efficiency

The EFA of the PAD estimated the NPV of the project to be EURO 37.58 million. It did not,
however, calculate the ERR. The analysis measured the monetary benefits for the cost-benefit
analysis in terms of mortality reductions from improving response times and distribution of teams.
The EFA of the PAD did not account for the benefits related to the second project component
arguing that they are hard to quantify. It referred to targets in Standardized Death Rate (SDR)
reductions as stated in the Results Framework. The final version of the Results Framework does
not, however, contain indicators in terms of SDR reductions. The PAD states a total project
envelope of US$132.77 million. The EFA cites total undiscounted costs related to the DEMSIPP
interventions amounting to US$214.49 million. While the EFA mentions that these costs include
recurrent costs not covered under the project financing, it is unclear how these recurrent costs are
calculated and where they come from.

A reproduction of the NPV presented in the EFA of the PAD was not feasible based on the
available information. Also, technical efficiency gains from separately managed emergency and
non-emergency calls as well as the positive labor market impact from increased labor force
participation as a result of reduced mortality rates cannot be reliably quantified. Nevertheless, the
DEMSIPP clearly corrected a very obvious inefficiency of the Croatian health service delivery
system. Field calls—whether urgent or not—were handled as emergency field calls. This situation
represented a waste of resources, since non-emergency calls can be handled in less resource-
intensive settings than real emergency calls. Furthermore, reduced mortality rates inherently
constitute an increase in social welfare, whether there are additional sizable improvements of
labor market outcomes or not. As a consequence, this assessment of efficiency did not attempt at
a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, it evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the DEMSIPP in terms of
measurable benefits generated and the occurrence of factors during design or implementation that
might have caused non-use of resources to achieve value for money. Considering the achievement
(and partial outperformance) of the indicator targets, the lower than expected costs of the
interventions 57 and the specific focus of the DEMSIPP on one particularly inefficient area within


57
  This is based on the premise that the initial costing of the interventions supported by the project was not
excessive.


                                                     35
the Croatian system of health services delivery that also has an immediate impact on mortality
rates (e.g., EMS), it can be concluded that the project represented the expected least-cost solution
to attain the identified benefits. There was a level 2 restructuring to extend the closing date of the
project by six months, but this was only to enable the implementation of the Geographic
Information System (GIS) for the Croatian Public Health Institute and does not reflect inefficient
project design or implementation. As a consequence, the efficiency of DEMSIPP is rated as high.

Context
During the last 15 years the Croatian health system has undergone significant changes, but
challenges remain in terms of both efficiency and financial sustainability. Regarding health
outcomes, Croatia has fared relatively well but these results have been achieved at a high cost and
the health insurance fund has faced growing deficits. The main challenge in the medium term is
maintaining and improving health outcomes while achieving a steady state level of spending
consistent with a sound fiscal policy framework. This is a challenge common to most countries
in Europe. Croatia is a good performer, with many health outcomes at or above the average of
new EU member states. However, three observations suggested that additional actions are
required to improve the functioning of the health system: (i) the gap with the more developed EU
economies is still large (e.g. Standardized Death Rate (SDR) associated to Motor Vehicle
Accidents (MVAs) is 30 percent higher, and SDRs related to all causes is 22 percent higher,
suggesting significant room to improve outcomes); (ii) the current health outcomes are achieved
at a relatively high cost for the state; and (iii) the upward pressures on spending are likely to
continue due to increasing trends in pharmaceutical spending, technological progress, and aging
of the population.

On the demand side, the instruments commonly used to deter excessive utilization of health
services are not well established in Croatia. Croatia’s share of co-payments in total health
expenditure is less than one percent, a relatively low value.

Regarding the supply of services, the challenges in health care provision extend to the
organizational structure of inpatient and outpatient care, payment mechanisms, and the adequacy
of response of emergency medical services. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were unequally
distributed across the territory of Croatia, with teams facing multiple demands, both emergency
and non-emergency situations. One of the main problems with EMS services was that in addition
to pre-hospital emergency calls, the EMS service also handled a large volume of in-home visits,
which were mostly out-of-hours non-emergency primary health care services, and operated EMS
clinics providing out-patient services to both the general population and patients brought in by
ambulances. The EMS service also provided non-emergency transportation for kidney dialysis.
It was estimated that the overall total emergency calls in Croatia was less than 15 percent of the
total number of calls.

It was envisaged that DEMSIPP would support the reform of EMS services as the first stage in
the restructuring of services given the readiness for implementation, the consensus reached
among the major stakeholders on the process and content of the reform program, and the urgency
to improve services in a sector that is directly related to the tourism industry — an important
source of revenues for Croatia. In addition a good functioning EMS system will also contribute


                                                41
to reductions in SDR from accidents and heart disease, which are relatively high in Croatia
relative to the EU.

Also, financing of a health facilities masterplan will provide a strategy for restructuring the
current health care provider network to better meet the needs of the Croatian population. It will
include plans for adapting the current supply network to decrease acute in-patient beds, increase
day-surgery capacity, and increase long-term care capacity. In addition the masterplan would
recommend improvements in the managerial model prevailing in Croatian hospitals, discuss
various alternatives to improve autonomy and accountability of hospitals, and discuss the scope
for private sector involvement in the supply of services through public-private partnerships. The
health facilities masterplan will complement well the investments financed under the first
component, as these would take place only after the masterplan is completed.

Development of Emergency Medical Services and Investment Planning Project
The Republic of Croatia has received The World Bank loan for the Development of Emergency
Medical Services and Investment Planning Project (DEMSIPP). The DEMSIPP also supported
the National Health Strategy adopted by the Government in March of 2006. The EMS reform
supported by the DEMSIPP would contribute to fulfill the strategic goals laid out in the strategy:
(i) access; (ii) quality; (iii) effectiveness/efficiency; and (iv) economic rationality.

Assessment of the Project Components
In accordance with the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the DEMSPP was implemented
around two components, where the first component aimed at restructuring the emergency medical
services in order to improve the geographical distribution of resources, responsiveness,
efficiency, and quality of services. The second component was focused on complementing supply
side reforms under component 1 by developing restructuring plans for health care facilities and
human resources; and strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Health for developing and
managing projects, some of which could be financed through EU accession funds

Component 1: Development of Emergency Medical Services

According to the PAD, the goal of this component was to improve the geographical allocation of
resources, responsiveness, and efficiency of EMS services. It was organized around four sub-
components, each addressing a specific area of Emergency Service provision and monitoring:

Sub-component 1: Establishment of a Croatian Institute for Emergency Medical Services
The idea was to establish Croatian Institute of Emergency Medicine which will provide overall
policy guidance, set national guidelines and standards for EMS services in Croatia and monitor
the system.

Croatian Institute of Emergency Medicine (hereinafter CIEM) was established in February 2009
by a Government Directive on the establishment of the Croatian Institute of Emergency Medicine
(Official Gazette, No. 28/2009) as an umbrella health institution that integrates, directs and
coordinates the activities in the field of emergency medicine. In 2009 CIEM employed four
workers, in 2010 seven and since 2011 CIEM has 12 full-time employees.

Since its foundation CIEM successfully fulfils its role through the tasks defined by the Health
Care Law (Official Gazette, No. 150/2008, Article 110) and actively participates in all activities
of the reorganization of pre-hospital and hospital emergency medical services and other activities
related to the Project.


                                               42
Through Sub-component 1 CIEM was fully equipped with furniture and office equipment;
standard operating procedures, protocols and algorithms of treatment for emergency medicine
were established ("National Guidelines for the pre-Hospital Treatment of Burns - Initial Care and
Advanced Life Support Procedures“ (2010); "Medical Dispatch Unit" (2011); "The Croatian
Index for Dispatching the Emergency Medicine Call in Medical Dispatch Unit“(2011);
"Elementary Procedures in Emergency Medicine" (2011); "Guidelines for Working in pre-
Hospital Emergency Medical Service" (2012); DVD "Emergency Medical Procedures in pre-
Hospital Conditions"; „Manual for Drivers of Emergency Medical Services˝(2012); „Manual of
Transport Ventilators Usage in Emergency Medicine" (2012); "Triage in the Integrated EMS
Department"; DVD „Emergency Medical Procedures in the Integrated EMS Department").

Sub-component 2: Reorganization of pre-hospital EMS
The originally envisaged purpose of this sub-component was:
- to support the implementation of the national guidelines at the county level on service
organization and standards;

- to upgrade human and capital resources ensuring that they are up the proposed standards,
including the retraining of EMS personnel (course costs, materials, travel, and staff replacement
costs if applicable) and renewing the emergency medical vehicles fleet (financing of new
emergency vehicles (ambulance Class B and C, other emergency types of vehicles) and the
updating the medical equipment in the existing fleet with new medical equipment).

- to create of dispatch centers at the local level and specifically the integration of EMS dispatch
with the 112 call centers, including (i) the training of dispatchers in EMS procedures, (ii) the
acquisition of a priority dispatch EMS module for the computer aided dispatch (CAD) system
which is currently being tested in Split, and (iii) improvements in the communications system
(Tetra), including expanding the coverage of the system and acquiring mobile, hand-held, and
fixed devices for EMS personnel to access the Tetra system.

The Subcomponent 2 activities were implemented as follows:

a) Standards of vehicles and equipment and visual identity of pre-hospital emergency medicine in
accordance with contemporary professional standards were established. Croatian Institute of
Emergency Medicine made technical basis for the Regulations on minimum requirements in
terms of space, workers and medical and technical equipment for the performance of emergency
medicine as a precondition for the establishment of the County Institutes of Emergency Medicine.
b) Complete assessment of the organization of pre-hospital emergency medical services was
carried out. With this analysis important data was obtained, which was required for the
development of the emergency medicine network.

c) Based on CIEMs proposal Minister of Health accepted the Emergency Medicine Network,
which was published in February 2011 (Official Gazette, No. 31/2011). It is the first network of
emergency medicine in the Republic of Croatia and the first document that systematically
arranged layout, number and composition of the teams and the availability of pre-hospital
emergency medical services in Croatia. It was harmonized with each district (regional)
government in regards of its area.

d) Establishment of the County Institutes of Emergency Medicine- twelve (12) County IEMs
started to work in 2011, and nine in 2012. This has fully completed the process of establishing the


                                                43
network of County IEMs, which created basic conditions for the realization of other reform goals
in pre-hospital emergency medicine in each county

e) Various training programs were developed and organized (for dispatchers in medical dispatch
units; doctors and nurses/medical technicians in pre-hospital EMS; drivers in pre-hospital EMS).
From 2011-2013 55 courses were held for employees of pre-hospital EMS.

f) Sixty three (63) models for practicing clinical skills were procured for Institutes of EMS that
are doing training / education according to the Regulations Gazette 146/2003 to enable them to
organize the trainings for the staff of the Institutes.

g) One hundred twenty eight (128) fully equipped EMS vehicles were purchased for County
Institutes of EMS. The handover took place from November 2011 to January 2012.

h) In 2013 TETRA radio devices, telecommunication system and IT system were procured for
County Institutes of EMS – at the time of their establishment 21 county institute of emergency
medicine needed equipment for setting up county emergency medical dispatch centers with all
functionalities which support modern emergency medical dispatch centers. Also medical dispatch
center needed to have direct communication whit emergency medicine. New organization of
emergency medical dispatch units enables continuous monitoring of the entire service 24 hours a
day, with all the necessary interventions. Emergency medical dispatch units are be able to use the
common, standardized work environment, common, centrally updated plans and standard
operating procedures. Because of the use of a common system it is be possible to pool call
taker/dispatcher resources and look for available EMS resources in neighboring counties.
Response times and quality of Emergency Medical Services are improved significantly.

i) As a support for the Ministry of Health’s National Program of publicly available early
defibrillation "Pokreni srce – spasi život” 197 Automatic External Defibrillators (AED), 41
trainer AEDs were procured and 450 people (employees of Ministry of Interior Affairs, Ministry
of Defense and other ministries, national parks, Croatian highways, airports, police academies,
fire schools) were trained about the basic measures of life maintenance with the use of AED.

Sub-component 3: Integration of in-hospital EMS
The goal of this sub-component was to improve responsiveness and efficiency of emergency care
in hospitals by creating integrated EMS departments in major hospitals (3 in clinical hospitals and
minimum 6 and up to 13 in county hospitals). As main activities included in this sub-component
the following were proposed: (i) creation of emergency medical departments in hospitals,
including setting up of staffing, equipment and infrastructure standards as well as assessing
needs; (ii) the rehabilitation of the selected facilities including the design preparation and
construction supervision and the supply medical equipment to the new units; and (iii) training and
re-training of staff to work within the new emergency department environment.

The Subcomponent 3 activities were implemented as follows:
a) Standards of space and specification of equipment for integrated EMS departments in
accordance with contemporary standards, designed technical basis for the Regulations on
minimum requirements in terms of space, workers and medical - technical equipment for the
work of integrated EMS department in hospital as a basic precondition for a unified organization
and equipping of integrated EMS departments were established. According to established
standards in terms of space, integrated EMS departments have triage area, diagnostic space,


                                                44
resuscitation room, emergency operating room and area furnished and equipped to accommodate
and control acute patients.

b) Based on the above mentioned during 2011-2014 thirteen (13) EMS departments were
rehabilitated/constructed and twenty one (21) EMS department (CHC Sestre Milosrdnice, CHC
Rijeka, CHC Osijek, CH Dubrava, CH Sv.Duh, GH Bjelovar, GH Karlovac, GH Čakovec, GH
Koprivnica, GH Zabok, GH Pula, GH Zadar, GH Šibenik, GH Ogulin, GH Gospić, GH
Virovitica, GH Požega, GH Pakrac, GH Slavonski Brod, GH Našice, GH Vinkovci) was fully
equipped with high quality modern equipment, such as anaesthetic devices, X-rays with a mobile
part, vital functions monitors, ECG machines, mobile ultrasound devices, lamps, beds and other
medical equipment.

c) Training programme for triage procedure in integrated EMS departments was developed and
delivered based on the experience with previous World Bank project (Koprivnica in 2003). From
2012-2013 12 trainings were held for the employees of integrated EMS departments.

Sub-component 4: Development of telemedicine projects to support EMS reform
The plan within this Subcomponent was to extend certain telemedicine services to the islands and
other sites to allow for more quality care to be given to the islands’ population and tourism
visitors and for more rational decision making as to when emergency transport from the islands
should be called.

The Subcomponent 4 activities were implemented as follows:

a) Equipment for teleradiology services consisting of CR (Computed radiography) units with
mammography capabilities together with picture preview and editing station and CR Cassette sets
(regular and mammo types) and UPS (uninterruptible power supply) units was procured for 12
locations (of which 7 are on islands): GH "Hrvatski ponos" Knin, Health Center Korčula; Health
Center "Ante Franulović", Vela Luka; Health Center Vrgorac; Health Center Supetar; Health
Center Hvar; Health Center Metković, Health Center Mali Lošinj; Health Center Rab; Health
Center Krk; Health Center Rijeka and Health Center Krževci.

Component 2: Institutional Support for Strategic Planning

According to the PAD, the objective of this component was to complement supply side reforms
under component 1 by developing restructuring plans for health care facilities and human
resources and to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Health to develop and manage
projects, some of which could be financed through EU pre-accession and accession funds.

The rationale for this component stems from two observations: (i) there were significant
investments to be done to improve the efficiency of the health sector that require adequate
planning and managerial capacity at the Ministry of Health; and (ii) the experience in new EU
member states shows that preparation of proposals and plans to make use of EU structural funds
should begin as early as possible. This component includes three sub-components:

Subcomponent 1: Developing Priority Programs- the aim was to develop the strategies and
projects that would assist the MoH to advocate for investing EU funds in the health sector, and
use those funds to achieve a more efficient and effective system.

The Subcomponent 1 main activities were implemented as follows:


                                              45
a) CHBIS- Based on the revised scope than initially planned, the project "Procurement of
Geographical Information Software and Related Services, also known as the Croatian Health
Business Intelligence System (CHBIS) which will support the country’s health care planning was
completed. CHIBS integrates available data sources in support of enabling advanced data analysis
and geographic presentation of information. It will be continuously used and evolved to assist in
decision making related to planning capacities, investments and human resources development in
primary health care, acute and special hospitals, nursing homes, and procurement of medical
services and high cost health technologies. It will also help developing a better understanding of
the health of the Croatian population through analysis of mortality and morbidity indicators on
local, regional and national levels.

b) Developed Hospital Masteplan- Master Plan is a key document for the development of
hospitals and one of the strategic Government documents which purpose is to necessary eliminate
the shortcomings in the functioning of the hospital systems that have piled up for years due to
unplanned expansion of the hospital network and the introduction of unplanned hospital services,
explains the Ministry of Health. The analysis showed that there are large differences among
Croatian hospitals - in bed occupancy, average time of stay in the hospital, the minimum number
of beds in the wards, as well as treatment options. Hospitals for years operate at loss and generate
debts, which is why the existing hospital network model is unsustainable. Based on the Hospital
Masterplan, National Plan for the Development of Clinical Hospital Centres, Clinical Hospitals,
Clinics, and General Hospitals in the Republic of Croatia for the period 2014-2016” was
developed and adopted by the Republic of Croatia.

c) Developed Implementation plan for rationalization and outsourcing/spin off of non-
clinical services in the Republic of Croatia- The aim of the consultancy was to develop a plan
for outsourcing or spinning-off NCS from public hospital in Croatia that includes transition of all
employees as well as providing and managing these services. The plan included identification of
main governance and managerial issues with provision of NCS including identification of the
legal and operational issues involved in creating separate State-owned companies to manage the
NCS. Furthermore, it included identification of advantages and risks of outsourcing or spinning-
off NCS for public hospitals with analysis of the results of outsourcing of various hospitals
implemented prior to 2013. In addition, consultant estimated potential cost savings that could be
accrued by outsourcing or spinning-off NCS in all public hospitals, specified for each service and
each hospital. Draft contract templates for each suggested outsourced/spinned-off service has
been made. Additionally, Action plan was prepared for contract management that will ensure that
outsourcing/spin-off is implemented in the best interest of the public hospital.

d) Developed Human Resources Strategy which will ultimately help in achieving more
efficient, equitable, and sustainable health care system. It will guide and inform future decision
makers with regard to tracking, assessment, recruitment, education, development, allocation,
remuneration, and stimulation of human resources in publicly financed health care system.
Other important activities implemented under Subcomponent 1 are: Business process
reengineering in Croatian institute for health insurance; Integration of national health registers;
Communication support for the Health System Reform (Awareness-raising campaign); training
for 6 professionals (now employed in HZZO) at University of York in Health Technology
Assessment.

Subcomponent 2: Capacity Building for Accessing EU Funds- the aim was to build the human
and institutional capacity at the Ministry and the counties to apply for and making use of pre-
accession and accession funds

                                                46
The Subcomponent 2 activities were implemented as follows:

a) Building the Capacity of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) in
Accessing EU Funds- during 2010 and beginning of 2011 consulting company was hired to help
the staff of the Ministry of Health, the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance, the Croatian
Institute for Public Health and other stakeholders designated by the Ministry of Health to
strengthen capacity for the preparation of development projects and obtaining grant funds from
the EU for efficient use of pre-accession funds and European Union structural funds.
b) Identifying and preparing projects for EU funds (2013)- supported two main strategies: a)
identification of projects with high potential for improving health indicators and increasing the
efficiency of the health service delivery network; b) strengthening of the operational structure
within the Ministry of Health, charged with provision of support to development of projects in the
long term.

Sub-component 3: Project Management - support for the successful execution of the
DEMSIPP- training activities for the Project Management Team, the Project audit and other
technical or training related investments in support of the Project implementation.

a) Study tour to Vienna, Austria- in November 2009 Study tour to Vienna was organized for
employees of Ministry of Health, Croatian Institute for Health Insurance, Croatian Institute for
Public Health and Agency for Quality. The main objective was the overview of Health Austria
Institute database and their activities related to GIS.

b) Study tour to Romania- in April 2010 study tour was organized for the employees of the
MoH and Croatian Institute of Emergency Medicine. The main objective of Study tour to Tirgu
Mures, Romania was to review Emergency medical system in Romania.

c) Study tour to Prag- in October 2010 study tour was organized for the employees of the MoH
and Croatian Institute of Emergency Medicine to review City of Prague Emergency Medical
Service.

d) Study tour to Rome and Bologna-in December 2013 study tour was organized for
representatives of Ministry of Health and two Clinical Hospital Centers to central procurement
agencies in Rome and Bologna to see best practices in implementation of central procurement.

e) Training for Project leader for preparation and management of EU funded projects- in
2013 12 employees of the Ministry of Health attended and successfully finished educational
program „Project leader for preparation and implementation of EU funded projects“ . The main
goal of the educational program is to raise the capacity of selected participants in the field of
development and management of projects financed from EU funds. The program is fully
approved and verified by Croatian Ministry of Science, Education and Sports.
