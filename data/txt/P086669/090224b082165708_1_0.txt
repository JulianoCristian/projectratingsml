                         emergency services from primary health care (PHC), (c) establishment of national management arrangements, (d) integration of emergency reception areas in hospitals, and (e)

                         will be fully functional by the end of the Project).
                         PDO2. The capacity of the Ministry of Health to develop and implement strategic project have increased significantly. A new Health Sector Strategy was approved and new
                         interventions as centralized procurement, Health Technology Assessment and new regulations for compensated drugs are in place. Theses interventions, together with a Hospital
                         Rationalization Master Plan, have created the needed momentum to implement a health sector reform that will be supported by a WB “Program for Results” operation under
