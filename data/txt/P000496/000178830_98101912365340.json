the following\n            main components: (i) support of a four-year maintenance\n            program covering approximately 5,300 km of unpaved roads and\n            tracks; (ii) regravelling of about 400 km of main roads by a\n            production brigade, which will also serve as a vehicle for\n            on-the-job training; (iii) a training program for staff of\n            the Directorate of Public Works; (iv) construction of four\n            ferry boats; (v) technical assistance and fellowships to\n            strengthen (a) the Directorate of Public Works; (b)\n            transport planning in the Directorate of Transport; and (c)\n            operations of the trucking industry; (vi) a study to prepare\n            a rural project; and (vii) completion of the improvement\n            program for cotton feeder roads, started under the Second\n            Highway Project. The proposed project is expected to\n            establish a permanent road maintenance capacity and to\n            contribute to improving accessibility to administrative and\n            commercial centers and to some of the main agricultural\n            production areas."}, "docdt": "1978-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
