PROJECT COHPIETION REPORT
CMAD SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 490-CD) --
HIGHLIGHTS
i.     The project evolved from a Government req'.est for IDA linancing for
improvement and maintenance of feeder roads in cotton-growing areas in
Southern Chad and followed on from the first highway project, Credit No.
125-CD. It was appraised in October 1973, signed in June 1974, and became
effective in January 1975.
ii.     The objective of the second higbhway project was to support the
Government's five-year Cotton Development Program through: (a) a five-year
improvement and maintenance program for about 800 km of feeder roads,
including purchase of equipment and spare parts; (b) a two-year traffic
counting campaign; tc) a training program for specialized public works
personnel; (d) a feasibility study for reconstruction of about 120 km of
cotton export roads; (e) reconditioning and maintenance of nine ferry-boats
and a feasibility study for their replacement; and (f) experts' services
for reorganization of the transport industry.
iii.     The project started about 10 months behind schedule because of
delays in contract finalizing. These delays, coupled with Inflation,
increased costs significantly and the roads improvement and maintenance
program had to be curtailed to three years. The traffic counting program
was also curtailed, to one year. The training program was seriously delayed
by slowness in building the training facilities.
iv.     All studies financed under the project were satisfactorily carried
out and at the time of the last supervision in September 1978, project
implementation was thought to have been generally satisfactory despite
Government failure to comply with the provision of the Covenant concerning
the establishment of a Road Fund (para. 3.03).
v.     Because of the political situation in the country, no supervision
was possible after September 1978. For this reason, information on the
physical status of the project is lacking and it has not been possible to
make any economic evaluation in this report.
vi.     A follow-up third highway project. Credit No. 840-CD was approved
in July 1978.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CHAD SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 490-CD)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01            The transport sector in Chad relies essentially on the
roads network since road hauling accounts for nearly 85Z of total
freight transportation. Due to the low average daily traffic, no road
paving would be economically justified and, therefore, the Bank Group
has so far placed emphasis on road maintenance and regraveling in order
to establish all-weather liaisons between N'Djamena and the different
parts of the country, mainly the potentially rich agricultural southern
region.
1.02      The Bank Group assistance to Chad's transport sector thus far
has been confined to one highway project. The First Highway Project
(Credit 125-CD, US$4.1 million, August 1968) was geared to improving
road maintenance. This road maintenance program was completed in 1973
but physical targets were only partially achieved due to severe budget-
ary constra5nts.
1.03      Under Credit 125-CD, it was envisaged that the Government
would finance all the recurrent expenditures of the five-year mainte-
nance program from 1968 to 1972, as well as the total cost of equipment
renewal in the last two years of the program. To this effect, two
special funds -the Road Fund and the Equipment Renewal Fund- were
created with the provision that some revenues from fuel taxes would be
earmarked for these special funds. Although fuel taxes were increased
as agreed in the Credit Agreement, the Government allocated only 50% of
the estimated revenues from the fuel taxes to these two special funds
due to overall budgetary constraints.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Background
2.01      The Project has evolved from a Government request for a
contribution to a five year Cotton Development Program in Southern Chad.
IDA, the European Development Fund (EDF) and the French "Fonds d'Aide a



-2
la Cooperation (FAC) were involved in the preliminary evaluation of this
program, whose cost was estimated to amount to US$44 million and which
finally was financed by EDP and FAC without IDA contribution. However#
the Government decided then to request IDA financing for the improvement
and maintenance of feeder roads in those cotton growing areas.
2.02      A prelimlnary selection of the most important roads to be
included in the project was made by a team of the Regional Mission for
Western Africa assisted by a FAC specialist acting as a consultant.  The
feasibility study, financed by FAC, was carried out by consultants from
February to July 1973.
B. Appraisal and Project Description
2.03      The project was appraised in October 1973.  Agreement was
reached with the Government on all technical aspects. However two
issues were discussed at the issues meeting: (a) the capacity of the
Government to participate in the local cost financing and (b) the low
economic return (llZ) for the feeder roads program. It was agreed that,
to support the Cotton Development Program, the project was important
and, in view of Chad's deteriorating financial situation, the credit
would finance all the project costs.
2.04      The Project provided for: (a) a five-year improvement and
maintenance program for about 800 km of feeder roads, including purchase
of equipment and spare parts; tb) a two-year traffic counting campaign;
Cc) a training program for the DPW's specialized personnel; (d) a
feasibility study for reconstruction of about 120 km of cotton export
roads; (e) reconditioning and maintenance of 9 ferry-boats and a fea-
sibility study for their replacement and (f) experts' services for
reorganization of the road transport industry.
C. Project Cost and Financing Arrangements
2.05      The project cost was estimated at US$3.5 million with a
foreign exchange component of 76% and the Association accepted to
finance 100% of all components. In order not to disburse for taxes
included in some operating costs, the percentage of expenditure to be
financed for these operating costs was limited to 84% and 88% depending
of the different natures of the components to be financed.
III_ IIMPLEMENTATION
3.01      The Credit Agreement was signed on June 28, 1974 and the
project was expected to become effective in January 1975. This date was
delayed by 3 months. However, in the meantime, the Government submit-
ted, and the Association approved the draft contracts for the training
program, preinvestment studies and the feeder roads maintenance program,
which had to be implemented by the Government controlled semi-public
company COTONCHAD.



-3-
3.02      Nevertheless, the slowness of the Government in finalizing
these contracts increased the delay. At the beginning of its implementa-
tion the Project was about 10 months behind schedule. Because of this
delay and the higher than anticipated rate of inflation (about 30X vi
152 estimated at appraisal), it became rapidly evident that large cost
overruns in the amount of about US$1.5 should be expected. It was
decided to reduce from 5 to 3 years the feeder roads maintenance program
under the Project. A possible Third Highway Project then under
preparation would have included a component to complete the implement-
ation of the five-year program.
3.03      To ensure adequate funds for recurrent maintenance, the
Government agreed to establish a separate Road Fund account in the
Central Bank. This provision of the Credit Agreement has not been
satisfied, although in 1976 all earmarked fuel tax revenues were al-
located to the Road Fund in the Treasury.
3.04      The feeder roads maintenance and improvement program was
satisfactorily implemented on all the roads included in the Project
during the period in which project supervision was possible. Owing to
that performance and to the fact that some adjustments had to be made in
the selection of the roads to be maintained, the Government requested
and the Association agreed that the list of these roads be revised.
Accordingly, an amendment to the Credit Agreement was signed on
June 18, 1977. The new list comprised 760 km of feeder roads.
3.05      The traffic counting program was correctly executed during the
first year of implementation. But it appeared then that the Government
had only scheduled a one-year traffic counting program instead of two
years as originally planned. After review of the first year results,
and in light of the necessity to pursue the feeder roads maintenance
program within the limits of the credit, the Association finally agreed
to limit to one year these traffic counts. The Government agreed to
implement a second year later under the Third Highway Project then under
preparation.
3.06      The training program suffered delays due to slowness in
construction of the training center and procurement of equipment and
unavailability of road maintenance equipment for on-the-job training.
The Government requested, and the Association agreed, that the contract
with the Consultant in charge of the training program be extended in
order to provide continuity with the USAID-financed training program
under the proposed Third Highway Project.
3.07      All studies have been satisfactorily completed.  The feasibi-
lity study for replacement of 9 ferry-boats pointed out that the re-
placement of four of these ferries was economically justified. This
replacement, therefore, was included as a component of the Third Highway
Project. Because the reconstruction of the cotton export road was not
found out economically justified, no further detailed engineering study
was carried out.



- 4-
IV. Disbursoments
4.01      At the time of the last supervision in September 1978, the
actual disbursements amounted to 102Z of the appraisal estimate for that
time.  This was mainly due to large cost overruns.  Neverthelesa, taking
into account the 10 month delay before the start of the project, .his
result shows that the general performance of the Government remained
satisfactory until the end of 1978.

PROJECr COMPLEON REPORT
QAD TERD IGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 840-CD)
HIGHLIGHTS
i.    The project was identified during supervision of the second highway
project (Credit No. 490-CD). Preparatory studies were done by consultants
financed underthat project.
ii.    The objective of the third project was to improve roads maintenarce
and to strengthen transport planning and operations.   Its principal
components were: (a) a four-year maintenance program on approximately 5,300
km of unpaved roads and tracks; (b) regravelling of about 400 km of main
roads; (c) construction of four ferry boats; and d) training, including
fellowships, and technical assistance to strengthen sector institutions.
iii.     Because of the difficult political situation in Chad at the time,
the Credit never became effective and, in accordance with the limit date
for effectiveness specified in the Credit Agreement. lapsed in October
1980.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CHAD THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
b                                          (CREDIT 840-CD)
A. Introduction
1.        The transport sector in Chad relies essentially on the roads
network since road hauling accounts for nearly 85Z of total freight
transportation. Due to the low average daily traffic, no road paving
would be economically justified and, therefore, the Bank group has so
far placed emphasis on road maintenance and regraveling in order to
establish all-weather liaisons between N'Djamfina and the different parts
of the country, mainly the potentially very agricultural southern
region.
2.        The Bank Group assistance to Chad's transport sector thus far
has been confined to two highway projects and transport components in
two other credits. The First Highway Project (Credit 125-CD, US$4.1
million, August 1968) was geared to improving road maintenance. This
road maintenance program was completed in 1973 but physical targets were
only partially achieved due to severe budgetary constraints. The Second
Highway Project (Credit 490-CD, US$3.5 million, June 1974) included:
(a) a five-year program of improvement and maintenance of cotton feeder
roads; (b) a three-year interim maintenance program for ferry-boats;
(c) a training program; (d) a program ot traffic counts; and (e) pre-
investment and road transport industry studies. This project has not
been fully implemented due to the severe economic and political diffi-
culties with which the country was confronted in the late 1970s. Two
other IDA-financed projects also had small transport-related components:
(a) the Rural Fund Project (Credit 664-CD, US$12 million, December 1976)
included maintenance operations on selected feeder roads sections and
(b) the Sahelian Zone Project (Credit 730-CD, US$1.9 million, October
1977) included rehabilitation of six airstrips.
B. Project Preparation
3.        The identification of the Third Highway Project took place in
the years 1975-76 during the supervision missions of the First and
Second Highway Projects. Preparatory studies were carried out by
consultants and financed by the Second Highway Project (Credit 490-CD).
The scope of the project, initially estimated at US$52 million, has been
progressively reduced by elimination of a road construction component
and a reduction of the operating costs for the road maintenance program.

4.        During the period of preparation, the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID), the African Development Bank (ADF),
the Swiss Technical Cooperation (STC), the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) and the Arab Bank for Development in Africa
(BADEA) indicated their interest in co-financing the Project.  At
Appraisal, only USAID and ADF made a firm commitment for parallel
co-financing. USAID financed, with the Government's participation, the
training program, the fellowships and the technical assistance to the                      J
Directorate of Transport. ADF took in charge the road maintenance
program. IDA was financing 100% of all other components except a small
one related to feeder roads improvement (US$350,000) for which the
percentage was limited to 90% in order not to disburse for taxes.
C. Objectives and Content of the Project
5.        The Third Highway Project was designed to improve road main-
tenance and to strengthen transport planning and operations. It was
expected to help improve accessibility to administrative and commercial
centers and to some of the main agricultural production areas. The
project was likely to benefit some of the poorest inhabitants as a
result of the maintenance of 1,300 km of roads and tracks in the
Sahelian zone. Reduced transportation costs would also benefit the
cotton industry, which is the main contributor to Chad's exports, and
the economy as a whole.
6.        The project's main components were: support of a four-year
maintenance program covering approximately 5,300 km of unpaved roads and
tracks; regravelling of about 400 km of main roads by a production
brigade, which would also serve as a vehicle for on-the-job training; a
traluing program for staff of the Directorate of Public Works; cons-
truction by force of four ferry boats; technical assistance and fellow-
ships to strengthen: (a) the Directorate of Public Works; (b) transport
planning in the Directorate of Transport; and (c) operations of the
trucking industry; a study to prepare a rural roads project; and com-
pletion of the improv.ment program for cotton feeder roads, started
under the Second Highway Project.
D.  Implementation                                              )
7.        Because of the political situation, the Project appraised in
April 1977 and signed in September 1978 never became effective. The
Credit 840-CD lapsed in October 1980 when the limit date for effect-
iveness was not further extended.
E. Conclusion
8.        Lack of road maintenance during the civil war resulted in the
deterioration of the network which is now a severe constraint for .he
economic rehabilitaton of the country.
