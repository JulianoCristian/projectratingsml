Loan 1350-CH
PREFACE
This project completion report (PCR) covers a credit project, for
which Loan 1350-CH was approved in November 1976 in the sum of US$25 million.
The loan was closed in October 1981 after cancellation of US$5,189.
The PCR was prepared by the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional
Office on the basis of the country visits in May 1981 and January 1982 and a
draft completion report prepared by the Agricultural Planning Office of the
Ministry of Agriculture (ODEPA), in Chile, delivered to the Bank in July 1982.
The PCR was substantially completed and submitted to OED on November 10, 1982.
Other sources of information for the PCR were: Appraisal Report
No. 100lb-CH dated November 29, 1976; the President's Report No. P-1948-CH
dated December 1, 1976; the Loan Agreement No. 1350-CH dated March 17, 1977;
the audit report (OED No. 2595) for the Chile Agricultural Rehabilitation
Project (Loan 1119-CH), dated June 29, 1979; supervision reports; correspondence
with the Borrower and internal Bank memoranda as contained in relevant Bank
files; and discussions with Bank staff associated with the project.
The PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments on January 21, 1983.
Comments received have been attached to the PCR.
The valuable assistance provided during the preparation of this
report by officials of the Government of Chile and executing agencies is
gratefully acknowledged.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CHILE
LIVESTOCK, FRUITS, VINEYARDS AND AGROINDUSTRY CREDIT PROJECT
Loan 1350-CH
HIGHLIGHTS
The subject project consisted of a line of credit to finance
medium- and long-term on-lending to small- and medium-scale farmers for the
development of livestock, fruits, vineyards, other crops and related
agroindustries. The main objectives of the project were generally met.
Because the initial period of project implementation, 1977 to 1980 was a
time of economic growth, declining inflation, and attractive rising prices
and export opportunities, the bulk of the US$50 million credit line was
exhausted during the first 18 months of project execution. However,
fulfilling the loan covenant to lend 20% of the credit line to the
subsector of the smallest scale farmers (0.1 to 5 basic irrigated ha
(BIH)) took the full four-year investment period. The loan was fully
disbursed 1/ four months after the originally scheduled closing date
(December 1981).
The project was implemented along the parameters related to
categories of investments and beneficiaries given in the loan processing
documents. However, the amount of on-lending expected to benefit agrarian
reform beneficiaries and other small-scale farmers possessing farms ranging
in size from 5 to 12 basic irrigated ha (BIH) 2/ reached only to 17% as
compared to 30% at appraisal. The main reason seems to have been that, up
to late 1979, the Government, trying to interest the banking system in
financing small-scale farmers, did not permit the Small Farmer Development
Institute (INDAP) to provide credit to any of the 40,000 beneficiaries of
the agrarian reform. Livestock development, mainly dairy, accounted for
about 44% of the investments made under the project; fruits and vineyards
took some 25%; and other on-farm investments and agro-industries used about
31%. Farmers contributions to their development plans, as an average,
were of the order of 40% as compared to 20% expected at appraisal. The
main items of investment that will help increase production were aimed at
establishing 4,000 ha of improved cultivated pastures; planting about 3,200
ha for fruit development, mainly table grapes and apples for export and
planting; and renovating some 2,000 ha of vineyards. Of special interest
to the smallest scale farmers was the planting of some 1,000 ha of
vegetables, the installation of 4,000 beehives, and equipment for honey and
1/   Except for cancellation of US$5,189.

best soils in the Maipo Valley; it was an index of production
potential utilized to establish farm size correlation under the
Agrarian Reform laws.

wax production. Under agroindustries, the main investments went for the
modernization and expansion of fruit packing plants, cheese plants, grading
and packing facilities for beans and lentils for export, and poultry
processing plants.
At appraisal time, the economic rate of return of the project was
estimated at 27%, while the financial rate of return of the farm models
ranged from 14% to 22%. Based on the field sample survey made by ODEPA for
the ex-post evaluation of the project, the actual economic rate of return
of the project is estimated to be at least 20%, with rates for individual
farm models ranging from 20% to over 30% at 1982 prices.
Points of interest of this project experience are:
- project lending was far beyond appraisal expectations as a
result of favorable and attractive sector environment (PCR,
para 4.02);
- the subject of smallest-scale farmers, minifundistas, per se
and the institutional arrangements to assist them was a subject
of considerable discussion between the Borrower and the Bank
(PCR, paras 2.04, 4.03, 4.04, 4.08, 6.01, 6,03); and
- participating farmers adjusted their cropping patterns to the
changed factor and product prices; new production technologies
were introduced and, as a result, labor utilization and farm
incomes increased significantly (PCR, para 4.09).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CHILE
LIVESTOCK, FRUITS, VINEYARDS AND AGROINDUSTRY CREDIT PROJECT
Loan 1350-CH
I. BACKGROUND
The Agricultural Sector During the Project Years
1.01      In 1977, the first project year, the Chilean economy was recovering
from a recession that began with a drastic drop in copper prices in 1975 and
bottomed out in the first quarter of 1976. The period 1977 to 1980 was one
of economic growth, declining inflation, and increasing agricultural land
prices, investments, production and exports.
1.02      Agricultural value added grew by an average real rate of 6% a year
during the period mentioned. The most dynamic products were those for which
Chile has a large comparative advantage -- table grapes, apples, peaches,
pulses and wine. The trend for crops for domestic use varied; cereal
production declined but production of pulses and vegetables increased. Wheat
and dairy production were the hardest hit by import competition. Between
late 1977 and 1980, short-term real interest rates declined and the
availability of long-term credit increased, largely as a result of foreign
capital inflows. Prices for most agricultural goods were favorable during
these years and, after several years of practically no agricultural
investment, demand for agricultural credit was strong and investments at farm
level extensive. Key indicators reflecting this background are given in the
attached Table 1.
Bank Involvement in the Agricultural Sector
1.03      The Bank has made six loans for agriculture and agroindustry to
Chile since 1948, totalling about US$70 million. The earliest operations (in
1948 and 1951, respectively) financed agricultural machinery and irrigation
improvements. These were followed by a livestock operation and one for milk
and meat processing facilities, both in 1963.
1.04      In 1975, the Bank financed an Agricultural Rehabilitation Project
(Loan 1119-CH) which provided short- and medium-term credit to farmers as
well as technical assistance for agricultural public sector institutions (see
para 2.01). This loan was disbursed in slightly over a year and more than
70% of the credit provided under the project went to small-scale farmers
owning 12 BIH of land or less. The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR
No. 2595) of June 29, 1979 found that the project contributed to the recovery
of the agricultural sector through direct support of production. The Bank's
dialogue with the Government in the context of this loan also helped
accelerate the titling of properties assigned under the land reform and the
liberalization of agricultural prices.



II. PROJECT FORMULATION
Identification
2.01      In November 1973, a Bank agricultural reconnaissance mission
visited Chile at the request of the new Government that took power in
September of the same year. The mission specifically recommended (report
dated December 4, 1973) that a livestock project and a fruit and vineyards
project, prepared under the previous Government, with Bank assistance should
be promptly revised to reflect current conditions, with a view to early
lending. Two additional mission recommendations, relevant to the final
design of the subject project, were: (a) to find ways to assist those
possessing farms up to 5 BIH, known in Chile as' minifundistas, who, in spite
of their large number (about 200,000), had not participated in or benefited
from the agrarian reform programs conducted during the previous regimes of
Presidents Frei and Allende; and (b) to give immediate priority to preparing
a rehabilitation project to assist Chile in financing the import of essential
inputs and supplies for the 1974/75 crop year. The latter recommendation led
to the immediate preparation and rapid implementation (1975/76) of the
Agricultural Rehabilitation Project partially financed under Bank Loan
1119-CH (para 1.04). An FAO/CP Project Identification Mission visited Chile
in October 1974 to assist the Government in identifying a new project.
Preparation
2.02      The project was prepared by an FAO/CP mission in February 1975
which integrated the two projects originally prepared by the Development
Corporation (CORFO). The new project provided for credit to be made
available to some 4,800 farmers, the majority of whom would be small-scale
farmer beneficiaries of the agrarian reform. The on-farm investments to be
financed would be for new plantations of orchards and vineyards, dairy and
sheep/beef development as well as for improvement of annual crops; funds were
also to be available for related agroindustries. Expanded efforts in
technical assistance, training and applied research were recommended in each
field.
Appraisal
2.03      A Bank mission visited Chile from September 22 through October 16,
1975 to appraise the project. As there were no substantive issues, the usual
issues paper and decision meeting stages of project processing were foregone;
instead, a memorandum of record highlighting the project's main features was
issued on November 7, 1975. Preparation of the SAR and other loan documents
proceeded without problems and the respective documents went to the Loan
Committee on July 6, 1976. For country reasons, clearance of loan documents
was held up by the Loan Committee until October 27, 1976 and negotiations
took place the week of November 8, 1976.
Negotiations
2.04      The only point of contention during negotiations related to the
Bank's position that it was necessary to guarantee that a portion of project
funds be channelled to the smallest scale farmers sector (para 2.01).



- 3 -
Departing from the criteria used under the previous project (Loan 1119-CH),
the Bank agreed with the Chilean negotiators to have, in the loan agreement,
two subcategories of small-scale farmers: (a) small-scale farmers,
minifundistas, with farms up to 5 BIH, and (b) other small-scale farmers,
including beneficiaries of the agrarian reform, with farms ranging from 5 to
12 BIH. The position of the Government was that, in the Chilean context, 5
BIH was considered the minimum farm size necessary to support a family, and
thus the two agrarian reform laws passed in Chile established that small
family farms be no less than 5 BIH and up to 12 BIH. Reluctantly, however,
the Chilean authorities accepted the Bank proposal that 20% (US$10 million)
of the total project lending program (US$50 million) be earmarked for lending
to farmers in the subcategory of small-scale farmers, minifundistas.
Board Presentation and Approval
2.05      On November 7, 1976, the loan was approved by the Bank's Board.
After some discussion of the Chilean Government policies, support for the
loan was voiced by the majority of members who felt that it was a sound
project and that, by directing 20% of project funds to the smallest scale
farmers, the loan was addressing production as well as income distribution
issues.
III. THE PROJECT, SCOPE AND OTHER FEATURES
3.01      The subject operation was a straightforward agricultural credit
project to provide investment loans to small- and medium-scale farmers for
the development of livestock, fruits, vineyards and related agroindustries.
To this effect, a lending program, amounting to US$50 million, financed in
equal parts by the Bank and the Borrower, was established at the Central Bank
(CB), which, in turn, was to channel the funds to project beneficiaries
through subloans made by participating banks and INDAP.     The sum of US$10
million (20%) of the lending program was earmarked for lending to small-scale
farmers, minifundistas (para 2.04).
3.02      The project was to provide medium- and long-term credit to some
4,300 small-scale farmers, including about 2,500 minifundistas, to an
estimated 500 medium-sized farmers owning up to 80 BIH and to some 80
agroindustrial enterprises. The investments to be financed under the project
were to be carried out over a four-year period (mid-1977 through mid-1981).
An important feature of the project was its expected impact on Chile's
balance of payments through import substitution of livestock products and
promotion of exports of products such as fruits for which Chile enjoyed a
comparative advantage because of its soils and Mediterranean climate, which
permitted these crops to be grown during the northern hemisphere's winter
season.
3.03      CB was to lend project funds to participating banks and other
financial institutions under subsidiary loan agreements whose terms and
conditions were acceptable to the Bank. Payments of interest and principal
under subsidiary loans were to go to CB's project account. The balance of
this account, after servicing the proposed Bank loan, was to be used for
further lending to the agricultural sector, during a period of 15 years.



Although all commercial banks and other lending institutions were eligible to
participate, it was expected that three Government entities would handle most
of the on-lending. These were the State Bank (BECH), then the largest bank
in Chile; INDAP; and CORFO. Participating banks (PBs) were to assist project
beneficiaries in preparing loan requests based on farm development plans,
which would include cash flow projections.
3.04      CB on behalf of the Borrower was to refinance 100% of the amounts
of subloans made by participating entities. The outstanding principal amount
of subsidiary loans made by CB to PBs and of subloans made by PBs to project
beneficiaries was to be adjusted in accordance with the variation of the
Borrower's CPI. Interest rates charged on the adjusted principal were to be
within the following range:

CB to PBs                             2.5% to 4.5% 1/             4.5% to 8.5%
PBs to Beneficiaries                  6% to 8% 2/                 8% to 12%
This flexible range provided, however, that, in no case would the spread
between the interest charged by CB and the corresponding subloan made by the
PBs be more than 3.5 percentage points. Repayment periods were to be
established in accordance with cash flow projections, with a maximum of 15
years, including up to five years of grace. The cost of breeding stock
included in the investment plans was not to exceed, on the average, 30% of
the total cost of the investment plans, and in no case the equivalent of 50%
of an individual investment plan.
IV. IMPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness and Start-up
4.01      Conditions of effectiveness of the loan required the Government to
deposit US$7 million equivalent in the project account with CB and CB to
enter into subsidiary loan agreements with BECH and INDAP and at least one
other participating financial intermediary. These conditions were promptly
met and the project was declared effective, as expected, in June 1977. There
was no problem in starting implementation; actually, the project moved so
fast that lending during the first six months after effectiveness reached
US$23 million (46% of the lending program), as compared to US$2.6 million
expected at appraisal.
Project Implementation Progress
4.02      The pace of actual project implementation, as compared to the
appraisal estimate, is clearly reflected in the following table showing the
progress of the lending program (which in practice constituted the project)
from the time of effectiveness (June 1977) to the actual closing date in
December 1981.

As indicated in this table, the project lending level during the first 18
months (to December 1978) was far beyond appraisal expectations. This
performance apparently came about as the result of (a) attractive prices
prevailing at that time for dairy and agricultural export products; (b) high
demand for on-farm investment funds by a badly decapitalized agricultural
sector; (c) attractive project lending terms and interest rate (between 6%
and 12% on adjusted principal) compared with prevailing market terms and
interest rates (14% to 18%); and (d) active participation of 17 private
banks, most of which were re-established after the change of Government in
1973. The breakdown of subloans granted by farm size (para 4.06) reflected
that the faster-than-anticipated pace of lending during the first 18 months
was entirely due to the amount of subloans made to commercial farmers. While
by December 1978, nearly the total amount allocated for lending to commercial
farmers and agroindustries (US$40 million) had been disbursed or committed,
less than 40% of the funds earmarked for small-scale farmers, minifundistas,
had been disbursed. It took nearly three more years and substantial effort
on the part of the Bank to achieve the target of directing of at least 20% of
the lending funds to benefit small-scale farmers, minifundistas (under 5
BIH), as required by the loan agreement.
Implementation Problems and Revisions Made
4.03      The slow pace of lending to small-scale farmers with under 5 BIH,
as compared to the far greater than expected speed in lending to farmers with
12 BIH or more, was an early concern of project supervision missions and
eventually became the only significant issue between CB and the Bank. CB
took the position that, due to the small size of the minifundista farms and
restrictive clauses under the loan agreement, such as the scope of
investments eligible for financing and the fact that no more than 30% of the
investments should be for cattle purchase, it was not possible for the
participating institutions to fulfill the quota assigned for this type of
lending. Therefore, CB requested, but the Bank denied, permission to
increase the size of minifundista farms from up to 5 BIH to up to 10 BIH.
The Bank, on the other hand, held that the principal reason for the slow pace
of lending to small-scale farmers, mainly the minifundistas, was CB's
insistence on seeking to reach such farmers through private banks, even
though these banks showed no interest in such lending, citing higher costs
and risks. The Bank informed the Borrower of its concern at the PBs lack of
interest in financing small-scale farmers and indicated its willingness to
amend certain restrictive clauses of the loan agreement, except the size of
farms, provided that outstanding balances of funds available for the lending
program earmarked for minifundistas were transferred to INDAP.



- 6 -
4.04      After discussions between a Bank mission and pertinent CB and
Ministry of Agriculture authorities, the issue was resolved, with the
following corrective measures taken by the Borrower and the Bank:
(a) Through subsidiary loan agreements with 17 participating banks
and INDAP, CB had originally allocated to them quotas of the
lending program (with an average of US$2 million) to relend to
farmers in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in
the loan agreement, including the covenant regarding 20% lending
to minifundistas. However, since it became clear that the banks
were not lending to minifundistas in the proportions expected,
the following actions were taken by CB: (i) the allocation to
INDAP was increased from USS3 million to US$10 million, with the
understanding that at least 50% of the latter would be lent to
minifundistas; (ii) the participating banks were notified by CB
that any part of the funds allocated to them and earmarked for
minifundistas, but not utilized by December 30, 1978, would be
cancelled; and (iii) it was agreed by CB that such cancelled
balances (amounting to about US$6.6 million) would be assigned to
INDAP for its 1979 lending program); and
(b) To overcome other deterrent factors in lending to small-scale
farmers, amendments were made to the loan agreement which (i)
broadened the scope of on-farm investments to be financed in the
case of small-scale farmers to include any viable investment in
agricultural activities, going beyond the loan agreement, i.e.,
livestock, fruits and vineyards; and (ii) exempted small-scale
farmers from the restriction that no more than 50% of the
investment financed would be for cattle purchase.
4.05      The other amendments to the loan agreement during the life of the
project concerned two reallocations of funds to reduce the amounts
earmarked for fruits, vineyards and agroindustries and increase the amount
for livestock. The following table compares the amounts allocated by
investment category under the loan agreement and the amounts actually
disbursed:

Lending by Type of Beneficiaries
4.06      In accordance with the loan agreement, 20% (US$10 million) of the
lending program amounting to US$50 million was earmarked for benefitting
farmers with between up to 5 BIH (para 3.01). Additionally, the SAR and
the President-s Report supporting the loan stated that 50% of the lending
program was expected to benefit small-scale farmers with farms of up to 12
BIH. Therefore, 50% of the lending program was to benefit medium-scale
farmers, those working farms ranging in size from 12.1 to 80 BIH. As shown
in the table below, the covenant related to the proportion of the lending
program that should benefit small-scale farmers with up to 5 BIH was
fulfilled; the proportion lent to other small-scale farmers, however, was
below the expectations at appraisal, and the amount lent to commercial
farmers was higher than estimated.

Table Notes: (a) Benefits of agroindustry loans estimated at appraisal at
20% for up to 5 BIH and 30% for 5.1 to 12 BIH
beneficiaries were reduced to about 10% and 20% under
actual estimates.
(b) Figures given under ODEPA report covering implementation
only to February 1981 were adjusted to include lending of
US$2.9 million after that date (of which 2.5 million was
lent to some 700 small-scale farmers with up to 5 BIH).
Number of Subloans and Beneficiaries
4.07      Regarding the number of subloans to small-scale farmers, it is
relevant to indicate that, the figures given in the supervision reports,
obtained from CB's statistics differ substantially from those given by
ODEPA in its draft completion report and those used in this report.
According to CB (letter to Bank, September 3, 1982), the distortion came
about because of their mistake in interpreting the statements of



expenditures provided by INDAP. In most cases the number given by INDAP
represented partial disbursements for one subloan, but were interpreted by
CB as separate subloans, and thus the total number of subloans to
small-scale farmers came to about 8,000 instead of the actual 3,900.
Lending to Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries
4.08      The small-scale farmers with farms ranging in size from 5 to 12
BIH, a category integrated by traditional small farms, plus some 40,000
beneficiaries of the agrarian reform, were expected at appraisal to account
for about 30% of total lending while actually they accounted for only 17%.
The main reason for this seems to be that, besides the already mentioned
reluctance of private banks, to serve small-scale farmers, INDAP was not
permitted to lend to agrarian reform beneficiaries until late in 1979.
However, by the time the Government decided to permit such lending, the
only project funds still available were some US$3 million earmarked for
lending to small-scale farmers with less than 5 BIH. As of 1981, the
agrarian reform farmers were assisted by INDAP as part of its US$18 million
lending program partially financed by the new Bank Loan 1902-CH.
Physical Progress
4.09      According to the analysis made by ODEPA, as part of the ex-post
evaluation of the project, livestock, mainly dairy, accounted for about 44%
of the investments made, fruits and vineyards (25%) and agroindustries and
others (31%). 1/ The survey indicates that participating farmers adjusted
their cropping pattern to the changed factor and product prices for the
different agricultural production lines. This resulted in an expansion
especially of table grape and dairy production largely at the expense of
annual crops. Parallel to this development, new production technologies
were introduced (grapes under trellises, higher fertilizer use for pastures
and grapes, artificial insemination). As a result, labor utilization and
farm incomes increased significantly. Another general observation was
that, as an average, beneficiaries' contributions to project costs were of
the order of 40%, as compared to 20% estimated at appraisal.
4.10      The main items of investment under the four categories of
investment reported by ODEPA were:
(a) Livestock: Establishment of 4,000 ha of improved cultivated
pastures, mainly mixture of clovers and grass; purchase of some
35,000 head of dairy and beef breeding cattle, mainly cows and
heifers; and some 30,000 head of breeding sheep.
(b) Fruits and Vineyards: Planting of some 3,200 ha for fruits,
mainly table grapes (under trellises), apples, nuts, cherries,
avocados, and nectarines, and planting and renovation of some
2,000 ha of vineyards for wine-making.
1/   When CB maintained the records, project investments were arbitrarily
recorded under one of the three categories established in the loan
agreement; however, when ODEPA took over, it opened a new category,
"other," and adjusted CB statistics accordingly.

(c)   Agroindustry: Equipment for modernization and expansion of
various fruit cold storage and packing plants; installation and
equipment for modernization of two cheese plants; expansion of a
cleaning, grading and packing plant for beans and lentils for
export; installations and equipment for two integrated poultry
production and processing plants; construction and installation
of wine caskets for 200,000 liters of wine; and improvement and
expansion of several wine and pisco plants.
(d) Other Investments: Drainage and leveling of 4,200 ha of land;
200 km of fences for ranches and crop farms; some 4,000 beehives
and equipment for honey and wax production; planting of about
1,000 ha of crops other than fruits and vineyards; tractors;
spray irrigation equipment; farm equipment and tools; lined
ditches, water tanks and ponds; and farm installations for
storage and other uses.
V. FINANCIAL RESULTS
5.01      The financial evaluation was carried out on the basis of farm
models (eight in the appraisal report and seven according to ODEPA). ODEPA
made some changes in model specifications which seem justified in the light
of the survey data and in the technical assumptions (yields, etc.),
although they deviated somewhat from those in the appraisal. The most
significant differences between the pre- and post-analyses are in prices.
The appraisal used the Bank's 1976 international commodity price forecasts
and ODEPA used actual 1978 prices and, for comparison, 1982 prices which
reflect a deteriorated input and output price relationship in comparison to
1976.
5.02      In the appraisal report, the farm models were defined and
analyzed as follows:

5.04      In general, the ODEPA ex-post analysis gives substantially better
results than were anticipated at appraisal, even using the deteriorated
1982 prices. As indicated in paragraph 5.01, this is mainly due to better
than expected prices and to a lesser extent a result of improved yields.
Another reason is ODEPA's assumption that no economic activity and/or
benefits were obtained in the "without project" situation or would have
materialized without the project. This assumption cannot be considered
realistic. The extent of this omission can best be judged by recalculating
the Bank appraisal models on the same basis. The effect on models 1 to 5
(Bank) is an increase in the rates of return by between 1.2% and 4.4%.
From this it can be deduced that, if consideration would have been given to
without project benefits in the ODEPA analysis, the rates of return would
not be reduced to marginal levels.
5.05      The ODEPA analysis does not calculate an economic rate of
return. However, considering (a) that the economic rates of return in the
Bank analysis were depending on the models between 6 and 17 percentage
points higher than the financial returns, and (b) that there are no
significant interventions in the factor and product markets in Chile, it is
safe to assume that the aggregate economic rate of return based on the
ODEPA analysis is at least 20%, even at 1982 prices.
VI. BANK/BORROWER PERFORMANCE
6.01      In general terms, the performance of the Borrower and the Bank
was normal and satisfactory. However, as indicated in previous chapters,
the subject of small-scale farmers, minifundistas, per se and of the
institutional arrangements to assist small-scale farmers in general was a
subject of considerable discussion between the Borrower and the Bank from
the time of negotiations to the end of the second year of project



implementation. The Borrower, under its economic policy based on private
sector initiative, the subsidiary role of Government, and free market
forces open to trade and capital movements, was opposed to the Bank's
policy of earmarking specific portions of project funds for minifundista
farmers or any other category of farmers. Also in line with its policy,
the Borrower wanted commercial banks to handle the lending to small-scale
farmers, and did not initially share the Bank's desire to support and
strengthen INDAP's role in lending and providing technical assistance to
such farmers. The Bank endorsed the long-term goal of having banks serve
small-scale farmers, but was skeptical that the private banks could
adequately satisfy small-scale farmers' credit needs in the short term.
Therefore, the Bank felt that INDAP's functions would be to attend to the
credit needs of the small-scale farmers until the private banking sector
had demonstrated the ability to do so.
6.02      During the first years of project implementation, in order to
stimulate commercial bank lending to small-scale farmers, the Government
introduced several measures to improve the conditions that had heretofore
made lending to small-scale farmers unattractive: (a) land mortgage
payments by reformed small-scale farmers to the Agrarian Reform Corporation
(CORA) were converted to an annual tax, equivalent to annual payment quotas
pending (25 to 28 years), payable to the Treasury in the same manner as any
other real estate taxes; therefore, as of mid-1979, reformed farmers
could, for the first time, offer their land as collateral to obtain credit
from banks or other financial institutions; (b) the Government, through
INDAP, implemented a crash program to provide titles to thousands of
minifundistas and other small-scale farmers, who, for various reasons, had
no titles to their land; (c) by the end of 1979, the Government issued a
decree under which all loans made by BECH and CORA to the reformed farmers
before 1978 that had repayments overdue and, in most cases, were under
legal process, were automatically consolidated for repayment on the same
long-term basis (25 to 28 years) as the land mortgages; and (d) a decree of
December 1979 authorized that, in the case of small-scale farmers, loan
guarantees involving land or chattel mortgages could be written as private
documents instead of as the costly and time consuming legal deeds
registered by public notaries.
6.03      In spite of Government efforts to make lending to small-scale
farmers attractive to commercial banks, they never became interested in
such a market and their lending of project funds to small-scale farmers was
insignificant compared to their lending to commercial farmers. Moreover,
during 1979 and the greater part of 1980, institutional credit and
technical assistance to small-scale farmers were greatly hampered as a
result of the ongoing institutional reforms geared to fit the new economic
policies. Specifically, the situation was: (a) with the closing of CORA in
December 1978, BECH, which, from 1975 up to 1978, had been the only source
of production credit to small-scale farmer beneficiaries of the agrarian
reform, under guarantee contracts with CORA, ceased to finance such
reformed farmers; meanwhile, because the Government wanted economically
viable reformed farmers to be increasingly served, by the private banks as
were commercial farmers, INDAP was not authorized to serve them; (b) there
was great uncertainty about the future of INDAP, since the justification
for existence of this agency was under debate; (c) BECH, under the new
Banking System Law, had lost its traditional privileges of State Bank and



- 12 -
thus also became reluctant to provide credit to small-scale farmers in
general; (d) the Agricultural Extension Service was discontinued and
replaced by a Private Technical Assistance (ATE) scheme that failed to
perform as expected; and (e) when in 1979 the Government authorized INDAP
to assist reformed farmers, INDAP had no resources with which to work.
6.04      The Borrower honored the loan covenants.   Project accounts were
properly maintained and their audits as well as the reporting of progress
in project implementation were, in general, satisfactory. The quality of
Bank's supervision was viewed by executing entities as good, the frequency
(over two missions per year) was satisfactory, but little fime was allowed,
espcially for field visits.
VII. LESSONS LEARNED AND CONCLUSIONS
Lessons Learned
7.01      The changes introduced in the follow-up Agricultural Credit
Project (Loan 1902-CH) and the new approach of the Government, since 1980,
toward assisting small-scale farmers are, to a great extent, indications of
the lessons learned throughout the implementation of the subject project.
Under the new credit project, minifundistas are no longer a subcategory,
but are included with the group of small-scale farmers owning up to 12 BIH,
for whom 33% of project funds is earmarked. The scope of lending is no
longer restricted to specific on-farm investments, but any economically
viable on-farm investment or related agroindustry may be financed; also,
consistent with the modifications made under Loan 1350-CH, financing of
breeding stock in the case of small-scale farmers is not restricted to 50%
of total farm plan financing.
7.02      Regarding the new attitude of the Government toward assisting
small-scale farmers, the actions taken since the end of 1978 represent a
positive appreciation of the role of INDAP in this respect. By
instructions of the Government, CB, out of the proceeds of the new project,
gave allocation priority to INDAP and thus financed its total requirements
for investment subloans to small-scale farmers during 1981 and 1982, for a
total of US$40 million, or 55% of total project funds. The Government has
stated that, among others, the role of the Ministry of Agriculture is to
take care of the credit and technical assistance needs of small-scale
farmers, and, to that effect, it has taken action and has further plans to
strengthen INDAP so that it can be the executing entity responsible for
such assistance to small-scale farmers, including beneficiaries of agrarian
reform.
Conclusions
7.03      The main objectives of the project were generally met. The
significant investments made for the development of export crops, mainly
fruits, made a contribution to the great increase in the value of exports,
which in 1981 was three times higher than in 1976. The investments made to
develop livestock, mainly dairy, also contributed to import substitution,
and no doubt helped improve the standard of living of the great number of

small-scale farmers who benefitted under the project. Of no less
importance is the indirect contribution of the project to the strengthening
of INDAP, the small-scale farmers' institute. It is not possible at this
stage to quantify the benefits or impact of the project on the country's
economy, but the analysis of data and interviews with farmers presented in
the report of the ex-post evaluation made by ODEPA clearly indicate that,
overall, the project contributed satisfactorily, both in terms of financial
returns to the farmers and in benefits to the country.

MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE
Office of the Minister
Mr. Shiv S. Kapur
Director
Operations Evaluation Department
World Bank
Dear Mr. Kapur:
I have pleasure in replying to your letter of January 21, 1983,
transmitting the provisional performance report on the Livestock, Fruit,
Vineyards and Agroindustry Project (IBRD 1350-CH), based essentially on
supervision visits by World Bank staff and the Evaluation Study of this loan
done by Chile's Agricultural Planning Office in 1982.
The document furnishes a fairly clear picture of the performance of
the project and the main problems that arose during its execution.
Particularly noteworthy among the achievements of the project are the
number of farmers benefited (approximately 4,500) and the investments made
possible: in fruit and grape cultivation (5,200 ha); livestock (establishment
of 4,000 ha of pasture, and purchase of nearly 35,000 head of cattle and
30,000 sheep), and agroindustry (setting up of plants of various types).
The problems encountered in implementing the loan relate mainly to
the constraint that a minimum of 20% of the Program's resources had to be
placed in the miniholding category. They were resolved satisfactorily during
the course of the Program.

The project was a notable success, both for the individual farmers
and in terms of the benefits it yielded to the country as a whole. This
success is due in large measure to the support furnished by the supervision
missions that visited Chile during the course of the project and by this
Ministry and the Central Bank, and to the substantial participation by
commercial banks.
Finally, under this line of credit this Ministry has developed a
methodology for measuring its impact on the sector; as our first experience in
this field, it no doubt suffers from certain deficiencies which we expect to
correct in connection with future commitments of this nature.
I thank you once again for the valuable contribution made by World
Bank staff to the success of the project.
Yours sincerely,
/s/ Jorge Prado Aranguiz
Minister of Agriculture
