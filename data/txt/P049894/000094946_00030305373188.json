  improve service delivery, and quality of health care. Within\n            the strategic context, the project will enhance critical\n            social services, assist vulnerable groups, and build\n            institutional capacity. There are four components. 1)\n            Training will be provided under the primary health care\n            development component, supporting health care services\n            delivery. It includes activities in physician retraining\n            programs; development of specific disease management\n            protocols and treatment guidelines; production of teaching\n            materials; development of a national health sector human\n            resources training plan; ensuring standards for family\n            health centers, compatible between training and facility\n            upgrading components; and, medical personnel retraining. 2)\n            The health facilities rationalization, and development\n            component, will ensure implementation of health systems\n            plans in two regions, in consultation with local\n            administrations, service providers, and stakeholders. 3) The\n            health care financing system, will develop a methodology for\n            population-based funding at the regional level, to be tested\n            only in pilot regions. 4) Management and institutional\n            capacity within the Ministry of Health, and, administrations\n            in pilot regions/hospitals, will be strengthened."}, "docdt": "2000-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
