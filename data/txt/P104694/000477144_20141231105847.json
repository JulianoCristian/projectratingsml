Policy Program received a moderately satisfactory outcome\n            with negligible to low risk to development outcome. The Bank\n            and Borrower\u0092s performance were both moderately satisfactory\n            as well. No restructurings of this project or any other\n            major changes were recorded. Several lessons were learned\n            from this project and include the following: (1) The program\n            highlights the importance of a comprehensive approach to\n            reform. (2) There is a need for higher level of coordination\n            for policy reforms in higher education reform than that\n            provided by the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET).\n            (3) An integrated strategy with a mix of different\n            instruments works effectively in support a comprehensive\n            reform program, but delays in the approval of implementation\n            of activities under one instrument can lead to delays in the\n            approval or implementation of another. (4) Vietnam\u0092s\n            consensus building process takes time. It would be important\n            to build in additional time into the implementation schedule\n            of future operations to incorporate adequate time for\n            consensus building, but to do so on the basis of a realistic\n            timetable that would ensure consistent and continued\n            progress towards critical policy measures. (5) Flexibility\n            in adjusting Prior Actions and Benchmarks is important\n            towards the eventual achievement of a program\u0092s development\n            objectives. (6) There is a need to carefully identify\n            realistic outcomes that can be expected to result from the\n            adoption of policy actions over an implementation period\n            from policy actions selected as prior actions or triggers.\n            (7) In an instrument structured as the Higher Education\n            Development Policy Program (HEDPP), a policy-based operation\n            with funding provided to the Government for policies is\n            adopted, but the timing between adoption of policies and\n            results expected through autonomous institutions, the Higher\n            Education Institution (HEIs), was too ambitious."}, "docdt": "2014-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
