1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      The Higher Education Development Policy Program (HEDPP) was designed to
support the Government of Vietnam (hereafter “the Government”) in the implementation
of its Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006-2010 (SEDP) and its Higher Education
Reform Agenda 2006-2020 (HERA). The HEDPP comprised a programmatic series of
three single-tranche Development Policy Credits (DPCs) to support the sustained
implementation of selected elements of the Government’s reform agenda. It aimed to
strengthen governance, rationalize financing, improve the quality of teaching and
research, improve accountability for performance, and enhance transparency in financial
management within the higher education sector.

2.      Vietnam had experienced rapid and consistent growth and poverty reduction since
launching its transition towards market mechanisms in 1986. GDP growth had averaged
over 7.5 percent per annum over the period of 2006 – 2010, the poverty rate had declined
from 58.1 percent in 1993 to 14.5 percent in 2008 (and continued to fall), and Vietnam
was on track to achieve most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Key
challenges the country faced were to maintain growth in the context of global integration
and to address concerns of increasing inequality. The country’s trade-led growth strategy
had resulted in a steady increase in both exports and imports as a share of GDP, and
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2007 was driving further
liberalization of the economy and reassuring investors about the Government’s
commitment to economic reform.

3.      Macroeconomic Context. Vietnam had weathered a domestic crisis in early 2008,
precipitated mostly by the massive capital inflows following WTO accession that led to
an overheating of the economy. The Government’s determined reaction to stabilize the
economy at the time succeeded in curtailing the boom in banking credit, acceleration in
inflation, a ballooning trade deficit and asset price bubbles. The stabilization package
took a toll on economic activity, however: second quarter 2008 recorded one of the
lowest growth rates in years (5.8 percent). At the same time, however, the stabilization
efforts in early 2008 placed the country’s economy in a better position to weather a
second shock: the global financial and economic crisis in the second half of 2008.
Nevertheless, the global crisis affected foreign demand, and international prices for
Vietnam’s export commodities declined, export orders for garments and other industrial
products collapsed, and a slowdown in manufacturing ensued.

4.     At the time of Appraisal of the HEDPP, Vietnam had witnessed very weak first
quarter 2009 growth, and expectations were that while a crisis was unlikely, growth
would be slower than in 2008. Sustaining economic growth during the remainder of 2009
was seen to require reliance on domestic demand, especially if the international recovery
were to be delayed and international trade did not resume at previous levels. The
Government had announced a sizeable stimulus component in the 2009 budget plan that

                                           1
included labor-intensive projects focused mostly on scaling up critically important public
investments, especially in energy and transport that were seen as an important obstacle to
long-term development.

5.      While Vietnam had some fiscal space to finance a part of the announced stimulus
package, its main constraint stemmed from financing rather than from debt sustainability.
The 2009 budget plan had contemplated the issuance of a second sovereign bond that had
become unlikely given the global context after the international economic crisis. Based
on then existing numbers, the financing gap was estimated at approximately US$1.7
billion equivalent, and given the unattractiveness of other options (i.e., an inadequately
funded stimulus, excessive reliance on domestic finance or attempts to monetize a part of
the cost of financing the stimulus), made the case for quick-disbursing Official
Development Assistance all the stronger.

6.     Poverty Reduction. Broad-based growth had been accompanied by a
continuation of Vietnam’s remarkable record in poverty reduction. A series of household
surveys had confirmed the continued reduction of poverty, with the proportion of
households living below the poverty line falling to 16.0 percent by 2006, compared with
58.1 percent in 1993. The rapid progress was accompanied by only a modest increase in
inequality. The country’s broadly inclusive pattern of growth explained the rapid rate of
poverty reduction. Aggregate figures however masked widening disparities in the extent
and depth of poverty between regions as well as between ethnic minorities and the Kinh
majority populations. Poverty rates were substantially higher in rural areas, particularly in
regions with high numbers of ethnic minorities. Despite crises in 2008 and the
uncertainties the country faced in 2009, Vietnam was expected to sustain its progress on
poverty reduction in the future, and even under a pessimistic growth scenario, the rate of
poverty was expected to fall to around 12.5 percent of the population in 2009.

7.      Sector Context at Appraisal. The role of education and training was critical for
addressing the potential adverse impacts of the global crisis on human development.. On
the supply side, possible reductions in funding for investments, operations and human
resources could lead to deteriorating quality. On the demand side, households could
choose to delay, or forego, educational investments. While education could protect
individuals during times of economic hardship, heterogeneous impacts of the crisis across
the labor market could lead to heterogeneous changes in the return to education, with
potential knock-on effects to demand for education as well as welfare.

8.      Vietnam’s education sector had expanded rapidly, with the fastest growth at the
upper levels of education. Primary enrollment was near universal: the Vietnam
Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) data showed that, between 1992 and 2006,
the percentage of the population aged 25-55 that had not completed even the lowest level
of education dropped from 23 to less than one percent of the population. Primary
educational attainment had increased from 28 to 34 percent of the population, lower
secondary from 30 to 34 percent only, and upper secondary education from 7 to 12
percent. Rural and lower income populations benefited the most from the increase in
primary and lower secondary attainment. Access to higher education had increased, with

                                             2
about 5 percent of the 25-55 aged population obtaining at least some tertiary education in
2006. Enrollment in colleges and universities had nearly doubled from about 900,000
students in 2001 to more than 1.6 million students in 2008. This was explained by: (i) an
initially low enrollment rate; (ii) high demand for higher education as a result of higher
returns to skills; (iii) expansion of private higher education; and (iv) the Government’s
actions in expanding the sub-sector.

9.       Private higher education emerged in the mid-1990s, and since then had become an
increasingly important share of total provision. On average, annual State budget
allocations to public HEIs accounted for 50-60 percent of these institutions’ total budgets,
while tuition fees accounted for 30 to 35 percent. While the Government’s State budget
for education overall had increased steadily, spending was skewed towards lower levels,
and the share allocated to higher education was considered low by international standards.
The introduction of cost-recovery in higher education had resulted in a rapid increase in
the share of tuition fees in the total revenue of HEIs. It allowed the country to expand the
sector rapidly without creating a heavy burden on the State budget, but there was concern
that it may have strained the capacity of some students and their families to pay, although
this risk had been mitigated to a considerable extent by the expansion of the means-tested
student loans scheme and a systematic approach of tuition exemption 1.

10.     Lack of physical, financial and human resources combined with institutional
constraints were identified as major impediments to quality improvement, especially in
view of the rapid expansion in enrollments. Access had been expanded at the expense of
quality of provision, with the proportion of faculty having a doctoral degree falling over
the previous decade and with a large number of students per faculty. The spending for
research, at less than one percent of total government spending, was also small. Finally,
information about HEI performance available to the Government, employers, students
and graduates was weak, creating a further impediment to assessing and improving
quality.

11.     Management of the financing of higher education was fragmented, with
responsibility for implementation of the education sector budget shared between the
Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), other line ministries and local authorities.
About 60 public HEIs were under direct MOET control, while other ministries or
provincial people’s committees controlled others. Budgeting was a bottom-up process
whereby MOET-controlled HEIs submitted their annual plan and budget estimates to
MOET for approval and consolidation, and other public HEIs submitted theirs to their
controlling ministries or provincial people’s committees, leading to incoherence and
opaqueness in setting enrollment quotas, budget allocations and determining the levels of
scholarships and fees. Fiscal transparency in the allocations to higher education and

 Decree No. 49/2010/ND-CP (May 14, 2010), the Decree expands the coverage of fee deductions and
exemptions by adopting a broader concept of disadvantage (including disability, several types of economic
difficulties, remote areas and ethnic minorities).


                                                   3
improved equity through ensuring equal opportunity to all students, especially those from
poor households, were considered important constraints to improved results.

12.     The Government recognized the importance of higher education for increasing
productivity and competitiveness, critical elements to sustain its future growth prospects
that were firmly grounded on market mechanisms and further integration in the
international economy. To address this, the Government set clear goals for higher
education in its Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006-2010 (SEDP) which were
detailed in its Higher Education Reform Agenda (HERA) that set forth its strategy for
higher education and research through the year 2020. The main objectives of the strategy
were: (i) a dramatic increase in capacity to allow an increase of the participation rate in
higher education (or tertiary) institutions, that implied huge investments in infrastructure
and in training of new lecturers and faculty; (ii) simultaneous increase in quality and/or
efficiency of the system; 2 (iii) the introduction or reinforcement of research in
universities in order better to train the future new teachers, to enrich and upgrade present
teachers’ teaching and to upgrade the quality level and international visibility of
Vietnamese universities; and (iv) improved governance of the higher education and
research system at both national and regional levels, as well as of universities.

13.      These goals implied greater autonomy for individual institutions and measures
that created a climate of competition between and within institutions. The Government
set the following targets for the education sector: (i) revenue from science and technology
activities increased to 15 percent of total university revenue by 2010, and to 25 percent
by 2020; (ii) the proportion of university teaching staff with master level degrees
increased to 40 percent by 2010, and to 60 percent by 2020; (iii) the proportion of
university teaching staff with doctoral level degrees increased to 25 percent by 2010, and
to 35 percent by 2020; and (iv) the ratio of university students to teaching staff reduced to
20:1 by 2020.

14.     The HERA was backed by an ambitious MOET plan to cover the additional
costs—estimated at US$20 billion over 15 years, mostly for HEI infrastructure and
smaller shares for training program development, staff development and student financial
assistance—financed from a combination of public and private funds, and ODA. Private
funds were expected to fund half of the additional costs. At the same time, the State
budget for higher education was expected to increase from 8.9% at the time of drafting
HERA in 2005/2006 to 12.5 percent by the end of the third operation, as a proportion of
the State budget for education, while the proportion allocated to basic education would

  Including: lower teacher-student ratios, a reformed entrance examination, better trained teachers, better
pedagogy, the development within universities of research activities indispensable for deepening and
broadening the teachers’ scholarship, the transformation of selected institutions into teaching and research
institutions, improved curriculum frameworks and better assessment of learning outcomes, greater
flexibility of study programs and student mobility with the introduction of a credit accumulation system,
and the development of a quality culture within the institutions, including the implementation of an
accreditation system of all institutions (public and non-public) at the national level.


                                                     4
decline responding to the decrease in the school-aged population. The MOET proposed
granting HEIs greater flexibility to set student fees, which was expected to result in an
increase in HEIs’ revenue from tuition from 34 percent of the combined State budget and
fee revenue in 2006 to 45 percent in 2012. The Government also planned to raise major
ODA financing for higher education from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and IDA.
The HEDPP and other IDA-financed operations (see below) supported this goal.

15.      Bank Country Assistance Strategy. The HEDPP was an integral component of
assistance for higher education in Vietnam, that together with other projects were
incorporated in IDA’s five-year Country Partnership Strategy 2006-2010 3, in support of
the Government’s SEDP 2006-2010 and its HERA. Pillar I of the CPS aimed to assist the
Government in its transition to a market economy, by helping to “develop a higher
education system that produces graduates better suited to the new economy’s needs”.
The HEDPP was to contribute directly to this objective by improving the quality of
higher education in ways that enabled central government and universities to: (i) produce
graduates with the knowledge and skills that met labor market demands, and (ii) support
the national innovation system through relevant basic and applied research. The HEDPP
was part of an integral program of support for higher education proposed in the CPS that
included the then ongoing Second Higher Education Project 4 (HEP2) and a proposed
New-Model Universities Project 5 (NMUP) that was in the initial phases of preparation at
the time of HEDPP’s appraisal. HEDPP supported the promulgation and execution of a
series of key policy measures, each set financed by a separate operation, linked to the
Government’s higher education reform strategy. From HEDPO2 onwards, HEP2 was to
take the policy development from the definition of the problem, through the collection
and analysis of information, to the development and discussion of policy options, and the
NMUP would then provide for the demonstration of the policy measures in a specific
institutional setting.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

16.     The Program Development Objective (PDO) of HEDPO1 and HEDPO2 was to
strengthen governance, rationalize financing, improve the quality of teaching and
research, improve accountability for performance, and enhance transparency in financial
management within the higher education sector. HEDPO 3 aimed to strengthen
governance, financing and quality of higher education by: (i) improving the

  HEP2, a SIL financed by a US$59.4 million equivalent IDA Credit and a US$4.8 million PHRD Co-
financing Grant, was approved on June 20, 2007 and closed on June 30, 2012. It had three components: (i)
capacity building in higher education policy development; (ii) capacity building for university teaching and
research primarily through a competitive grants scheme; and (iii) project management and monitoring and
evaluation.
5
  NMUP, financed by an SDR 119.4 million IDA Credit, was approved on June 24, 2010 and is under
implementation. The project support the establishment and development of a new model university through
four components: (i) policy and regulatory framework; (ii) academic and research development; (iii)
campus and facilities development; and (iv) project management and monitoring and evaluation.

the system; (ii) enhancing fiscal transparency, sustainability and effectiveness of the
higher education sector; and (iii) improving the quality of Higher Education Institutions
(HEI).

17.    Progress under the programmatic series of three single-tranche DPCs, designed to
support the sustained implementation of selected elements of the Government’s reform
agenda, was to be assessed by the key indicators presented in Table 1 below.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

18.     The PDO was not revised. However, six new Key Outcome Indicators were
introduced to measure progress towards the achievement of Program Development
Objectives in the Results Framework under HEDPO2 and five additional indicators under
HEDPO3, as indicated in Table 1. HEDPO3 was processed within the same policy
framework that was defined for HEDPP with an updated set of indicators. The HEDPO3
triggers were for complex major reforms that included the passage of a higher education
law. As a result, additional indicators were designed to measure a shift of decision
making authority from the central government to HEIs. At the same time some indicators
in HEDPO1 and HEDPO2 were dropped as indicated above.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

19.     The policy measures, summarized in the Program Policy Matrix (Annex 7) were
grouped under five themes: (i) governance; (ii) financing; (iii) quality improvement; (iv)
quality assurance, and (v) financial reporting/audit. Measures for the first four of these
themes were drawn from the Government’s HERA; the measures for the last theme were
designed in response to recommendations of the Country Fiduciary Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) carried out in 2007 that were relevant to the higher education sub-
sector. The objectives of the policy measures, by each of the five themes, are summarized
below.

20.     Governance. This policy area had two objectives: (i) to improve the efficiency,
quality and responsiveness of higher education and research, and (ii) to increase the
quantitative capacity of the higher education sector. The first objective would require the
development of new governance arrangements, both for the higher education system as a
whole, as well as for individual HEIs, and was expected, by HEDPO3, to have
culminated in the development of a “master plan” for the higher education and research
sector. The “master plan” and consequently the HE Law would build a HE system that




                                                       7
was multi-tiered and included HEIs operating under different ownership models (public,
private and mixed). The new governance arrangements would alter the respective roles of
MOET and the HEIs, in particular giving more autonomy to HEIs. Quantitative capacity
would be increased by clarifying the regulatory environment for private higher education
providers (both domestic and foreign) and by creating a common set of rules for the
operation of both public and private HEIs. The increased capacity would be managed
through a centralized process, to ensure adequate and appropriate coverage by disciplines
and by regions.

21.     Financing. This policy area aimed to enhance fiscal transparency, sustainability,
efficiency and equity of higher education and to promote greater autonomy and improve
the quality of research universities through changes to the financing regime. This would
be achieved through moving to an enrollment quota mechanism that was based on the
number of enrolled students (as opposed to historical budget allocations), increasing
funds made directly available to poor households through the Government’s student loan
scheme, and diversifying public funding for research.

22.     Quality Improvement. This policy area aimed to improve the efficiency and
transparency of student admissions, improve the quality of teaching inputs and improve
the efficiency and transparency of higher education qualifications. For this, the
Government was moving to a single examination for the transition from secondary to
higher education, devolving oversight for curriculum framework development to a HEI-
level entity, encouraging students into advanced undergraduate and graduate programs
with a view to their becoming qualified HEI teaching/research staff, moving to a more
flexible credit-based qualification framework and complementing traditional teaching
methods supported by information technologies.

23.    Quality Assurance. This policy area aimed to improve information about HEI
performance that was available to Government, as well as to employers, graduates,
students and their families, and to improve the quality of teaching and research outputs.
This would involve reinforcing the quality assurance system at the central level.

24.      Financial Reporting/Audit. This policy area concerned transparency and
accountability in public financial management in the higher education sub-sector. This
was considered particularly important given the high level of perceived risk in public
investment programs operating in increasingly decentralized HEIs with moderate
institutional capacity. These issues would best be addressed at the policy level with
corruption vulnerabilities and collusive practices best being reduced through wider use of
“social audit” approaches. The measures supported focused therefore on financial
reporting and auditing, with a strong emphasis on disclosure.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

25.    The policy Areas were not revised.




                                            8
1.6 Other significant changes

26.      In late 2011, it became clear that the Government would require additional time
to pass the higher education law which was the critical Prior Actions for approval of the
HEDPO3. This was due to the fact that passage of the law required the highest levels of
political support, extensive consultation and the involvement of multiple ministries and
agencies due to the fragmented structure of the higher education system. The delay was
longer than 18 months thereby creating an automatic disconnect between operations as
indicated in Bank policies related to DPOs. As a result, HEDPO3 was prepared as a
stand-alone DPC within the same policy framework that was defined for the HEDPP and
with an updated set of indicators. Although the delay created a disconnect, the Bank team
received a waiver from Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) to submit the
ICR for HEDOP1-2 in conjunction with HEDPO3.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

27.     The HEDPP was a series of three one-tranche operations with the first Program
Document describing the entire program with policy actions for the three operations,
including “prior actions”, considered critical steps on the path of reform and hence,
triggers for approving a subsequent phase, and “benchmarks” that were included to give a
fuller picture of the Government’s progress in implementing its reform agenda. HEDPO3
triggers were slightly revised in the Program Document to reflect the changing context of
the sub-sector including, inter alia, the issuance of the Higher Education Law. A
summary of the each of the operations is provided in Table 2 below.

    Total           150.0              68.4

28.     Prior actions had to be met prior to negotiations for each DPC to be released. The
status of these is presented in Annex 7.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

29.    Several factors had a positive impact on implementation including strong
government commitment, extensive consultation with stakeholders, and financial support
for higher education and an integrated IDA strategy for the higher education sub-sector.
An implementation review was undertaken by the Ministry during the preparation
mission of HEDPO2 during which 90 universities and 100 colleges were assessed. A
consultation workshop was also held towards the end of the review in March 2010.

                                             9
Overall challenges affecting implementation were: (i) completion of the master plan
envisioned for the program was slowed down due to the government consultation
process; (ii) there was some degree of inconsistency in the legislation related to
autonomy of higher education institutions; and (iii) there was limited capacity within the
institutions to exercise the given autonomy.

30.    Strong Government Commitment. The Government remained committed to the
HEDPP and to its HERA that the Program supported throughout implementation. The
reform process, however, was slower than expected which is indicative of an
“incremental/gradualist approach” as they moved toward a “paradigm shift” in the higher
education sector. The Government has a clear sense of its development goals for higher
education and a solid knowledge of the steps required to achieve those goals however, it
has taken longer for the Government to put in place each of these steps.

31.     Consultation with Stakeholders. The development of the HERA involved an
extensive consultation process with numerous stakeholder groups that were used to
identify the policies best suited to reach expected development outcomes. There was a
serious effort to collect inputs from different groups of Vietnamese society through
consultation workshops with local officials, universities, and groups of academics, the
domestic business sector, and international and local experts. Similar consultation
processes were carried out for critical policy actions and legislation supported under the
HEDPP. This extensive consultation reflects a trend towards new modes of political
participation for citizens to provide feedback to government policies and regulations, and
has been welcomed by the public as a popular means of public consultation and
participation. Extensive consultation has led to a process that builds popular support for
policy decisions that otherwise might have been difficult to obtain. However, this process
also played a role in slowing down the decision making process on reforms and
legislation such as finalizing the Mater Plan. Although the Master Plan became obsolete
once the Higher Education Law became effective, aspects of the draft plan were included
in the Law. In the future, the key for the government will be to balance the need for
consultation against its commitment to a firm timetable for the reform agenda.

32.    Integrated IDA Strategy. The HEDPP was part of an integrated IDA strategy
supporting the reform of Vietnam’s higher education system that included the HEP2 and
the ongoing NMUP that was in the initial phases of preparation at the time of HEDPP’s
appraisal. As indicated above, HEP2 supported the analysis and development of policies,
the HEDPP supported the enactment of policies, and the NMUP is providing for the
application of policy measures in a specific institutional setting.

33.    At the same time, an extensive program of analytical and advisory services,
together with assessments and studies carried out by the Government and financed under
the technical assistance component of HEP2 supported implementation of the HEDPP.
Analytical and advisory services carried out by the Bank included “Higher Education
and Skills for Growth” (World Bank, 2008), that provided an analysis of demand for




                                           10
skills, and the policy options for reforming higher education. A case study on “Equity
and Access to Tertiary Education in Vietnam” 6 documented the significance and
consequences of disparities in tertiary education opportunities, and investigated the
results and lessons of efforts to expand access to tertiary education and improve the
chances of success for disadvantaged youth (with particular emphasis on the effects of
the fee structure as well as student loans and scholarship schemes). These were
complemented by a regional study on Higher Education, Skills and Innovation that found
that in Vietnam, there had been a significant transfer of decision making authority to
HEIs. However, further work was needed to reduce ambiguity of content, low
implementation feasibility, and inconsistency between different regulations, due to lack
of a systematic vision and coordination between agencies responsible for higher
education which was what the DPLs were design to help. Assessments and studies
supporting the HEDPP that were financed under HEP2 include: development of the
Master Plan, higher education situation analysis, policy development and capacity
building for financing, reform of the entrance examination, and analysis of current quality
culture and accreditation of Vietnam’s higher education.

34.     Financial Support for Higher Education. The Government’s strategy for
financing HERA relies heavily on overseas development assistance (about 20 percent).
The Government’s market friendly policies in education that provide incentives for
foreign investment in education and training, succeeded in mobilizing increasing amounts
of ODA financing for the higher education sub-sector from US$31 million in 1998 to
US$86 million in 2005 and to US$146 million in 2009 and US$592.7 million during the
socio-economic period 2011/2015. Higher Education spending increased 16 percent in
absolute terms during implementation this, coupled with an increasing share of HEI
funding from tuition and fees, bodes well for continued financing of higher education in
the future (Section 3.2).

35.     Sequencing and Pace of Reforms. Since the adoption of HERA, the Government
has adopted numerous policies that touch on reforms to different aspects of the higher
education system. The transition from a highly centralized system characterized by strong
bureaucratic control required a major redefinition of the policy framework for higher
education. Due to the need to move quickly, reforms were being implemented even
before a perfectly sequenced regulatory framework was in place, including those
supported by the Program. This resulted in challenges for the achievement of some
Program objectives. The Higher Education Law granted greater autonomy to HEIs to
decide fees, however, the tuition fees for mainstream undergraduate students is regulated
by a 2011-2015 decree thereby limiting the ability of HEIs to fully determine fee levels.
In addition, though the policy goal for establishment of University Council was achieved,
their role within the regional political processes will need to be more clearly defined as
the reform process moves forward.

36.    Program Design and Results Framework. The Program was appropriately
designed to advance the establishment of the legal framework which is the prerequisite
for HEIs’ to be able to realized increased autonomy and accountability. The result
framework was also appropriately designed to measure implementation of the Program at
the institutional level. Progress was achieved across the framework, however, there
remain challenges related to achievement of some policy indicators due to the ongoing
need to harmonize legislation related to HEIs autonomy. This ongoing effort will provide
HEIs with a clearer framework for moving forward with autonomy.

37.     Implementation by HEIs. The greater level of autonomy has enabled HEIs to
diversify provision and sources of income which in return, helped raise the quality of
provision which has been a substantial improvement for HEIs. While HEIs recognize the
benefits of greater autonomy, the significant transfer of decision-making authority to
HEIs has created some concern due to the recognition that some HEIs have limited
capacity to fully exercise the given autonomy. The Program also envisioned a relative
short period between adoption of policy actions and expected results. In some cases, the
timing was ambitious and HEIs were not able to witness actual results for some policy
actions during the implementation period. Going forward there will be an introduction of
related by-laws which will guide HEIs, in the short- and medium-term, on how to
implement different aspects of the reform program.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

38.    The MOET’s Program Unit monitored and reported on progress against the
HEDPP development objectives throughout implementation, in accordance with the
Policy Matrix (Annex 2) and the Outcome Indicators in the Program’s Results
Framework (Annex 4). The Program Unit could draw on HEP2 funds for the preparation,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the operations in the HEDPP series.
However, the Program Unit was dismantled due to the closing of the HEP2 thereafter
M&E was then managed by the Higher Education Department.

39.     The MOET’s Higher Education Management and Policy Information System
(HEMPIS) was to continue to strengthen monitoring and evaluation beyond HEDPP.
Support for strengthening the HEMPIS was to be provided under HEP2, and the MOET
aimed to develop new and more sophisticated indicators (e.g., graduate employment and
research based patents) and collect survey data on these and other indicators that
individual HEIs are now required to disclose in their effort to assure quality. However,
this activity was dropped under HEP2 as the development of HEMPIS proved to be more
difficult than anticipated and was eventually cancelled. Additionally, by the time of
drafting the ICR, an indicator introduced under HEDPO3 on the “Percentage of students
receiving loans (disaggregated by gender)” was not fully reported due to the lack of
coordination between MOET and the Bank of Social Policies which processes this data.

40.     As noted in Section 3.2 under the Quality Assurance policy area, an important
objective of the HEDPP was to support policies aimed at improving the information
available to the Government, and to employers, graduates and students and their families.

                                           12
HEIs are now required to disclose timely information regarding quality of education,
facilities, teaching and management staff, income and expenditures on a regular basis.
This, together with a strengthened quality assurance system and minimum standards for
accreditation, are expected to gradually improve the quality of higher education outcomes.
HEIs reported varying results in these areas, as described in Section 3.2.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

41.     The recent adoption and enactment of the Higher Education Law deals with
critical aspects of HEI autonomy, establishment of University Councils, the move
towards a multi-tiered higher education system, private higher education, and further
progress on accreditation and quality assurance. There has been good progress on the
autonomy given to HEIs related to academic matters. Going forward the Bank will
continue to support, through lending and technical assistance, the work of the
Government on harmonizing the policies related to management of HEIs so that HEIs
will have a clearer framework for increased autonomy related to resource management.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

42.      Relevance of Objectives. The HEDPP’s objectives were and continue to be very
relevant and closely aligned with the Government’s SEDP, its HERA and IDA’s CPS.
This is because they are critical to Vietnam’s future development. Since Vietnam joined
the World Trade Organization, the country has become increasingly integrated with the
world economy requiring a well-trained work force with the ability to adjust to changing
needs and opportunities in the labor market. In line with the experience of other middle-
income countries in the region and around the world, the demand for skills in Vietnam is
beginning to evolve rapidly and will likely continue over the coming decade. Beyond the
issue of shortages of skilled labor, it is clear that the poor quality and relevance of skills
acquired in higher education continues to be a big issue. Vietnam’s national
competitiveness increasingly depends on skilled human capital that its higher education
system needs to deliver. Hence, the importance and continued extreme relevance of the
reforms supported by the HEDPP in responding to this challenge. The design of the
HEDPP continues to be relevant, especially since the programmatic instrument allows for
needed adjustments during program implementation that respond to government and local
realities while maintaining constant the pursuit of the program’s development objectives.

43.     Relevance of Design and Implementation. The Program supported an ambitious
reform effort, in effect aiming to redefine and redesign Vietnam’s system of higher
education. The policy matrix and result framework were relevant to measure the impact
of policies which were put in pace under HEDPP. However, the timing provided between
adoption of different policies and between enactment and expected results, was, in
retrospect ambitious. As mentioned previously, the Government will introduce related
by-laws that will guide HEIs, in the short- and medium-term, on how to implement
different aspects of the reform program which should be instrumental in assisting HEIs as
they continue with the reforms.
                                             13
3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

44.     The Program supported a bold and comprehensive higher education reform effort,
as grounded in the HERA that succeeded in putting in place important policies
strengthening governance, rationalizing financing, improving the quality of teaching and
research, improving accountability for performance and enhancing transparency in
financial management in HE sector, in order to create a new framework for the subsector.
Critical pieces of legislation and policies to cement accomplishments have advanced,
including the Higher Education Law or is expected to be approved in the near future, i.e.,
definition of quality assurance mechanisms. The HEDPP’s Policy Matrix is presented in
Annex 7.

45.     The program had an impact on the development of reforms and systemic change
related to the sub-sector. However, as is normally the case with extensive programs, it
will take time to fully realize the impact of the reforms as well as for all major actors to
embrace them. Interviews with different universities presented a mixed picture, with
private HEIs reporting important advances in terms of enrollments, development of new
curricula, enrollment of students and greater transparency and accessibility in terms of
financing education for the lower income population by receiving public subsidies for
those students in advance. Public HEIs were more cautious, sometimes constrained by
conflicting legislation with which they must comply that led to uncertainties and
difficulties in implementing new policies by MOET.

46.     Nevertheless, all three phases of the HEDPO made notable progress towards the
achievement of the Program’s Development Objectives, as measured by Key
Performance Indicators, within the context of a stable macroeconomic framework. The
MOET conducted an implementation assessment of the HEDPP in 2010. The findings
revealed that the policy measures adopted have had overall positive impacts on the
development of the HE sector, providing legal basis for HEIs to be more proactive and
more accountable in carrying out their academic, financial and human resource duties.
The adopted policy measures have resulted in a significant transfer of decision-making
authority to HEIs from the central ministry. The MOET now, for example, focuses on
implementation of the development strategy, development of quality assurance and
accreditation system, monitoring and inspection and conducts it supervision role. The
assessment also found, as could be expected in the implementation of a reform program
of this magnitude, that there remained some issues related to the ambiguity of the content,
feasibility for implementation, comprehensiveness and consistency between different
regulations for higher education.




                                            14
47.    A summary of achievements and issues is presented below, by Policy Area
supported under the HEDPP.

       Governance: (i) improve efficiency, quality and responsiveness of higher
       education and research, and (ii) increase quantitative capacity of higher
       education sub-sector;

48.     Addressing the objectives of the governance of the higher education sub-sector
required tackling and amending laws and regulations inherited from an earlier period
characterized by a highly centralized political and higher education environment, and
drafting new laws and regulations that would be needed. A series of regulations has been
introduced under the HEDPP altering the respective roles of MOET and HEIs, in
particular giving more autonomy to HEIs and increasing their accountability. HEIs have
claimed that they owned complete autonomy in academic matters including curriculum,
content of programs and student enrolment targets. Since 2012, 100 percent of HEIs have
been able to decide on the enrolment targets following MOET regulations stipulated in
the Circular No 57/2011/TT-BGDDT of December 2, 2011. Similarly, 100 percent HEIs
now can decide on the content of their training programs and open new training programs
as they wish.

49.     Significant progress was made on improving the regulatory environment for
private higher education providers (both domestic and foreign), creating a common set of
rules for the operation of both public and private HEIs, and for putting in place the new
governance arrangements, both for the education system as a whole, as well as for
individual HEIs.

50.     Supported by HEDPO1, the Prime Ministerial Decision No. 380/QD-TTG dated
March 24, 2009 issued the regulation on a charter for the first “new model” university,
conferring academic, managerial and financial autonomy to the Vietnamese-German
University (one of the four new model universities that are being supported under the
NMUP). This decision has allowed this HEI to enjoy high autonomy and special
operational mechanisms beyond previous practices in financial management, including
setting its own tuition fees and salary for staff based on competencies and professional
performance. There were some inconsistencies, however, in implementation, for example,
with the HEI still requested to submit its financing proposal for approval annually,
thereby weakening incentives to innovate and be accountable.

51.    Also under HEDPO1, Ministerial Decision No. 64/2008/QD-BGDDR dated
November 28, 2008 issued regulations on working conditions of general HEIs teaching
and research staff that is aimed at enhancing HEIs leadership’s autonomy in the
management of human resources. The initial implementation of these regulations led to
some challenges because the decision put emphasis on the number of working/teaching
hours (input based), rather than expected results or outputs/outcomes of teaching or
research activities. Also aimed at increasing HEIs autonomy in the management of
human resources, Prime Ministerial Decision No. 174/2008/QD-TTg dated December 31,

                                           15
2008 issued regulations and procedures and criteria for appointment and dismissal of
professors and associate professors. Regulations were promulgated on ownership
arrangements (Prime Ministerial Decision No. 61/2009/QD-TTg, dated April 17, 2009),
and on the establishment, merger, division, suspension and dissolution of HEIs, providing
common rules for public and private domestic investors (Prime Ministerial Decision No.
07/2009/QD-TTG, dated January 15, 2009).

52.     Significant progress was made towards putting in place the regulatory
environment and common rules of operation under HEDPO2. Prime Ministerial Decision
No. 58/QD-TTg dated September 22, 2010 put in place regulations on the generic HEI
Charters setting out functions of key bodies within HEIs. The generic HEI Charter is
crucial for the success of the government’s policy towards increasing the autonomy,
capacity of the higher education sector and for increasing its responsiveness and
efficiency. The generic HEI Charter, applicable to both public and private universities,
academies and colleges in charge of higher education, sets forth the duties and rights of
HEIs regarding their three fundamental missions: education and training, fundamental
and applied research and interaction with society (outreach). It also defines the rights and
duties of academic, technical and administrative staff, the duties and rights of students, to
fix the governance of the institutions, the composition and roles of the different bodies
involved in managerial, financial and academic decisions. Finally, the Charter stipulates
the control mechanisms of institutions, as well as procedures for the settlement of
violations. Experience in the adoption of University Charters has been mixed, with
mostly public HEIs reporting difficulties with conflicting legislation, and uncertainties
and need for guidance on implementation. Several HEIs have commented that HEI
Charters should distinguish and be modified for different types of HEI, i.e., public and
private.

53.      Under HEDPO3, Prime Ministerial Decree No. 73/2012/ND-CP dated September
26, 2012 on the foreign cooperation and investment in education, was also put in place,
paving the way for increased quantitative capacity of HEIs. The Decree sets forth the
parameters for the establishment and operation of foreign-capitalized educational
institutions. The Decree has made it easier for foreign investors and partners in
developing and running joint programs with their national counterparts. As a result, the
number of joint programs developed far exceeded the target. The regulations, however,
have often been found lacking details straining uniform implementation at HEIs.

54.     In line with the objective of increasing the autonomy of HEIs, the charter
entrusted most of the decision power to two bodies, the University Council and the
Rector, approved under the same Prime Ministerial Decision that regulated the Charter 7.
The University Council is considered the management authority of HEIs, responsible for
passing resolutions on major policies to implement the autonomy and social duties of the



7
 The regulations for the HEI Charter and for the University Councils were separate Prior Actions for
HEDPO2. The Government integrated both sets of regulations in one Prime Ministerial Decision.


                                                   16
universities as assigned by the State. It is also responsible for nominating candidates for
Rectors and Vice-Rectors for appointment (for public universities) or approval (for
private universities) by the competent government body. This policy was a considerable
step forward in increasing autonomy of HEIs and it is expected that complete autonomy
will be granted to HEIs once their institutional governance and capacity is further
strengthened. The Rector is directly responsible for managing and leading all the
institutions’ activities as stipulated in the State’s laws and in the Charter. Participation of
the private sector in University Councils is expected, thereby supporting stronger
linkages between universities and the private sector, and therefore ultimately higher
responsiveness to labor market needs. A general Directive No. 296/CT-TTg on higher
education management for the 2010-2012 period was issued on February 27, 2010,
setting the basis for an acceleration of governance (towards university “self-management”
and independent quality assurance) and financing reforms (tuition fee policies coupled
with fee exemption and student loan policies). Universities are not all on the same page
with regard to the willingness and ability to exercise autonomy. The Government has
decided to conduct a pilot/demonstration with substantive autonomy to universities who
have higher potential for autonomy. Consequently, on 24 October 2014, governmental
Resolution No. 77/NQ-CP was promulgated on a pilot autonomy and accountability
mechanism at HEIs which includes four universities specialized in Economics and Social
Science 8. According to the resolution, these universities are granted extended level of
autonomy and accountability in the areas including teaching and research, governance
and personnel, and finance. The pilot will be evaluated and the plan is to eventually roll
out substantive autonomy to all HEIs.

55.     A draft Master Plan, a Prior Action for HEDPO3 at the time HEDPO2 was
prepared, with technical assistance financed under HEP2, provided a vision of a tiered
higher education system and pathways and policy options to implement the vision has
been produced. The draft proposed: (a) a system with three levels of institutions (with
corresponding qualification frameworks): (i) research universities (subject to a strict
limit in number); (ii) teaching and applied science institutions; and (iii) post-secondary
professional schools; (b) a plan not only for the higher education sector (universities and
colleges), but also for the whole tertiary sector, including the post lower secondary school
system; (c) reduction of mono-disciplinary institutions and autonomy of faculties and
schools ; (d) integration of teaching-learning and research and competitive founding of
research; (e) development of the private sector, in particular not-for-profit; (f) governance
of the system, with HEIs reporting to only one ministry; (g) increased autonomy of HIEs
(depending on type) implying strong leadership and counter-power (councils or boards);
and (h) raising the issue of the qualification of the teaching staff. The progress on issuing
the Master Plan, however, was slower than expected. As such, the government’s legal
framework put the Higher Education Law as the highest legislation governing the sector
and was identified as a prior action in the HEDPO3 program document. Key elements of



8
 Hanoi National Economics University, HCMC Economics University, Foreign Trade
University and Hanoi University


                                             17
the Master Plan have been integrated into the new Higher Education Law enacted by the
National Assembly on 18 June 2012. The law defines: (i) the qualification and training
modalities of HEIs, (ii) the classification of HEIs; (iii) the structure of networks of HEIs
and their differentiation/segmentation in the system by institutional missions; (iv) the
regulation of HEIs’ institutional autonomy and accountability in academic, organizational
and financial affairs; and (v) the regulation of HEIs’ institutional accreditation and
quality assurance process. The draft of the Master Plan has also contributed towards the
drafting of a government decree on HEI stratification and ranking which was put forward
for consultation with concerned ministries on 20 December 2013.

       Financing: (i) enhance fiscal transparency, sustainability, efficiency and
       equity of the higher education sub-sector, and (ii) promote autonomy and
       improve the quality of research and teaching at research universities;

56.     These objectives were to be supported through policies aimed at moving to an
enrollment quota mechanism that is based on clear and transparent criteria (rather than
historical student numbers), diversifying funding sources while supporting increasing
public budget for higher education with clear allocation criteria, increasing funds made
directly available to poor households and/or differentiating treatment of poor households,
and supporting competitive funding for research.

57.     Following the dissemination of the Proposal to Restructure Education and
Training Financing for the Period 2008-2012, a Prior Action under HEDPO1, the
National Assembly approved Decision No. 35/2009 dated June 19, 2009 with the
multiple purpose of developing new mechanisms to attract and use different sources of
funding (public and non-public) to improve the quantity and quality of education. In
relation to higher education, the Decision provides the basis for increasing public budget
for higher education, attracting family contributions based on capacity and on a cost-
sharing principle, increasing the financial autonomy of HEIs by giving them flexibility to
set up fee levels based on the fee framework approved by the government, supporting
student loan schemes and clarifying criteria and responsibilities in budgeting and
allocation. The share of the state budget allocated to higher education increased from 8.9
percent in 2006, to 11.3 percent in 2008, declined slightly to 11.2 percent in 2010 and
increased to 11.51 percent in 2014, not meeting the target of 12.5 percent. However,
higher education spending increased 16 percent in absolute terms during implementation.
Student tuition fees as a proportion of HEIs’ income from state budget and fees increased
from 20.9 percent in 2008 to 42 percent in 2011, and declined to 39 percent in 2014.
Though the collection of tuition fees regulated for the period 2011-2015 under Decree No.
49/2010/ND-CP, dated May 14, 2010 diversified sources of income have brought down
the percentage of income generation from tuition fees. For example, revenue from non-
degree activities and short professional programs increased faster than tuition.

58.      Building on the Decision, HEDPO2 supported the regulation on introducing a
criteria-based formula for setting HEIs’ maximum enrollment quotas under Ministerial
Decision No. 795/QD-BGDDT dated February 27, 2010. This Regulation contributes to
increasing transparency in enrollment and, to the extent that they are linked, budgetary

                                            18
decisions, while supporting higher quality. The main criteria include student-faculty
ratios, availability of equipment for teaching and research, training and teaching space for
students and program accreditation and the extent to which HEIs comply with rules on
public disclosure of information on teaching conditions, expected learning outcomes and
finance. HEIs also remain free to add additional specific criteria that they deem relevant.

59.      The demand side is also considered by supporting human resource
production/development centers that provide signals from the labor market to the HEIs on
the number and skill profile required of new graduates. While the use of an input-based
formula is not considered ideal, it represents a significant advance towards higher
transparency in enrollment and budgetary decisions in relation to the previous practice
that was based on negotiations, historical costs and political connections. It can also
provide a basis for eventual quality enhancing budgeting, especially since this formula
encourages the practice of HEIs publishing information on quality related staff and
facilities that in turn supports accountability and competition. HEDPO2 introduced a new
Prior Action (that had not been contemplated in HEDPO1) that involved issuance of a
Decree to regulate tuition fees for the 2011-2015 period (Decree No. 49/2010/ND-CP,
dated May 14, 2010). This Decree was considered critical to allow for further financial
diversification in already budget-constrained institutions through a planned increase in
tuition fees. At the same time, it addressed potential inequities in access to higher
education that the use of tuition fees would entail. In establishing a unified and
systematic approach to tuition exemption, the Decree is a considerable improvement to
the previous structure, and several HEIs have reported positive results in that the
prepayment of the subsidy directly to universities has provided more predictability in
tuition receipts, thereby providing flexibility with respect to the self-managed capital.

60.     The Decree’s poverty and social impact analysis shows that this approach
supports an adequate balance between fee increases and mechanisms to protect the poor.
The tuition fee framework, however, has not been developed based on unit cost. As such
the fees, after four years of implementation, proved to be insufficient which constrained
HEIs from improving the quality of their offers. MOET current work on state budget
allocation mechanism and technical and economic norms will result in new regulations
on financing higher education sector which will facilitate further quality improvement of
its provision.

61.     With regards to the research, a new regulation on the financing of higher
education research was prepared and approved. Decision No. 1041/QD-BGDDT dated
March 13, 2008 of Ministry of Education and Training, introduces criteria-based formula
for allocating task and budget for science and technology activities at HEIs and research
institutes. This Decision also contributes to increasing transparency in allocating funds.
The main criteria include core teachers and researchers and funds are allocated based on a
reporting system of researches done and planned research by the time research fund
proposals are submitted. Under HEPDO2, circular No.12/2010/TT-BGDĐT dated 29
March 2010 regulates the management of scientific and technological research at
Ministry level, setting criteria for competitive selection of research proposals though this
is very input and supply driven.

                                            19
62.     The Prior Action for HEDPO3 for issuing the regulation on financing mechanism
of national education system, covering public subsidies, student tuition fees and student
financial assistance for higher education was modified when HEDPO2 was processed. A
draft Prime Ministerial Decree on allocating public financing to public HEIs for recurrent
budget, dated May 12, 2014 has been put forward for consultation at different ministries.
The draft regulation aims to improve the effectiveness, efficiency of equity of state
budget in higher education. Tuition fees and student loans had been regulated in separate
legislation, while the allocation of public financing needed reform. Changes to the
allocation of public financing to HEIs was also seen as consistent with the move towards
a criteria-based formula for setting HEIs’ maximum enrollment quotas supported under
HEDPO2. 9

          Quality Improvement: (i) improve the efficiency and transparency of
          student admissions, and (ii) improve the quality of teaching inputs, and (iii)
          improve the efficiency and transparency of qualifications;

63.     The continuing growth of higher education enrollment put tremendous pressures
on the quality of teaching, research and public service. Lack of physical, financial and
human resources combined with institutional constraints were identified as major
impediments to quality improvement. Some of the policy actions under the governance
and financing areas supported higher responsiveness, efficiency and quality. These were
complemented by other specific actions to improve quality. Under HEDPO1, the
Government issued: (i) regulations on admission to HEI part-time programs, with a view
to providing alternative but equivalent pathways to national HEI qualifications
(Ministerial Decision No. 62/2008/QD-BGDDT, dated November 25, 2008); (ii) a plan
on provision of advanced undergraduate programs in selected HEIs for the period 2008-
2015 (Prime Ministerial Decision No. 1505/QD-TTg, dated October 25, 2008), and (iii) a
regulation on doctoral programs with a view to enhancing HEI autonomy in admission to,
teaching, assessment and award of doctoral degrees (Ministerial Circular No.
10/2009/TT-BGDDT, dated May 7, 2009).

64.     HEDPO2 supported a broad agenda to improve quality through enhancing
flexibility, mobility and competition in the higher education system, while targeting
additional resources to some advanced programs. The move towards a credit-based
training system is well under way, and has exceeded the number of pilots (30) established
as a Prior Action under HEDPO2. By the 2014/2015 academic year, 179 HEIs have
moved to credit-based training. This reform is expected to increase the efficiency,
accountability and quality of study programs and faculties by allowing student to move
among institutions more fluidly.

65.    As a prior action to HEDPO3, MOET issued Circular No. 57/2012/TT-BGDĐT
of December 27, 2012 amending Decision No. 43/2007/QD-BGDDT, of August 15, 2007

    Decision No. 795/QD-BGDDT (February 27, 2010)


                                                20
on higher education credit-based training system, providing for: (i) HEIs guidance on the
application of credit-based training curricula; (ii) minimum training standards for HEIs;
(iii) consistency in HEI’s grading systems; (iv) an early warning system for students to
maintain acceptable level of credit accumulation; and (v) the implementation steps for the
revised credit-based system in HEIs. Together with higher entry of private and foreign
institutions and the publication of information on quality related inputs, the move towards
a credit-based system is supporting competition among HEIs.

66.     A joint circular between the MOET and the Ministry of Labor (MOLISA) was
approved after broad consultation with stakeholders on recognition of prior learning and
building pathways between professional technical and higher education. This was
considered an urgent priority given the high importance of technical vocational education
and training, its relative isolation in the overall education system, and the need to develop
multiple skill development pathways.

67.    A circular on the disclosure of output-standards by HEIs (Regulation No.
2196/BGDDT-GHDH, dated April 22, 2010) was adopted to further advance on quality
improvement through competition and accountability. This regulation provides the
administrative framework for the public disclosure of outputs (knowledge, skills,
competencies and attitudes) that graduates should achieve at graduation, as determined by
each HEI, providing students with additional elements to make informed enrollment
decisions.

68.     Finally, a joint-circular on financial norms for advance study programs (Joint-
circular No. 220/2009/TTLT-BTC-BGDDT, dated November 20, 2009) was approved to
provide for increasing funds for improving the flexibility of these study programs, with
the objective that this would improve their quality and encourage their uptake, thereby
helping create more qualified HEI teaching/research staff.

69.     Two actions included under HEDPP as benchmarks for HEDPO2 were excluded
from the Program when the operation was processed: (i) establish examination serving
both for secondary leaving certification and HEI entrance evaluation; and (ii) issue
regulations on alternative delivery methodologies (e.g., distance education, open
universities, e-learning and e-textbooks). Given the rapid expansion of enrollments in
higher education, a high emphasis has been placed on quality at entry to HEIs. To ensure
the fairness and quality of the admissions process while at the same time reduce the costs
and administrative burden at all levels, the government plans to combine the high school
graduation examination and the HEI admission examination. After a long time of
consultation, a draft proposal for this modified examination was prepared and approved
by the Prime Minister on September 6, 2014. Remaining key challenges include the
limited capacity to design high quality, objective and fair tests, and the sharing of
responsibilities in examination and admission between the MOET and HEIs.

70.    The recent development of alternative delivery channels will allow Vietnam to
move from elite to mass higher education, but will pose a challenge with respect to
ensuring quality of delivery. For this, an adequate regulatory and quality assurance

                                             21
framework for alternative delivery channels will be important. However, because of the
still limited expansion of alternative channels, the government preferred to address
recognition of prior learning and building pathways between professional technical and
higher education (see above) before addressing alternative delivery. It is expected that the
progress in linkages between professional technical and higher education will provide
important inputs for the establishment of a National Qualification Framework that MOET
and MOLISA are jointly developing for Prime Ministerial approval in 2015.

       Quality Assurance: (i) improve information available to Government, as
       well as to employers, graduates, students and their families, and (ii) improve
       the quality of teaching and research outputs;

71.     The Government’s HERA has as an important objective not only raising quality
but cultivating and sustaining and culture of quality in the higher education system. The
HEDPP supported government policies aimed at developing this quality culture from
within individual HEIs, supported by an external environment that demands high quality
standards. This is seen as all the more important for improving accountability of more
autonomous HEIs.

72.     Under HEDPO1, the Government issued a regulation (Ministerial Circular No.
09.2009/TT-BGDDT, dated May 7, 2009) requiring HEIs to disclose information relating
to the quality of education, facilities, teaching and management staff, income and
expenditures on a regular basis. This regulation aims to improve timeliness and quality
of information about HEI performance that is available to the Government, employers,
graduates, students and their families. The Government also established the National
Accreditation Body (Ministerial Decision No. 7113/QD-BGDDT, dated October 23,
2008) that is charged with reinforcing the quality assurance system at the central level by
specifying and ensuring minimum quality standards.

73.      The approval of the Education Law 2009 led to a slight adjustment in the Prior
Action for HEDPO2 that required issuing regulations for the establishment of
independent review agencies responsible for regularly reviewing public and private HEIs
against minimum standards and advising government on their accreditation. The MOET
needed to put out a comprehensive framework for education quality assurance and
accreditation before a new structure for accreditation was set up (this became the revised
Prior Action). A Regulation on the framework for education quality assurance and
accreditation was approved by the MOET (Ministerial Decision No. 4138/QD-BGDDT,
dated September 20, 2010). The framework outlines two main objectives of the system:
(i) ensuring minimum standards and accountability of HEIs, and (ii) promoting the
development of quality assurance culture at the institutional level. The first objective is
to be achieved through the accreditation process. MOET will be responsible for setting
accreditation standards and procedures and licensing accreditation agencies, which may
include from among government, non-governmental and private agencies. For the
second objective, the framework outlines the process of developing quality systems at the
institutional level, including: (i) establishment of quality centers; (ii) development of
quality assurance mechanisms including internal and external reviews, and (iii) other

                                            22
feedback mechanisms. The accreditation model grants stronger independence to
accreditation agencies that the previous model (in which these agencies only conduct
external evaluation and the accreditation/certification rested with the MOET-led
accreditation body).

74.     When the HEDPO3 began, there were no accreditation agencies in Vietnam. In
September and November 2013, the MOET issued Decisions (3568/QD-BGDDT,
5570/QD-BGDDT) on the establishment of two state education quality assurance centers
(VNUHN CEA and VNUHCM CEA). Substantial progress has been made ever since to
operationalize these national accreditation centers which have successfully trained 240
independent accreditors – 60 became certificated in July 2014. This has enabled the
external accreditation for HEIs to commence in 2014 as stipulated in the HE Law. MOET
is calling for establishment of further accreditation bodies from the private sector to
enhance the quantitative and qualitative capacity of independent assessment which will
likely improve the quality of training provision.

75.     Another important prior action for HEDPO3 was the development on internal
quality systems. To date, 301 HEIs (71 percent) have set up quality assurance centers but
their capacity to provide quality assurance services to the university and to faculties
remains limited. Several workshops were held to provide capacity building for staff of
quality assurance centers and to develop feedback instruments from students, employers,
and graduates. Nevertheless, some HEIs informally reported different progress in
establishing quality systems, and reported lack of guidance and need for technical
assistance to make progress.

       Financial Reporting and Audit: (i) achieve financial transparency and
       efficiency in public resource use, and (ii) ensure adequate oversight of public
       funds through independent audits;

76.     Improving transparency and accountability in public financial management is
seen as particularly important given the high level of perceived risk in public investment
programs operating in increasingly decentralized HEIs with moderate institutional
capacity. Under the HEDPP the government streamlined the budgeting, financial
reporting and audit process between MOET and the HEIs. The Government completed
satisfactorily Prior Actions for all three series. Financial reports for fiscal year 2011
(HEDPO2) were received by 45 MOET managed HEIs, and the State Audit of Vietnam
audited 25 HEIs; for fiscal year 2013 (HEDPO3), all 44 MOET managed HEIs submitted
the reports to MOET with Hanoi University of Agriculture started reporting to its line
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. The financial statements complied with
government regulations, and the audits were reviewed and endorsed by IDA.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

77.   The overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory. This is based on the
Program’s continued relevance, and the sustained progress towards putting in place the
fundamentals of a modern, quality, equitable higher education system that is responsive
                                              23
to Vietnam’s growth and poverty reduction objectives. The sheer magnitude of the
reform supported by the HEDPP was impressive. The systemic reform is a long haul
exercise that is organic in nature. Therefore, despite extensive and significant progress,
challenges remain in achieving some Program goals within the short period of time for
implementation. Based on the existing progress and initial results, together with the
Government’s continued commitment to its HERA, there is no doubt that the Program
has made a substantial contribution to the reform of Vietnam’s higher education system.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

78.     The HEDPP was expected to produce generally positive poverty and social
impacts. Through a comprehensive financing strategy to address needs for both fund
diversification and equitable access, the policy reforms supported by the HEDPP were
expected to have generally positive effects. In fact, the proportion of HEI students that
belonged to ethnic minority groups increased from a baseline of 0.9 percent in 2007/2008
to 2.0 percent in 2010/11, as targeted. The move toward a credit-based training system
and the establishment of equivalencies between higher and technical and vocational
education and training (TVET), together with recognition of prior learning are all
expected to have significant positive impacts on disadvantaged students that typically
attend TVET in higher numbers and that work while studying, mostly by permitting them
to obtain recognition for their courses and degrees across education levels and HEIs.

79.     The higher education reform supported by the HEDPP is being financed through
the State Budget, development assistance and fees. Supported by the Program, Prime
Ministerial Decree No. 49/2010/ND-CP dated May 14, 2010 established a new tuition fee
schedule for the 2011-2015 period for public sector HEIs (private institutions have no cap
on their fees). To protect the impact of the increase in fees on disadvantaged students,
this Decree also expanded fee exemptions and reductions and student aid that have been
in place since the late 1990s. The Government has had an active policy of providing fee
deductions and exemptions benefitting, among other students, those from poor and ethnic
minorities. In 2006, about 22 percent of mostly disadvantaged higher education students
were benefiting from significant fee deductions (up to 50 percent). The Government has
also adopted student aid schemes. Since 2006, students from ethnic minorities have been
receiving lump-sum assistance representing about one-third of their overall monthly
higher education costs. From 2007, scholarships for poor students were increased to
cover full tuition costs. The Government in a separate directive further increased the
amount of student loans under a student loan program that was introduced in 1998, but
since that time had covered very few students and hence, had had little impact. This loan
program was modified substantially in 2007 to provide for a significant increase in loan
amounts and longer repayment periods. As of March 2014, there are 1,970,960 active
student loans for Vietnam’s 2,177,299 higher education students. Both students from
public and private HEIs are potential beneficiaries of student loans.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening


                                           24
80.     The HEDPP was a program whose every objectives were defined to radically
change the institutional setting and governance arrangements for higher education in
Vietnam, and these achievements are described in detail in Section 3.2. The program’s
impact on the roles of the MOET and the HEIs, the relationship between them, the
increased autonomy and decentralization on academic and personnel matters including
overall enrollment, program content, tuition fees for non-mainstream undergraduate
students and staff recruitment and retention has been impressive. While there will be
challenges to be tackled in the future, including strengthening of HEIs, internalizing their
new accountability and autonomy, ensuring that MOET has the capacity to operate in its
new steward role, the major impact that the HEDPP has had on the institutional structure
for higher education in Vietnam cannot be underestimated.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
N/A

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

81.    A workshop on the Program was held in Danang on February 16 and 17, 2012,
chaired by the Director of the Higher Education Unit in MOET, and attended by
representatives of 79 HEIs. The Bank also participated. The feedback provided by the
HEIs during the workshop, especially the need to differentiate among different types of
HEIs and provide a comprehensive policy framework under which they operate, have
been incorporated in throughout this report.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible to Low

82.     The Risk to Development Outcome is Negligible to Low, based on:
       Government ownership of higher education reform as embedded in its SEDP and
        HERA—this is the Government’s program, it is a high priority for the country
        that addresses a very important constraint to its continued future growth;
       The extensive consultation, consensus-building and general outreach that the
        government pursued before adopting important policies and reforms bodes well
        for “buy-in” from all involved parties;
       The Government’s emphasis on protecting disadvantaged groups, ensuring that
        their access to higher education is not only guaranteed but expanded through
        different mechanisms (Section 3.5 (a));
       Policy reforms did not occur in a vacuum—they were put into practice through
        government programs, partially financed by IDA under HEP2 and NMUP, that
        provided the technical capacity building, investments, etc. that actually supported
        implementation of new policies;
       Approval of the Higher Education Law by the National Assembly; and despite
        delays in implementation of some measures, e.g., Master Plan, the Government
        advanced the drafting and passing of the Higher Education Law which represents
        the highest legislative document to direct its reform in the sector.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
                                             25
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

83.     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is rated moderately satisfactory.
The Bank grounded the Program’s preparation within a comprehensive strategy of
support to higher education reform, incorporated lessons learned from earlier projects and
programs, incorporated best practices with respect to Prior Actions and Benchmarks, and
most importantly, the Bank’s assistance was timely, in response to the Government’s then
recently adopted HERA. The Program was ambitious, especially given the difficult
political realities of higher education reform, but not beyond the Government’s capacity
given its commitment, but perhaps overly optimistic in terms of the speed with which
different policies were expected to be put in place and legislation adopted. In addition,
the reforms required actions to be taken in sequence which was not always possible given
the comprehensiveness of the broad reform leading to some inconsistences in the
implementation of the reforms. The Program’s Results Framework was also slightly
optimistic, especially since it is not clear that some results and targets expected could be
achieved in their entirety within such a short period after policy actions had been taken.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

84.    The quality of supervision is rated satisfactory. Supervision, mostly continuous
in terms of preparation of each subsequent phase in the programmatic series, was timely
and flexible. The Bank’s supervision was pragmatic, reviewing and monitoring the
progress of policy implementation, and providing hands-on technical support. As a
continuous process, it also adjusted Prior Actions and benchmarks to adapt to
Government and implementation realities identified throughout implementations support.
Supervision was coordinated within the context of overall IDA assistance, with financing
of needed technical assistance often provided within the context of other operations, and
implementation of policy measures in others.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85.    Overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory, based on ratings for
ensuring quality at entry and quality of supervision, and on the Program’s outcome rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

86.   Government for purposes of this Section is taken to be the broader Government
and MOET. The Government’s Performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The
Government demonstrated consistent commitment to very ambitious reform program, as

                                            26
reflected in sustained support and enormous number of individual pieces of legislation.
Risk aversion and continuous consultative processes aimed at consensus-building seeking
to incorporate views of multiple stakeholders before adopting policies, produced some
delays in the reform process. Decisions often took longer than originally expected, but
because of this extensive consensus-building, they are likely to be more grounded and
sustainable.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

87.     Implementing Agencies for the purposes of this Section are taken to be the Higher
Education Program Unit in MOET and the Higher Education Department that took over
responsibility for the Program’s implementation when the Program Unit was dismantled
at the end of HEDPO2 and the HEIs. The Higher Education Program Unit/HE
Department moved the Program forward consistently, but progress in improving
monitoring and evaluation, in establishing an HEMPIS as had been originally envisaged
and in improving the availability of timely, reliable data was less than expected.
Implementing Agencies’ Performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Under the
Program, significant decision - making authority was transferred to HEIs from the MOET
to HEIs. The new legal framework requires the HEIs to be more proactive and
accountable in carrying out their academic, financial and human resource management
functions. Implementation differs among public and private HEIs, especially among those
public HEIs that report to a ministry other than MOET. A number of HEIs still await
specific guidance for implementation from the center. However, the policy environment
in which both MOET and the HEIs have been operating is constantly evolving, in a
positive direction, towards the vision put forth in the HERA and both the Higher
Education Program Unit/HE Department in MOET and the HEIs have demonstrated
commitment to the reforms and cooperated to work out issues as they have arisen.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

88.    Overall borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory based on ratings
for Government performance and implementing agencies’ performance.

6. Lessons Learned

89.    The HEDPPs’ implementation reinforces lessons learned that had been identified
during preparation, both with respect to the Bank’s previous support, and with respect to
good practice in policy lending.

    The Program highlights the importance of a comprehensive approach to reform.
     Although the reform was not sequential, e.g., the Higher Education Law was only
     recently approved and progress has been slower than originally expected.
     However, an important effort was set in motion and, in part, due to the extensive
     consultation process carried out, progress has been steady.


                                           27
    There is a need for higher level of coordination for policy reforms in higher
     education reform than that provided by MOET. This is because several important
     public HEIs have reporting relationships beyond those to MOET (e.g. some
     university reports to the Ministry of Health, some to the Ministry of Justice, etc.),
     and without reforms to adjust their relationship with the other ministry or office to
     which they report they are not able to benefit fully from the autonomy provided
     by MOET. Perhaps an inter-ministerial coordinating committee could be put in
     place to prove the link to other relevant ministries (e.g., MOLISA, Ministry of
     Home Affairs, Ministry of Justice, etc.)
    An integrated strategy with a mix of different instruments works effectively in
     support a comprehensive reform program, but delays in the approval of
     implementation of activities under one instrument can lead to delays in the
     approval or implementation of another, e.g., delays in the selection of an
     international expert to help draft the Higher Education Law, led to delays in its
     preparation, consultation and enactment;
    Vietnam’s consensus building process takes time. It would be important to build
     in additional time into the implementation schedule of future operations to
     incorporate adequate time for consensus building, but to do so on the basis of a
     realistic timetable that would ensure consistent and continued progress towards
     critical policy measures;
    Flexibility in adjusting Prior Actions and Benchmarks is important towards the
     eventual achievement of a program’s development objectives
    There is a need to carefully identify realistic outcomes that can be expected to
     result from the adoption of policy actions over an implementation period from
     policy actions selected as prior actions or triggers. This is especially relevant in a
     program that embraces policies enacted or put in place by the Government but
     that are to be implemented by autonomous institutions, in this case the HEIs.
     There is a natural lag between enactment of policies, their dissemination and
     eventual putting in place by institutions of varying institutional capacity.
    In an instrument structured as the HEDPP, a policy-based operation with funding
     provided to the Government for policies is adopted, but the timing between
     adoption of policies and results expected through autonomous institutions, the
     HEIs, was too ambitious. In addition, HEIs were offered only minimal technical
     support, to put in place the new mechanisms, institutional arrangements, and
     overall improvements that was required of them. In any future development
     policy operation in Vietnam in support of higher education autonomy it would be
     important to provide parallel technical assistance and possibly financial incentives
     to ensure they are able to effectively implement new policies.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

90.    The Development policy instrument was appropriate in recognizing the
Government policy actions. However, MOET has not been able to mobilize any of the
funds to support the issuance of by-laws, neither to support HEIs in implementing the

                                           28
Higher Education Law since the first series was fully disbursed in 2009. Ministry of
Planning and Finance has only recently reviewed the MOET’s proposal on mobilizing the
fund. At the time of the draft of this ICR, no fund has been made available. Decision on
financing instrument for future operations should take this implication into consideration.

91.    Having recognized the significance the DPL put in place to enhance legal
framework for the higher education sub sector, MOET is now seeking further support in
developing the national qualification framework with a view to establish industry-linked
knowledge and skills standards for learners.

    III.        Assessment of impacts by curriculum objectives
           3.1.    Positive impacts
           3.1.1. Governance

106. The policy documents of higher education development in the program have
involved in the implementation process of fundamental and comprehensive renovation in
higher education in Vietnam during the period of 2006 - 2020 under the Government's
Resolution No. 14 and Resolution No. 44/NQ-CP dated June 09, 2014 of the Government
on fundamental and comprehensive renovation in education and training, satisfying
requirement of industrialization, modernization in market oriented socialist economy and
international integration.

107. Law on Higher Education is an important policy document which was issued in
Phase 3. This is the most important legal basis for the fundamental and comprehensive
renovation in higher education. Law on Higher Education covers the Program's areas,
including university governance; finance and financial management; quality and higher
education quality enhancement. The Law on Higher Education focuses on the autonomy
of higher education institutions, on testing and quality assurance. Under the provisions of
the Law on Higher Education, the training institutions have autonomy in the formulation
and approval of curriculum. Implementing the Law on Higher Education, the Ministry of
Education and Training takes main responsibility in formulation and submission to the
Government for adoption of Decree No. 141/2013/ND-CP dated October 24, 2013
detailing and guiding implementation of some articles of Law on Higher Education,
which has positive impacts on improving the legal document system; on socialization and
foreign investment, especially on lecturers and entire system of higher education.

108. Decree No. 73/2012/ND-CP dated September 26, 2012 on foreign cooperation
and investment in education stipulating conditions, establishment and operation of
foreign-capitalized educational institutions, including higher education institutions. This
Decree was built from Phase 1 through Phase 2 and was adopted by the Government after
the Document of Phase 3 was signed. This Decree provides for the establishment of
educational institutions, cooperated curricula including higher education and foreign-

                                            40
cooperated training. Decree 73 has positive impacts on the State management for the
establishment of foreign training institutions and joint training activities in accordance
with the law of Vietnam and of the country having projects of establishment of schools or
joint training programs in Vietnam.

109. University Charter, policy documents issued in Phase 2 under Decision No.
58/2010/QD-TTg dated September 22, 2010 of the Prime Minister. University Charter
issued has created a legal framework for higher education, especially in the following
contents: University Council; lecturer standards; conditions and procedures for opening
training majors and specialties; autonomy and social responsibilities of universities;
university accreditation; reporting regime. University Charter has a strong impact on
university management and governance renovation at the macro and micro level;
implementing higher education decentralization; enhancing university autonomy and
social responsibility; developing teaching staff in both quantity and quality; renovating
training contents and methods towards improving education quality, associating training
with scientific research and practical production and business; improving efficiency of
scientific and technological activities, international cooperation; developing facilities,
equipment, textbooks and materials for training, scientific research towards
standardization and modernization; establishing quality assurance systems of higher
education and ensuring effective operation of accreditation system; developing higher
education in association with social needs and international integration. The organization
and implementation of University Charter in accordance with Decision 58 has
strengthened the autonomy of universities in the organization of school activities;
improved the competencies and quality of teaching staff and is a prerequisite for the
development of Law on Higher Education later.

110. Decision No. 380/2009/QD-TTg dated March 24, 2009 of the Prime Minister
promulgating the Regulation on organization and operation of Vietnamese - German
University. This policy document was developed and promulgated in Phase 1. Regulation
on organization and operation of Vietnamese - German University defined an advanced
organization model of higher education in Vietnam, which established a University
Council which had real power. Vietnamese - German University has empowered with
high autonomy in organization of human resources, finance, enrollment, training
organization and management, science and technology activities; the successes in
applying models and mechanisms at Vietnamese - German University will be
summarized, evaluated and applied gradually to the entire system of higher education;
create important premise and motivation for fundamental and comprehensive renovation
of education in Vietnam.

111. Decision No. 61/2009/QD-TTg dated April 17, 2009 of the Prime Minister
promulgating the Regulation on organization and operation of private universities. The
document was issued in Phase 1. This decision is a legal basis for the operation of private
universities, especially human resource organization, functions, duties, training and
scientific research, quality assurance, campus construction, experimental equipment,
library, facilities. This Regulation is the basis for investors to build strategic development
of the university by phase and road-map committed in the university establishment

                                             41
agenda. Regulation on organization and operation of private universities has a positive
effect in encouraging education investment and socialization.

112. Decision No. 07/2009/QD-TTg dated January 15, 2009 of the Prime Minister
specifying conditions and procedures for the establishment, operation suspension, merge,
split, dissolution of the universities. This document issued in Phase 1 is minimum
standards for the founders, investors to prepare necessary documents and conditions for
the establishment of universities. This decision also stipulates minimum standards for the
construction and evaluation of documents for universities establishment towards quality
assurance conditions in preparation of training organization.

113. The policy documents for higher education development which were developed
and issued in all 3 phases of the Program focus on strengthening autonomy and
accountability of universities; changing State management approaches, especially that of
the Ministry of Education and Training applicable to higher education institutions.

       3.1.2. Finance

114. Circular No. 57/2011/TT-BGDDT dated December 2, 2011 of the Minister of
Education and Training, which was amended and supplemented by Circular No.
20/2012/TT-BGDDT dated June 12, 2012, was developed and promulgated in Phase 3.
The Circular provides for identification of enrollment quotas of doctoral, master,
university, college and professional high school levels, including: criteria and principles
for determining enrollment quotas; registration procedures, violation handling. This
Circular has positive impact on the autonomy and self-accountability of training
institutions in determining and implementing the annual enrollment quotas; ensuring
openness and transparency in the determination and announcement of annual enrollment
quotas; creating conditions for society and learners to monitor the quality assurance
capability of training institutions while promoting the investment in and development of
conditions for training quality assurance by institutions. Criteria for determining targets
will be based on minimum requirements of competencies of training staff and facilities.

115. Decree No. 49/2010/ND-CP dated May 14, 2010 stipulating on reduction and
exemption of tuition fee, support for learning costs, collection and use of tuition
applicable to educational institutions belonging to national education system from the
2010 - 2011 school year to the 2014-2015 school year. This policy document was
developed and promulgated in Phase 2. Decree 49 created a legal framework and road-
map for tuition fee adjustment in the national education system from the 2010-2011
school year to 2014-2015 school year, including: Stipulating subjects who do not have to
pay tuition fees, Subjects exempted from tuition fees; Subjects entitled to tuition fee
reduction; Subjects entitled to support for learning costs; Mechanism of reduction and
exemption of tuition fees and support for learning costs; Terminable training will be free
from tuition fees; Stipulating principles for determining tuition fees; tuition fee
framework for early childhood education and general education; tuition fee maximum
level for vocational education and formal higher education in public educational
institutions and tuition fee increase road-map until the 2014 - 2015 school year;

                                            42
stipulating tuition fees for regular training and training under the credit system;
organizing the collection and use of tuition fees. The tuition fees that are higher than the
tuition fees paid before the promulgation of the Decree have a positive effect in quality
improvement and assurance under the condition of limited State budget.

116. Decision No. 795/QĐ-BGDDT dated on 27 February 2010 regulates the
specification of enrollment quota, enrollment procedures, announcement of enrollment
quota, monitoring and handling violations in implementing enrollment quota. This
document was elaborated and enforced in Phase 2. It regulates the student - faculty ratio;
space area per a student; specifies enrollment quota for regular education, in-service
training, articulation education, and second degree education; identification of enrollment
quota in 2010 was still based on enrollment results in 2009 and public reports of
education institutions. This Circular helps to make the specification and allocation of
training quota to higher education institutions and lay foundation for developing criteria
for quota specification. The Circular was then replaced with Circular No. 57/2011/TT-
BGDDT dated 2 December 2011 which was modified and supplemented in line with
Circular No. 20/2012/TT-BGDDT dated on 12 June 2012.

117. Joint Circular No. 220/2009/TTLT-BTC-BGDDT by the Ministry of Finance and
the Ministry of Education and Training dated on 20 November 2009 guiding financial
management of the budget for the implementation of the Advanced Training Program.
This Circular was promulgated in Phase 2. The Circular regulates budget source for the
implementation of the Advanced Training Program; expenditure items, and cost norms;
guidance on designing budget projection and finalization, and cost norms with financial
source from State Budget, meeting requirements of universities in carrying out the
Advanced Training Program. It is the motive drive for universities to expand the
operations of Advanced Training Program to other faculties and universities, which
creates development momentum comprehensively in the Higher Education system,
aiming at improving Higher Education training quality.

118. Resolution No. 35/2009/NQ-QH12 dated on 19 June 2009 in the fifth session of
the 12th National Assembly provides guiding principles and directions for reforms of
some financial mechanisms in education and training from school year 2010-2011 to
school year 2014-2015. This document was promulgated in Phase 1. This Resolution
offers legal frameworks for reforms in financial mechanism in education in general and
higher education in particular; provides legal basis for autonomy enhancement, social
responsibility of universities in financial aspects; facilitates universities to actively adjust
tuition fees for training costs aiming at guaranteeing and improving training quality.

       3.1.3. Quality and quality improvement

119. Circular No. 57/2012/TT-BGDDT dated on 27 December 2012. This document
was elaborated in Phase 3. It provides guidelines for higher education institutions in
applying credit based training system; minimum training standards for higher education
institutions; consistency of scoring system; gives early warnings for students in order to
maintain credit accumulation at an acceptable level and changes in administration for

                                              43
higher education institutions. This Circular overcomes some limitations and gaps during
the implementation of credit based training, which was promulgated together with
Decision No. 43/2007/QĐ-BGDDT dated on 15 August 2007 by the Ministry of
Education and Training.

120. Official Letter No. 2196/BGDDT-GDDH dated on 22 April 2010 provides
guidance on setting and announcement of program outcome standards. This document
was elaborated and promulgated in Phase 2 guiding universities and colleges to publicize
their training capabilities and quality assurance conditions so that students will know
which kinds of professional knowledge, work skills, problem awareness and solving
ability, and jobs they can gain after graduation. This document promotes higher education
institutions to develop and issue criteria about knowledge, skills, behaviors and their
capabilities in guiding students to achieve targeted missions after graduation; affirm the
training quality of fields of study in their universities; take on commitments on training
quality towards students, financial sponsors and society and make effort to implement
quality assurance conditions; guide students to choose fields of study and vocational
training, assist governmental agencies in policy making, provide orientation support to
enterprises in recruitment and invest in higher education development.

121. Circular No. 09/2009/TT-BGDD dated on 7 May 2009 by the Minister of
Education and Training regulates the public implementation towards educational
institutions within national education system. This policy document, elaborated and
promulgated in Phase 1, had positive impacts on publicizing quality assurance conditions;
enabled transparency in activities, activity outcomes and quality assurance conditions of
universities; laid a good foundation for the public to take part in monitoring quality of
universities and colleges; and helped prestigious and high quality universities to ensure
education quality. This is one of activities which help university to implement their
autonomy and social responsibilities.

122. Circular No. 10/2009/TT-BGDDT dated on 7 May 2009 by Minister of MOET
provides for the Regulations on Doctorate programs. This Circular was elaborated and
issued in Phase 1. It is the legal basis for training institutions to gain autonomy in
providing higher quality doctorate programs. Training institutions are active in
recruitment, program design, training organization and evaluation and awarding doctorate
degrees.

123. Decision No. 1505/QD-TTg dated on 15 October 2008 by Prime Minister
approves the scheme on "the implementation of advanced training program at a number
of Vietnamese universities in the 2008-2015 period". The Advanced Training Program
has been applied in 23 big universities with 35 training programs built under the
cooperation with high ranking universities in the world. This is an important milestone
which makes a positive impact on teaching and learning activities in universities. It is one
of the practical program for the quality improvement of higher education: teacher
exchange program, English skill enhancement for teachers and students; attracting
international students; upgrading facilities, supplementing modern teaching equipment,
building capacity for teachers, management officers, and inviting foreign professors to

                                            44
join the faculty in teaching; aiming at improving quality of scientific and technological
activities and international cooperation. Its achievement has widely influenced other
programs in the university.

        3.2. Limitations and shortcomings
        3.2.1. Governance
124. There are many hindrances in the implementation of higher education Law
because its relevant guideline systems have not been completed synchronously, namely,
Decree regulating layer standards, ranking framework, and ranking standards for higher
education institutions; University Charter; College Charter; Circular stipulating minimum
knowledge load and required capabilities of students for higher education; Circular
regulating national standards for higher education institutions.

125. The University Regulations as regulated in the Decision No. 58 of the Prime
Minister have not been fully implemented. Due to lack of guidelines on structure and
members in a University Committee, there is no university committee set up in the
private universities. The Regulation does not regulate the type of not-for-profit private
universities. These limitations will be amended and supplemented in the new University
Regulation, which has been submitted to Prime Minister for approval. As planned, the
Regulation will be promulgated in November 2014.

126. The separation of Regulation on organization and operation of private universities
as regulated at Decision No. 61/2009/QD-TTg dated on 17 April 2009 by the Prime
Minister: has many overlapped articles with the University Charter promulgated by the
Prime Minister; no representatives from stakeholders as members of Board of
Management and Chairman of the Board of Management; no regulations on not-for-profit
operation of private universities. These shortcomings will be eliminated by integrating
the Regulation on organization and operation of private universities with University
Charter; clearly specifying members of the Board of Management and adding the model
of not-for-profit private universities.

127. During the implementation, there has existed some limitations in the Regulation
on organization and operation of Vietnam - German University related to: right of the
representative as a member of the university committee when he/ she is absence from the
committee meeting; rights of the Rector; solving tasks during university construction.
The Regulation was amended and supplemented in an appropriate way as directed by the
Prime Minister at Document No. 270/VPCP – KGVX dated on 13 January 2011 about
amending and supplementing the Regulation on organization and operation of Vietnam -
German University.

       3.2.2. Finance

128. Regulations of Circular No. 57/2011/TT-BGDDT dated on 2 December 2011
were amended and supplemented in accordance with Circular No. 20/2012/TT-BGDDT
dated on 12 June 2012 with 2 criteria on staff capability and facility typical for capability
of the training institutions. There is no social needs based criteria. On the other hand,

                                             45
registering quota is not necessarily based on field of study. This regulation has led to the
overcrowding situation in some fields of study; not met employee needs, resulting in the
selective lack and abundance of workforce.

129. Circular No. 49/2010/ND-CP dated on 14 may 2010 by the Government exists the
shortcoming. It regulates fixed tuition fees and road map to increase the tuition fee, with
no conversion to the approval time. Therefore, the adjustment level of tuition fees is
lower than the fluctuation level of consumption price index.

130. The implementation of Resolution No. 35/2009/NQ-QH12 dated on 19 June 2009
promulgated in the fifth session of the 12th National Assembly has still been slow. The
Pilot Scheme on financial autonomy for four universities has been submitted to the Prime
Minister and still waiting for the approval.

       3.2.3. Quality and quality assurance

131. The implementation of Circular No. 57/2012/TT-BGDDT dated on 27 December
2012 which was amended and supplemented in accordance with Decision No.
43/2007/QĐ-BGDDT dated on 15 August 2007 by the Ministry of Education and
Training on credit based training system faces with some obstacles because the higher
education law regulates that Training organization and management is implemented
based on school year or credit systems. Therefore, the number of training institutions
applying credit based system and the number of students following credit based training
has increased slightly.

132. There is no link between Official Letter No. 2196/BGDDT-GDDH dated on 22
April 2010 guiding the development and announcement of program outcome standard
and the screening and developing training program; program outcome standard and
training program; inappropriate training organization and management methods;
announcement of unreasonable program outcome standards

133. Implementation of the Advanced Training Program as regulated at Decision No.
1505/QD-TTg dated on 15 October 2008 by the Prime Minister approving the scheme on
"the implementation of advanced training program at a number of Vietnamese
universities in the 2008-2015 period" has been on track. However, because there is no
state budget left from training program in Phase 1 and Phase 2, maintaining and
developing the Advanced Training Program has been in difficulty, especially among
those less attractive majors like Agriculture, Material Science, etc. In some universities,
the management of Advanced Programs is not aligned between the units in charge and
the Academic Affairs Department.

134. There is some limitations in the implementation of Circular No. 10/2009/TT-
BGDDT dated on 7 May 2009 by the Minister of Education and Training. It regulates the
required foreign language ability, enrollment duration, punishment mechanism if not met
requirements; no monitoring and checking mechanism, the doctorates required to follow
continuous training duration; no unified regulation on the format of a dissertation to

                                            46
apply for all universities. Some limitations have been amended and supplemented in
accordance with Circular No. 05/2012/TT-BGDDT dated on 15 February 2012 and
continue to be amended and supplemented in accordance with regulation of higher
education law.

    IV. Disbursement, allocation and use of loan fund
   4.1. Disbursement

135. After program documents of all phases have been approved the World Bank and
the Government of Vietnam signed loan agreements:
• Phase 1: on 21 August 2009 and the World Bank transferred 52.44 million VND to
    the Government of Vietnam on 23 December 2009.
• Phase 2: The Loan Agreement was signed on 16 March 2011, and the World Bank
    transferred 51.42 million US$ to the Government of Vietnam on 9 May 2011.
• Phase 3: Loan agreement was signed on 14 May 2013, and the World Bank
    transferred 50 million US$ to the Government of Vietnam in September 2013.

136. As a result, the World Bank has disbursed the whole program budget for the
Government of Vietnam. This is a loan form with fast disbursement.

   4.2. Allocation and use of loans

137. Although loan funds have been transferred to the Government of Vietnam early,
the budget has not yet been allocated for beneficiaries because the relevant Ministries
including the Ministry of Education and Training, the Ministry of Planning and
Investment, the Ministry of Finance have not reached an agreement on beneficiary
portfolio and specific allocation amounts to be reported to the Prime Minister for
consideration and decision making.

138. Slow loan fund allocation and use has limited loan effectiveness. This is also the
weakness of development policy program based lending.

   V.     Conclusion and recommendations

139. The Higher Education Development Policy Program has made positive impact on
planning process for system development policy through establishing and promulgating
the system of normative legal documents relating to higher education system and
Government's commitment in implementing articles within the Program.

140. In addition to positive impacts, during the implementation, there have been
limitations and shortcomings in the system of normative legal documents
institutionalizing policies regarding higher education system development. A number of
legal documents need to be amended and supplemented such as the Decree on tuition
fees; Universities Charter, Regulations on fund allocation to public higher education
institutions; Regulations on enrollment quota registration and determination.


                                          47
141. The Higher Education Development Policy Program has been under good track in
loan agreement negotiation and approval, however, the use of loans have met with many
difficulties because the lending fund was channeled into the state budget, and therefore its
use required the agreement of various related ministries and agencies which in turn
resulted in limited effectiveness of loan use.

142. The World Bank is proposed to continue its support extended to the higher
education system development in an appropriate manner to bring about higher investment
effectiveness in the coming time. The Ministry of Education and Training proposes the
World Bank to support the following activities:

       a. Build training capacity for selected key higher education institutions to
          support them build and develop some specific majors and fields of study at the
          regional quality level to meet the demand of the nation's industrialization and
          modernization.
       b. Develop Vietnam National Qualification Framework in higher education to
          standardize minimum knowledge, skills and capabilities of students after
          graduation from specific major or each field of study at higher education level.
       c. Review and restructure higher education system.
       d. Develop a quality assurance system for higher education.
