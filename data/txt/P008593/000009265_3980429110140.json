Second Road Project will involve\n            rehabilitation of roads and highways, and bridges for river\n            crossings.  Less than 20 people will be relocated, and a\n            resettlement package has been provided.  This environmental\n            assessment studied the impacts for three stages:\n            construction of camp, during road construction, and after\n            construction.  At the first stage, construction of camp\n            sites away from vegetated areas will reduce vegetation\n            destruction.  Good practice will be adopted to avoid\n            oil-grease spillage and recycling will be pursued.  Asphalt\n            plant will be located at leeward edge of the camp to reduce\n            air and sound pollutions.  Measures to tackle waste disposal\n            and poor sanitation include source separation of garbage and\n            use of organic materials as compost.  At the second stage,\n            landscape disfiguration can be mitigated by road side\n            plantation of trees and gentle slopes at cut and fill\n            sections.  Drainage works stabilized with retaining\n            structures will be provided to prevent landslides.  There\n            will be pollution control for construction equipment and\n            precautionary measures during blasting at quarries.  Ditches\n            will be built to reduce interference with surface drainage.\n            Channeled water flow will reduce erosion of road embankment.\n            Controlled withdrawal of water from deep aquifer will retain\n            sub-soil water table.  Drainage facilities will be used to\n            reduce surface and ground water at the third stage."}, "docdt": "1997-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
