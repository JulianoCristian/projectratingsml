3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

The original objective of the project was not revised.

The objective and sub-objectives were clear, realistic in scale and scope, and important to the country's
economic and social development. They were also timely and appropriate to the needs of the Borrower,
considering: (i) Poland's increasing traffic volumes; (ii) the mixture of traffic found on Polish roads; (iii)
budget constraints which had slowed down road improvement efforts, and as a result, certain road sections
were experiencing increasing capacity and safety problems. In particular, the Flood Component was really
appropriate to Poland, which was severely affected by the flood in 1997 in terms of heavy damages to
roads and bridges, especially in areas close to urban or industrial centers. Further, few major cities had
bypasses, and in many urban areas, traffic capacity was approaching its upper limit. New bypasses, and
roads and railroad grade separations along these roads, were expected to eliminate point impediments to
traffic-flow capacity. In addition, in selected locations, a second carriageway was needed.

The project was consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Poland, dated April 14,
1997, which concentrated on the removal of infrastructure bottlenecks, on creation of better conditions for
private sector participation in infrastructure, and on infrastructure modernization, as a core part of the
strategy for successful European Union (EU) integration and economic development. The project was
based on the General Directorate of Public Roads's [Generalna Dyrekcja Drog Publicznych] (GDDP)
1996-2000 Road Investment Program.

The project took into account lessons learned from previous Bank-assisted projects in the transport sector
in Poland, including the First Transport Project and the Roads Project which highlighted the need to focus
at an early stage on environmental issues to get timely clearance from relevant authorities and avoid delays
in proposed project processing. Other main lessons learned from these projects were the importance of: (i)
keeping the project objectives clear and simple in order to facilitate implementation and monitoring; (ii)
guaranteeing counterpart funds on time in order to avoid delays or even failures; and (iii) providing advice
on construction techniques to the domestic contractors to increase their competitiveness.

The following two risk factors which could affect project implementation were taken into account while
designing the project: (i) the availability of adequate local funds; and (ii) the ability of the institutions to
implement the project on time. In order to reduce these risks, the Government agreed at negotiations to: (i)
budget local costs (US$240.0 million equivalent) and, if the case arises, any cost overrun; (ii) consult
GDDP's budget with the Bank on an annual basis; (iii) progressively increase GDDP's maintenance budget
in order to ensure appropriate maintenance of the national road network; (iv) retain the existing Project
Monitoring Unit (PMU) for the project; (v) prepare first year's road/bridge/bypass works program; and (vi)
execute the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) in accordance with defined monitoring criteria, and reporting
arrangements.

3.2 Revised Objective:

The objective was not revised.

3.3 Original Components:

The project consisted of the following components under three categories: (i) Civil Works; (ii) Goods; and
(iii) Technical Assistance and Training. They were all related to achieving the project's objectives. The
Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) (former Ministry of Transport and Maritime Economy {MTME}) and
GDDKiA (former GDDP and National Motor Agency ) had sufficient technical, administrative and
          1                                                2


financial capacity for successful implementation of these components. Following is a description of each
one of the project's components.

A. Civil Works

(a) Rehabilitation, upgrading, realignment and resurfacing of priority road sections. This component
included 522 km of road works, divided into four groups totaling 42 separate contracts. Key sections of
principal national roads were selected to benefit from pavement reinforcement and asphalt concrete
overlays, with associated widening or shoulder improvement where justified, and in certain cases new
bypasses of congested urban areas were to be built.

(b) Construction and reconstruction of bridges. The project included the reconstruction of two high
priority bridges, and construction of three new permanent bridges.

(c) Construction of new bypasses. In order to eliminate congestion in urban areas, the project included
the construction of 12 new bypasses totaling 61.7 km in length.

(d)   Emergency reconstruction and repair of flood-damaged high priority roads (300 km) and
bridges. The project included emergency reconstruction and repair of high priority roads and bridges which
were severely damaged or washed away by the 1997 flood. The total length of road sections for
reconstruction was approximately 300 km. About 1.6 km of flood-damaged concrete and steel/concrete
bridges (consisting of 18 contracts) was included for emergency reconstruction or repair under this
subcomponent.

1General Directorate for National Roads and Motorways (Generalna Dyrekcja Drog Kuejowych I Autostrad).
2GDDP and National Motorway Agency merged in 1999 to become GDDKiA.

B. Goods

(a) Equipment, vehicles, and materials for road maintenance. The project included funding for road
maintenance equipment, vehicles, and materials.

(b) Equipment, vehicles, and materials for road safety. The project included funding for road safety
equipment, vehicles, and materials.

C. Technical Assistance (TA) and Training

(a) This activity consisted of providing TA and training for MOI, GDDKiA, Regional Administration of
GDDP [Dyrekcja Okregowa Drog Publicmych] (DODP) , and the National Police on road maintenance,
privatization of the management, construction, and design methods, modernization of the construction and

consulting industries, and the Road Safety Program. Under this category, the project was also to finance
the Road User Charges Study.

3.4 Revised Components:

The components were not revised. However, based on a formal request from the MOI, the Legal Agreement
was amended in December 2004 in order to create a new expenditure category to carry out three specific
studies for the Polish National Railways (PKP), referenced as "Provision of technical assistance to the
Railway Sector Reform", and allocate US$2.8 million (Euro 2.4 million equivalent) from the remaining
funds of the project to finance these studies.

A separate Implementation Completion Memorandum (ICM) will be prepared for this activity by June 30,
2007, which will spell out its outcome.


3.5 Quality at Entry:

Satisfactory. The project's quality at entry received a satisfactory rating from the Quality Assurance
Group (QAG). According to QAG, the project implementation plan was sound as borne out by the progress
in project implementation, despite an initial delay caused by the Government's administrative reform. QAG
also noted that the project design was sound not only for technical aspects, but also concerning institution
building and safety. The ICR also deems the quality at entry to be satisfactory and the project as well
conceived.

As mentioned in the earlier section, the project's main objective and sub-objectives were consistent with the
CAS and the Government priorities and met the critical needs of Poland's transport sector. Since the MOI
and GDDKiA had the technical capacity, the quality of project design was generally adequate to meet the
project's overriding objective. During preparation of the project, major risk factors and lessons learned
from other earlier projects in the transport sector in Poland were considered and incorporated into the
project design.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

Satisfactory. The project's Development Objective (DO) was fully met. It is worth mentioning here that,
the project was implemented at a time when Poland was going through large political, social, and economic
changes. Thus, the project's meeting its DO under these difficult circumstances itself could be considered
as a significant achievement.

The major outcomes and achievements of the project are as follows:




                                                     - 4 -

(i) Improving the main national road network. The outcome of the project toward this objective was
satisfactory. Rehabilitation, upgrading, realignment, and resurfacing of priority road sections and their
crossings through cities covering a distance of 535 km were completed. Through 70 civil works contracts,
reconstruction and upgrading of two bridges, and construction of four new major bridges and 13 bypasses
around congested cities, covering a distance of 58.5 km were also completed. In addition, road maintenance
equipment were also procured and the equipment used under force account by MOI are operational.

The completion of these activities has resulted in reducing trip time and vehicle operating cost, and thereby
reducing transportation costs in project-affected areas. In addition, important sections of national highway
have improved and become safer and will, as a result, reduce traffic congestion, and accidents. It is also
expected to improve the burden of inconvenience placed on road users as a result of the deterioration of the
road network in Poland over recent years.

The project also contributed to improve the quality of main national road network, as shown in the Table
below:

(ii) Reconstructing and repairing flood-damaged high priority roads and bridges. A total number of 95
contracts (392 km ) were completed for the reconstruction of flood-damaged roads and bridges. The
component included the construction of retaining walls, flood prevention bunds, raising of alignments,
improvement of drainage systems and road surfaces. This entire component in conjunction with other flood
preventative measures, financed by the EU, and flood alert early warning systems, financed by the Bank,
are jointly providing better protection to those areas affected by the 1997 floods. This improvement will
have a positive impact upon both the regional and national road network.

(iii) Studying and solving the rutting situation on the network. The project helped to strengthen the
capacity of GDDKiA to plan its annual rehabilitations. The computerized road management software,
Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model-4 (HDM-4) is now partly operational at both the
national and regional levels. The data are being collected through the calibration of the HDM-4 decision
model.

(iv) Promoting the competitive capacity of domestic contractors through improvement of their
technical, managerial, and financial capacity. Capacity of domestic contractors was fostered under the
project because of their involvement in a large number of civil works contracts. For example, for the
reconstruction and repairing of flood-damaged roads and bridges, all the contracts were undertaken by
Polish contractors, and for non-emergency civil works, out of 70 contracts, 47 were undertaken by Polish
contractors. As a result, most of them are now better prepared both in terms of managerial and financial
capacity to compete further within the context of the rehabilitation and construction of road investments in
the years to come.

(v) Adjusting road user charges for different vehicle types to cover the economic costs incurred by each
type of vehicle, and to achieve a well balanced combined transport framework. GDDKiA's capacity in
terms of monitoring and planning investments has increased substantially. HDM-4 model is used to
prioritize expenditure financed from various road user charges such as excise tax, additional road charges
on fuel, and road fees. A study carried out in 2003 reviewed all the fees, taxes and charges paid by the road
users and the cost that each class of vehicle imposes on the road network (wear and tear costs). The results
and findings from the study are then used to determine the Government's road funding policy and the
GDDKiA's future investment plans.

(vi) Advising on the operation, management, and administration of the road sector, and on road safety
issues and its coordination with the National Traffic Police and GDDKiA. The Road Safety
sub-component consisted of the implementation of the GAMBIT Program (National Road Safety Program
of the Polish Government) developed in 1997 (and updated in 2000). National Road Safety Council
(NRSC), the National Police, and GDDKiA worked together in full cooperation to improve the road safety
level. The road safety coordinator and local safety experts are operational and assist NRSC to identify the
most cost-effective road safety investments. Their involvement is contributing significantly to build local
capacity and expertise.

(vii) Improving the road safety situation. The National Road Safety Program has been operating in
Poland since 2001. It provides an orientation for road safety policy and guidance for concrete actions.
Important provisions have been made to the national legislation on road safety to further strengthen the
road safety structure and enhance its operational basis. Poland has been provided with a nationwide road
safety framework comprising a central coordination body and 16 regional branches. There is an increased
involvement of the private sector and Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs), mainly within the
framework of Global Road Safety Partnership (GRSP) Committee. An increased contribution to national
road safety efforts has been noticed. There is a slow but steady progress in raising social awareness of road
hazards and increasing the public's recognition of road safety measures, especially against excessive speed
and alcohol impairment.

Eleven black spots elimination contracts were awarded by GDDKiA, seven of which were completed.
Private companies sponsored signaling of some further black spots. Installation of cats eyes and rumble
strips has resulted in improving road safety, and reducing road hazards in many parts of the country.

A Regional Road Safety Program was implemented in eight regions (voivodships). US$6 million from the
loan was used to co-finance the treatment of hazardous locations and regional authorities provided
counterpart funding worth US$7.05 million. The program consisted of small schemes aimed at improving
safety levels in local communities using cost-effective engineering measures.

The number of road crashes has been declining since 1997, despite a steady growth in car ownership. The
number of fatalities has shown the fastest decline, followed by a slight drop in injuries and crash figures.
By signing the European Road Safety Charter in April 2004, Poland endorsed the European Community's
road safety goals. Shortly following the accession, in May 2004, the countrywide speed limit of 50 km/hr
within built-up areas was passed by the Parliament.

For further details, see Annex 9.

(viii) Environmental aspects, right of way, land acquisition. The project was successful in this regard
compared to other projects that the Bank or others financed in Poland. This was mainly due to the
preparation of the bypass design and to better communications with communities. The experience and
knowledge gained in this field under the project is now being applied to other projects.

4.2 Outputs by components:
A. Civil Works

See Section 4.1

Achievement of this component is satisfactory.

B. Goods

Thirty mobile heavy snow blowers, as well as 39 salt mixing and storage depots were procured by
GDDKiA under the project and are fully operational. GDDKiA also procured two cats eyes, rumble strips,
and crash cushions for installing on the National Road Network. Various road safety equipment for the
National Police were delivered under the project: (i) 4,000 security kits; (ii) 3,000 sobriety testers; (iii) 500
hand torches; (iv) 100 heavy motorcycles for heavy duty service; (v) 700 sets each consisting of a
motorcycle leather suit, gloves, boots, and helmet with a transmission system; (vi) a communication
system; (vii) cat eyes; and (vii) 39 traffic photo radars.

Achievement of this component is satisfactory.

C. Technical Assistance and Training

An international firm of consulting engineers financed under the project provided satisfactory and
continuous support to GDDKiA during the implementation period. The two resident advisors provided



                                                      - 7 -

advice and training to counterpart staff on all matters of the project pertaining to management,
procurement, and financial issues including site management and contract management. The consultants
also helped in improving the methodology for prioritizing road expenditures based on the Government's
2002-2005 road development program and the implementation of HDM-4 into the existing road
management system. Visiting specialists advised on ways to improve contract and specification documents,
the causes of rutting problems and environmental management of road surface run off.

National Road Safety Council

Road safety coordinator and local experts. In order to enhance the institutional ability of the Secretariat
of NRSC to lead and coordinate the work on road safety, a road safety coordinator and four local experts
were employed to enable a more effective implementation of road safety policy and programs based on
cost-effective investments.

Analysis of selected aspects of road user behavior. The project established a regular, consistent and
well-coordinated process of acquiring information about key components of road safety prevention: traffic
speed and the use of seat belts. Reports are available on www.krbrd.gov.pl

Training Program in Road Safety. The project developed comprehensive training materials covering the
whole road safety system which would help to establish a regular training process of road safety personnel
of the regional road safety councils, improve their professional skills, and enable them to take more
effective leadership in road safety work.

Road Safety Survey and Campaign. This activity had two objectives. The first was to conduct an
investigation about public perception of road safety in the country, and the second was to develop and
implement a countrywide campaign encouraging the use of seatbelts on the basis of the survey results and
data on seatbelt use obtained from the analysis of selected aspects of road user behavior.

Purchase of technical software supporting tools. A package of software for road design and traffic
engineering was purchased from the Technical University in Gdansk to facilitate and raise the quality of
education of road designers and traffic engineers.

Seminars, study tours, international cooperation. The staff of NRSC Secretariat participated in study
tours abroad and international seminars and took an active part in international cooperation, which enabled
the acquisition and use of expertise and best practices from other countries.

GDDKiA

Training courses/seminars on project management, new investments, Environmental Assessment, and
Blackspot Program, and study tours for material engineers, road maintenance staff, and pavement engineers
were conducted for GDDKiA.

Achievement of this component is satisfactory.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:

As stated in the SAR, none of the non-emergency road sections (rehabilitation and modernization) schemes
had less than 6000 Vehicles Per Day (vpd), and none of the bypasses and bridges less than 10,000 vpd.
The bypass alignments selected have achieved traffic diversions of between 70 and 90 percent of total
traffic, depending on the amount of transit traffic passing through the location.

For bridge and new bypass construction, the average internal rate of return (IRR) was 40 percent and for
modernization/rehabilitation schemes, it was 34 percent, compared to the minimum 12 percent identified in
the SAR. These IRRs indicate high benefits by way of lower operating costs, reduced trip time and accident
costs, and a reduction in adverse environmental impacts. None of the schemes undertaken created any
adverse environmental impacts during construction or after.

Costs and benefits were measured net of taxes. Current levels were estimated based on counts carried out
by GDDKiA. Cost savings per km on road rehabilitation/modernization contracts averaged US$0.04 per
km/vehicle/day. With regard to rehabilitation contracts which did not involve any element of modernization,
the benefits only related to savings in operating costs.

4.4 Financial rate of return:

N.A.

4.5 Institutional development impact:

Substantial. The project resulted in a substantial institutional development impact.

·   Roads Safety. See section 4.1

·   Road Administration. GDDKiA's capacity in terms of monitoring and planning investments has
increased substantially. The computerized road management HDM-4 software is now partly operational at
both the national and regional levels. The staff training was completed during June 2005. This has
facilitated issuing a draft 6-year rolling road expenditure program and a pilot 12-year cash flow. This draft
was used to develop the Operation Plan for Transport 2007- 2013 to meet European Union assistance
according to EU budget. The study helped to identify the ultimate road network, the right timing of works
and the required standard and scope of works and this will be revised and developed over future years.
GDDKiA Division in Cracow is responsible for disseminating knowledge acquired under the project and
helping the regional offices to master the maintenance planning exercise.

·   National Road Fund. The project facilitated the creation of the National Road Fund by making
available the services of experts on Road Funds. The National Road Fund is fully operational since January
2004 and is generating sufficient funds for future road investments. At present, in its first year of operation
the Road Fund is only being used to finance investment. Investigations are taking place into ways in which
the Road Fund may be utilized for maintenance, investment or a combination of both. The project also
paved the way for the Government's 2004-2009 National Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program,
which provides a long-term vision for road maintenance and rehabilitation as well as the necessary funding
mechanisms.




                                                     - 9 -

·   Growth of Domestic Consultants. The project contributed to furthering the privatization and growth
of domestic consultants and the domestic construction industry. As mentioned in Section 4.1, domestic
contractors are now better prepared both in terms of managerial and financial capacity to compete further
in the rehabilitation and construction of road investments in the years to come.

Training sessions given on procurement of works, site supervision, documentation and procedures, have
enabled GDDKiA staff to have a better understanding of the principles and practice of site supervision
necessary for a road-works contract. The training on FIDIC Conditions of Contract provided participants
with an understanding of the principles and practice associated with the use of the FIDIC red book for
major road-works contracts. Project managers and contract engineers have benefited from a better
understanding of their roles and responsibilities under Bank procedures. The training programs were also
useful in introducing modern site supervision techniques to resident engineers and their assistants and
enabling them to gain a thorough understanding of their roles and responsibilities. Likewise, financial
managers have received a better understanding of international and the Bank's financial procedures.

·   Even though National Competitive Bidding (NCB) was built into the project design very late because
of the unexpected Flood Component, it proved to be a very successful, popular and efficient tool. The NCB
procedure was instrumental to the GDDKiA getting contracts for works at low cost, from a dedicated,
although new and numerous, group of small to medium size contractors. It is now widely used and this is
probably a positive outcome of the project.

However, the project did not result in capacity building for specific project monitoring. Since the
Government outsourced monitoring activities to consultants, even though it helped project implementation,
institutional impact of this aspect was minimal.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

None.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

The original closing date of the project, which was June 30, 2003, was first extended by 18 months to
December 31, 2004 due to the following reasons: (i) the national administration was reorganized from 49 to
16 voivodships in 1998 and it became operational only on January 1, 1999. The delays experienced made
the extension of the closing date by 18 months inevitable; and (ii) there were delays in local authority
approvals, land acquisition, design documentation by local consultants, and in the preparation and
presentation of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for the new bypass and bridge contracts.

The project was subsequently extended for two more years, from December 31, 2004 to December 31,
2006, with the exclusive purpose of using the US$2.8 million in savings to finance, as mentioned in Section
3.4, studies for the reform of the railway sector.




                                                     - 10 -

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

See Section 5.2.

5.4 Costs and financing:

The total final cost of the project was US$473.4 million, compared to US$540 million as estimated at
appraisal. The Bank financed US$300 million (63.3%), and the GOP contributed US$173.4 million
equivalent in local costs (36.7%). The local costs are presented net and are exclusive of land acquisition
costs, design and documentation costs, supervision costs and VAT, which if included would increase the
overall cost of the project over the original US$540 million estimate.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

Likely. Considering that the Government is fully committed to strengthening its road network and to
reducing traffic accidents, and also partly in view of its accession to the EU, the project outcome is likely to
be sustainable. On the financing side, the government is now making allocations in the budget for road
maintenance. For example, 12% of the excise tax collected by the Government is now earmarked to
GDDKiA for road and bridge maintenance. Investment projects are being financed by the Road Fund. In
addition, financial resources would also be available from the Government's 2004-2009 National Roads
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program. The Bank's Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation (RMR)
Program will also finance road maintenance, in addition to a Road Safety Program. Consequently, it is
expected that while in 2002, 37% and in 2004, 46% of the roads were in good condition, by 2009, 70% of
the national roads would be in good condition.

During 1997-2004, the budget allocated to rehabilitation and maintenance has evolved as follows
(Equivalent US$ Million):

      Year/(MUS$)                 National Budget          World Bank Support              Total Budget
           1997                         195.3                      10.6                        205.9
           1998                         307.5                       5.3                        312.8
           1999                         280.7                      35.7                        316.4
           2000                         281.3                      39.9                        321.2
           2001                         291.2                      14.3                        305.5
           2002                         188.4                       8.5                        196.9
           2003                         282.7                      36.2                        318.9
           2004                         282.6                      165.7                       448.3


6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

The proposed program is expected to be well balanced between maintenance/rehabilitation, strengthening
and reconstruction of existing roads together with new construction of motorways and expressways. Its
financing is contemplated from both domestic and foreign sources as shown in the Table in Section 6.1.
The Government, as well as the transport and infrastructure committee of the Sejm (Polish Parliament) are



                                                     - 11 -

determined to move forward with the road program as soon as possible based on the existing laws on public
roads, financing of public roads and the Toll Motorways Act.

From this program it is apparent that road maintenance will be the highest priority in GDDKiA and this is
reflected in increased budgetary allocations for this purpose, partly financed by loans from the Bank and
EIB.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

Satisfactory. The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project was
satisfactory. The project was part of the first phase of the Government's two-pronged
highway-improvement strategy to foster a national institutional and managerial improvement of the road
sector. It also aimed to continue and complement the ongoing institutional and physical improvements
under the Bank's First Transport and Roads I Projects, and the planned partial rehabilitation of the main
road network.

The Bank took into account the adequacy of project design and all major relevant aspects, such as
technical, financial, economic, and institutional, including procurement and financial management. In
addition, the Bank assessed the project's risks and benefits. The Bank had a consistently good working
relationship with the Borrower during preparation and appraisal.

7.2 Supervision:

Satisfactory. A Quality of Supervision Assessment was carried out by a QAG panel of reviewers for the
project. The panel rated the supervision of the project as satisfactory overall and for all categories except
for realism of the project rating which was found moderately satisfactory (because of weaknesses in key
performance indicators). The ICR also considers the Bank's performance during the implementation of the
project as satisfactory.

QAG noted that:

    "The supervision team gave appropriate and timely advice and recommendations to the Borrower
    who implemented them. The overall rating for financial management was satisfactory. The audit
    reports for the projects were received and reviewed by the task team. Besides the statutory audit as
    required by the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), the National Audit Office of Poland
    conducted a separate review of the project as part of the review of the execution of the state budget.
    Most of the findings of this audit were of a compliance nature. This audit provided additional
    fiduciary comfort to the task team. The financial management issues of the project were captured by
    the regular supervision missions and implementation of actions were monitored by the task team. All
    of the 20 covenants were complied with by the borrower, without any issues."

Sufficient budget and staff resources were allocated, and the project was adequately supervised and closely
monitored. Over the seven years of project implementation, there were 13 supervision missions, with an average of
about two missions per year. The Bank's client relationship was very cordial and productive. Review teams
included specialists in road safety, social development, environment, economics, project management,
financial management, and procurement. External consultants were used for specific aspects of project
components.

The Project Status Reports (PSRs) realistically rated the performance of the project both in terms of
achievement of development objectives and project implementation. Aide-Memoires were regularly
prepared and the task team discussed with the Government and the implementing agencies problems with
project execution, and gave appropriate advice for resolving them. The Bank paid sufficient attention to the
project's likely development impact. Loan covenants and remedies were enforced effectively.

In order to measure the performance of the project, the Bank used outcome indicators such as reduced
traffic accidents rate, on-the-spot fatality rate, and improvement in the competitive capacity of domestic
contractors and consultants; and output indicators such as number of contracts executed, number of kms of
roads rehabilitated/modernized, number of kms of flood-damaged roads reconstructed, and the number of
jobs created by the project during implementation.

The Bank's field office in Warsaw worked closely with the Government and the implementing agencies,
and provided them with extensive assistance including technical advice. Many of the procurement and
financial management activities were performed by the field office. Frequent technical inspections were
carried out using field office staff, who also engaged the road administration in a continuous policy
dialogue. The excellent integration of headquarters and field staff in the supervision effort earned the
project an award from the Europe & Central Asia Operations Policies and Country Services (OPCS) Unit
of the Bank.

In order to keep a more dynamic relationship with the borrower, the Country Unit instituted a practice of
regular meetings between the Country Director and the Deputy Minister of Finance to review, inter alia,
any unresolved portfolio issues. An Environment Specialist from the Bank's Warsaw office closely
monitored the implementation of environmental safeguard provisions and helped ensure that GDDKiA
maintained compliance with Bank safeguards and Polish environmental laws.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:

Satisfactory. Overall, the Bank performance was satisfactory during project preparation, appraisal and
implementation.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

Satisfactory. The Borrower's performance in the preparation of the project was satisfactory. The Borrower
was committed to the objectives of the project and considered design in terms of technical, financial,
economic, institutional, environmental and sociological factors. The Government officials and staff of the
implementing agencies worked in close coordination with the Bank's project team. QAG noted that "the
Borrower was strongly committed to the project, not only for physical implementation, but also for other
aspects such as road safety. Furthermore, the Borrower implemented the Bank recommendation to recruit a
high level and experienced road safety specialist".

7.5 Government implementation performance:

Satisfactory. The Government implementation performance was satisfactory. It consistently maintained its
commitment throughout project implementation. MOI, which was responsible for the overall
implementation of the project, consisted of senior policy makers and experienced managers. They took
great interest in the Bank's recommendations and took corrective action when needed. Appropriate levels of

review and approval were usually in place; financial accountability and follow-up was observed, and
documentation was maintained properly for periodic review. The project did not suffer from any
counterpart funding problems, as the Government took timely corrective measures and made appropriate
budget provisions. According to QAG, the Borrower's strong commitment to the project contributed to the
Bank's supervision efficiency.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

Satisfactory. Performance of PMU was satisfactory. The PMU which was established under the MOI (now
MOTC) managed well the overall coordination functions, and the flow of funds. It was well organized and
effective in dealing with disbursement, auditing, financial management, progress reports, and in
maintaining proper records of the project. It was receptive to the Bank's advice, and collaborated with the
Bank to meet benchmarks and deadlines.

The performance of the PIU, the project implementation unit of GDDKiA was also satisfactory. The PIU
was responsible for the procurement of civil works. The Road Safety Secretariat, which was in charge of
the Road Safety Program, needed help from the Bank in the initial stages but subsequently developed
adequate capacity for implementation, with the recruitment of an international specialist and two local
specialists.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

Satisfactory. The overall performance of the Borrower was satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

Bank-Related

·   While preparing a project, it is important to make its objective very clear and consistent with
Government policy in order to secure a strong commitment for each component. In addition, full ownership
of the project by the Government is also a major factor for a project's success.

·   Day-to-day attention and prompt response from the Bank are important so that the Bank can expect the
same type of response from the Borrower. Likewise, good quality and high frequency of supervision are
important for successful implementation. Having local staff to follow-up on implementation issues will be
very useful on this matter.

·   Investment projects provide a good opportunity for policy dialogues and for helping the Borrower to
improve their performance. When the Bank is functioning as an investor, it is good to initiate policy
dialogues on reforms.

·   The Bank should be more flexible in implementation matters, depending on the country situation. For
example, this project demonstrated that by giving more freedom, the Borrower was able to adopt new
approaches on procurement and become more efficient.

·   It will be useful to have a single organizational structure to take care of international financial
institutions involved in road projects in Poland. Such an organizational structure could focus on:
prioritization of investments; efficient administration and management of road programs; clear and
sustainable system of financing the construction and maintenance of roads.

·   Because of the constraints and limitations encountered during the implementation of this investment
project, the Government agreed with the Bank to use a sector-wide approach for the Road Maintenance and
Rehabilitation (RMR) Project approved in 2004, a repeater project approved in 2005, and the third and last
RMR Project which is expected to be approved in 2006, so that there will be more flexibility in using the
funds and also in implementation. This was made possible as a result of a strengthened partnership.

·   With the experience gained from the implementation of the Bank's procurement procedures, it has
become easier for the staff of the GDDKiA to follow the procurement rules of EIB and other multilateral
organizations.

A positive impact of the project was the creation of jobs. It is estimated that the civil works component
generated 117,000 man/months of work. This figure was comprised of design consultants, operatives and
supervision staff employed directly on site. In addition, indirect employment was generated in the
administration, materials, production and transport sectors.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits

Costs and benefits were measured net of taxes. Current levels were estimated based on counts carried out
by GDDKiA. Cost savings per km on road rehabilitation/modernization contracts averaged US$0.04 per
km/vehicle/day. With regard to rehabilitation contracts which did not involve any element of modernization,
the benefits only related to savings in operating costs.

The table below provides a summary of Economic Cost and Benefit analysis carried out on the project
aiming to improve the main national road network during the period 2003/2005. The overall IRR is 34%
well above the minimum 12% identified in the SAR.

Annex 8. Borrower's Contribution to ICR

1. Context

Roads II Project was a continuation of the World Bank support for the Polish roads sector, first initiated in
1993 with approval of a 150 M USD loan for the First Roads Project. Therefore, the Roads II Project
aimed at financial contribution to the Ministry's ongoing program to modernize Poland's national road
network, including also support to repair damage to roads and bridges from devastating floods of July
1997.

Poland's rapidly expanding economy in the transition period resulted in a sharp expansion of road
transport, including rapid growth in the use of heavy trucks. This has led not only to serious problem of
congestion and road safety, but has also accelerated deterioration of the road network, which was never
designed for the current number of vehicles and much heavier average axle loads.

The Project aimed at continuing the modernization of the road sector through the repair and upgrading of
priority road sections and bridges and the construction of new bridges and bypasses. The Project was
expected to address road safety concerns, help strengthen the Polish road construction and maintenance
industry, and improve the level of periodic road maintenance.

More specifically, the Project was to support and accelerate transformation of the Polish transport sector
by:
·   improving the national road network through expanding the level of periodic road maintenance;
·   reconstruction and repairing flood-damaged high priority roads and bridges;
·   improving road safety conditions through funding for road safety equipment, reduction of roads
    hazards, and training for national traffic police;
·   strengthening the technical, managerial, and financial skills of domestic engineering and contractors
    and helping them to bid competitively; and
·   minimizing road transport cost by adjusting road user charges to match different vehicle types.

The total Project cost amounted to 540 M USD. The Bank's loan of 300 M USD equivalent financed 56
percent of the total Project cost. 76 M USD of total project cost was specifically earmarked to help the
Government reverse the damage caused by floods. The Government of Poland was to contribute 240 M
USD in financing.

The Bank's 300 M USD equivalent loan consisted of two single currency loan tranches of 150 M USD and
270 M DEM, respectively.
The loan is to be repayable in 15 years, including a five-year grace period, at the Bank's LIBOR - based
floating interest rate.

2. Project Goals and Objectives

The Project covered the following three main areas of policy, as well as institutional and physical
investments.

Physical Infrastructure (total cost of component - 510 M USD):
·   Repair, upgrade, realign and resurface priority road sections and their crossings through cities;
·   Reconstruct and upgrade 2 bridges, an construct 3 major bridges;



                                                     - 28 -

·   Construct 12 bypasses around congested cities;
·   Undertake emergency reconstruction of flood-damaged high priority infrastructure;
·   Facilitate the acquisition of road maintenance equipment, vehicles, and materials, and road safety
    equipment;
·   Provide technical and training for the ongoing road safety program; and
·   Increase maintenance, especially the frequency of winter maintenance, and strengthen high priority
    roads, including bridges.

Policy Improvements (total cost of component - 20 M USD):
·   Review and adjust road user charges and distribution between different user groups to reconcile cost
    and revenues;
·   Further improve the axle-load policy to coincide with that in Western Europe; and
·   Establish a leasing policy to enhance and speed up the privatization of local road contracting
    enterprises.

Institutional improvements (total cost of component - 10 M USD):
·   Promote further restructuring and development of the Polish road contracting industry, focusing on the
    improvement of its managerial, financial and          technical capacity, and on the establishment of
    professional associations to enhance their competitiveness;
·   Improve the coordination and operation of agencies involved in transport and in implementing of the
    ongoing road safety program; and
·   Assist the vehicle inspection centers network as a part of road safety and environmental measures.

4. Changes in the Project

In the end of 2004 there were made some amendments to the Loan Agreement. A new component was
added to Part C of the Project (as a result of savings - 2,8 M USD), i.e. the reform of the Borrower's
railway sector. This component is divided into the following subcomponents:

·   Privatization advisers for PKP Cargo S.A. (1.5 M USD);
·   Privatization advisers for PKP Intercity Ltd.(1 M USD);
·   Technical assistance for Koleje Mazowieckie-Mazovian Regional Railways Ltd. (150 000 USD); and
·   Technical support services for PKP PLK S.A - Polish Railway Lines (150 000 USD).

The closing date of the loan was also amended. The date "December 31, 2002" was firstly extended to the
date "June 30, 2006". Due to the substantive amendments of the loan (new railway component) the closing
date was extended again to the end of 2006 (31 December 2006).

5. Lessons Learned

The lessons learned from the implementation of the Project can be grouped into project- related and general
lessons confirmed by the Project. They are interconnected and often a project-related lesson leads to a
deeper problem or complexity. The most relevant specific lessons coming out of the implementation of the
Project, learnt by the Project Monitoring Unit (PMU) at the ministerial level are as follows:

a) The PMU faced a lot of difficulties with financial management of the loan based on two different
    currencies. This caused some perturbation connected with exchange rate and the management found it
    disadvantageous. The next loan of this kind, namely Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation (still active)
    is based on one currency only.

b) There had been many obstacles with supervising the Project's components due to significant differences
    between them. As a consequence, there were many various final beneficiaries of these components. It
    was particularly hard to finalize contracts with voivodships (regional authorities).

c) In 1998 administrational reform was introduced (reactivation of local and regional authorities), what
    contributed to considerable delays in the process of concluding the contracts. On average many
    contracts were finalized 12-18 months later than originally estimated when signing the loan.

d) The Project was of open nature - the tasks were not identified in the loan agreement. It was considered
    very advantageous as it allowed the Borrower to define the scope of tasks with great flexibility. As a
    consequence, next loans are based on SWAP concept, enabling the Borrower to define the projects with
    much sovereignty.

e) Another aspect worth mentioning here are savings within the amount granted for the Borrower. On one
    hand, these savings resulted from some delays and disturbances in the planning process and application
    of ICB procedures. On the other hand, the savings enabled the Borrower to allocate the remaining
    amount for other additional projects.

f) A special attention should be paid to a good cooperation with the World Bank team - particularly with
    Mr Luis Revuelta and Ms Elena Kastlerova - founding parents of the Project.

In conclusion, we are very glad that the Project enjoyed high support from all parties involved
throughout the implementation period. The Project served as a good preparation before next loans,
that can be defined as a second generation road projects co-financed with the World Bank funds.

Roads II Project was the last project that did not go through the state budget, but was disbursed directly
from the special account in the Central Bank of Poland to the beneficiaries' bank accounts.

The final beneficiaries of the loan funds were as follows:

·   General Directorate for National Roads and Motorways
·   National Council for Road Safety
·   National Police - the Logistics Office

Below, there are beneficiaries' contributions to ICR, presenting separately and in detail, objectives achieved
and lessons learnt during implementation period of the Project.

1. Project Objectives

1.1 Original Objectives and Changes during Implementation

As stated in the SAR of 7th October 1997 the overall objective of the project was to provide support and
foster a national institutional and managerial improvement of the road sector and to continue and
complement the ongoing institutional and physical improvements under the Bank's First Roads project.
Furthermore the project also included an emergency road and bridge reconstruction subcomponent which
involved the repair of high priority roads and bridges damaged by the floods of 1997. In specific terms the
project was to support the following:

·   Improvement of the national road network;
·   Reconstruct and repair high priority flood-damaged roads and bridges;
·   Improvement of the road traffic safety situation;
·   Promote the competitive capacity of domestic contractors through improvement of their technical,
    managerial, and financial capacity; and
·   Development of modern management tools in GDDKiA.

A total of 42 civil work schemes under the main component and 61 civil work schemes under the
emergency relief component were identified originally in the SAR for execution under the project and as the
project progressed this figure was revised and reassessed and a total of 70 civil works contracts and 95
emergency relief civil works contracts received funding from the project. The selection was to be based on
economic criteria , requiring a minimum ERR of 12 % and provided also that other criteria regarding
environmental protection and safety were met.

Key sections of national highway were to be earmarked for strengthening and improvement, and in certain
cases for by-passing of congested urban areas. Elimination of accident black-spots, difficult passages
through towns, safety barriers and reflectorised road markings and crash barriers were also to be included.
As a result of the serious backlog in Poland of major bridge repairs the program was also to include the
repair and reconstruction of high priority bridges, and in some cases, the construction of new permanent
structures to replace existing. The GDDKiA component also included the provision of winter maintenance
equipment to boost the financing arrangements of the maintenance budget.

To assist GDDKiA with its ability to manage and plan its activities a Technical Assistance and Training
component was envisaged, which included the appointment of an international firm of consulting engineer's
and the preparation and implementation of a training programme. Overseas study tours and visits were also
to be included for selected staff of GDDKiA.

Another important aspect of the project was aimed at the privatisation and commercialisation of the local
Road and Bridge construction sector. Local contracting firms were to be encouraged to undergo
restructuring and to form joint ventures with foreign firms. The loan proceeds and the Government's
contribution to the cost of the project would be an important source of revenue for local contractors and
would help to generate local employment.

2. Achievement of Objectives

2.1 Civil Works

A total of 176 GDDKiA civil works contracts were successfully procured and completed under the project
and are summarised as follows:

·   New bypasses (58.5km)                                                     13 No.
·   Bridges [6no.] (modernisation/new)                                         6 No.
·   Rehabilitation/modernisation of existing sections of road (535km)         51 No.
·   Emergency reconstruction of flood-damaged roads                           68 No.
·   Emergency reconstruction of flood-damaged bridges                         27 No.
·   Black-spot elimination civil works contracts                              11 No.

Important sections of national highway have been improved and made safer and will as a result reduce
traffic congestion, accidents and will improve the burden of inconvenience placed on road users as a result
of the deterioration of the road network in Poland over recent years. Savings that resulted from exchange
rate differences and reduced tender prices as a consequence of the Bank's competitive bidding procedures
enabled the incorporation of additional urgently needed contracts.

Following the floods of 1997 many towns and villages were affected with many roads and bridges either
washed away or severely damaged. The emergency relief component under the Roads II project was to
finance the emergency reconstruction of flood-damaged roads and bridges through the incorporation of
national competitive bidding procedures which was intended to speed up the procurement process. The
SAR envisaged that this component would comprise of 61 contracts of total length of approximately 300
km. Selection was based on criteria of priority and after review the final total number of contracts executed
entailed 95 no. of total length 392 km.

During the course of the project an additional accident black-spot elimination programme was identified
and 11 civil works contracts were procured through National Competitive Bidding aimed at the
improvement of road safety in specific locations. An assessment of the number of accidents that have
occurred since execution of these contracts has shown a marked improvement in road safety and a
reduction in the accident statistics of these locations (refer to Appendix I).

The World Bank Roads II project in conjunction with earlier World Bank loans has played an important
role in the continued modernisation of the road contracting industry in Poland. It has helped in the
transformation of many state owned contracting enterprises into independent private commercial entities
many of which have now merged or are co-operating with larger foreign contracting organisations. The
introduction of competitive bidding and international conditions of contract as those adopted by the World
Bank and FIDIC has achieved greater competition and a consequent fall in tender prices.

Another important effect of the project has been the employment it has generated. It is estimated that the
civil works component has generated 117,000 man/months of work. This figure comprises of design
consultants, operatives and supervision staff employed directly on site, however, it should also be
remembered that further employment has been generated indirectly in the administration, materials,
production and transport sectors.

2.2 Equipment and Materials for Road Safety by GDDKiA

In order to boost the GDDKiA's winter maintenance budget this component included the provision of
winter maintenance equipment aimed at improving the GDDKiA's ability of dealing with adverse weather
conditions during the winter period. Three separate contracts were procured for the supply and installation
of 39 no. salt storage depots located nationwide and one contract for the supply of 30 articulated heavy
snow blowers. All these items are in use and providing relief during winter periods.

In order to improve the overall road safety situation contracts for the supply and installation of reflective
road studs, rumble strips have been procured on a nationwide basis.

2.3 Technical Assistance and Training

The GDDKiA TA and training objectives have been quite extensive. An international firm of consulting
engineers Scott Wilson from UK were hired through ICB to provide consulting services by way of two
permanent resident advisors and visiting specialists as and when required. The two resident advisors
provided advice and training to counterpart staff on all matters of the project pertaining to management,
procurement, and financial issues including also site management and contract management. Visiting
specialists have advised on ways to improve contract and specification documents, the causes of rutting
problems and environmental management of road surface run off.

A training programme was developed by the consultants at the start of the project which identified the
following training needs:

·   Procurement of Works, Site supervision, documentation and procedures - for less experienced
    GDDKiA and consultants engineers;
·   The FIDIC Conditions of Contract - for consultants and GDDKiA engineering staff participating in the
    implementation of the larger contracts using the FIDIC International Conditions;
·   Roles and responsibilities of Project Managers - for GDDKiA Project Managers, training included
    prequalification and bid evaluation issues;
·   Resident engineers role and responsibilities, problem solving - for consultants resident engineers and
    assistants;
·   Financial management of projects - mainly aimed at finance officers within GDDKiA;
·   Training in maintenance management - for maintenance engineers from GDDKiA - comprising study
    tours to the UK focusing on current UK maintenance management practice, winter maintenance, new
    methods and materials;
·   Training in project financial management of internationally funded projects for finance management
    staff comprising study tours to the UK;
·   Training of local consultants undertaking Environmental Impact Assessments in accordance with
    World Bank procedures;

·   produce a pilot 6-year rolling programme of work and pilot 12-year cash flow for GDDKiA; and




                                                     - 35 -

·   install HDM-4, the Highway Design and Maintenance model, as the analysis tool to ensure value for
    money, taking account of both road and GDDKiA costs, now and in the future.

The study achieved the following:
·   identification of the ultimate road network;
·   the right timing of works;
·   the right standard of works (e.g. whether to build a full expressway at once or in stages); and
·   the balance between (i) spending money on maintaining what exists; and (ii) adding new roads or
    improving existing roads.

3. Problems and Lessons Learned

3.1 Civil Works

The emergency road and bridge repairs of the Flood Emergency component were of an urgent nature and in
order to procure the work at the earliest it was agreed during loan negotiations to introduce World Bank
National Competitive Bidding procedures. In the early stages of the project the procurement of these works
was unnecessarily delayed despite the incorporation of national competitive bidding and the introduction of
post qualification in lieu of pre-qualification. All bid evaluations for this component were carried out at
regional level by staff less familiar and experienced in World Bank bidding procedures and as a result
implementation delays occurred. With time, however, and after the introduction of training courses and
seminars these problems were overcome and the World Bank NCB procedures were seen as a helpful
method for procurement and were incorporated into other non World Bank funded projects.

Errors and omissions contained in Bidding Documents have on a number of occasions given rise to claims
for additional costs. Greater care should therefore be given in preparing Bidding documents and design
consultants should be made to account for their mistakes.

The introduction of more realistic contract duration's will help to discipline the mobilisation of
Contractor's and reduce situations where advance payments are cashed and no progress on site is noted.
This problem has occurred on a number of contracts and has caused traffic delays and inconvenience to the
road user. GDDKiA has taken note of these problems and more realistic contract durations are now being
incorporated together with staged or phased contract completion which should reduce the cost of
contracting and the indirect cost to the road user.

Cash flow forecasting has often resulted in an overestimation of funding requirements. GDDKiA
management is aware of this and is implementing measures which should reduce such problems on future
projects.

The procurement of local supervision Contracts is being carried out in accordance with local public work
procurement regulations. Problems in the selection process have been noted at times and a standardisation
of these Bidding Documents would reduce the ambiguities in the contract conditions and enable better
transparency in the selection of the most appropriate consultancy firm. For locally procured consultancy
agreements a standard set of Bidding Documents could be prepared on the basis of a simplified form of the
WB selection procedures modified to suit local public work procurement regulations.

At pre-contract stage greater attention should be paid when forming a project strategy and how to slice and
package contracts. Bridge contracts divided into separate contracts for approach roads and bridge


                                                    - 36 -

construction will prove more costly to the Employer in the long run if 2 contractors are deployed. This
causes unnecessary additional overhead costs and a greater risk of potential claims if one contractor delays
the other. The merging of such contracts into one larger one will reduce supervision costs and improve
overall site co-ordination and operations.

A number of protests by local residents on a number of GDDKiA construction sites has forced GDDKiA to
re-assess its policy towards public consultations with regard compulsory land acquisition orders. Better
communication and earlier consultations with local residents will improve the present situation and prevent
contractors work stoppages and compensation claims

3.2 TA and Training

One of the objectives of the project to Upgrade Methods to Prioritise and Program Road Expenditures was
to leave GDDKiA with the skills to update the rolling programme annually and to develop and improve the
analytical system. Due to staff shortages it was not possible to free any GDDKiA staff from their duties to
work with the consultant. In order to gain confidence in the use of HDM-4 a small, competent unit in the
central office of GDDKiA will have to be established.

The GDDKiA continues to have problems with staff migration and many of the staff that achieved
experience and training under the Project have now moved to other companies or sectors. In order to deal
with this problem it will be necessary to implement a continuous rolling training programme comprising of
seminars and courses for GDDKiA staff of all levels. The training would cover project and contract
management and administration and should include refresher courses aimed at continual professional
development.

4. Conclusion

The GDDKiA is very appreciative of the help, work and advice given to them by the Bank's staff
during the implementation of the Project. The contribution and work of the supervision missions,
have contributed greatly to the final success and achievements of the Project.

In accordance with the terms of the loan agreement budgetary expenditures for national road maintenance
have been satisfied and have seen steady annual increases. The funding for national investment in roads is
now firmly in place and should continue to increase over the coming years in order that the required
improvements to the road network may be met.

              EXECUTING AGENCY ­ NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR ROAD SAFETY

1. Context

The World Bank, as a part of his strategy to reduce poverty, as been active in the field of Road Safety, in
the case of Poland the Bank financed an in depth analysis of the road safety situation in the east of Europe,
that shows that Poland loses are about U$$ 3 billion per year in the field. This information prompts the
bank to include a road safely component in ROADS II loan, oriented to support institutional development
and an initial action plan.




                                                   - 37 -

2. Project Objectives

The general objectives of the component, identified in the staff Appraisal report of the loan, are to support
and speed-up the implementation of the National Strategy (GAMBIT), to improve the road safety situation,
by reducing the number of victims and to strengthen the capacity of the Road Safety Secretariat.

3. Project Components

a) Technical Assistance and Training
Road Safety Coordinator and Local Experts. In order to enhance the institutional ability of the Secretariat
of NRSC to lead and coordinate the work on road safety, a International road safety coordinator and four
local experts have been employed to enable a more effective implementation of road safety policy and
programs based on cost-effective investments. The International Road Safety Specialist has been
responsible of suggesting an action plan, based in a modification of the plan considered initially in the loan,
adding some high rate of return items (like regional programs) and the removal of low or uncertain rate of
return items (like heavy duty motorbikes or speed display signs).

b) Action Plan
Regional Road Safety Programs. The project co-finance with the regions small investment schemes in
eight regions to correct dangerous black spots.

Analysis of Selected Aspects of Road User Behavior. The project established a regular, consistent and
well-coordinated process of acquiring country-wide information about key components of road safety
prevention: traffic speed and the use of seat belts. Reports are available on www.krbrd.gov.pl .

Training Program in Road Safety. The project developed comprehensive training materials covering the
whole road safety system which would help to establish a regular training process of road safety personnel
of the regional road safety councils, improve their professional skills, and enable them to take more
effective leadership in road safety work.

Training in Traffic Engineering for the Police. It will empower police officer to recognize unsafe or
ambiguous features in the road and adjacent public space, permitting better interaction with roads
authorities.

Road Safety Survey and Campaign. This activity had two objectives. The first was to conduct an
investigation about public perception of road safety in the country, and the second was to develop and
implement a countrywide campaign encouraging the use of seatbelts on the basis of the survey results and
data on seatbelt use obtained from the analysis of selected aspects of road user behavior.

Supply and Installation of Cats Eyes. The project, implemented by GDDKiA, permit to introduce positive
guidance to drivers in foul weather.

Rumble Strips on Selected Road Sections. Oriented to lay a hot-melt plastic border line to warn drivers
that they are going off the road, over 500 km will be installed. This will be an effective tool, specially
considering that a third of those killed in rural roads are killed in single vehicle accident. It is implemented
by GDDKiA.




                                                     - 38 -

Crash Cushions. Oriented to install deformable barriers before rigid and non removable obstacles, It is
implemented by GDDKiA.

Mobile Speed Cameras for Police. The procurement of automatic speed detection equipment with
photographic cameras to reduce the extend of over-speeding.

Purchase of Technical Software Supporting Tools. A package of software for road design and traffic
engineering was purchased from the Technical University in Gdansk to facilitate and raise the quality of
education of road designers and traffic engineers.

Seminars, Study Tours, International Cooperation. The staff of NRSC Secretariat participated in study
tours abroad and international seminars and took an active part in international cooperation, which enabled
the acquisition and use of expertise and best practices from other countries.

4. Project Implementation

The project was implemented by the NRSC Secretariat and partners, for example GDDKiA call for bidding
of projects localized in national Roads, while the regional Road Authority implemented blacks spot
projects. Also the police develop the procurement of speed cameras. Finally, the studies was procured by
the secretariat.

5. Achievement of Objectives

a) Strengthen the Capacity of the Road Safety Secretariat. The loan has permitted to increase the
    manpower of the secretariat with new skills, form an initial situation of a Director with a secretary to a
    full developed staff of 11 persons, including Engineers, journalists, enforcement officers, etc.

b) Support and Speed-up the Implementation of the National Strategy (GAMBIT). The resources
    obtained from the loan permitted to finance a number of GAMBIT activities like Black Spot
    countermeasures or Speed equipment, increasing the credibility of the national Strategy, especially at
    the Regions, and with the Council.

c) Reducing the Number of Victims. The number of victims has been reduced in the period (1997-2004), the
    fatalities have been reduced from 7310 to 5712, a 22% reduction while injured persons was reduced from
    83169 to 64661, also a 22% reduction.

6. Project Results

a) Quantifiable. Has been a 22% reduction of fatalities and victims in the period, considering that road safety
    has losses of U$3 billion for Poland; this implies that the project benefits are in the order of U$$ 600 million.

b) General. The project has permitted to develop useful working relationships with the regions, and the NRSC
    has adopted a methodology of working based in accident data, this increase the credibility of the unit at the EU
    level and has permitted to secure an EIB loan of EURO 50 million.

7. Conclusions

The successful implementation of the Loan has permitted to raise the status of the national Road Safety
Council, both in Poland and Abroad, permitting to develop a self-sustaining organization that can secure new
sources of financing and can provide country leadership in the area.

               EQUIPMENT FOR THE ROAD TRAFFIC SERVICES OF THE POLICE
                               EXECUTING AGENCY ­ NATIONAL POLICE

Introduction

The aim of the present document is to present the required information on tasks carried out by the Police
under the II. Road Project. The presented material constitutes a justification ­ from the Borrower's point of
view ­ of the need to purchase the equipment for the Road Traffic Services of the Police.

The present document has been drawn up upon a request of the World Bank.

1. Context

Since the beginning of the 1990's, the number of motor vehicles in Poland gradually increases. In
2003/2004 Polish roads have been used by 15,899,195 vehicles. Comparing to 1990, the number of motor
vehicles in Poland increased by 75,8%. The location of our country at the east-west transit route also
causes a substantial transit traffic. According to the data obtained from the Headquarters of the Border
Guard, in 2003 exactly 15,228,629 vehicles driven by foreigners entered the territory of Poland, which
constitutes an increase by 2,4% comparing to 2002. Poland has been visited by 52,129,778 foreigners.

The following table presents data on the number of road accidents, casualties and collisions in 2002-2004:

                                           2002                         2003                      2004
 Road Accidents                           53,559                      51,078                     51,069
 Injuries                                 67,789                      63,900                     64,661
 Deaths                                   5,872                        5,640                      5,712
 Collisions                              358,807                      367,700                   424,938


In the last decade, the largest number of road accidents has been noted in 1997. The same year also
witnessed the largest increase of injuries caused by road accidents. In the years 2002-2004 a decrease in the
number of road accidents and casualties has been registered.

2. Project Objectives

As a result of statistical analysis of road accidents conducted for the GAMBIT programme, it has been established
that the largest decrease of road dangers may be obtained by concentrating actions around the following issues:
·    speeding;
·    young drivers;
·    unprotected road users;
·    inebriated road users;
·    severity of accidents
·    road routes through small villages; and
·    places of increased frequency of road accidents.

Police has direct influence over three of these issues, namely: speeding, safety of unprotected road users and
inebriation of drivers.

3. Project Components

Under the Road II Project from the funds obtained from the World Bank loan the following equipment has
been purchased:

a) "Zapora" set, consisting of red-and-white tape for fencing, yellow flashing lights and a set of road
    signs.

b) LION Equipment for the measurement of breath alcohol level

c) Halogen flashlights with special holders for car-usage, which are also battery re-chargers, as well as
    with a red adapter used for stopping cars from dusk to dawn and in the conditions of poor visibility.

4. Light and heavy motorcycles (250 vehicles) with following equipment:
·   2 sets of leather motorcycle uniforms, including shoes;
·   2 protective helmets; and
·   2 sets of helmet communication systems.

Even though the equipment has been purchased separately, their usefulness in the Police work must be
regarded as a whole. Uniforms, helmets and communication systems, without the motorcycles would be
useless in Police work. The aim of obtaining the set was to ensure the safety of the motorcycle drives and
enabling him to work in unfavourable weather conditions in the summer.

Photo radars "Fotorapid" - 39 sets, which have been distributes to Voivodship headquarters of the Police.
The sets include three poles with casings for stationary measurements.

4. Project Implementation

a) The "Zapora" set is used for the separation, fencing and marking of road occurrences, as well as for
    introducing temporary traffic modifications in the close vicinity of road occurrence location. The
    equipment is also used for marking the location of police road blockades. The Road Traffic Police
    currently uses 1600 such sets, which means that all police cars may be equipped with such sets. Police
    Officers are obliged to use the equipment for separating and marking the locations of road occurrences.


b) The purchased equipment are used as a breath alcohol level indicators, the result of which must be
    verified by approved and certified type of equipment. This is caused by administrative decisions
    independent from the actions of the Police. Revealing a maximum number of inebriated participants
    and eliminating them from road traffic constitutes the area of particularly intensive police actions.
    Since inebriated drivers cause 67.8% of accidents involving inebriated road traffic participants, they
    constitute the main object of police activity. In order to reveal and eliminate inebriated drivers from
    road traffic, independently of breath alcohol level measurements carried out during "routine" vehicle
    checks, special actions are organised. Such actions, consisting of mass controls of the soberness of
    drivers are conducted by all Voivodship Police Headquarters. Revealing drivers "having consumed
    alcohol" should not be perceived as Police victimizing the citizens, but as action lying in the best
    interest of the society ­ eliminating potential perpetrators of most tragic occurrences.




                                                     - 41 -

c) Purchasing halogen flashlights from the funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
   Development constituted the first purchase of that equipment on such a large scale. Previous purchases
   have been done in small amounts, which had no real effect on the everyday Police work. These
   flashlights give very strong light and have large range, which facilitates the work of the Police and
   ensures greater safety of the Officers. The flashlights are also used by Police officers serving abroad.

d) Purchasing new motorcycles facilitated the work of road traffic police officers. These vehicles, thanks
   to their size and maneuverability may be used in areas of intensive road traffic. Police car in such cases
   may not be able to access or patrol the required area. It is the case not only in large urban areas, but
   also in holiday resorts and on access routes during the summer weekends. Motorcycle patrols in such
   times and places may successfully supervise the traffic and undertake all necessary actions.

e) In September 2003, 60 additional poles with casings have been purchased and distributed among the
   Police units. Currently, the Police uses two types of photo radars in their work: analogue devices
   registering offences on film, and digital devices Fotorapid. According to the information obtained in
   October 2004, the Police owns and uses 58 photo radars. Municipal and Communal Guards use
   additional 14 such photo radars. Pursuant to Article 17 of the Ordinance of the Minister of Internal
   Affairs and Administration of 30. December 2003 on the road traffic control (Journal of Laws No. 14,
   item 144, as amended), Municipal (Communal) guards are authorised to use devices automatically
   registering vehicles exceeding speed limits and failure to comply with traffic lights.

5. Project Results

a) Use of "Zapora" sets enables not only a safer work of police officers on the road but also improves
   safety of persons involved in the occurrences. Despite very useful character of this equipment for work
   of road traffic services and its impact on work safety , the results related to use of this equipment are
   not measurable and it is impossible to evaluate its influence on the reduction of number of accidents
   and casualties thereof in concrete numbers.

b) Due to detection and elimination of intoxicated road users from road traffic, a gradual decrease of
   accidents with the participation thereof occurs, e.g. in comparison to 2001, in 2004 it was stated that
   an increase occurred in number of drivers under the influence of alcohol (after having consumed
   alcohol or intoxicated) by 28, 108 persons which corresponds to 16%.

c) Despite great usefulness of halogen flashlights in work of road traffic services and the influence thereof
   on the work safety, the results related to use of this equipment are not measurable and it is impossible
   to evaluate its influence on the reduction of number of accidents and casualties thereof in concrete
   numbers.

d) Despite great usefulness of motorcycles in work of road traffic police officers and influence thereof on
   the work safety, the results related to use of this equipment are not measurable and it is impossible to
   evaluate its influence on the reduction of number of accidents and casualties thereof in concrete
   numbers.

e) Analysis of functioning of photo radars shows their direct influence on improvement of the state of
   road traffic safety through repressive and preventive actions taken towards drivers. In the photo radar
   zones a significant improvement of road traffic safety has been observed, which corresponds to the
   general decrease of number of road occurrences on the controlled sections of the roads. This equipment



                                                   - 42 -

    facilitates operations leading to limitation of offences such as exceeding the speed limit, and frequent
    measurements in the set area caused evident improvement in road traffic safety on these sections of the
    roads. Conducting persuasive and repressive activity helps to establish an opinion among drivers on
    unavoidable character of punishment for offences recorded by the radar.

Photo radars, apart from their basic function of automatic recording of road traffic offences, play important
preventive role among road traffic participants and they influence the increase of feeling of safety on the
roads in the members of the society. Moreover, the fact of placing information board or a mast or exposing
the information on location of photo radars in public media have disciplinary effect on drivers.

The police officers using this equipment found photo radars as very useful in Police work and appraised
highly its efficiency in reducing the number of detected road offences, which resulted in the decrease of the
number of deaths and injuries. Further more, photo radars may function in unfavorable weather conditions
and in places where the use of a manual radar speedometer is impossible due to road infrastructure.

In every voivodeship photo radars take about 1,300 pictures monthly, from which about 1,030, i.e.
79.20%, has the quality enabling to conduct offence proceedings.

6. Conclusions

Phenomena such as excessive speed or intoxication of drivers exist in Poland as well as in other European
countries. The Police of these countries, similarly to Polish police treat them as a priority.

Road accidents are great humanitarian, social and economic problem in Poland and they cause great
damage to human and economic potential of the country. Moreover, loss of human life leads to economic
burden for society related to necessity to provide medical assistance, funeral costs, vehicle repair costs,
administrative costs and costs due to decrease of production. Road accidents take substantial part of
national financial means estimated at $4 billion (above 2.1% of NGP).

The implementation of the II Road Project of the World Bank in the scope of providing adequate equipment
for the Police will enable to improve this situation.

The graphic below shows the good fit between the projection done under GAMBIT 2000 and the actual
results observed on the ground. The efforts deployed by the NRSC during the period have resulted in a
downward trend, although individual car ownership has increased dramatically during the period, i.e., from
8.5 million in 1997 to about 12 million in 2004.
