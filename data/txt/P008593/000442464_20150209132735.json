The World Bank has responded\n            to this development challenge with multiple roads projects,\n            including a United States (U.S.) 29 million dollars\n            investment in road safety programs in 1997-2006 under the\n            roads second project and the road maintenance and\n            rehabilitation project. About 600 people from Poland's\n            16 regions went through a five-day course developed under a\n            World Bank contract. The World Bank provided crucial\n            consultancy that helped things happen on the ground outside\n            the usual administrative channels, to make a difference and\n            save people's lives."}, "docdt": "2006-08-28T00:00:00Z"}
