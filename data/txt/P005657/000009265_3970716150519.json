would support STEG's\n            three-year investment program for:  (i) rural\n            electrification; (ii) rehabilitation of the urban network;\n            and (iii) provision of equipment, vehicles, tools and\n            training.  The rural electrification component would extend\n            electricity service to about 35,000 new domestic customers,\n            1500 pumping stations, and 50 commercial and small\n            industrial consumers.  The urban rehabilitation component\n            would improve the quality of service to more than 130,000\n            existing customers by rehabilitating the distribution\n            systems of about 60 cities and towns.  The third component\n            would provide the construction, erection, and testing\n            equipment, vehicles, tools, and training which would assist\n            STEG in implementing the project and improving its technical\n            capabilities.  The project involves the supply,\n            construction, and erection of about 2500 km of\n            medium-voltage lines, 2600 km of low-voltage lines, and 65\n            MVA of distribution transformer capacity."}, "docdt": "1984-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
