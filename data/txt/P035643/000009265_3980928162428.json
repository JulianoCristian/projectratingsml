  Project will support the implementation of the second half\n            of the Government's Education Sector Policy Framework,\n            1998-2005. First, the basic education expansion program will\n            a) better use existing facilities by expanding double-shift\n            and multi-grade teaching; b) construct and rehabilitate\n            classrooms; c) provide trained teachers; d) increase\n            enrollment in the poor areas; and e) improve services for\n            the disabled. Second, the girls' education program will\n            lower the cost of girls' education; enforce sexual\n            harassment policies at schools; provide counseling; and\n            mobilize communities to resolve girls' education\n            problems. Third, improving the quality and relevance of\n            basic education will redesign the curriculum and remove\n            gender bias in instructional materials. Fourth, early\n            childhood development and care (EDCD) will develop an EDCD\n            strategy; increase training for ECDC givers; and get support\n            from NGOs. Fifth, secondary school development program will\n            construct new secondary schools; train teachers; and\n            introduce computer education programs in schools. Sixth,\n            vocational and technical education will set up a labor\n            market information system. Seventh, university education\n            will upgrade existing post-secondary institutions'\n            programs to degree level. Eighth, the adult education\n            program will finance the nongovernmental organizations to\n            implement the program. Ninth, sector management improvement\n            will identify capacity building needs."}, "docdt": "1998-08-07T00:00:00Z"}
