           India, offering even a few years of education to all boys\n            and girls is a daunting prospect, but one that the\n            government is confronting with the aid of the international\n            community. Initiated in the early 1990s, the district\n            primary education program (DPEP) was designed to facilitate\n            India's efforts to achieve universal primary education\n            and it has since become the world's largest education\n            program, reaching 60 million children. The project also aims\n            to reduce the number of school dropouts and improve the\n            overall quality of primary education Enrollment in general\n            has increased, and in a three-year period enrollment of\n            girls increased to 43 percent from 38 percent."}, "docdt": "2002-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
