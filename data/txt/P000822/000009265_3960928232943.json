of the\n            role of women. Project objectives are fourfold : 1) improve\n            women's productivity and income earning potential; 2)\n            improve women's welfare and status; 3) strengthen\n            government institutions to enable them to better deal with\n            women's issues; and 4) contribute to bringing about a\n            change in society's perception of their role. The\n            project comprises the following six components : a)\n            increasing women's agricultural productivity,\n            disposable income, and nutritional level through the\n            strengthening of agricultural extension services, and\n            cooperatives; b) improve rural women's skills, through\n            promotion of basic literacy and numeracy skills; c)\n            promoting safe motherhood and strengthening family planning\n            services, and expanding the contraceptive distribution\n            system; d) developing an information, education and\n            communication (IEC) strategy and reinforcing ongoing\n            educational campaigns on agriculture, health, family\n            planning and nutrition; e) strengthening the Women's\n            Bureau for policy and program formulation; and f)\n            establishing a fund to be used by NGOs for small projects\n            and programs to help women and children."}, "docdt": "1990-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
