were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low or substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the Chad ESRP original results framework was weak with only\n            one Project Development Objective (PDO) indicator out of\n            seven specific to the project intervention (the other six\n            were meant to measure increases on a national scale) and the\n            intermediate outcome indicators included some measures of\n            activities that were not funded by the Project. Overall,\n            this resulted in the adoption of indicators which were not\n            well-aligned with project components, hindering the Bank and\n            the Government's ability to effectively measure\n            progress of the Project. Improving capacity requires\n            training on a continuous basis and a strong Technical\n            Assistance (TA) sub-component. The ESRP provided sound TA\n            and training to the CNC (Centre National des Curricula -\n            National Curricula Center) technical staff which was\n            supported over an extended period of time. This increased\n            the impact of the training and has had a lasting influence\n            on improved capacity. The challenge being faced now is\n            limiting staff turn-over and renewal of staff contracts to\n            ensure continuity and sustainability. Although design\n            problems were identified earlier and discussed extensively\n            with the Government, it was only two years after the\n            Mid-Term Review (MTR) that restructuring was finalized when\n            74 percent of the funds were already disbursed. Project\n            restructuring might have been undertaken earlier which would\n            have provided a greater opportunity to achieve better outcomes."}, "docdt": "2012-12-03T00:00:00Z"}
