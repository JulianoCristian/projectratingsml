The restructured project will focus on\n            addressing: (i) access and equity related issues; and (ii)\n            the weak capacity to manage the education system. The\n            project's components have been reduced to two and the\n            sub-components are reorganized and regrouped in line with\n            the two new components and their number reduced from 18 to\n            9. Some of the original subcomponents that have marginal\n            effects on the overall education system will be dropped.\n            Finally the project restructuring will align the project\n            activities with the changes in the school construction\n            program that is being implemented under the Government\n            social infrastructure construction program, financed through\n            the oil revenue budget. The results framework is revised to\n            reflect the change in project development objective and the\n            new target values for some indicators, as agreed during the\n            mid-term review. The restructuring also proposes to extend\n            the closing date from December 2010 to June 2012. This is a\n            level one restructuring, which requires a Board approval."}, "docdt": "2010-12-07T00:00:00Z"}
