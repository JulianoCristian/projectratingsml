This goal is in line with the state policy\n            contained in the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction\n            of Poverty which states that all children should be ensured\n            a primary education of universal quality, eliminating\n            disparities in access to education, health, nutrition and\n            non-farm employment and establishing social safety nets\n            needed to improve living conditions of street children, the\n            disabled, women, old persons and other outcasts of society.\n            The negative environmental impacts of the project result\n            from construction of latrines and water points in terms of\n            disruption of living conditions, and production of solid and\n            liquid waste. The exploitation of quarries for extraction of\n            construction materials could also be sources of negative\n            impacts to the environment, which will require restorative\n            actions after use. Environmental impacts such as soil\n            erosion, pollution of soil and water, loss of vegetation,\n            and impacts due to increased waste solids and liquids may\n            come from the activities of construction of latrines and\n            wells and the opening and operation of quarries for building\n            materials. In the preparation phase of construction, the\n            impacts are related to cutting trees to clear the targeted\n            sites and extraction of construction materials and building\n            waste. In short, direct and indirect effects are expected\n            from: the pollution caused by uncontrolled discharge of\n            solid and liquid waste, noise, dust, risk of accidents, soil\n            erosion, and the likely reduction of vegetation cover in the\n            area allowed for construction or operation of quarries."}, "docdt": "2010-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
