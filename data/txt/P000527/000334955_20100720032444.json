However, the EA specifies that land acquisition\n            or loss of income are not expected as a result of schools\n            construction. The EA recommends the use of standard\n            environmental guidelines, including community participation\n            in the process for re-vegetation propagation. Mitigation\n            measures address the need to establish one primary\n            decantation basin for each ten sand washers, as well as\n            restoration of borrow pits, and provision of latrines. The\n            use of cement and metal frames is strongly recommended to\n            prevent vector diseases, in line with sanitation\n            technologies. Appropriate site selection should identify the\n            location of water effluents, to include as well water\n            quality testing. During construction, soil surfaces should\n            be protected, ensuring adequate drainage from gutters, and\n            from wastewater collection points, while wastes, and solid\n            waste management control should be ensured through disposal\n            services. Public, and educational campaigns will contribute\n            to improved health, through the provision of health and\n            hygiene measures. Monitoring criteria should ensure that\n            appropriate mitigation is being conducted."}, "docdt": "2010-07-16T00:00:00Z"}
