                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was restructured on December 28, 2010, the number of components was reduced to two and the closing date extended to June 30, 2012. This will enable the project to
                         (i) respond to critical needs in the education sector and (ii) complete the ongoing works on school wells and the new National Curriculum Center. The initial targets of building 400
                         classrooms and 400 latrines and training over 10,000 primary teachers have been met. The ongoing construction of the National Curriculum Center and the 190 wells for primary
                         schools have shown some delays. Under the restructured project, construction latrines and wells for an additional 65 primary schools and training of another 1,500 primary teachers
                         will be implemented.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         By narrowing the scope of the project, the complexity of the project activities has been reduced. A comprehensive implementation plan was prepared well in advance to mitigate
                         potential constraints for the implementation of the restructured project. However, a close monitoring of the procurement process and the performance of the contractors is required to
                         ensure that all activities will be completed before the revised closing date of June 31, 2012.
