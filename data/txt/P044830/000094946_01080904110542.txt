3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Background
Georgia is a country of 5.4 million people bounded by the Black Sea, Armenia, Azerbaijan,



Turkey, and Russia. It has played a historic role as a transit country between Asia and Europe.
Georgia's independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991 reopened the country's transit
possibilities; however, political instability hindered this potential until 1994. With the conclusion
of a cease-fire in the Abkhazian separatist dispute, political and economic stability improved
substantially and has been sustained. This increased stability focused attention on Georgia as one
possible outlet for the huge oil reserves of the Caspian region.
Subsequently, on October 9, 1995, it was announced that Georgia would be one of two transit
countries along with Russia for "early oil" from the first phase of exploitation of crude petroleum
under the Caspian Sea by the Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC), a consortium
of 11 international oil companies and the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic
(SOCAR). AIOC has a Production Sharing Agreement (PSA), signed on September 20, 1994, for
development of the Main Azeri Oil and Chirag oil fields and the deep water portion of the
Guneshli field. The Georgian International Oil Corporation (GIOC) was created on November 11,
1995, as a state-owned enterprise to provide liaison services between AIOC and the Government
of Georgia.
Two options for Georgian transit were considered. The first one, a possible route from Baku,
Azerbaijan through the Tbilisi area to Ceyhan on the Turkish Mediterranean Coast. A feasibility
study was financed under the Baku-Ceyhan Oil Export Pipeline TA Project. The feasibility study
was completed and the pipeline project is in the development phase. The second option was a
route from Baku, Azerbaijan through the Tbilisi area to Supsa (on Georgia's Black Sea coast) for
which technical assistance was provided under this IDA Credit to Georgia. The main goal of the
project, consistent with objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of March 30, 1995,
was to improve Georgia's ability to benefit from oil development in the Caspian region by
attracting large-scale private investment in the necessary transport infrastructure, which would in
tun strengthen fiscal revenues and generate substantial economic growth.
Original Objectives
The objective of the project was to enhance the capacity of Georgian personnel to undertake
intemational negotiations in respect of oil pipeline transit.
3.2 Revised Objective:
There was no change in the objective of the project.
3.3 Original Components:
There were four components to this project.
Component 1: FEASIBILITY STUDY (by international consultants collaborating with Georgian
counterparts) of a major oil export pipeline from Baku, Azerbaijan to Supsa, Georgia and of
related terminal and storage facilities at Supsa. This study was intended to provide on-the-job
training to Georgian personnel in project economics, pipeline tariff determination, environmental
audit, legal review, project management and project financing, in order to enhance Georgian
capacity to negotiate transit terms with private investors.
- 2 -



Component 2: TRAINING FUND to finance Georgian participation in formal training courses in
Georgia and abroad, and on-the job training in international companies in the oil industry. Such
courses were to include: (i) pipeline transport economics (including principles of taxation); (ii)
intemational contract negotiation skills; (iii) environmental impact assessment (including
stakeholder analysis and public consultation); (iv) legal principles of transcountry pipeline
construction & operation; (v) principles of oil accounting, general accounting and auditing; (vi)
project financing; (vii) oil marketing; and (viii) oil industry in English language.
Component 3: NEGOTIATIONS ADVISORS to provide specialized legal and financial advice
prior to and during negotiations for oil transit, as well as to assist in preparing related contractual
documents.
Component 4: PROJECT MANAGEMENT SERVICES to be provided by GIOC in kind and to
include support services, office facilities and the provision of maps, serial photographs, and other
data.
3.4 Revised Conmponents:
The original components remained the same but the financing of the formal training (Training
Fund) was taken over by other donors.
3.5 Qutality at Entry:
Not rated. However, a rapid supervision assessment was done in 1999 by the Bank and was rated
satisfactory.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The overall outcome of the project is rated as highly satisfactory.
The Baku-Supsa Major Oil Export Pipeline (MEP) feasibility study was completed in September
1999 and provided very substantial on-the-job training to GIOC staff.
Legal, Financial, Technical and Taxation Negotiations Advisors were involved in project
negotiations for the Baku-Ceyhan Major Export Pipeline project (a US$2-3 billion project). The
negotiations have been completed and the Host Government Agreement (HGA) has been signed.
The signed HGA differed substantially from the original draft submission to Georgia by the
private investors. The enhancements achieved through the HGA negotiating process can be
directly attributed to the capacity-building and advisory services under the project (particularly as
regards to transit fees, environmental responsibilities, and land acquisition).
As the feasibility study for a potential Baku-Supsa Major Oil Export Pipeline (MEP) was designed
to provide the bulk of the training under the project (mainly through on-the-job training), the
objective related to training was also achieved. Furthermore, formal training identified at
appraisal and in the feasibility study was picked up by a combination of EU TACIS, USAID, and
the UK Know-How Fund (i.e. the training fund was financed by grant-based donors rather than by
the IDA Credit).
-3 -



In addition, Technical and Legal consultants were hired to advise the Government in negotiations
regarding the cleaning/deoiling of the Samgori-Batumi pipeline. As a result of their assistance, the
Government was able to enforce environmental responsibilities and ensure that deoiling of the
pipeline takes place.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Component 1: FEASIBILITY STUDY
This component was fully completed and the output is rated satisfactory. The feasibility study for
a potential Baku-Supsa Major Oil Export Pipeline (MEP) covered economic, financial, legal,
engineering and environmental issues and provided on-the-job training to GIOC personnel. The
training received allowed GIOC to assess the economic underpinnings of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
negotiations, as well as to evaluate the environmental impacts and sensitivities. It also identified
legal reforms needed in the areas of environmental liabilities and land acquisition with due
compensation. Those legal reforms were subsequently enacted, and strengthened the
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan legal agreements to the mutual benefit of Georgia and the private investors.
Component 2: TRAINING
The above feasibility study provided GIOC with substantial training in project economics, pipeline
tariff determination, environmental impact assessment, legal review, project management and
project financing, in order to enhance Georgian capacity to negotiate transit terms with private
investors. It also involved the extensive use of Georgian consultants (particularly environmental
scientists) alongside international experts, ensuring that local knowledge was incorporated and
that technology was effectively transferred. The Training Fund's formal training courses were
undertaken (but financed by other donors).
Component 3: NEGOTIATIONS ADVISORS
Intemational and local advisors were hired to advise on the legal, financial, and technical aspects
of transnational pipelines. They provided critical assistance to the negotiations of the
Baku-Thilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline Host Government Agreement (HGA) and related agreements.
This covered contractual provisions, financial/taxation arrangements, environmental
responsibilities, and Georgian Government commitments and liabilities. As a related endeavor,
engineering/environmental advisors assisted in negotiating with AIOC the environmental
protection of the Samgori/Batumi pipeline.
Component 4: PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Terms of reference for all consultants were prepared by GIOC, with the assistance of Bank staff.
In addition to providing support services (office facilities and the provision of maps, aerial
photographs and other data), GIOC was closely involved with the work of the consultants and
participated in reviews of the studies and reports produced by international consultants.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Net Present Value or Economic Rate of Return was not calculated for this Technical Assistance
-4 -



project.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Financial Rate of Return was not calculated for this Technical Assistance project.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The Georgian International Oil Corporation (GIOC) was created on November 11, 1995 as a
state-owned enterprise to act as AIOC's counterpart in Georgia, a country with very little prior
exposure to the international oil industry. The main objective of the credit was to enhance the
negotiating capability of GIOC. GIOC was able to develop substantial negotiating capabilities
through this project, which enhanced the benefits to Georgia of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline.
GIOC has since been given the responsibility of supporting the Govemment in negotiating a US$
2 billion gas transit pipeline project with private investors.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Negotiations on the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Major Export Pipeline (MEP) project started much later
than originally anticipated (although there was considerable pre-negotiation) and were then much
more intensive than expected. These factors created implementation problems related to
providing advisory services on time and on ensuring that consultancy contracts remained within
initial ceilings. However, these issues were well-managed and ultimately did not undermine the
project.
Unexpected environmental problems related to Samgori-Batumi pipeline created the need to hire
technical and legal advisors so as to ensure that the pipeline is properly cleaned in accordance
with intemational environmental standards. The Credit closing date had to be extended by one
year to allow for overdue audit of GIOC caused by delayed funding from EU TACIS, as well as
by the slippage in MEP negotiations.
5.2 Factors generally suibject to government control:
This MEP was seen by President Shevardnadze as a guarantor of Georgia's independence. As
such, the Oil Institution Building Credit, and the MEP negotiations process had complete support
at the highest level.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The implementing agency, GIOC, was excellent and performed in a highly satisfactory manner
throughout the project. It was a model of technical assistance management maximizing the
training provided by consultants (a notoriously difficult objective to achieve). It maintained
continuity of all key staff on the project.
5.4 Costs and financing:
At appraisal, the project was estimated to cost US$1.5 million, of which US$1.4 million was to be
financed by IDA, and US$0.1 million was to be in kind from GIOC. The Credit was made to the
Government of Georgia (GoG) and onlent to GIOC in US dollars. The local costs were borne by
GIOC in form of support services, office space and facilities and is estimated to be about
US$70,000.00. A unutilized balance of US$1,958.00 from the Credit was transferred back to
IDA by GIOC. The feasibility study exceeded estimated cost, resulting in the Training Fund being
- 5 -



assumed by other donors; the contract for advisors for the Samgori-Batumi pipeline (which was
not initially anticipated) resulted in part of the contract being financed by another Credit
(Structural Reform Support Credit). However, none of these changes proved disruptive to project
implementation. The detailed project costs and financing are shown in Annex 2.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for slustainabilitv rating:
The purpose of this project was to enhance the capacity of Georgian personnel to undertake
intemational negotiations in respect of oil pipeline transit. The Oil Institution Building project
focused on oil pipeline transit. The implementing agency for the project displayed consistent
commitment to project objectives. Bank involvement in transit pipelines has been strongly
supported by President Shevardnadze and other key members of the Government. It is highly
likely that the achievements of the project will be sustained.
Experience gained by GIOC staff during the preparation of Baku-Supsa MEP feasibility study and
Baku-Ceyhan MEP negotiations will be an asset as they will be involved in the negotiations of the
East West gas transit pipelines. In addition, as the construction of Baku-Supsa pipeline is still
being considered for oil which cannot be transported through Baku-Ceyhan because of its
chemical composition, GIOC will be able to use the acquired knowledge.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
As a follow-up to the Oil Institution Building project, a proposed Energy Transit Institutional
Building project in the amount of US$9.63 million was approved by the Board in March 2001. It
focuses primarily on implementation of negotiated oil and gas transit agreements. The new
project aims to: (i) maximize the Govenmment's pipeline revenues and minimize its liabilities; (ii)
ensure that transit agreements are negotiated and implemented in a manner that balances the
interests of investors and of Georgia, thereby reducing the long-term political risk faced by private
investors in infrastructure in Georgia; and (iii) through technical assistance review environmental
impact assessments and related environmental permit applications for pipelines (and subsequent
monitoring and public outreach), as well as in oil spill prevention and mitigation for non-pipeline
transportation of oil.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank responded very quickly to the Government's/GIOC's request for assistance. Project
preparation was carried out essentially in one mission. The preparation process was highly
collaborative with GIOC and other state agencies. The project team mobilized Bank management
support very effectively.
7.2 Supervision:
The project was intensively supervised, given the importance of the MEP to Georgia. The task
manager remained the same from project inception to closure, and there were only minimal
changes in team members. The team included several senior and experienced staff members. The
- 6 -



project received considerable attention during every Bank energy mission to Georgia (4-5 per
year) even where the mission was not formally a supervision mission for this project. Between
missions, there were weekly telephone conversations between GIOC and the task manager, and
frequent emails were exchanged. GIOC and the Bank team developed an extremely high level of
trust, which was very beneficial to the project.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The implementation progress was adequately monitored and reported (although reporting was
sometimes oral where it should also have been reflected in writing). The performance ratings in
the Project Supervision Reports (PSRs) were realistic. The Bank's supervision team, borrower,
and implementing agency worked together in a proactive and flexible manner. No deviations from
Bank policies and procedures were made and no safeguards issues arose. The closing date of the
project had to be extended by one year to allow EU-Tacis to fund audits of GIOC and because
HGA negotiations slipped beyond the originally expected date. The overall Bank performance is
rated satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
GIOC and (where necessary) Government were intensively involved in project preparation,
particularly the drafting of terms of reference for consultants.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government acted as a facilitator where necessary for the smooth implementation of the
project, although GIOC's direct reporting relationship to the President made the need for
Government facilitation only occasional.
7.6 Implementing AgencY:
The project was implemented by GIOC in its function as technical support agency for the
Government in its negotiations for oil transit through Georgia. The Executive Director of GIOC,
as project manager, had the direct responsibility of project implementation, procurement and
management of consultants while disbursement, accounting, and loan repayment were managed by
the Finance Department of GIOC. Terms of reference for consultants were prepared by GIOC
with the assistance of Bank staff. The actual work of 11 consultants was closely managed by
GIOC to ensure high-quality output and maximum capacity-building could be achieved.
7.7 Overall Borrower peiformance:
The performance of the borrower and GIOC as the implementation agency has been rated as
Highly Satisfactory."
8. Lessons Learned
This was a relatively small but highly visible project and the main lessons learned from Bank
involvement were: (i) there is a need for flexibility in project design to reflect considerable
uncertainty in pipeline implementation schedules; (ii) events can move very fast and timely
response is essential; and (iii) Bank management involvement is critical, given political
sensitivities.

9. Partner Comments
(a,) Borrower/implementing agency:
Four components of the project, which was implemented with the credit from the World Bank,
were Feasibility Study, Training Fund, Negotiation Advisors and Project Management.
Implementation of the Feasibility Study for the Baku-Supsa Major Oil Export Pipeline provided
huge practical experience and training for the GIOC's personnel. The study consisted out of five
sections on following subjects:
*     Baku-Supsa Major Export Pipeline Study
(Prepared by SNC-Lavalin International Inc. (SLII))
*     Baku-Supsa Legal and Regulatory Review
(Prepared by Macleod Dixon)
*     Baku-Supsa Crude Oil Market Analysis
(Prepared by Purvin and Gertz)
*     Baku-Supsa Tariff and Economic Study
(Prepared by TransCanada International)
*     Baku-Supsa Environmental Analysis
(Prepared by SLII and Georgian Intemational Oil Corporation (GIOC))
The study's main objectives were:
*     to seek to identify the basic design and cost estimates for an oil transportation system from
Baku (Azerbaijan) to Supsa (Georgia) for alternative routes and throughputs as identified by
GIOC;
-     proposing the recommendations regarding additional legal and regulatory requirements for
Georgia which are considered to be necessary or desirable for the construction, operation and
financing of the proposed Baku-Supsa Major Oil Export Pipeline;
-     development of sophisticated financial and economic model of the Project;
-     provide certain financial and economic analyses and comrnentary in support of the Tariff
and Economic portion of the Project's Feasibility Study;
-     to make elaborate research in fields of Geology and Hydrogeology, Landscape and Land
Use, Botany, Terrestrial fauna, Fisheries, Cultural heritage, Socio-economic aspects, Mitigation
measures.
-     to describe from an environmental point of view the different alternative routes which link
the Azerbaijan-Georgian border to Supsa.
-     providing the on-job training for the GIOC's personnel.
The recommendations and proposals, which were made resulting from the study included:
-     changes in regulatory and legal framework of Georgia and Azerbaijan;
-     principal changes in such categories as Pipeline Construction and Operation, Land
Matters, Financial and Tax Matters, Environmental Matters, Transnational Matters;
-     advising on analyzing of different financing approaches for the Project and its investors;
- 8 -



-     providing various criteria for the successful implementation of the Project;
-     advising on the aspects of Ownership and Operating Structure and Jurisdictional Issues;
-     suggested ways of further development of Georgia's actions, desirable approaches and
what country should consider in terms of the development of the complicated and highly sensitive
Project.
The suggested Tariff and Economic study and the model presented in it, were structured to enable
ongoing analysis under a variety of throughput, cost, stakeholder, financing, investment, tax and
tariff assumptions in response to Project development.
The Feasibility Study was fully completed and the output as we consider is highly satisfactory. As
the result Feasibility Study covered economic, financial, legal, engineering and environmental
issues and provided on-the-job training to GIOC personnel. It is very important that one of the
main results and conclusions which could have been drawn from the Feasibility Study was pointed
out in an affirmative sense: the project, as a large-scale, cross border, highly capital intensive
initiative, is anticipated to be a significant physical, legal and financial undertaking with complex
issues related to technical, commercial, legal, financial, international and local matters.
For the successful implementation of the Project, extensive training of the GIOC's personnel,
which was established within the framework of the Project, was held in the fields of project
management, project economics, pipeline tariff determination, environmental impact assessment,
legal matters, and financing. It helped to increase the ability of Georgian specialists in dealing with
foreign counterparts during the negotiations on various terms, and was provided during the
economic and technical evaluation of pipeline options in order to provide the capability of GIOC's
staff. Training process created the foundation for the strong and well-prepared staff of GIOC, and
provided substantial background in assessment and implementation of all other future projects.
International and local advisors were hired in order to assist and advise Georgian side on different
issues related to the financial, technical and legal matters of the Baku-Thilisi-Ceyhan Main Export
Pipeline Host Government Agreement. Engineering and environmental advisors assisted in
negotiations with the Azerbaijan International Oil Company on the environmental protection of
the Samgori/Batumi pipeline.
Concerning the Project Management component of the Project itself, GIOC gained the significant
experience in preparation of the terms of references for all consultants and carrying out the
complex evaluation process of the bidding procedure for the completion of the Feasibility Study
(awarded to SNC Lavalin International Inc.). World Bank personnel also provided its assistance
on that aspect. Participation in reviews of the studies and reports produced by international
consultants and provision of the support services highly involved GIOC in depth of the realization
of the given Project.
During the implementation of the Project, GIOC provided following information and assistance
for consultant's reference:
-     All reports, studies and geographical and environmental data relevant to the feasibility
-9-



study, aerial photographs, high resolution satellite maps, large scale ordinance maps and plans and
profiles of potential routes, data on existing facilities in Georgia, details and estimates of costs of
locally available goods and services. All this was obtained according to the best availability of
above-mentioned to GIOC. Best efforts were made to obtain all relevant information from AIOC,
SOCAR, GPC and BOTAS.
-     Obtaining visas and work permits in Georgia, Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkey as well as
other countries in the region where necessary.
-     Liaison with Governments of Azerbaijan and Turkey as well as AIOC, SOCAR, GPC and
BOTAS.
-     Office facilities and secretarial services.
