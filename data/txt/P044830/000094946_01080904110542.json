The performance of the Bank\n            is rated satisfactory, given an intense supervision, and the\n            contribution of experienced staff, to a well monitored, and\n            reported implementation progress. Performance by the\n            Borrower is rated highly satisfactory, given a strong\n            involvement in project preparation, and that the\n            Government's role greatly facilitated the successful\n            implementation. Regardless of success, this highly visible\n            project draws the following lessons. The need for\n            flexibility in project design is strongly emphasized, an\n            aspect which could take into account the considerable\n            uncertainty in pipeline implementation schedules.\n            Uncertainty was also an issue regarding the fast changing\n            events, particularly when timely responses are essential.\n            Nonetheless, the Bank's management involvement was\n            paramount, particularly given the country's political sensitivities."}, "docdt": "2001-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
