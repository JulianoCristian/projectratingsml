Specifically, the project is designed to:\n            1) increase the availability, range and quality of services\n            provided by primary health care facilities and raion\n            hospitals; 2) reorient service delivery toward more cost\n            effective health care; 3) decentralize decision making for\n            capital investments to the facility level; and 4) support\n            policy development through the introduction of national\n            health accounts. The project will have three main\n            components: 1) medical equipment including related supplies\n            and training, furniture, spare parts and maintenance\n            equipment to targeted health care facilities - both primary\n            (polyclinics, women's clinics and feldsher stations)\n            and secondary (raion hospitals and maternity homes); 2)\n            national health accounts; and 3) project management."}, "docdt": "1996-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
