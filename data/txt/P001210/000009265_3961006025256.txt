THE REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
RURAL SAVINGS AND LOANS REHABILITATION AND PROMOTION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:    The Republic of Cote d'Ivoire
Beneficiaries: The Network of CREPs/COOPECs
Amount:      SDR 1.5 million (US$2.2 million equivalent)
Terms:       Standard IDA Terms, with 40 years maturity
Relending
Terms:       From the Republic of CMte d'Ivoire to the Network of CREPs and COOPECs on
standard IDA terms.
PrQjS
Description:  The project would help revitalize the CREP/COOPEC Network by rehabilitating
existing CREPs and assisting in the creation of new ones where justified. To this
end, it would capitalize on results achieved during the pilot operation by: (a)
completng the rehabilitation process; (b) providing technical assistance and training to
the CREP/COOPEC membership in accounting and basic financial management; and
(c) funding awareness campaigns designed to fully internalize the main principles of
the mutualistic movement and ensure a strong sense of ownership from the members.
In order to ensure long-term sustainability and financial independence of the
movement, project efforts would focus on rural savings mobilization.
To meet the above objectives, the project would include the following
components:
(a)    Rehabilitation and Development of Local CREPs.  Detailed audit and
financial restructuring of the 70 existing CREPs, improvement of their
accounting system, and training of members and managers.
Establishment of about 70 new CREPs nation-wide on the basis of
local market surveys and awareness campaigns.
(b)    Support to Regional Service Units (RSUs) to provide timely
supervision and support to rural CREPs in their immediate
geographical area. These regional units would be responsible for the
promotion and supervisory functions of the project in their area. In
particular, they would promote and assist in the creation of new
CREPs, provide training to members, ensure that all prudential ratios
are met, see that the loan portfolio is ia good standing, and, during
the restructuring phase and beyond, make sure that important efforts at
loan recovery are made.



(c)     Support to the Central Management Unit (CMU). The project would
support the establishment of the CMU, on the basis of the small unit
already operating with CICM support, to provide the Network with
policy and operational guidelines, manage CREPs excess liquidity and
supervise their activities and RSUs' activities. The project would
fInance the necessary technical assistance to the CMU and its
investments and operating costs.

Benefits and risks
Project Benefits. The project would support the Government's efforts to develop an efficient, low
cost, grassroots rural financial intermediation system responding to rural populations' needs that the
formal banking system will be unable or unwilling to service even in the medium to long-term. An
efficient CREP network will provide rural dwellers with much needed deposit safekeeping services
and access to short and medium-term financing for productive and social expenses, thereby improving
rural incomes and living cond;tions and reducing poverty. It will also help mobilize and recycle rural
savings for productive purposes throughout the economy.
Risks. The main risk of the project lies in the fragility of the existing network. In fact, many rural
dwellers have been reluctant to join the CREP movement in part due to misinformation or the
perception that the movement was an arm of the Govermnent or belonged to few village elders. To
reduce this risk, considerable efforts will be deployed in the area of sensitization, awareness



- vi -
campaigns, and training. Another risk concerns the low level of know-how of current CREP
managers and administrative entities on sound financial practices. This risk will be minimized
through: (a) appropriate training; (b) close supervision from both the central and regional management
units; and (c) clearly spelled-out operational policies and procedures. A final risk concerns the
specificity of the CREPs membership which in the past consisted mostly of farmers, and, therefore,
made the Network vulnerable to cyclical pressures (physical, marketing and financial) often
encountered in the agricultural sector. To minimize this risk, the resource base of CREPs would be
enlarged by actively seeking membership from a large variety of rural dwellers (civil servants,
traders, craftsmen, etc.) to reduce the variability of deposits associated with agricultural incomes.
Economic Rate of Return: Not Applicable.

THE REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
RURAL SAVINGS AND LOANS REHABILITATION AND PROMOTION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01         The Government of CMte d'lvoire has requested assistance from the Bank for the
implementation of a Rural Savings and Loans Rehabilitation and Promotion Project. The project was
identified as a priority investment to fill the void left after the collapse of the National Agricultural
Development Bank (BNDA) and develop an efficient financial intermediate system in rural are'as. To
this end, the Bank, jointly witii the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) started the
preparation of a long-term National CREP rehabilitation program in 1988. A pilot project was
initiated in 1990. It is funded by CIDA and entrusted to the Canadian Societe Desjardins (SDID). At
about the same time, the Caisse Frangaise de Developpement (CFD), through the Centre International
du Credit Mutuel (CICM). also resumed its assistance t3 the CREP/COOPEC2 movement.
1.02         The project supports the Government's objective of developing viable financial
institutions which cter to the needs of rural populations. CREPs have demonstrated their potential to
be an efficient medium to serve the inteiests of rural populations at the grassroots. Consequently,
emphasis is given in the project to the rehabilitation of existing CREPs and assistance in the creation
of new ones where justified. The project would be fully in line with the financial sector reform
program supported by the Bank in the context of Cote d'Ivoire's medium-term macro-economic
program, including the FY92 Financial Sector Adjustment Loan.
HI. SECTOR BACKGROUND
A.    Economic Setting
2.01         Since the early 1980s, Cote d'Ivoire has faced several fiscal and balance of payment
crises. They reflected not only inadequate macroeconomic policies but also more fundamental
distortions in trade, finance, public sector, and pricing policies, thereby adversely affecting the
efficient allocation of resources and constraining sectoral growth prospects.
2.02         The Government has responded by adopting various stabilization and adjustment
programs which were supported by the IMF and the World Bank. In the context of these programs,
the Government has sought to correct its macroeconomic imbalances and the increasing lack of
international competitiveness through internal adjustment.
2 CREPs (Caisses Rurales d'Epargne et de Prets) are found in rural areas; COOPECs (Cooperatives
d'Epargne et de Credit) are found in semi-urban and urban areas. They are all part of the same network
(Reseau CREP/COOPEC) and operate along the same rules, regulations and management.



2.03         The strategy of internal adjustment was also at the core of the Govermnent's medium-
term economic framework (MT), adopted in 1991, which spelled out structural reforms aimed at
restoring international competitiveness and returning to a path of sustainable growth. To attain this
objective the Government has pursued tight fiscal and monetary policies, and implemented reforms in
the areas of trade and finance.
2.04         Moreover, the Government has initiated a privatization process, involving about 50
public enterprises, and sought to strengthen human resource development. The MTF was supported
by three SECALs of the World Bank and a stand-by arrangement of the IMF. In addition, the World
Bank has approved three technical assistance credits to support the Government in implementing its
economic reforms, privatization program, and human resources development program.
2.05         Despite progress in implementing key parts of the economic program, recent
economic developments show that the Ivorian economy continues to suffer from substantial fiscal and
balance of payments imbalances and considerable structural rigidities. As these macroeconom;e
imbalances persisted, the economic decline observed since 1986 was not reversed. With investment
levels hovering around 10 percent during the early 1990s, stagnant export receipts for the country's
main export products, cocoa and coffee, and stagnant industzial production, real GDP fell, on
average, by about 1 percent per year during 1990-93.
2.06         Faced with this difficult economic situation, the Government therefore decided, in
close consultation with its partner countries in the CFA zoDe, to complement the on-going internal
adjustment efforts with a realignment of the parity of the CFA franc to the equivalent of 100 CFA to
1 FF, with the effect from January 12, 1994.
2.07         With the re-alignment of the CFA franc, the Government has reformulated its
medium-term adjustment program in a Policy Framework Paper (PFP) for the 1994-96 period which
will be circulated to the Board shortly. During that time, this program aims to (i) raise the rate of
growth to about 6 percent beginning from 1996, (ii) achieve primary surpluses in the Government's
budget, (iii) strengthen external competitiveness through trade, price, and regulatory reform, (iv) seek
debt relief from official bilateral and commercial creditors at concessional terms, and (v) intensify
human resource development and expand poverty alleviation measures with a view to protecting the
most vulnerable groups during the adjustment period.
2.08         It is expected that, with the implementadon of the Government's program, the
recession will be halted and the country will return to a path of positive real growth rates in 1994,
accelerating to annual rates of 5 percent and bigher from 1995 onwards. The recovery will be led by
a sustained increase of investmant levels. This increase will come in response to the anticipated
implementation of structural reforms in such areas as trade, finance, and the labor market, thereby
instilling investors' confidence in the Ivorian economy. Moreover, private investment will be
increasingly geared toward non-traditional export activiPies, a key sector which is expected to grow
rapidly in the wake of the devaluation and to be a major source for new employment opportunities.
2.09         Due to the important debt overhang, most of the investrment will be financed by
domestic savings. They are expected to increase substantially as public savings will increase due, in
large part, to constraining real growth of current expenditure. In addition, private savings will be
stimulated by, among others, a recovery in economic growth and an improvement in the financial
position of tradable goods, notably in the agricultural sector. In this context, the strengthening of



-3 -
rural financial institutions assumes a key role. Increased rural savings can both be recycled into the
overall economy and help populations in the nrral areas undertake social and productive activities. It
is also expected that a strong and efficient rural financial network would undoubtedly play a key role
in the medium to long term in developing agriculture, thereby helping reverse the trend of economic
deterioration in the rural sector.
B.    The Agricultural Sector
2.10         Agrnculture is the most important sector in the Ivorian economy. It accounts for
about 35 percent of GDP, provides employment for about two thirds of the country's labor force,
generates close to 60 percent of export earnings and is a major source of fiscal revenues. The sector
is key to developing the country's industrial and services sectors.
2.11         The total land area of 320,000 km2 can be divided into a forest region, which covers
about 40 percent of the territory, and a savannah region, accounting for the remaining 60 percent.
With higher rainfall and better soils, the forest region has a richer resource base than the savannah.
Most of the origirnal forest cover (estimated at about 16 million hectares) has been cleared for
agriculture, leaving less than 3 million hectares of intact forest, mostly in gazetted areas and national
parks. There has been heavy migration into the forest zone from the savannah region and from
neighboring Sahelian countries. Cocoa and coffee occupy two thirds of the total cropped area and
dominate the forest region's economy. Annual food crops (rice, maize, yams, plantain and cassava)
account for about 25 percent of the cropped area, while other tree crops (oil palm, coconut and
rubber) and industrial crops (banana and pineapples) cover about five percent.
2.12         About 40 percent of all farmers in the savannah region grow cotton. Cotton revenues
account for almost one third of the cash incomes of savannah households. Cotton yields are high by
African standards (1,400 kg/ha) and the productivity of ginning is excellent (44 percent). Maize
accounts for 26 percent of the area planted, followed by yams (24 percent), cotton (16 percent), rice
(13 percent), sorghum/millet (9 percent), groundnuts (7 percent) and cassava (4 percent).
2.13         Despite the present problems faced by the eocoa and coffee subsectors, C8te
d'}voire's economic development depends heavily on the agricultural sector which has considerable
potential for growth and diversification. To realize this potential, technical and structural constraints
need to be removed, special efforts need to be made to mobilize savings in support of productive and
social investments. The absence of a viable and efficient financial intermediation system in the rural
areas has prevented rural populations to reach their full developmental potential. As a result,
populations in rural areas have become more vulnerable to the shocks of the recent economic
deterioration. The proposed Rural Savings and Loans Rehabilitation Project will establish an
environment conducive to helping rural populations address some of their most pressing financial
needs.

C.    Agricultural Institutions
2.14         Ministry of A,-riculture. The Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources
(MINAGRA) comprises departments responsible for crops, livestock, fisheries, forestry and
cooperatives. There are two central directorates handling Programming and Agricultural Training,
and separate directorates in each of the regions. MINAGRA has overall responsibility for
coordinating the activities of the various institutions in the agricultural sector. Government policies
are implemented through various development agencies (SODEs) responsible for extension services,
input distribution, processing and marketing. Within MINAGRA, the Direction de la Mutualite et de
la Cooperation (DMC) is in charge of promoting the development of cooperatives. Until now, this
directorate was responsible for providing technical backstopping and supervision to the CREP
network. Constant staffing and funding problems have prevented DMC, to properly fulfill its
mandate. Lax supervision by DMC, in turn, has contributed to the deterioration of the CREP
network.
2.15         Extension and Training. To date, extension and training Jf farmers and herders have
been provided by the following institutions: (a) the Cotton Development Agency (CIDT, created in
1974), for cotton and associated food crops in the savannah region; (b) the Company for the
Modernization of Ivorian Agriculture (SATMACI, created in 1958), for cocoa and coffee planters in
the forest region; (c) the Food Crop Development Agency (CIDV, created in 1988), for all food crop
producers over the entire national territory; (d) the Oilpalm Company (Palmindustrie, created in
1963), for oilpalm and coconut farmers in the forest region; (e) the African Rubber Company (SAPH,
created in 1956) and the Rubber Company of Grand Bereby (SOGB, created in 1979), for rubber
producers in the forest region; and (f) the Livestock Development Agency (SODEPRA, created in
1970), for cattle herders in northern Cote d'Ivoire and for small ruminants producers over the entire
national territory.
2.16         At present, the Government is undertaking a complete revamping of the national
extension system, as well as a reorganization of MINAGRA, under the proposed IDA financed
National Agricultural Services Restructuring Project (PNASA, FY94). The project entails: (a)
establishing streamlined extension services through the merger of SATMACI, CIDV and SODEPRA
into one decentralized national agency; this agency will have private-type status; and (b) reorganizing
and strengthening the regional and departmental services of MINAGRA. The project's focus is on
strengthening research-extension linkages and promoting the systematic use of the farming systems'
approach, supporting the development of farmers' associations and strengthening MINAGRA in key
areas (policy making, monitoring and statistics).
2.17         Research. In 1984, COte d'Ivoire took over all research institutes originally
established by France. Thereafter, these institutes were administered jointly by the Ministry of
Higher Education and Scientific Research (MESRS) and the French International Center for
Development Oriented Agronomic Research (CIRAD). This arrangement came to an end in 1991
when MESRS took over complete tutelage of agricultural research. At present, the agricultural
research establishment in C6te d'Ivoire consists of the following institutes: (a) the Savannah Research
Institute (ODESSA), based in Bouake that has mandate over crop and livestock production throughout
the savannah region; (b) the Forest Institute (IDEFOR), based in Abidjan, that has mandate over cash
crops in the forest region; and (c) the Ivorian Technological Research Center (CIRT) and the Ivorian
Tropical Technology Institute which have responsibility for research on agricultural technology.
Links between research and extension agencies remain weak although some improvement in this area



- 5 -
has been made as a result of the Bank's first Agricultural Extension Project (PVA, Ln. 2765-IVC).
The upcoming National Agricultural Services Restructuring Project (PNASA) would capitalize on
progress to date and further improve linkages between extension and research.
2.18         Farmers' Cooperatives. The Government has long been committed to the
development of cooperatives, particularly those capable of handling the primary marketing of cocoa,
coffee and cotton. Throughout the country there are numerous cooperative groups (GVCs), each with
a management committee. The GVCs are structured upwards in unions and regional federations. In
the forest region there are about 2,700 GVCs with a combined membership of about 222,000. These
GVCs were responsible for collecting 30 percent of the coffee and cocoa harvested in 1991. Thus
far, there is little scope for them to increase their share of primary marketing because, unlike the
licensed buyers, they cannot easily obtain commercial credit. In fact, since they cannot pay cash at
the farm gate, many producers prefer to sell to licensed buyers. In this regard, GVCs as well as
individual members would be encouraged to adhere to the CREP movement. To this end, awareness
and sensitization campaigns targeting GVCs will be initiated at project start.
2.19         Regional Land Management Funds. The FRARs (Fonds Regionaux d'Amenagement
Rural) were set up for each of the regions by a 1973 decree, with financial assistance from UNDP.
The initiative entails provision by the Government of matching funds to communities interested in
developing social and economic infrastructure (pumps, schools, dispensaries, rural roads, etc).
Access to the FRARs presupposes that communities themselves make a substantial contribution to
investment, the exact proportion depending on the type of infrastructure and the means of the
community. The poorest communities, as defined on the basis of their 'contributing capacity", are
expected to pay ten percent of the initial investment cost, the richest communities 85 percent. Almost
three-quarters of these projects were of a social rather than a directly productive nature.
D.    The Banking and Financial Sector
2.20         Cote d'Ivoire is a key member of the West African Monetary Union (UMOA). The
country accounts for 50 percent of the union's money supply and 55 percent of credits outstanding.
2.21         As of January 31, 1991, fourteen commercial banks were operating in C8te d'Ivoire,
with total assets of CFAF 1,332 billion. Over the years, these banks have developed an extensive
network including 165 branches, of which 92 are outside Abidjan. Four large retail banks account
for close to 90 percent of loans, deposits and Central Bank refinancing. Three of these larger banks,
incorporated in 1962, are affiliates of major F-ench commercial banks (Societe Generale de Banque
de Cote d'Ivoire - SGBCI, an affiliate of Societ Generale; Banque Internationale pour le Commerce
et l'Industrie - BICICI, an affiliate of Banque Nationale de Paris; and Societe Ivoirienne de Banque -
SIB, an affiliate of Credit Lyonnais). The fourth Bank (Banque Internationale pour l'Afrique
Occidentale - BIAOCI), inco orated in 1965 as an affiliate of the French BIAO-SA, became a state-
owned bank when the latter collapsed in 1990. However, the bank is now scheduled for
privatization. The other ten banks, established in the mid-1970's at the peak of the coffee and cocoa
boom, are smaller, and operate mostly as merchant banks or term lenders. Several of the smaller
banks are affiliates of American or British international banks (e.g., Citibank, Barclays), while others
are branches of transnational banks operating throughout Africa (e.g., Ecobank). In addition, there
are ten non-bank lending institutions providing leasing, hire purchase services and term finance. The
Abidjan Stock Exchange (Bourse des Valeurs) and several insurance companies also operate as
financial intermediaries. Between 1988 and 1990, the banking sector in Cote d'Ivoire experienced



-6 -
difficulties because of the economic recession and substantial arrears by both the Government and the
private sector. As a result, a major reform program was undertaken by Government. This reform
program is being supported by the Bank through the FY92 Financial Sector Adjustment Loan.
2.22         While commercial banks are very active in urban areas, they have provided only
minimal services to the rural areas, except for the financing of cocoa and coffee marketing campaigns
and, to a limited extent, of large agricultural outfits. The commercial banks have been reluctant to
move into rural areas because of the real or perceived high risks and costs of operating in these areas.
This role was to be played by BNDA, the now-defunct Agricultural Development Bank. BNDA was
established in 1968. It mobilized rural deposits and participated in the financing of large agricultural
projects and crop marketing campaigns, and provided bridge loans to farmers. It also managed lines
of credit established by donors. Before its liquidation in October 1991, BNDA had assets of CFAF
94 billion and a large network of 32 permanent and 44 temporary branches scattered across the
country.
2.23         From its very beginning, BNDA had been successful in attracting rural deposits which
increased at a ten percent annual rate on average. However, the bank suffered from high operating
costs and a large non-performing portfolio, and its financial situation continuously deteriorated from
the mid 1980's. In 1987, a restructuring program was initiated and later supported through the Bank-
financed Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL-FY90). It included: (a) the consolidation of
public sector deposits and of overdrafts with BCEAO; (b) the assumption of BNDA's external debt by
the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA), the Government's debt agency; and (c) fresh money
from the Government to fill the remaining financing gap. The plan also called for the bank to operate
under a two window-system: a first window for regular commercial risks funded by the bank's
deposits, and a second window for higher risk lending financed by government grants or donors' lines
of credit, with the lending risk assumed by the Government. This would have separated development
from commercial operations, and protected depositors against risks involved in financing development
oriented operations.
2.24         However, the Government was unable to provide its financial contribution and the two
window-system was never set up. With over 90 percent of its portfolio non-performing, the bank
continued to accumulate losses. In 1990, the abrupt closing of six agencies prompted substantial
withdrawals of deposits which further accelerated BNDA's decline. In October 1991, the
Government decided that BNDA could not be rehabilitated. It was therefore liquidated.
2.25         With BNDA's liquidation, developing an alternative financial instrument in rural areas
has become a priority for both the Government and the donor community, as a large percentage of
rural populations did deposit their funds with BNDA. This need was fully highlighted by the
Government during the preparation of the Financial Sector Adjustment Program in a Statement of
Sector Development Policy. To this end, renewed emphasis is being placed on the rehabilitation of
the rural savings and loans cooperatives Network (Reseau CREP/COOPEC) which is expected to
become the vehicle for savings mobilization in rural areas and provide rural populations with access
to credit services that commercial banks are not able to provide, namely small loans and deposits,
daily access to funds, proximity to villages, etc. The project would be the first phase of this
rehabilitation. It would emphasize the Network's institutional and financial restructuring. CREPs
would not be expected at first to play a major role in the financing of the development of the
agricultural sector since their deposit base is limited and their weak operational and managerial
capacity would not enable them to serve as a channel for routing APEX lines of credit destined for



- 7 -
the agricultural sector. Also, it is important that the Network keeps its grass-roots nature and only
relends resources it has mobilized. In the short-to-medium term, CREPs would cater to rural
populations' credit needs for small scale productive and social activities.
E.    Rural Financial Intermediation
2.26         History and Background. In Cote d'Ivoire as in most other African countries,
commercial banks have shied away from providing adequate financial services (small deposits and
loans) to rural populations. Although the main commercial banks have established branches in most
urban centers outside Abidjan, their main interest has been to mobilize deposits, and, to a limited
extent, cater to credit needs of well established clients mostly in commerce, small industries etc.
Their reluctance to lend to farmers and rural dwellers is due to the perceived risks and high
administrative costs associated with lending to smallholders; and to the fact that these costs cannot be
adequately covered by interest rates banks can charge. It is estimated that in 1990 less than four
percent of total lending by Formal Financial Intermediaries (FIs) was in favor of agriculture, with
BNDA accounting for more than three quarters of credit to agriculture. In view of this situation, the
Government has taken steps since the mid-1970's to promote grass-root rural savings and loans
cooperatives that would be able to efficiently respond to the financial needs of rural dwellers.
2.27         The start of the CREP/COOPEC movement in Cote d'Ivoire dates back to 1976. The
period of 1976-81 saw a rapid development of CREPs under the guidance of the Office National pour
la Promotion Rurale (ONPR) with the support of the French Centre International du Credit Mutuel
(CICM). During this period, 66 CREPs, with a membership of about 7,600 and total savings of
around CFAF 250 million, were established with close links to BNDA which was responsible for
managing CREPs liquidity and providing operational assistance. The following three years (1982-
1984) were marked by growing difficulties for the CREP/COOPEC movement. The interruption of
the assistance provided by CICM and the dismantlement of ONPR, whose responsibilities were
transferred to the Direction de la Mutualite et de la Cooperation (DMC) of the Ministry of
Agriculture, resulted not only in a slow-down in the creation of new CREPs but also in a marked
deterioration in the management of existing ones. Loan delinquency became widespread partly
because of the 1982-83 drought (which greatly affected income generation in rural areas), but also
because of the lack of proper supervision and inspection and a reluctance to enforce financial
discipline.
2.28         The Network also functioned without policy guidance and under weak institutional and
regulatory arrangements. CREPs were being opened in an ad-hoc fashion without financial
justification. There was no clear strategy for the Network's development. By 1991, about a third of
the 76 CREPs were inactive, and the total bad loans of the movement amounted to CFAF 264 million
(44 percent of total deposits and members' capital). Since 1991, 22 additional CREPs have been
closed.
2.29         Recent Developments. There is a large untapped savings potential in rural areas and
an urgent need for safekeeping and efficient financial intermediation services that commercial banks
will not be able or willing to offer even in the medium to long-term. Given the importance of
developing a rural financial institution that would efficiently cater to the needs of rural populations,
the Bank, jointly with the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), started in 1988 the
preparation of a Pilot CREP Rehabilitation Project to be implemented in the Man Region. This pilot
project was to promote the development of a CREP/COOPEC network that would: (a) be based on



- 8 -
growth from grassroots level; and (b) emphasize savings mobilization. In 1990, the French
International Center for Mutual Credit (CICM) decided to resume its assistance to the movement with
funding from the French Cooperation Ministry (FAC). Both SDID and CICM were then mandated
by the Government to promote jointly the development of a grass;oots-type rural savings network.
2.30         With CIDA financing, implementation of the pilot operation, entrusted to the
Canadian Societe Desjardins (SDID), started in 1990. In the first seven months of its operations,
SDID undertook a thorough diagnostic of the status of the each of the twelve CREPs in the Man
region. Four CREPs were retained for immediate rehabilitation, operations of a further three were
suspended (to be resumed provided certain conditions, related essentially to recovery of loans,
changes in management and organizational structure) and the remaining five CREPs were liquidated.
The pilot project also undertook sensitization of CREP members, training of its managers and
members and initiated actions for the establishment of three or four new CREPs within the region.
The major focus of CICM's activities has been on carrying out the diagnostic of the financial
structure and management of individual CREPs and the establishment and management of a Central
Management Unit, located in Abidjan to carry out inspections and manage excess liquidity. It has
assisted in the opening of about 20 new CREPs and closing of ten that were not performing.
2.31         Present Legal and Financial Status of CREPs. The CREP/COOPEC network is not
subject to the regulations of the banking sector. The Network is currently operating under a
legislative framework defined by the 1977 Cooperative Law (Law No.77-332). This law provides a
wide framework with almost no restrictions on the Network's development. However, it is not
specifically tailored to the needs of rural financial cooperatives, and, as such, it does not provide the
guidelines and safeguards necessary for their financial operations. A regulatory framework for rural
savings and loans cooperatives is under preparation by BCEAO with technical support from the
SDID. This regulatory framework ("Loi Cadre") and subsequent implementation decrees will apply
to mutualistic-type financial cooperatives in the UMOA. In the meantime, the prevailing current legal
framework would be strengthened under the project by: (a) a revision of CREPs' statutes and by-
laws; and (b) commitment by the Government through a Letter of Sector Policy (LSP) to give the
Network freedom of operation, in accordance with rules democratically established by its own
management. During its constitutive General Assembly on April 9, 1993, the Association Nationale
des CREP/COOPEC de COte d'Ivoire (ANAC-CI) was formally established, its statutes adopted and
its membership approved. ANAC-CI is legally empowered to commit the Network, guide it through
its rehabilitation phase and develop a coherent growth strategy.
2.32         The total membership of CREPs presently stands at 20,200, i.e. less than 3 percent of
estimated rural households in Cote d'lvoire. Total deposits represent about 0.1 percent of private
deposits of the country's commercial banks of CFAF 570 billion. Average membership per CREP
(200) and deposits per member (CFAF 40,000) are relatively low and few rural CREPs presently
have a financially viable size (estimated at about CFAF 15 million of deposits). As of September 30,
1991, the Network's estimated accumulated losses were about CFAF 300 million. Use of the
Network's accumulated reserves and stepped up loan recovery efforts during FY92 have contributed
to reduce the financial gap. This gap, estimated at about CFAF 180 million as of December 31, 1992
would have to be financed by external funds. A substantial amount of financial management and
rehabilitation will need to be undertaken at the level of each local CREP in order to re-establish local
populations' confidence in CREPs. This is a prerequisite to increasing participation in the movement
and make it financially viable and sustainable over the long run. To this end, a number of corrective



- 9 -
measures are envisaged in the proposed operation, in particular with regards to better supervision,
training and sound credit and savings policies and practices.
2.33           Present and Projected Profitability. Detailed audits undertaken during the pilot phase
have indicated that the majority of the existing cooperatives have a potential for financial viability.
Those that were considered not viable were liquidated. During the project period, important cost
containment measures and safeguards would be established and enforced: rigorous financial control
and inspection of accounts would be undertaken systematically; accounts would be audited annually by
external auditors; a 100 percent repayment rate would be mandated and the ratio of loans outstanding
to total deposit would be limited initially at a low level and gradually increased at a pace that reflects
the financial health of each individual CREP.
2.34           Deposits and Loans. The expected evolution of CREPs' membership and deposits,
shown in Annex 2, is summarized in the table below.

2.35           Financial projections presented in Annex 2 are based on the following key
assumptions: (a) increase in deposits by 12.5 percent annually; (b) a five percent increase of operating
costs per year; (c) lending to members at a rate of at least 22 percent per annum; (d) total lending
amounts limited to 20 percent of total saving deposits mobilized in year 1 and increasing to 50 percent
by year 3; (e) interest earnings of 11.5 percent per year on excess liquidity; (t) interest payment of
four percent on members' deposits; and (g) a mandated loan repayment rate of 100 percent for all
members. Profitability scenarios are also based on the assumption that a number of CREPs would be
established within semi-urban or urban areas. Former depositors of the now-defunct BNDA, most of
wliom have now been reimbursed, would be targeted and encouraged to become members of CREPs.
It is expected that within ten years, at least half of deposits collected would originate from CREPs in
semi-urban or urban areas and the balance from rural CREPs. It also is expected that average



- 10-
membership in rural and mixed CREPs/COOPECs would grow from 200 to 650 and from 350 to
2000 respectively by year 10.
2.36            The projected financial viability of the Network (see Annex 2) is summarized below.
Most CREPs within the Network should become profitable at the primary level during the proposed
project period ending in 1999. Temporary operating losses would be incurred by newly opened
CREPs which would be allowed a limited four-year period to break even. Rigorous cost containment
measures (part time opening, manager's salary adjustment, authorized litrited amount of operating
expenditures) would be applied to ensure viability. Key monitoring indicators such as loan recovery
rates, loans to deposits ratios, administrative and operating costs, etc., would be strictly enforced.
However, although financial projections indicate that the CREPs would be able to cover an increasing
share of the total operating costs of the Network (including those of the Regional Units and of the
Central Management Unit) it is not expected that the Network as a whole would become fully self-
financed during the first phase of the rehabilitation program. In subsequent phases, the Network
would be expected to cover all operating and development expenditures incurred at the regional level
(over a ten-year period), and then become totally financially autonomous, i.e. able to finance
expenditures at both the regional and the central levels (15/18-year horizon). Therefore, during the
next 15 years, technical backstopping, training and management support at the regional/central level
would still have to be covered in part by donors and/or the Government. It is estimated that the
Network would have to generate about CFAF 15-20 billion of savings before it is fully able to cover
all development and operating costs.

F.    Donor Activities in the Rural Financial Sector
2.37         Until recently, the agricultural sector has been the main engine of growth in COte
d'Ivoire. As such, it has benefitted from a considerable amount of donor support. In particular, the
rural credit sub-sector has received assistance from most of the donors present in Cote d'Ivoire.
Therefore, the proposed Bank proiect would draw on experiences gained through the implementation
of past projects. To date, the rural credit sub-sector has received support from:
(a)   the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) which supports, inter alia,
the pilot CREP Rehabilitation Project, the promotion of rural agricultural and forestry
cooperatives, and a pilot project specifically tailored to the needs of rural women;
(b)   the French Cooperation Ministry (MAC) which has fnanced the promotion of rural
savings and loans institutions along with technical backing from the Centre
International du Credit Mutuel (CICM);
(c)   the European Union (EU) which is supporting a rural cooperative development. This
project stresses savings mobilization and financial assistance to cooperative groups.
EU has also established a CFAF 2 billion line of credit destined to assist cooperatives
and farming groups in the financing of agricultural marketing campaigns; and
(d)   the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) which is supporting a
Rural Development Project in KatiolalDabakala with a view to improving that
region's extension service. As part of that project, it is assisting the creation of eight
to ten CREPs.
2.38         A number of small projects, initiated and managed by non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), have credit components. These projects are usually localized and target specific
communities. Furthermore, a number of informal rural savings and loans "institutions' are found in
the commerce and transport sectors. Finally, several agricultural development projects, ongoing
and/or envisaged, although they are not expected to include rural savings mobilization and credit
components, are likely to have an impact on the development of specific areas that would be favorable
to the creation and/or promotion of rural CREPs.
G.    Lessons Learned
2.39         Because the project would be the first to be financed by IDA in the rural financial
intermediation arena in Cote d'Ivoire, preparation efforts capitalized on experiences gained in other
countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Rwanda, etc.) which have implemented similar operations. IDA also
learned from experiences of the pilot CREP operation. In particular, the need to build up the
Network from the grassroots, rather than favoring the promotion of development banks funded
through external lines of credit and/or government resources, was stressed during project preparation.
Other significant lessons incorporated into the project design include measures to give the CREP
network full autonomy over its management and in the implementation of its activities regarding
staffing, credit policy, and anticipated growth targets as past government interference and
inappropriate monitoring prevented the movement to reach its full potential. Furthermore, important
safeguards and measures to re-launch the movement on a sound footing have been introduced during
project preparation (revised statutes and by-laws, new credit and personnel policies and a well-



- 12 -
defined Statement of Operational Policies of the Network to be adopted by ANAC-CI prior to project
start). In particular, the Credit Policy, highlighted in the "Manuel de Credit' prepared by the
Network, has been overhauled to ensure that: (a) credit is granted only when it is economically or
socially justified; (b) loans are made for specific purposes; (c) credit is granted only when members
savings are adequate; and (d) prudential ratios are respected and monitoring of all loan repayment is
made systematically. Still, it is also recognized that, for some time to come, important resources and
efforts would have to be directed towards training and sensitization of members. During the project
period, close supervision of financial management by CREP managers and administrative entities
would be frequent. Adherence to strict guidelines and internal procedures would also be monitored.
III. THE PROJECT
A.    Project Rationale. Objectives and Description
3.01         Rationale. Besides large scale agricultural operations financed through the crop-based
("filibre") approach by development agencies and/or large parastatals (i.e. CIDT, SODEPRA, SAPH),
there are important financial needs in the rural sector that can only be fulfilled by a decentralized
network of financial institutions. Such a network can collect savings mobilized locally with a view to
financing low-cost agricultural activities and providing readily available credit to rural dwellers to
help them fulfill some of their basic financial needs (small equipment, school fees and supplies, social
expenses, etc.). The Government has therefore decided to make the promotion of a revitalized CREP
movement one of the main thrusts of its strategy to foster growth in rural areas. To this effect,
savings frozen as part of BNDA liquidation have been fully refunded to the CREP/COOPEC network
and the Government has launched a long-term effort to: (a) provide the movement with an enabling
regulatory and institutional environment; (b) clearly define its organizational structure and operational
policies; (c) carry out its financial restructuring; and (d) provide the necessary assistance and
safeguards until the movement is well on its way to managerial and financial autonomy. The main
underpinnings of the Government's strategy are clearly spelled out in a Letter of Sector Policy (LSP)
dated November 18 1993, which is acceptable to IDA (Annex 3). The project is fully consistent with
the Operational Directive 8.30 on Financial Sector Operations. In particular, it takes into account the
country's incentives framework and macro-economic environment, financial sector policies were
evaluated, and the legal and regulatory framework of CREPs was reviewed and, where appropriate,
strengthened. Furthermore, safeguards have been introduced (para. 2.39) to: (a) ensure market
determination of interest rates; (b) restore public confidence in the Netwonk; (c) prevent imprudent or
fraudulent behavior by CREP managers and members; and (d) assure sound management of the
Network through improved credit and financial policies, simple but efficient accounting and
administrative practices and staff training.
3.02         As a complement to the Financial Sector Adjustment Program being supported by the
Bank (para. 2.21), the proposed proiect would focus primarily on the institutional strengthening of
rural financial intermediaries. It would help establish a privately-owned rural financial intermediation
system which would fill the void created by the reluctance of commercial banks to operate in rural
areas and the recent liquidation of BNDA. ITe existence of such a financial instrument is essential to
long-term economic growth, not only in rural areas but also at national level, through a recycling of
grassroots savings for productive purposes throughout the economy.



- 13 -
3.03         Obiectives. The project would help revitalize the CREP/COOPEC movement by
rehabilitating existing CREPs and assisting in the creation of new ones, where justified. To this end,
it would capitalize on results achieved during the pilot operation by: (a) establishing a satisfactory
institutional structure for the movement and completing its financial restructuring through rigorous
loan recovery and systematic closing of non-viable CREPs; (b) providing technical assistance and
training to the CREP members and managers in accounting and basic financial management to ensure
satisfactory management of individual CREPs; and (c) funding awareness campaigns to restore
populations confidence, stress the private nature of the Network and its total independence from both
the Government and the now-defunct BNDA, and get members to fully internalize the principles of
the mutualistic movement and have a strong sense of ownership of the Network. In order to ensure
long-term sustainability and financial independence of the movement, one of the project's main thrusts
would be to focus on rural savings mobilization.
3.04         Project Description. The project would consist of the following components:
(a)   rehabilitation and development of Local CREPs. Detailed audit and financial
restructuring of the 70 existing CREPs, improvement of their accounting system and
training of members and managers. Establishment of new CREPs nation-wide on the
basis of local market surveys and awareness campaigns (preliminary estimates indicate
that between 70 to 75 CREPs could be created). The project would finance CREPs'
financial restructuring, equipment and operating costs;
fb)     ort to Regional Service Units fRSUs). Support to six Regional Service Units
(Korhogo, Gagnoa, Bouake, Man, Abidjan-Est, Abidjan-Ouest) which would provide
timely supervision and support to local CREPs in their geographical aiea; and
(c)   support to the Central Management Unit (CMU). The project would support the
establishment of the CMU, on the basis of the unit already operating with CICM
support, to provide the Network with policy and operational guidelines, manage
CREPs excess liquidity and supervise their and RSUs' activities. The project would
finance the necessary technical assistance to the CMU and its investments and
operating costs.
B.    Detailed Features
3.05         The project would be carried out over the 1994-1999 period. It would be the first
phase of a long-term rehabilitation program and would be developed along the following principles:
(a)    establishment of a network of a private nature controlled by its members and free
from government interference in its operational policies and management (in
particular, the freedom of setting interest rates on deposits or loans within the limits
of usury law). The rate of 22%, expected to be charged for loans under the project is
a reasonable proxy of a market clearing rate for most credit purposes in the rural
sector. All operational policies concerning lending activities would be clearly spelled
out in a Statement of Operational Policies (SOP). Formal adoption of the SOP by
ANAC-CI would be a condition of effectiveness (para 7.02 (a));



- 14 -
(b)   priority would be given to deposit mobilization with only limited lending activity in
the short-to-medium term, under strictly defined guidelines, funded by members
deposits and not by external lines of credit;
(c)   setting up of a three-tiered organizational structure, with (i) autonomous operational
units at local level (CREPs) undertaking deposit mobilization and lending activities;
(ii) regional service units (RSUs) at regional level providing training and technical
backstopping to CREPs, and also responsible for the promotion of the movement in
their region; and (iii) a Central Management Unit (CMU) at national level responsible
for the supervision of CREPs activities and the centralized management of their excess
liquidity, with the Board of Directors of ANAC-CI as the movement's policy-making
body; and
(d)   outside supervision would be carried-out through (i) external annual audits, and (ii) a
Project Monitoring Committee, chaired by the Ministry of Finance with representation
from other ministries and BCEAO.
Project components are described below, and more details are given in the project preparation report
and associated working papers.
1.    Rehabilitation and Develoment of local CREPs
3.06         Activities envisaged under this component would capitalize on work already
undertaken during the pilot phase. All CREPs identified during the pilot phase as non-viable have
been closed. All remaining CREPs would be audited, and, on the basis of these audits and after
rnegotiations with each CREP's management, a timetable for its financial restructuring would be
agreed on. This restructuring plan would mainly consist of: (a) establishing criteria and a timetable
for a loan recovery drive specific to each rural CREP; (b) defining a set of parameters specific to
each rural CREP in the area of membership development, credit and savings policies (ratios, credit
duration, fees, interest) and training; and (c) agreeing on a set of performance indicators which would
be used to evaluate the need for the creation of new CREPs and the progress of existing ones during
the project and beyond.
3.07         Day-to-day management of the rural CREPs would be done through three simple
internal entities: (a) a Board of Directors (Conseil d'Administration) comprising five to seven
members elected democratically by the membership; (b) a Credit Committee (Comite de Credit)
comprising three to five members, in charge of implementing the credit policy and ensuring
creditworthiness of applicants; and (c) a Surveillance Committee (Comite de Surveillance) comprising
three members, in charge of ensuring financial discipline. These bodies would function in accordance
with the guidelines and rules established by ANAC-CI, the revised by-laws and the Statement of
Operational Policies.
3.08         The project would finance the training of members, institutional and management
support, awareness campaigns, and logistical and infrastructural support. In particular, the project
would finance the construction and/or rehabilitation of offices for about 40 CREPs. It would also
finance office equipment and supplies for financial transactions. A number of training sessions and
information seminars on management, accounting procedures would also be financed under this
component. Finally, provisions would be made under the CFD loan to cover restructuring costs and



- 15 -
operating deficits in order to speed up the financial viability of CREPs for which satisfactory steps are
being taken to improve financial discipline and loan recovery, and develop membership.
2.    Support to Regional Service Units
3.09         The project would support the development of Regional Service Units (RStJs) to
provide timely supervision and support to CREPs in their immediate geographic area. In particular,
the RSUs would assist in the creation of new CREPs, provide training to members, ensure that all
prudential ratios are met, see that the loan portfolio is in good standing, and, during the restructuring
phase and beyond, make sure that the required efforts at loan recovery are made. The six regions
cnvisL,ged under the project are: Korhogo, Gagnoa, Bouake, Man, Abidjan-Est and Abidjan-Ouest.
SDID anid CICM would each provide assistance to three of the six regions (SDID in Man, Bouake,
and Abidjan-Est; CICM in Korhogo, Gagnoa and Abidjan-Ouest).
3.10         Each regional service unit would have a small team of specialists in charge of: (a)
identifying training needs for both CREP managers and members, and implementing training
programs accordingly; (b) assisting in the definition of procedures; (c) organizing awareness
campaigns at the regional level and undertaking socio-economic analysis that would serve as the basis
for installing new CREPS; and (d) providing support to local CREPs in accounting practices and
internal control. This team would consist of one CICM or SDID specialist, two regional promoters,
two controllers, and a small support staff. A senior counterpart staff would be selected in each
region, trained by the internationally-recruited staff, and take over the management of the regional
unit in project year 3.
3.11         Under this component, the project would finance vehicles, office space and
equipment, seminars and workshops, long and short term technical assistance, and operating
expenses. All activities envisaged under the component are aimed at institution building. They would
strengthen local CREPs through training, technical back-up and monitoring organized at the regional
level, and, in time, improve their capacity to become self-supporting.
3.    Support to the Central Management Unit
3.12         Inspection, financial, institutional and managerial support, as well as assistance for
supervision, would be provided to the Network from a central unit (para 7.01 (a)) with the assistance
of CICM and SDID-the two firms chosen by the Government to promote the development of the
Network through a joint approach. The Central Management Unit would be entrusted with daily
project management and have exclusive responsibility to: (a) define the operational policies of the
Network; (b) supervise and inspect the CREPs and RSUs; (c) pool and manage the liquidity of
individual CREPs; (d) approve the closing and opening of CREPs on the basis of socio-economic
studies and financial monitoring; (e) implement publicity and awareness campaigns at the national
level; and (f) collect and centralize data on the Network's development.
3.13         The Central Management Unit would be headed by a CICM credit specialist assisted
by a SDID training specialist and a high level national specialist of credit activities. The Government
would have no involvement in project management other than through the Project Monitoring
Committee (Comite de Suivi). All project staff would be hired on a contractual basis and be
gradually taken over by the Network.



- 16-
3.14         The project would finance technical assistance (Project Director, Training Specialist)
and two Junior Specialists (French Volunteers) in charge of setting up a computerized accounting
system. Provisions have also been made under this component for technical support missions,
external training, workshops and annual financial audits. The project would also finance some
vehicles, office space and equipment, as well as the CMU's operating costs on a decreasing basis.
All long-term technical assistance would be financed by CFD, FAC and CIDA. The recruitment of
all technical assistance staff and key project personnel on terms of reference (Annex 4) and conditions
satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of effectiveness (para 7.02 (b)).
IV. PROJECT COSTS. FINANCING. PROCUREMENT.

A.    Uroject Costs
4.01         The total cost of the proposed project over 1994-99 period, including all incremental
capital and recurrent expenditures, is estimated at CFAF 9.5 billion (US$15.8 million), of which
CFAF 6.5 billion (US$11 million) or 69.2 percent of total costs in foreign exchange, and about
CFAF 450 million (US$0.8 million) or five percent in taxes and duties.
4.02         Base costs have been estimated at January 1994 prices using the rate of exchange of
CFAF 605 prevailing at that date. Physical contingencies have been allowed on investment and
operating cost items except for technical assistance and staff salaries. The average physical
contingency amounts to two percent of base costs, with individual rates ranging from zero to five
percent. Price contingencies have been applied ti base costs over an estimated implementation period
of five years (1994-1999). Price contingencies on foreign exchange costs based on Bank's projections
of international price increases have been included at an average rate of 3.2 percent per annum over
1994-1999. Price contingencies on local costs have been revised to take into account the recent
devaluation of the CFAF and expected inflation rates over the next five years. Total price
contingencies amount to 8.6% of base costs.
4.03         Project costs (including taxes and duties) are summarized below and detailed estimates
for each component are given in Annex 5 and Working Paper No.2.

* Taxes only
4.05             In accordance with IDA guidJines on Local Cost Financing and Cost Sharing (OD
6.30, para 5), this project, an operation in support of financial intermediaries, is not subject to Bank
cost-sharing limits. However, the financing plan has been devised to ensure satisfactory contribution
from the Network without compromising, in the early stages, its chances for a successful financial
rehabilitation and subsequent viability. The CREP network's estimated financial contribution of
CFAF 450 million, over five years, was based on realistic growth prospects. Because the Network is
of a private nature, and to become, in time, financially autonomous, the Government's involvement in
the project has been limited to the financing of taxes and duties. To this end, the Government would,
on behalf of the Network, open a project account to channel its contribution (meant to finance taxes
only). The opening of such account and evidence of an initial deposit of CFAF 100 million would be
a condition of effectiveness (para 7.02 (c)).
4.06             The proposed credit of US$2.2 million equivalent would finance about 15 percent of
project costs (net of taxes). IDA funds would cover expenditures related to part of civil works
expenditures, vehicles and equipment (mainly computers), short-term consultancies for management



- 18 -
support and audits, training activities and part of RSUs' and CMU's development costs. CFD
financing would cover CREPs' past operating losses, part of the long-term Technical Assistance
(CICM), vehicles and equipment, and operating costs. FAC would mainly finance two long-term
expatriate positions at the CMU and at the RSUs. CIDA would finance three long-term resident
experts to be posted in the RSUs and one at the CMU, part of operating costs and management
support. The Government's contribution to the project would cover 100 percent of taxes and duties.
The Network is expected to cover its operating costs only in the long term. Its own financial
contribution to the operating costs of the RSUs and CMU over the first five years would however be
significant: about CFAF 450 million (US$0.8 million), or 20% of the total operating costs of
RSU/CMU (excluding technical assistance). IDA funds would be passed on from the Government to
ANAC-CI on behalf of the Network on standard IDA terms. Foreign exchange risks would be borne
by the Network. The signing of the subsidiary credit agreement between the Government and
ANAC-CI required to this effect would be a condition of effectiveness (para 7.02 (d)). CFD, FAC
and CIDA financing have been approved. The effectiveness of the CFD loan, the FAC and CIDA
grants would be a condition of effectiveness for the IDA Credit (para 7.02 (e)). A detailed financing
plan is available in working paper No.2.
C.    Procurement
4.07         The proposed procurement arrangements are detailed in table following para 4.13 and
in Annex 6. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Network would respect these
arrangements and apply procurement procedures in accordance with Bank Guidelines and that
progress reports would include monitoring of the various aggregate amounts and ceilings. The
Central Management Unit will be the executing agency responsible for carrying out project activities,
including all procurement activities.
4.08         Civil works for the construction and/or rehabilitation of office buildings at the
regional and central levels are too small and too scattered geographically to attract bidders under
International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Contracts for these works, each not exceeding US$40,000
equivalent, will therefore be awarded through local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures. These
procedures have been reviewed and found acceptable by the Bank. There are enough contra tors in
CMte d'Ivoire to provide for adequate competition. Foreign contractors would be eligible to bid.
Total Bank financing under LCB for the civil works contracts is estimated at the equivalent of
US$160,000.
4.09         Contracts for vehicles and equipment, to the extent possible, would be grouped into
lots of sufficient size to allow for competitive bidding. Those in excess of US$200,000 will be
awarded on the basis of International Competitive Bidding (ICB). LCB, using procedures acceptable
to the Bank, will be used for precurement involving contracts of less than US$200,000 but greater
than US$50,000, up to a total of US$200,000 over the life of the project. Procurement of contracts
for small items of equipment under US$50,000, up to a total of US$200,000, that cannot be grouped
under the above procedures, would be made under local shopping procedures (minimum three
quotations).
4.10         Service contracts for the provision of long-term technical assistance for mutualistic
credit management would be financed by the cofinanciers (CFD, CIDA) and procured under their
own procurement procedures. Consultants and technical assistance personnel financed by the Bank



- 19 -
will be selected in accordance with Bank guidelines. Studies, training and audits are included in that
category.
4.11         Incremental operating costs, including costs related to staff travel, vehicle operation
and maintenance, office equipment and supplies, given their nature, would not be subject to
competitive bidding. However, strict budgetary and expenditure control would be applied. The use
of project vehicles would be recorded on logbooks ("Carnets de bord'). All expenses under this
category would be fully investigated during audits and IDA supervision missions.
4.12         Local Competitive Bidding would include local advertising, eligibility of foreign
bidders, public opening of bids and award to the lowest bidder. A n- nnmum of four bids will be
required. Procurement procedures for IDA-financed works and goods contracts and bidding packages
estimated to cost over US$100,000, as well as technical assistance, wouled be subject to prior review
by IDA as would the award of the contract. Works, goods, and services for contracts below
US$100,000 and above US$20,000 would be subject to ex-post review in accordance with paragraphs
three and four of Annex 1 of the Guidelines. Random ex-post review for goods, works, and services
contracts below US$20,000 would be made by Bank staff on supervision missions and during annual
audits and based on certified Statements of Expenditures (SOEs).
4.13         Procurement information would be collected and included in the semi-annual progress
reports to be prepared by the project management so as to update cost estimates and timing of
procurement actions. In particular, various aggregate amounts and ceilings would be monitored.
Prompt reporting of contract award information would also be realized and a Project Completion
Report (PCR) would be prepared within six months of the Credit closing date. Submission to IDA of
finalized Standard Bidding Documents found acceptable by IDA to be used for IDA-financed goods
would be a condition of effectiveness (para 7.02 (f)).

k/ IDA financing of operating costs for eligible expenditures will start at 55% until 12/31/96.  IDA
financing of operating costs for eligible expenditures will continue at the level of 30% from 1/1/97 only if
an institutional framework satisfactory to IDA has been put in pLace for the Network (Condition of
Disbursement; para 7.03).
4.15          To facilitate project execution, a Special Account equivalent to US$300,000
representing about 4 months of expenditures would be opened in the Caisse Autonome
d'Amortissement (CAA). The terms and conditions for operating this account were agreed during
negotiations. This account would be replenished by IDA against documented expenditures and upon
receipt of withdrawal applications. Disbursements would be fully documented except for contracts
and expenditures valued at less than US$20,000 equivalent, in which case statements of expenditure
(SOEs) would be used. Documentation would be held for review by IDA supervision missions and
verification by external auditors. IDA would not honor direct payment requests below US$20,000
equivalent.
E.    Financial Management. Accounts. Audits and Reporting
4.16          The Central Management Unit would be responsible for overall fimancial management
of the project. It would also maintain accounts, prepare disbursement applications, and manage
project funding for all components.
4.17          In order to accelerate financial viability of the Network, operating costs at local, RSU
and CMU levels would be closely monitored. Detailed budgets of local CREPs, RSUs and CMU
would be approved by ANAC-CI and submitted to IDA for final approval prior to the beginning of
each implementation year (para 7.01 (c)). The project accounts would classify expenditures by
component for budgetary and management control purposes. There would be tight physical control of
vehicles and equipment. Project accounts would be audited according to international standards
acceptable to IDA. The auditors would be required to express an opinion on the reliability of SOE
procedures, the legitimacy of expenditures made out of the Special Account, the utilization of goods
and services financed under the Credit, and the standards for record keeping and internal controls.
The audited accounts and reports would be submitted to IDA no later than six months after the end of



- 22 -
the financial year (December 31). Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations (para
7.01 (b)).
4.18         Managing bodies at the CREPs level (Conseil d'Administration, Comite de Crddit,
Comite de Surveillance) would be responsible for monitoring project implementation, including
physical, institutional and financial objectives. They would be assisted in these tasks by the Regional
Service Units. With assistance from the Central Management Unit, each Regional Service Unit would
prepare semi-annual progress reports assessing progress (physical, institutional, budgetary) against
agreed annual programs of operations and targets.
V. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
A.    Implementation Arrangements
5.01         The Government of Cote d'Ivoire through its Ministry of Economy, Finance and
Planning would be responsible for ensuring that the project is carried out in accordance with the
Development Credit Agreement. Until the setting up of a regulatory framework by BCEAO, CREPs
and COOPECs would continue to operate under the current legislative framework (the 1977
Cooperative law). They would retain their current statutes but their by-laws would be modified to
introduce greater transparency and accountability in management. Overall project management and
implementation (Ane 8 would be carried out by the Central Management Unit in accordance with
principles established by ANAC-CI. However, until the Mid-Term Review, when the permanent
institutional set-up of the Network is decided, ANAC-CI's Board of Directors (the former National
Committee of CREP Presidents) would essentially have an advisory role and not a full involvement in
day-to-day activities carried out under the project. This prudent approach has been chosen to: (a)
avoid the creation of a complex federative structure from the start; (b) give the Network and its
members time to reflect on its desired future structure; and (c) allow the CMU, supported by
expatriate management, to carry out the much needed but painful initial 'clean-up" (closure of non-
viable CREPs) and do away with past management practices. In the meantime, the CMU and ANAC-
CI would be required to launch a detailed study on the various options for the Network's future
institutional structure and submit its recommendations to IDA before the Mid-Term Review. In the
event of a disagreement between ANAC-CI and the CMU, the Project Monitoring Committee would
be called upon to give its advice.
5.02         The CMU would, in time, evolve into the Technical Secretariat of the National
Federation. This Unit would oversee activities undertaken by Regional Service Units which would
have responsibility for specific training programs, credit policies and savings mobilization efforts at
local level. The CMU would be responsible for determining, in agreement with ANAC-CI, the
closing and opening of CREPs, implementing training programs, publicity and awareness campaigns
at the national level, collecting and centralizing data and statistics on parameters reflecting the
Network's development, and managing the project's human, physical and financial resources. It
would also be responsible for the management of excess liquidity, ensuring that prudential ratios are
met and undertaking financial and administrative inspection of all CREPs. Formal establishment of
both the CMU and RSUs with terms of reference acceptable to IDA, would be a condition of
effectiveness (para 7.02 (g)).



- 23 -
5.03         Implementation and management at the local CREP level would be done through three
separate bodies: (a) a Board of Directors (Conseil d'Administration) comprising five to seven
members and elected by the membership; (b) a Credit Committee (Comite de Credit) comprising three
to five members in charge of implementing the credit policy and assessing creditworthiness of
applicants; and (c) a Surveillance Committee (Comite de Surveillance) comprising three members, in
charge of financial control. These bodies would function in accordance with the guidelines and rules
established by ANAC-CI, revised by-laws and statutes and the Statement of Operational Policies
(SOP). In each CREP, a manager (gerant) would be responsible for day-to-day management of the
CREP. He/She would be identified by the local CREP Board of Directors and selected after an
assessment of his/her skills level and references by the Regional Service Unit. Finally, the Project
Monitoring Committee headed by the Ministry of Finance - including of representatives of BCEAO,
the Network and concerned ministries - would be established. Formal establishment of this
committee would be a condition of effectiveness (para 7.02 (h)).
B.    Annual Work Programs
5.04         Annual work programs would be prepared by the CMU in conjunction with the RSUs
and based on targets and objectives set out by ANAC-CI. The work programs would include: (a)
progress to date; (b) the work program of each regional service unit for the coming year; (c)
timetable for the opening and/or closing of CREPs; and (d) the preparation of appropriate budgets.
The work programs would be fine-tuned during IDA supervision missions. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that draft work programs would be submitted to IDA for comments and approval
before Jur.e 30 of each year. After taking into account IDA's comments, the Central Management
Unit would submit the revised work program to IDA for final review and approval by September 30
of each year (para 7.01 (c)). With regard to training activities, submission to IDA of a detailed
training program (Annex 9) for the first year, and an outline for subsequent years would be a
condition of disbursement against training activities (para 7.04).
C.    Monitoring and Evaluation
5.05         The CMU would have primary responsibility for overall monitoring and evaluation of
the project. This unit would be supervised by ANAC-CI and twice a year by the Project Monitoring
Committee. This monitoring unit would be the primary vehicle through which the Government would
have effective oversight on project activities. IDA would also undertake two full supervision missions
each project year (Annex 10.
5.06         Mid-Term Review. A Mid-Term Review would be undertaken at the end of PY3
(1996) to confirm or improve the orientations of project activities. In this regard, a number of key
performance indicators to be assessed were agreed on at negotiations. The review would cover, inter
alia: (a) progress in the development of the Network including its institutional set-up; (b) evaluation
of the consultants' performance; and (c) overall project performance against key performance
indicators (Annex 1IL

VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS
A.    Benefits
6.01         The project would support the Government's efforts to develop an efficient, low cost,
grassroots financial intermediation system responding to rural populations' needs that the formal
banking system would be unable or unwilling to service even in the medium to long-term. An
efficient CREP/COOPEC network would provide rural dwellers with much needed deposit
safekeeping services and with access to short and medium-term fmancing of productive and social
expenses, thereby improving rural incomes and living conditions. It would also help mobilize and
recycle rural savings for productive purposes throughout the economy.
B.    Risks
6.02         The main risk of the project lies in the fragility of the existing network. In fact,
many rural dwellers have been reluctant to join the CREP movement in part due to misinformation or
the perception that the movement was an arm of the Government or belonged to few village elders.
To reduce this risk, considerable efforts would be deployed in the area of sensitization, awareness
Campaigns, and training. The withdrawal of the Government from the supervision and management
of the Network would also reduce this risk. Another risk concerns the low level of familiarity by
current CREP managers and administrative bodies with sound financial practices. This risk would be
minimized through training and close supervision from both the central and regional management
units and clearly spelled-out operational policies and procedures. A final risk concerns the specificity
of the CREP membership which in the past consisted mostly of farmers, and, therefore, made the
Network vulnerable to the cyclical pressures (infrastructural, marketing and financial) often found in
the agricultural sector. To minimize this risk, the resource base of CREPs would be enlarged by
actively seeking membership from a large variety of rural dwellers (civil servants, traders, craftsmen,
etc.) to reduce the variability of deposits associated with agricultural incomes.
VII. ASSURANCES. CONDMTIONS AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01   Assurances obtained during negotiations
(a)    Responsibility for daily project management would be entrusted to the Central Management
Unit (para 3.12);
(b)   audited accounts and the audit reports would be submitted to IDA within six months of the
end of each fiscal year (para 4.17);
(c)    detailed programs of operations and budgets would be submitted annually to IDA for review
and approval (paras. 4.17, 5.04); and
(d)    a Mid-Term Review would be undertaken by December 31, 1996 (para 5.06).



-25 -
7.02   Conditions of Effectiveness
(a)    Statement of Operational Policies (SOP) by ANAC-CI has been received and found acceptable
by the Association (para 3.05);
(b)   recruitment of all technical assistance staff and key project personnel on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA (para 3.14);
(c)    opening of a project account by the Government and evidence of initial deposit of CFAF 100
million (para 4.05);
(d)   signing of a Subsidiary Credit Agreement acceptable to IDA between the Government and
ANAC-CI for relending IDA funds to the Network on standard IDA terms (para 4.06);
(e)   effectiveness of the CFD loan and the FAC and CIDA grants (para 4.06)
(t)   submission of Standard Bidding Documents found acceptable by IDA to be used for IDA-
financed goods (para 4.13);
(g)   formal establishment of CMUI and RSUs with responsibilities acceptable to IDA (para 5.02);
and
(h)    establishment of the Project Monitoring Committee (para 5.03).
7.03   Condition of Disbursement against OIerating Costs as of 01/01/1997. Institutional and
organizational structure for the Network acceptable to IDA (para 4.14).
7.04   Condition of Disbursement against Training Activities. Submission to IDA of a document
presenting the main orientation of the training program to be carried out during the project,
and the detailed training program for the first year (para 5.04).
7.05   Recommendation. With the above agreements, the project would be suitable for an IDA
credit of SDR 1.5 million equivalent to the Republic of C6te d'Ivoire on standard IDA terms, with 40
years maturity.

LETTRRE DE POLfITQUE DU GOUVERNEMENT
SUR LE RERABILIrATION ET LA PROMOTION
DES CAISSES D'EPARGNE ET DE FRETS
}NTRODUCTION
Le Gouvernement a trac6 dans son programme I moyen terme et danm les programmes setoriels,
concernant notamment I'agriculture et le secteur financier, les gmndes orientations de politique economique qui
visent k redonner I la C6te d'Ivoire un taux de croissance positif de 5% a l'horizon 1995.
IA mobilisation de 1'pargne int6rieure, la consolidation de la contribution de l'agiiculture a la
richesse nationale, la couverture des besoins d'epargne et de cr&dit des populations rurales constituent des axes
d'actions prioritaires de ces differents programmes.
Dbs la liquidationde la Banque Nationale de D6veloppement Agncole (BNDA), decid6e en Octobre
1991, danm le cadre du progamme d'ajustement structurol du secteur financier (PASFI), les Autorit6s se sont
souci6es de trouver les moyens de preserver les acquis de la banque dans la coUecte des dEpats et d'assurer la
poursuite des financements qui se rdalisaient par son intermediaire.
En matiere de financement des filieres agricoles orgards6es, il est fait appel a un systTme mettant
en relations les principaux intervenants, le systame bancaire, ainsi que des baifleurs de fonds pour le financement
des investissements.
Pour la collecte de l'epargne et la couverture des besoins de credits, le Gouvernement a retenu
les orientations faisant suite I une Etude entreprise conjoitement par le Centre hIternational de Credit Mutuel
(France) et la Societe iternationale Desjardins (Canada) visant le developpement d'un r6seau a base mutualiste. Des
bailleurs de fonds tels que le Canada, la France et la Banque Mondiale ont marque leur interet pour ce projet I
1'elaboration duquel ils ont ete associes.
La presente lettre de politique generale decrit, apres un rappel des principes d'organisation, les
objectifs de developpement du reseau, l'organisation et les moyens mis en oeuvre, les besoins de financement et
leur couverture, les modalitds d'intvention de l'Etat. Le cadre geEr ainsi trace garde cependant un carctre
evolutif de maniere I permettre les adaptations qui apparitront necessaires pour assurer la viabiite du reseau.

I - P}UNCIPES GENERAUX DE DEVELOPPEMENT DU RESEAU
Les principes selon lesquels doit se developper et fonctionner le systame de cr&lit mutuel visant
A favoriser l'interm6diation financiere en milieu rural ont 6te6 nonces dans le releve de conclusions du 28 mars 1992
faisant suite a une rencontre entre les autorites de la Cote d'Ivoire, les bailleurs de fonds et le op&rateurs qui se
proposent pour r6habiliter et d6velopper le reseau. Ces principes se resument ainsi:
-      Autonomie des institutions pour leur gestion, leurs operations, le recrutement de leur personnel
et pour leur 6quilibre financier. L'Etat exerce son role de tutelle gen6ral, dans le cadre des dispositions Idgales et
reglementaires.
-      Intervention coordonnee des operateurs: elle se realise en concertation avec les autorit6s, sans qu'il
y ait exclusivite.
-      Developpement du r6seau en vue d'obtenir une couverture nationale, tout en respectant l'equilibre
financier a terme des implantations.
-      Organisation du reseau selon une demarche f&edrative souple, avec un appui exterieur initial centre
sur la formation de maniere a permettre une prise en charge graduelle par les organes responsables.
-      Rattachement au cadre r6glementaire actuel pour ce qui est du statut des caisses et de leurs
op6rations, avant de les placer sous le cadre r6glementaire qui est en voie d'elaboration par la BCEAO.
I - OBJECTIFS DE DEVELOPPEMENT DU RESEAU
Le projet vise la rehabilitation de caisses qui existent et a l'ouverture de nouvelles caisses sur
1'ensemble du territoire, avec des objectifs globaux de collecte d'epargne et de credits.
1 -    La rehabilitation concernera les caisses jugees viables apres examen de leur situation qui a deja
§te entrepris.
Une premitre evaluation Aaisse penser que 19 fermetures sont a prevoir. Grace a des mesures
approprides de formation et d'appui, quelque 65 autres pourraient etre maintenues.
2 -    L'ouverture de 88 caisses nouveUles est prevue pour les 5 ans A venir. Des projets de localisation
ont deja ete etablis. Cependant, l'implantation sera decidde sur la base d'enquetes socio-economiques conduites par
les operateurs du projet.
3 -    Les objectifs susceptibles d'etre atteints, au bout de 5 ans sont chiffres A 5,7 rnilliards de FCFA
pour la collecte de l'epargne. Une part des sommes collectees sra utilisee pour la mise en place de crEdits, I'autre
partie fera l'objet de placements de tresorerie.
Le nombre des adherents passerait de 15.000 actuellement it 113.000 en 1998/99, effectif qui
correspondait a celui des deposants de l'ex BNDA.
I][ - STRUCTURES ET ORGANISATION DU RESEAU
1 -    Selon les principes de gestion et responsabilitEs d6centralisEs du crEdit mutuel, le rdseau
s'organisera selon une structure pyramidale qui se mettra progressivement en place:



Annex 3
Page 3 of 4
-      Caisses locales, denommtes Caisses Rurales d'Epargne et de Prets (CREP), institutions de base
autonome, auxquelles les soci6taires adharent par la souscription d'une part sociale de 3.000 FCFA. Chaque
caisse est dirigee par un Conseil avec un Prdsident qui la reprdsente.
-      Association Nationale des CREP et COOPEC de C6te d'Ivoire (ANAC-CI), & laquelle les CREP
adherent. L'ANAC-CI fixe les principes de fonctionnement du r6seau des CREP. Elle constitue egalement
l'organe de representation du reseau, en particulier aupr?as des pouvoirs publics.
-      Structure d'appui, ddnommee Unite centrale de gestion, qui prefigure la Caisse centrale du reseau
qui pourra 8tre cr66e lorsque celui-ci aura atteint une taille suffisante.
-      L'Unit6 centrale de gestion agit dans le cadre de pouvoirs qui lui sont delegu6s par l'ANAC-CI.
Dans la phase de depart, l'Unite centrale jouera un role d6terminant dans l'implantation du reseau, I'appui
et le contrkle des caisses, la formation des responsables et des gestionnaires. Elle sera chargde de la gestion
des fonds relatifs au projet et de leur emploi. Elle recueillera 6galement les exc6dents des Caisses pour les
placer.
L'Unite centrale de gestion mettra en place des D6legations regionales, qui seront au nombre de
six (KORHOGO, BOUAKE, MAN, GAGNOA, ABIDJAN EST, ABIDJAN OUEST). Dans une premiere phase,
ce seront les structures d'appui, dependant de l'UniR 1 centrale de gestion, chargees, en particulier, de la formation
et de la promotion dans leur zone de competence.
2 -    Le reseau sera appuy6, dans sa phase initiale, par un dispositifd'assistance technique qui sera mis
en place par le CICM et la SDID selon les dispositions d'un contrat d'operateurs passd avec l'Etat.
La dur6e des missions d'assistance technique est pr6vue pour 3 ans au maximum. Le relais par
des cadres ivoiriens devrait intervenir dans ce delai a l'echelon des unites r6gionales, en raison du fort accent qui
sera mis sur la formation. Exceptionnellement, 1 ou 2 assistants techniques pourraient etre tnaintenus sur une
p6riode de 5 ans au maximum.
W - BESOIN DE FINANCEMENT ET COUVERTURE
1 -    Les coilts lidsa  la rehabilitation et au d6veloppement du reseau ont ete chiffres a 5 milliards sur
5 ans.
Le financement de ces coOts pourfa etre assure pour une large part grace a des contributions
ext6rieures pour lesquelles des accords pr6alables ont deji ete recueillis.
Pour sa part, I'Etat assumera les charges inh6rentes aux taxes douanieres et fiscales selon les rbgles
fix6es par la reglementation concermant les op6rations financ6es sur concours exterieurs.
Les dons seront reverses au reseau, par l'entremise de l'ANAC-CI. Les prets seront retroc&eds
au reseau, par le biais d'un accord I passer avec I'ANAC-CI, aux conditions concessionnelles qui sont faites a
l'Etat.
V - APPUIS ET ENGAGEMENTS DE L'ETAT
1 - Dispositif institutionnel
Les dispositions de la loi 77-332 relative au statut de la coopdration ainsi que les D6crets
d'application subs6quents forment le cadre juridique des Caisses d'epargne et de credit (CREP, COOPEC).

elabore I l'6chelon de l'UMOA.
2 - Instances de representation et de concertation
a)     L'ANAC-CI, constituee par les CREP et COOPEC qui devront y adherer, sera reconnue comme
l'organe representatif du r6seau. Elle fixera les orientations du reseau.
A ce titre, elle sera appel6e a produire une lettre de politique gendrale, en harmonie avec les
dispositions enonc6es dans la lettre de politique de developpement arr8tee par les pouvoirs publics.
L'ANAC-CI sera l'instance de concertation avoc les pouvoirs publics. La concertation portera sur
les conditions de d6veloppement et de fonctionnement du reseau, dans le cadre de rencontres qui auront au moins
deux fois I'an avec les services du Ministere charg6 des Finances et du Ministbre charg6 de l'Agriculture.
b)     Un Comit6 National de suivi du CrEdit Mutuel sera institua.
11 so composera des representants de l'Adiniistration, du reseau, de la BCEAO ainsi que des
Opdrateurs.

RURAL SAVINGS AND LOANS REHABILITATION AND PROMOTION PROJECT
IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
1.     PMC:          A Project Monitoring Committee (PMC), headed by the Ministry of Finance and
made of representatives BCEAO, the Network and other concerned ministries would
be responsible for overall monitonng and guidance to the Network. This monitoring
unit would be the primary vehicle through which the Government would have a 'droit
de regard' over project activities. It would be responsible for overall Monitoring and
guidance to the Network. The Monitoring Committee would also be called to give
advice in the event of a disagreement between ANAC-CI and the CMU.
2.     ANAC-CI:       ANAC-CI would be primarily responsible for defining the overall policy of the
Network, providing guidance to and supervising the Central Management Unit.
ANAC-CI would delegate part of its management powers to the CMU. Until the mid-
term review, time at which the permanent institutional set-up of the network is
decided, the ANAC-CI would essentially have an advisory role.
3.     CMU:          The Central Management Unit (CMU) would, in time, evolve into the Technical
Secretariat of the National Federation. This Unit would oversee activities undertaken
at the level of regional service units from where, specific training programs and credit
policies and savings mobilization efforts would be driven. The CMU would be
respoible for determining, in agreement with ANAC-CI, the closing and opening of
CREPs, designing training programs, implement publicity and awareness campaigns at
the national scale, collecting and centralizing data and statistics on the network's
development, and managing the project's human, physical and financial resources.
The CMU would also be responsible for the management of excess liquidity, ensuring
that prudential ratios are met and undertakng financial and administrative inspection
of all CREPs.
4.     RSU:           Regional Service Units (RSU) would provide timely supervision and support to
CREPs in their immediate geographical area. These regional service units would be
decentralized implementing 'arms' of the CMU. As such, they would be responsible
for the management and supervisory functions of the project in their area. In
particular, they would promote and assist in the creation of new CREPs, provide
training to members, ensure that all prudential ratios are met, see that the loan
portfolio is in good standing and, during the restructuring phase and beyond, make
sure that important efforts at loan recovery are made.
5.     CREPs'
BOARD OF
DIRECTORS:  Each CREP has a Board of Directors composed of 5 to 7 members installed after
voting by a General Assembly. Each member can only stay a Board member not
more than three years. The Board of Directors is responsible for (a) deciding on
membership approval or dismissal, (b) nominating or dismissing the CREP managers;
(c) to set or modify interest rates after consultations with the CMU; (d) to manage the
CREP's financial account, and (e) assure proper management of the CREP. Members
of the Board of Directors do not receive any salary or supplemental payments.

6.     CREPs' CC:   The Credit Committee (CC) is comprised of 3 to 5 members. This committee is in
charge of: (a) implementing the credit policy and ensuring credit worthiness of
applicants and; (b) monitoring the granting and repayment of loans.
7.     CREPs' SC:   The Surveillance Committee (SC), comprised of 3 members chosen after a vote by the
General Assembly, would be responsible for ensuring financial discipline amongst
CREP managers and Board members. This Committee would ensure that the CREP
is managed in accordance with guidelines established in the statutes, by-laws and by
the NCP. The Surveillance Committee would meet four times a year to perform ad-
hoc inspection of the CREP's books and accounts. In the event of mismanagement,
the SC would report directly to the RSU and the CMU.
