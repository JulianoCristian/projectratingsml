In order to ensure long-term\n            sustainability and financial independence of the movement,\n            project efforts will focus on rural savings mobilization. To\n            meet the above objectives, the project will include the\n            following components: (a) rehabilitation and development of\n            local CREPs; (b) support to regional service units (RSUs);\n            and (c) support to the central management unit (CMU)."}, "docdt": "1994-03-02T00:00:00Z"}
