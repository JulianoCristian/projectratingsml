MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
FOR A RURAL SAVINGS AND LOANS REHABILITATION AND PROMOTION PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the followiug memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed credit to the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire for SDR 1.5 million, the equivalent of US$2.2
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a Rural Savings and Loans
Rehabilitation and Promotion Project.
2.           Economic Background. Since the early 1980s, Cote d'lvoire has faced several fiscal
and balance of payment crises. They reflected not only inadequate macroeconomic policies but also
more fundamental distortions in trade, finance, public sector, and pricing policies, thereby adversely
affecting the efficient allocation of resources and constraining sectoral growth prospects. The
Government has responded by adopting various stabilization and adjustment programs which were
supported by the IMF and the World Bank. In the context of these prograins, the Government has
sought to correct its macroeconomic imbalances and the increasing lack of international
competitiveness through internal adjustment.
3.           The strategy of interrnl adjustment was also at the core of the Government's medium-
term economic framework (MTF), adopted in 1991, which spelled out structural reforms aimed at
restoring international competitiveness and returning to a path of sustainable growth. To attain this
objective the Government has pursued tight fiscal and monetary policies, and implemented reforms in
the areas of trade and finance. Moreover, the Government has initiated a privatization process,
involving about 50 public enterprises, and sought to strengthen human resource development. The
MTU was supported by three SECALs of the World Bank and a stand-by arrangement of the IMF. In
addition, the World Bank has approved three technical assistance credits to support the Government in
implementing its ecoa1omic reforms, privatization program, and human resources development
program.
4.           Despite progress in implementing key parts of the economic program, recent
economic developments show that the Ivorian economy continues to suffer from substantial fiscal and
balance of payments imbalances and considerable structural rigidities. As these macroeconomic
imbalances persisted, the economic decline observed since 1986 was not reversed. With investment
levels hovering around 10 percent during the early 1990s, stagnant export receipts for the country's
main export products, cocoa and coffee, and stagnant industrial production, real GDP fell, on
average, by about 1 percent per year during 1990-93. Faced with this difficult economic situation, the
Government therefore decided, in close consultation with its partner countries in the CFA zorte, to
complement the on-going internal adjustment efforts with a realignment of the parity of the CFA franc
to the equivalent of 100 CFA to 1 PP, with the effect from Janmary 12, 1994.
5.           With the re-alignment of the CFA franc, the Government has reformulated its
medium-term adjustment program in a Policy Framework Paper (PFP) for the 1994-96 period which
will be circulated to the Board shortly. During that time, this program aims to (i) raise the rate of
growth to about 6 percent beginning from 1996, (ii) achieve primary surpluses in the Government's
budget, (iii) strengthen external competitiveness through trade, price, and regulatory reform, (iv) seek
debt relief from official bilateral and commercial creditors at concessional terms, and (v) intensify
human resource development and expand poverty alleviation measures with a view to protecting the
most vulnerable groups during the adjustment period.



- 2 -
6.           It is expected that, with the implemertation of the Government's program, the
recession will be halted and the country will return to a path of positive real growth rates in 1994,
accelerating to annual rates of 5 percent and higher from 1995 onwards. The recovery will be led by
a sustained increase of investment levels. This increase will come in response to the anticipated
implementation of structural reforms in such areas as trade, finance, and the labor market, thereby
instilling investors' confidence in the Ivorian economy. Moreover, private investmert will be
increasingly geared toward non-traditional export activities, a key sector which is expected to grow
rapidly in the wake of the devaluation and to be a major source for new employment opportunities.
7.           Seor Background. In Cote d'lvoire, as in most other African countries, commercial
banks have shied away from providing adequate financial services to the rural populations. Although
the main commercial banks have established branches in most urban centers outside Abidjan, their
prime interest has been essentially to mobilize deposits, and, to a limited extent, cater to credit needs
of well established clients mostly in commerce, small industries, etc. Their reluctance to lend to
farmers and rural dwellers is due to the perceived high risks and administrative costs of this activity
and to the fact that these costs cannot be fully covered by interest rates banks can charge, thereby
affecting the margins these bancs can earn. It is estimated that in 1990 less than four percent of total
lending by Formal Financial Intermediaries (FFIs) was in support of agriculture, with the now defunct
National Agricultural Development Bank (BNDA) accounting for more than three quarters of credit to
agriculture. In view of this situation, the Goverunnent has taken steps to promote rural savings and
loans coope.ratives (CREPsICOOPECs)1 tha; would respond to the financial needs of rural dwellers in
areas where commercial banks have been reluctant to operate.
8.           Given the importance of developing a rural financial institution which caters
efficiently to the needs of rural populations, the Bank, jointly with the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA), started the preparation of a Pilot CREP Rehabilitation Project in
1988/1989 to be implemented in the Man Region. This pilot project, hlter entrusted to the Canadian
Societe Desjardins (SDID), was to promote the development of a CREP/COOPEC network that
would: (a) be based on growth from grassroots level; and (b) emphasize savings mobilization. At
about the same time, the French International Center for Mutual Credit (CICM) decided to resume its
assistance to the CREP/COOPEC Network (the Network) with funding from the French Cooperation
Fund (FAC). Both SDID and CICM were then mandated by the Government to promote, through a
joint effort, the development of a grassroots-type rural savings network.
9.           With CIDA financing, implementation of the pilot operation started in 1990. In the
first seven months of its operatioi. s, SDID undertook a thorough diagnosis of the status of each of the
twelve CREPs in the Man region. Four CREPs were retained for immediate rehabilitation, operations
of a further three were suspended (to be resumed provided certain conditions, related essentially to
recovery of loans, changes in management and organizational structure), and the remaining five were
liquidated. The pilot project also undertook sensitization of CREP members, training of its managers
and members, and initiated actions for the establishment of three or four new CREPs within the
region. In 1990, CICM resumed its activities after a six-year absence. The major focus of CICM's
activi.ies has been on carrying out the diagnosis of the financial structure and management of
individual CREPs and the establishment and management of a national "Caisse Centrale des
CREPs/COOPECs', located in Abidjan, to carry out inspections and manage excess liquidity (CREPs
I CREPs (Caisses Rurales d'Epargne et de Prets) are found in rural areas; COOPECs (Cooperatives
d'Epargne et de Credit) are found in semi-urban and urban areas. Both are part of the same network (RSseau
CREP/COOPEC) and operate along the same rules, regulations and management.



- 3 -
and COOPECs have a reserve requirement of 40% of their deposits). CICM has assisted in the
opening of about 20 new CREPs, and in tht closing of ten CREPs that were not performing.
10.         PrQject ibje.ivM. The project would help revitalize the CREP/COOPEC movement
by rehabilitating existing CREPs and assisting in the creation of new ones, where justified. To thir
end, it would capitalize on results achieved during the pilot operation by: (a) establishing a
satisfactory institutional structure for the movement and completing the financial restructuring process
by rigorously implementing a loan recovery program and systematically closing down non-viable
CREPs; (b) providing technical assistance and training to the CREP members and managers in
accounting and basic financial management to ensure satisfactory management of individual CREPs;
and (c) funding awareness campaigns to restore populations confidence, stress the private nature of
the Network and its total independence from both the Government and the now-defunct BNDA, a;id
get members to fully internalize the principles of the mutualisti. movement and have a suong sense of
ownership of the Network. In order to ensure long-term sustainability and financidl independenee of
the movement, one of the project's main thrusts would be to focus on rural savings mob1lization.
11.         Project Description. The project would consist of the following components:
(a)    Rehabilitation and Development of Local CREPs. Detailed audit and financial
restructuring of the 70 existing CREPs, improvement of their accounting system and
training of members and managers. Establishment of new CREPs nation-wide on the
basis of local market surveys and awareness campaigns (preliminary estimates indicate
that between 70 to 75 new CREPs could be created). The project would finance
CREPs' financial restructuring, equipment and operating costs;
(b)    Support to Regional Service Units (RSUs). Establishment of six Regional Service
Units (Korhego, Gagnoa, Bouake, Man, Abidjan-Est, Abidjan-Ouest) which would
provide timely supervision and support to local CREPs in their immediate
geographical area. These regional units would be responsible for the promotion and
supervisory functions ef the project in their area. In particular. they would promote
and assist in the creation of new CREPs, provide training to members, ensure that all
prudential ratios are met, see that the loan portfolio is in good standing, and, during
the restructuring phase and beyond, make sure that important efforts at loan recovery
are made; and
(c)    Support to the Central Management Unit (CMU). The project would support the
establishment of the CMU, on the basis of the unit already operating with CICM
support, to provide the Network with policy and operational guidance, manage CREPs
excess liquidity and supervise their activities and RSUs' activities. The project would
finance the necessary technical assistance to the CMU, and its investments and
operating costs.
12.         Projeet Costs and Financing. The total cost of the proposed project over the 1994-99
implementation period, including all incremental capital and recurrent expenditures, is estimated at
CFAF 9.5 billion (US$15.8 million), of which CFAF 6.5 billion (US$11 million) or 69.2 percent of
total costs in foreign exchange and about CFAF 450 million (US$0.8 million) or five percent in taxes
and duties. The French Caisse de Developpement (CFD), the French Cooperation Fund (FAC) and
the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) have already approved their share of project
funding. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are presented in Schedule



-4 -
B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations are given in
Schedule C and D respectively. A map is also attached.
13.          Project bIMlementation. The project will be implemened under the overall guidance
and monitoring of a Monitoring Commite, chaired by the Ministry of Economy, Finance and
Pinning, with representatives from other concerned ministries, the Banque Centrale des Etats de
l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO), the regional central bank, and of the Network. During the project's
first three years or until a regulatory framework is established for all rural financial cooperatives by
BCEAO, CREPs will continue to operate under the current legislative framework. They will retain
their current statutes, but their by-laws will be modified to introduce greater transparency apd
accountability in their management (separate Board, Credit and Surveillance Committees). Their
operational policies and procedures will be clearly spelled out and enforced (in particular with regard
to the nature of, and limits on, lending, and full loan recovery requirement). The RSUs and the
CMU will be established by the "Association Nationale des CREPs et COOPECs de C6te d'Ivoire"
(ANAC-CI) under a mandate and staffing acceptable to IDA. The CMU will be responsible for daily
project implementation. ANAC-CI will be primarily responsible for defining the overall policy of the
Network. It will provide guidance to the CMU and delegate part of it management powers to it.
Possible conflicts on policy issues between CMU and ANAC-CI's Board of Directors wi1l be referred
for advice to the Monitoring Committee. The desirability of formally establishing a National
Federation of CREPBs and COOPECs under revised comprehensive statutes would be reviewed during
the proposed Mid-Term Review, at the end of PY3. BCEAO is currently undertaking a review of
current institutional and regulatory arrangements for the management and supervision of mutualistic
savings and loans institutions. If and when new arrangements are approved, the Network would be
subjected to the new regulations. In the meantime, they will remain outside the purview of BCEAO.
14.          The financial restructring program is being prepared on the basis of a detailed
external audit of CREPs' financial situation as of December 31, 1992. The CMU is already carrying
out a review of: (a) the technical and managerial skills of CREPs directors and managers, and
defining a comprehensive staffing/training program; and (b) CREPs accountng and management
procedures in order to define a comprehensive overhau. program. The Network's operational policies
and procedures have been clearly defined in a Statement of Operational Policies (SOP). The
necessary external assistance at CMU (project director and training/development specialist) and RSU
(regional coordinators) levels is being provided by CICM and SDID. Each expatriate staff will have
a national counterpart staff. The advisability of reducing external technical assistance and transferring
full operational responsibilities to local counterparts will be studied during the Mid-Term Review.
External controls wil be carried out through annual external avdits of CREPs and project operations,
and through monitoring by the Monitoring Committee.
15.          Project SustainAility. Given the very limited startig resource base (CFAF 600
million in deposits), the prime objective of this first phase is fbr primary-level CREPs to achieve
financial break-even by the end of the project. The financial audit and restructuring carried out at the
beginning of the project would ensure that: (a) only potentially viable CREPs are retained; and (b) the
latter start from a sound financial situation. CREPs which could not become financially viable within
four years after project start-up or establishment would be closed down. On the basis of realistic
assumptions, it is projected that at least 60 out of the 70 existing CREPs would break even or
generate profits by project's end (the remaining CREPs being located in poorer areas would have a
slower growth in deposits), and that, collectively, the CREPs would finance up to 20 percent of the
total operating costs of RSUs/CMU (excluding technical assistahce).



- 5 -
16.          Lessons learned fron Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. Because the project will be
the first to be financed by IDA in the rural financial intermediation arena in COte d'Ivoire,
preparation efforts capitalized on experiences gained in other countries (Benin, Burkina Faso,
Rwanda, etc.) which have implemented similar operations. IDA also learned from experiences of the
pilot CREe operation. In particular, the need to build up the network from the grassroots, rather
than favoring the promotion of development banks funded through external lines of credit and/or
government resources, was stressed during project preparation. Other significant lessons incorporated
into the project design include measures to give the CREP network full autonomy over its
management and in the implementation of its activities regarding staffing, credit policy, and
anticipated growth targets as past government interference and inappropriate monitoring prevented the
movement to reach its full potential. Furthermore, important safegu.ards and measures to re-launch
the movement on a sound footing have been introduced during project preparation (revised statutes
and by-laws, new credit and personnel policies and a well-defined Statement of Operational Policies to
be adopted prior to project start). Still, it is also recognized that, for some time to come, important
resources and efforts would have to be directed towards training and sensitization of members.
During the project period, close supervision of financial management by CREP managers will be
frequent. Adherence to strict guidelines and internal procedures will also be monitored by RSUs and
the CMU.
17.          Rationale for IDA Involvement. Although IDA's financial contribution to the ptojec.
is relatively snall (15% of total costs net of taxes), its involvement in the project would be fully in
line widi the financial and agricultural sector reform programs it currently supports. It would also
ensure implementation of the project in accordance with policies and guidelines agreed by IDA, the
Government and ANAC-CI. A country assistance strategy (CAS) note is under preparation. It will
be included in a proposed Economic Recovery Credit, scheduled to be presented to the Executive
Directors in June. The CAS will point out that a functioning rural financial intermediation system is
key for the development of agriculture, Cote d'Ivoire's engine of growth.
18.          Ageements reached. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the
Government that: (a) the Network would adopt the SOP which will govern CREPs activities, in
particular their opening, closing and savings operations; (b) responsibility for daily project
management would be entrusted to the Central Management Unit; (c) annual detailed programs of
operations would be submitted to IDA for review and approval; and (d) a Mid-Term Review would
be undertaken by December 31, 1996. The following conditions would be fulfilled prior to Credit
effectiveness: (a) formal adoption of the SOP by ANAC-CI; (1) recruitment of all technical
assistance personnel and key project staff on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA; (c) opening of
a project account and evidence of the initial deposit of CFAF 100 million; (d) signing of a subsidiary
credit agreement between the Government and ANAC-CI on behalf of the Network; (e) effectiveness
of other donors' contributions (CFD, FAC, CIDA); (f) submission to IDA of Standard Bidding
Documents to be used for procurement of IDA-financed goods; (g) formal establishment of CMU and
RSUs under terms of reference acceptable to IDA; and (h) establishment of the Project Monitoring
Committee (PMC). Submission to IDA of a detailed training program for the first year and an
outline for subsequent years would be a condition of disbursement against training activities. The
setting up of an institutional and organizational structure for the CREP network acceptable to IDA
would be a conditicn of disbursement against operating costs as of January 1, 1997.
19.          Environmental Aspects. The project is classified under the environmental category C.
It is not expected to have a direct impact on the environment.



-6 -
20.          PrearamObjectives Category. The proposed project addresses both the Government's
and the Bank's antipoverty strategy through the implementation of actions designed to restore viable
financial institutions in rural areas and consequently help rural dwellers tackle their daily financial
needs.
21.          Project Benefits. The project would sunport the Government's efforts to develop an
efficient, low cost, grassroots rural financial intermediation system responding to rural populations'
needs that the formal banking system will be unable or unwilling to service even in the medium to
long-term. An efficient CREP/COOPEC Network will provide rural dwellers with much needed
deposit safekeeping services and access to short and medium-term financing for productive and social
expenses, thereby improving rural incomes and living conditions and reducing poverty. It will also
help mobilize and recycle rural savings for productive purposes throughout the economy.
22.          Risks. The main risk of the project lies in the fragility of the existing Network. In
tact, many rural dwellers have been reluctant to join the CREP movement in part due to
misinformation or the perception that the movement was an arm of the Government or belonged to
few village elders. To reduce this risk, considerable efforts will be deployed in the area of
sensitization, awareness campaigns, and training. The withdrawal of the Government from the
supervision and management of the Network would also reduce this risk. Another risk cw.;cerns the
low level of know-how by current CREP managers and administrative bodies of sound financial
practices. This risk will be minimized through training and close supervision from both the central
and regional management units and clearly spelled-out operational policies and procedures. A final
risk concerns the specificity of the CREP membership which in the past consisted mostly of farmers,
and, therefore, made the Network vulnerable to the cyclical pressures (infrastructural, marketing and
financial) often found in the agricultural sector. To miniiuize this risk, the resource base of CREPs
would be enlarged by actively seeking membership from a large variety of rural dwellers (civil
servants, traders, craftsmen, etc.) to reduce the variability of deposits associated with agricultural
incomes.
23.          Recommendato. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and therefore recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

Portfolio Assessment
The portfolio has been affected for some time by CMte dlIvoire's overall economic and financial
difficulties. A country ilmLementation review (CIR) took place in June 1993, during which generic
implementation issues, such as lack of counterpart funds, audit, disbursement and procurement issues were
discussee. Specific corrective actions in most of those areas have been agreed upon which shouLd help speed
up disburiements. Also, as a result of the recent devaluation of the CFA Franc and agreements with the IMf
on a new *.acro-economic program, IDA was able to release the second tranches of the FY91 SECALs; the
remaining tranches are expected to be released by April/May 1994.
