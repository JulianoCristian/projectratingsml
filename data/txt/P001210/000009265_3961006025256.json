rehabilitating\n            existing CREPs and assisting in the creation of new ones\n            where justified. To this end, it would capitalize on results\n            achieved during the pilot operation by: (a) completing the\n            rehabilitation process; (b) providing technical assistance\n            and training to the CREP/COOPEC membership in accounting and\n            basic financial management; and (c) funding awareness\n            campaigns designed to fully internalize the main principles\n            of the mutualistic movement and ensure a strong sense of\n            ownership from the members. In order to ensure long-term\n            sustainability and financial independence of the movement,\n            project efforts will focus on rural savings mobilization. To\n            meet the above objectives, the project will include the\n            following components: (a) rehabilitation and development of\n            local CREPs; (b) support to regional service units (RSUs);\n            and (c) support to the central management unit (CMU)."}, "docdt": "1994-03-02T00:00:00Z"}
