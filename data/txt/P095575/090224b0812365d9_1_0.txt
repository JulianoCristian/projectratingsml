Program Development Objectives
Program Development Objective (from Program Document)
The proposed Grant will provide critical resources to support elements of the Government Poverty Reduction Strategy in a manner that consolidates and deepens the
agenda set by the Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery series including progress made in governance, decentralization of government, management of public
resources and private sector-led economic growth. The grant will contribute to economic recovery and growth by providing foreign exchange resources for imports of
essential commodities, by providing financial resources to the Government budget to finance priority public expenditures and by supporting reforms to attract private
investment. By helping to close the financing gap in 2006, it will also contribute to maintaining macroeconomic stability and low inflation.
Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?
