Poverty Reduction Strategy\n            (PRS). The central goal for poverty in the PRS is a\n            restatement of the first Millennium Development Goal: by\n            2015 the proportion o f people whose income is less than one\n            dollar a day should be reduced to half the 1990 level o f 82\n            percent, from the current base of 70 percent in 2003/04.\n            This is to be achieved through a very ambitious growth rate\n            of 8-9 percent per annum. This growth rate, in turn, will be\n            promoted by actions to be taken under the three components\n            of the PRS: i) good governance, security and peace building;\n            ii) pro-poor sustainable growth for food security and job\n            creation; and iii) human development."}, "docdt": "2006-11-10T00:00:00Z"}
