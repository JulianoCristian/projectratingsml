satisfactory, sustainability as\n            likely, institutional development impact as modest, bank\n            performance as satisfactory, and borrower performance as\n            satisfactory. The main lessons learned from the project\n            include: 1) Policy implementation in a time of unstable\n            coalition governments is difficult, particularly if\n            implementation may involve legislative action. 2) The\n            accomplishment of project objectives can be successfully\n            materialized by the staff that has relevant knowledge,\n            experience, and high motivation. The training of the staff\n            has proven to be an effective investment which helped to\n            improve the staff performance and motivation of the\n            personnel. 3) One of the principal activities of the project\n            was the provision of job insertion training. Data on the\n            relevance of the training vis-a-vis training needs of\n            employers and the quality of the training providers are\n            lacking. There is a need for the development of a follow-up\n            longer term monitoring system. 4) Tripartite coordination\n            and coordination involving representatives of the interest\n            groups was crucial in especially determining the needs for\n            job insertion training. 5) There is a need for\n            prioritization of implementation activities and\n            deliverables. 6) Delays in implementation of especially\n            Automation Component indicates that planning of a time-table\n            should be made in a more realistic way taking into account\n            the project complexity."}, "docdt": "2001-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
