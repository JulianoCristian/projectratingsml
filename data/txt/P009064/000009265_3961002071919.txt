NEKORAxnDJ AND  OECO)QIENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TEE I8RD )TO THE E ECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO TIE REPUBLIC OF TRuKEY
FOR AN EMPLOTIENT AND TRAINING PROJECT
1.      I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent
of US$ 67.0 million to help finance an Employment and Training Project. The
loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate for a term of 17
years, including a grace period of five years.
2.      Ackgxound:  In 1980, following a serious external crisis, Turkey
embarked on a major economic reform program, which constituted a sharp break
from earlier policies of iAport substitution, market intervention, and
pervasive involvement of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in all sectors of
production. The reform program aimed to improve the efficiency of production
and allocation through greater reliance on competitive market forces. It
included measures intended to reduce public subsidies to the SOEs, to control
the fiscal deficit, and to simplify the trade regime -- thereby exposing
domestic producers to external competition. An underlying goal of the reform
effort Was to raise Turkey's competitiveness in European markets, thereby
bolstering Turkey's bid for European Community (EC) membership.
3.      These efforts produced results.  Real GDP growth averaged about 5
percent between 1980 and 1986, and exceeded 7 percent in 1986 and 1987. In
1988 there was a current account surplus for the first time in 15 years. But
the fiscal discipline which marked the early years of the reform gave way to a
more expansionary policy as the 1987 and 1991 elections approached. This
interruption of the reform process reversed many of the early achievements of
the reform.  By 1990, the current account deficit had returned, inflation
exceeded 60 percent, and SOBs continued to require massive operating
subsidies. Unemployment, which had risen earlier in the decade, abated -- to
an overall rate of 7.2 percent in 1990. Economic output grew at 9 percent in
1990, reflecting the combined effect of a tight monetary policy, expansionary
fiscal policy, and large foreign capital inflows. But the situation again
deteriorated in 1991 as public-sector borrowing requirements rose to 15
percent of GNP, output growth slowed to less than 1 percent, and the rate of
inflation rose to 70 percent.
4.      Following the October, 1991 elections, one of the first acts of the
new coalition Government was to confirm its commitment to the main goals and
policies of the reform strategy adopted in the early 1980s. But there has
been little progress in implementation of policies under this strategy.
Public enterprise reform is one key area requiring urgent government action.
Successful implementation of public enterprise reform is likely to require the
creation of suitable programs to train and redeploy workers who would be
displaced by the reform, as well as of programs to provide temporary income
support during the transition to new jobs.

5.      Prosect Obiectives:  The proposed project has four objectLves: a) to
improve allocative efficiency through diversified employment services, b) to
improve the absorption of unemployed, unskilled workers in productive
employment, c) to improve the efficiency of labor-market decisions by
providing better information on employment prospects and training requirements
by occupation, and on the skills of job seekers, and d) to promote women's
productive employment.
6.      PrjjSt De8¢rjptnim: To support the objectives listed above, the
Project would support: a) the generalization of the Turkish Employment
Agency's (IA ve ZgVI BYum8 Rurumu, or IIBK) pllot program of job-insertion
trairing for the unskilled unemployed (US$ 42.8 million)31- h) the development
and initial implementation of a strategy for provision of employment services
by a range of public and private providers (USS 0.3 million), c) the
improvement of employment services in IIBK, including the development of
employment counseling and applicant screening and their integration with
IIBK's existing job placement services ($ 40.4 million), d) the development
and dissemination of improved labor-market information, iL  X aliI, as an
input to activity c, above ($2.6 million), e) the development of employer-
relevant occupational standards and certification ($ 3.6 million), and f) an
action and research program to promote women's productive employment ($1.4
million).
7.      Proka        Ilementation: IIBK would be the main implementation agency
for the Project, but four other agencies would also have implementation
responsibilities. The Labor-Market Information component would be implemented
by the State Institute of Statistics (SIS); the Occupational Standards and
Certification component would be implemented by the Foundation for Promotion
of Vocational Training and Small Industries (MERSA/ATH8), under the policy
guidance of the Occupational Standards Commission (MSK); the research program
on Women's Employment would be implemented by the Directorate for the Status
and Problems of Women (DSPW) in the Prime Minister's office; and the schools
counseling component would be implemented by the Ministry of Education (MOE)
in close consultation with IIBK.
8.      To ensure the timely implementation of scheduled project activities,
a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) would be established at IIBK. The
integrated nature of the project requires close coordination and monitoring
across the public and private agencies involved, as well as within the IIBK.
To achieve this coordination, the project would finance technical assistance
for project management in the PCU.
9.      RatLiaMle for Bank Involvement:  The rationale for Bank involvement
is that, by supporting liberalized and more efficient labor markets, the
Project would complement the support which the Bank has provided over the past
decade for economic reforms designed to improve Turkey's competitiveness
abroad. The project would also strengthen basic employment services for
unWkilled job seekers, many of whom are poor. The Bank is well situated to
support the proposed project initiatives because of the knowledge of sector
'P@toJot aost  pbst" tshout this pWaio ispas    bae. cost (act of castamie").



3
issues and institutions which it has gained from past lending and sector work.
The Bank collaborated with the State Planning Organization (SPO) in conducting
a broad-ranging sector study or employment and training policy in 1990. The
study identified the Issues which the Project would address, and developed the
strategy for dealing with them.
10.     Ennironmental IMpt:  The project is not expected to have negative
environmental impacts. Accordingly, the project has been placed in
environmental screening category "C", which does not require any environmental
analysis. The occupational standards which are to be developed under the
occupational standards and certification component are to include occupational
safety and health aspects of work in particular occupations.
11.     A.reemt &2ached:  Several actions are proposed to assure
successful implementation of the project and attainment of the broader project
objectives.  During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that:
(a) unless specifically agreed by the Bank in advance, loan funds are
to be made available only for training: a) consistent with annual
training plans developed by the local employment office and
endorsed by the local tripartite Employment Council and National
Employment Council, b) providing flexible entry and exit for
trainees, c) not exceeding a maximum unit cost per participant of
US$ 600 or an individual contract value of US$ 10,000 or as
subsequently agreed by the Government and the Bank, and d)
requiring training providers to meet specified goals for job
placement of trainees (except for self-employment training).
(b) it will: i) conduct a study on private employment services under
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, commencing not later
than September 1, 1993; il) discuss the findings and
recommendations of the study at a national seminar, to be held
not later than September 1, 1994, and to include representatives
of the Government, employers, employees, and public and private
bodias concerned with Turkey's national development strategy;
Iii) on the basis of the recommendations of the study and the
seminar, develop a plan for phased diversification of employment
services in Turkey, and iv) subsequently implement the plan, as
discussed and agreed with the Bank, beginning not later than
December 31, 1994;
(c) the IIBK will: i) identify. six staff counterparts (e.g., in
management development, unemployment benefits, client application
and referral, job development, job search/job club, mass layoff,
and collection and analysis of local labor market information) by
the time the employment and counseling services technical
assistance contract is signed, and iI) cease the practice of
stipulating gender preferences in its job vacancy listings;



4
(d) the IIBK will substantially staff the Career Information Unit
(CIU) with approximately six full-time staff by the time the
employment and counseling services technical astnistance contract
is signed;
(e) the I1BK will substantially staff its three staff in-service
training centers by December, 1, 1993;
(f) the IIBK will staff its Automation Department with core staff,
including a systems analyst, systems programmer, systems
administrator, and technical training specialist, by the time the
related technical assistance contract is signed;
(g) the NSK will review the legal status of MSK and ATEB by September
1, 1994, and, if MSK members concur, the Government will support
development of plans to formalize MSK as a fully or partially
self-financing foundation or association by pecember 1, 1995; and
(h) the Gsvernment will provide to the Bank within six months of the
end of each fiscal year an audit report of such scope and detail
as the Bank may reasonably request.
12.    8eeitg:  The project would promote the integration of the unskilled
unemployed-into productive employment, and would improve the efficiency of
Libor-market choices through improved information on employment prospects and
training requiremnts, and on job-seekers' skills. It would make a particular
effort to provide better employment opportunities for women. In addition to
the equity benefits for the unskilled unemployed, the project would contribute
to economic efficiency through the liberalization of labor markets -- an
sleament of the Government's general economic strategy of liberalizing markets
for factors, products, and exchange rates. For example, the development of
occupational standards and certification under the project is expected to lead
to Improved productivity by promoting the movement of skills to their best
uses in the economy. And the improved labor-market information to be
developed under the project -- in particular, relating to trends in labor
productivity by sectors and occupations -- will provide a more objective basis
for wage determination than the current, confrontational process of collective
bargaining. The job-insertion training to be supported under the project is
also an important tool for dealing with the worker dislocation which is likely
to result from the planned restructuring of public enterprises.
13. UI.I.: Project risks relate to: a) I2BKfs limited implementation
capacity and b) the need for cooperative action among numerous public-sector
and private-sector agencies in order to ensure coherence of implementation
among the various elements of the project. This coherence is necessary if the
objectives of the project are to be met. To address the risk that project
implementation could suffer from IIEK's limited implementation capacity, the
project provides for management assistance to IBK throughout implementation
of the project. To address the risk of inconsistency in implementation of the
project actions, the project provides for participation of other parties in
the various advisory and policy-making bodies to be established under the



5
project, including the National Training Review Board and the Local Training
Advisory Committees for the Job-Insertion Training componert, the Career
Information Advisory Committee for the Employment and Counseling Services
component, the Labor-Market Information Advisory Board for the Labor-Market
Information component, the Occupational Standards Commission for the
Occupational Standards and Certification component, and the Research Advisory
Committee for the Women's Employment Promotion Component.
14.    Recommedation: I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
