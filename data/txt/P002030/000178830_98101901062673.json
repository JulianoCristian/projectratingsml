of the Tree Crop Unit created at Benin under the\n            second Cocoa loan to implement the replanting program; new\n            planting/replanting of 8,000 ha of smallholder oil palm and\n            8,000 ha of nucleus oil palm estates; improving about 299 km\n            of earthroads to facilitate all-weather collection of ffb\n            from smallholders; operating a grant/credit scheme for\n            smallholders; training staff and farmers at selected\n            institutions and through in-service courses; the\n            construction and operation of two palm oil mills by Oil Palm\n            Company (OPC) to process the total production from the\n            estates and smallholders; establishing a fruit collection\n            system to be operated by OPC for
