The\n            components include a range of distance learning approaches,\n            developed by the Institute of Distance Education (IDE), so\n            as to reach a potential audience of civil servants needing\n            training. The existing Global Distance Learning Network\n            (GDLN) videoconferencing, and internet link at the Civil\n            Service College (CSC) will be upgraded in accordance with\n            international standards. Modified GDLN links with five\n            regional centers will be established, and beaming programs\n            will be developed at the IDE. These centers are considered\n            extensions of the IDE/GDLN, which should offer equal\n            programs to regional students by July 2001, and will be\n            established in existing tertiary level institutions, with\n            provision of computers, and audiovisual equipment. Satellite\n            rental, facility maintenance, and operational costs will be\n            partly financed, through tuition percentages generated by\n            students during 2001-2003. Printed distance learning\n            material will be developed in three disciplines,\n            administered by trained tutors at regional centers, in\n            addition to provision of training in computer literacy, and\n            English courses. Capacity building, and technical assistance\n            will enhance interactive computer activities, procurement,\n            and financial management."}, "docdt": "2001-04-04T00:00:00Z"}
