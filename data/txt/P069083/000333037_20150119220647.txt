Ethiopia Distance Learning                                                                                    June 11, 2004
The Distance Learning Project in Ethiopia, will test comparative learning outcomes, cost and cost-
effectiveness, and the sustainability of several, different distance learning approaches in the
country. The components include a range of distance learning approaches, developed by the
Institute of Distance Education (IDE), so as to reach a potential audience of civil servants needing
training. The existing Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN) videoconferencing, and internet
link at the Civil Service College (CSC) will be upgraded in accordance with international
standards. Modified GDLN links with five regional centers will be established, and beaming
programs will be developed at the IDE.
Â These centers are considered extensions of the IDE/GDLN, which should offer equal programs to regional students by July
2001, and will be established in existing tertiary level institutions, with provision of computers, and audiovisual equipment.
Satellite rental, facility maintenance, and operational costs will be partly financed, through tuition percentages generated by
students during 2001-2003. Printed distance learning material will be developed in three disciplines, administered by trained
tutors at regional centers, in addition to provision of training in computer literacy, and English courses. Capacity building, and
technical assistance will enhance interactive computer activities, procurement, and financial management.
