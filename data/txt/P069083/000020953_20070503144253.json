The Learning and Innovation\n            nature of LILs strongly suggests the need for a separate\n            subcomponent in the project design, and providing adequate\n            resources for an effective M&E system with appropriate\n            baselines established at the outset. 2. Creating an open and\n            direct line of communication between the management of\n            implementing agencies / project management team and the task\n            team leaders is essential for effective implementation. 3.\n            Bank management needs to carefully monitor the performance\n            of projects with short life-spans (3 years) or with less\n            than three years remaining, to ensure that decisions for\n            corrective action can be taken early enough to allow\n            effective implementation. 4. Task Teams and Clients need to\n            agree on a system of incentives to ensure that key personnel\n            remain on the payroll of the project and that frequent\n            change of staff is avoided. 5. Management could have been\n            more proactive during the first two years of implementation\n            and could have re-organized the Bank team at an earlier\n            stage. 6. The Bank missed the opportunity during the first\n            two years of implementation to (a) identify project\n            difficulties and provide adequate implementation support to\n            the Borrower; and (b) to restructure the project much\n            earlier to improve its performance. 7. Distance Education\n            projects that plan to include the use of modern information\n            and communication technologies need to focus strongly on\n            assessing the institutional capacity and the technology\n            options available on the ground. Ensuring that the required\n            institutional capacity, high level political support,\n            capable human resources, and technical infrastructure are in\n            place - or can be readily developed - are essential for success."}, "docdt": "2007-03-26T00:00:00Z"}
