a) damaged flood protection\n            infrastructure along rivers; and b) irrigation\n            infrastructure. The project consists of two components. 1)\n            Rehabilitation/reconstruction of river protection and\n            irrigation infrastructure will finance repair and\n            rehabilitation of eroded river embankments in five rivers,\n            together with rehabilitation and reconstruction of 23\n            protective spurs. The component will also finance the\n            rehabilitation and reconstruction of selected irrigation\n            infrastructure inside and outside of river beds at 16\n            different schemes. Within the river beds the repair works\n            will include intake spurs, irrigation conveyance canals and\n            their embankments, spurs to protect such embankments, and\n            spillways and gated headworks. Outside the river beds the\n            repair works will include drain overpass reconstruction,\n            spillway reconstruction from debris dams and repair of\n            concrete lining. 2) Project management and implementation\n            support will establish a project implementation unit for the\n            project's daily management. Consulting firms will be\n            contracted for the preparation of feasibility studies. The\n            component will also support two study tours to countries\n            where different methods of flood protection are practiced."}, "docdt": "1998-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
