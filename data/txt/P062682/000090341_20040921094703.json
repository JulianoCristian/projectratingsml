The lessons learned indicate\n            that flexibility of project design, accompanied by good\n            resource planning, sound engineering design, and effective\n            management for implementation, produced very good results.\n            Contractors in ex-Soviet environments still face\n            difficulties in adjusting to Bank-style construction\n            contracts with Government.

Simple technologies and\n            design approaches which are new for the borrowing country\n            can be successfully introduced, and adopted by relatively\n            inexperienced contractors if the necessary support of\n            international experts, along with effective local support,\n            is provided. Import of working quantities of new products\n            can demonstrate the effectiveness of new technologies and\n            provide the key to their acceptance on a wider scale, as\n            well as a guide and comparative gauge for local manufacture.\n            Training (especially on-the-job) is critical in order to\n            obtain overall satisfactory results and to provide a\n            relatively homogeneous quality level throughout similar\n            sub-projects.
