MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR AN
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed agricultural
research and extension loan to Tunisia for US$17.0 million is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be for 17 years including a 5 year grace
period with interest at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would
help finance an agricultural research and extension project.
2.    Background.  After a relatively high level of growth of 8% between 1967
and 1976, growth of agricultural GDP (1980 prices) slowed to 2.8% per annum
between 1977 and 1987. The food trade gap is currently about 42% largely due
to low self sufficiency ratios in cereals, milk and meat (60%, 48% and 83%
respectively). While the sector accounts for only 13% of GDP, it employs some
35% of the labor force. Open unemployment is about 15%. Average annual per
capita income in agriculture is estimated at US$325, again - a national per
capita income (1988) of US$1,210. To meet the needs of food, employment and
exports, investments in the sector have been strongly oriented to investments
in irrigation. However, Tunisia now has reached, and in some cases exceeded
the limits of horizontal expansion of sustainable irrigated and rainfed
agriculture. Further growth now depends much on the identification and
application of iiaproved technology to increase production from available land
and water resources, for which research and extension are crucial.
3.    The Bank has worked closely with the Government in reviewing past
agricultural expenditure policies and in developing the strategy for invest-
ments under the VIIth Development Plan (1987-1991). Support for policy
adjustments in the Agricultural Sector has been provided under the first
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL I). This support has been expanded
under the Second Adjustment Loan (ASAL II) (Loan 3078-TUN). Assistance in
developing agricultural extension has been provided in several irrigation and
area development projects. Two masterplan studies aimed at improving and
strengthening research and extension were completed with Bank financing in
1986/87 under the Technical Assistance Project (Loan 2197-TUN), with
assistance from ISNAR and FAO/CP. These studies are the basis for the project
now proposed for financing.
4.    Research and Extension are currently carried out by a number of
Government Institutions, Agencies and Directorates under the Ministry of
Agriculture. The masterplan studies referred to above have identified key
issues that need to be addressed to upgrade research and extension in Tunisia.
Based on past experience, research suffers from: (a) a lack of coordinated
planning and selection of priorities; (b) unbalanced allocation of financial
resources; (c) inadequate financial manage- nt; (d) concentration of research
staff in Tunis; and (e) an excessive numbet of field stations. Despite
valuable assistance from the International Research Centers and bilateral aid,
and several important research results in key subsectors such as cereals,



- 2 -
a number of major technological and economic constraints to agricultural
development are not adequately addressed through current research and
extension efforts. Extension is still hampered by: (a) overlapping
responsibilities of various Government agencies; (b) inadequate organization,
work program supervision and training; (c) inadequate means of transport,
teaching and communication support material; (d) insufficient up-dated
messages adapted to local conditions; (e) inadequate attention to farm
management economics ani mechanization; and (f) weak linkages with and
insufficient feedback to research. The Project was designed to address these
weaknesscs.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
5.    Due to the limited potential for horizontal expansion, further deve-
lopment of the sector depends mainly on an increase in productivity and
efficiency. A well focussed agricultural research program, in close
association with a well organized extension effort, were identified by
Government and the Bank as crucial factors to reach the goal of further growth
of the sector and more efficient use of resources. The Bank has been closely
involved in the steps taken during the past five years to prepare the reform
of research and extension institutions. A number of reforms have already been
implemented through the first Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL I),
notably the adoption of an improved remuneration and career structure for
agricultural research staff. A major step was taken ir 1989 through the
establishment of Regional Extension Divisions which combine the previously
separate services for rainfed and irrigated land. Moreover, legislation has
been submitted to the National Assembly for the creation of an Extension and a
Research entity at central level to enable improved programming, budgeting and
monitoring of all agricultural research activities, and to provide training,
programming and monitoring and mass media support to the regional extension
Divisions. The Bank's involvement has been productive in assisting the
Government to focus on the necessary reform measures for research and
extension, as part of an overall strategy in agriculture. The continuation of
this involvement, both financially and through advice, is justified at a time
when the Government has shown its receptiveness to this assistance through the
initiation of its important institutional restructuring program. Bank
assistance through the Project is needed to continue the reform and to enable
further rationalization and strengthening of Research and Extension.
6.    Project Objectives.  The Project's main objective is to improve the
institutional and organizational framework needed to increase the effective-
ness of Research and Extension.  It would also provide direct suppori. for               y
research into key crops and farming issues and to find solutions for major
constraints, to provide farmers with tested technical innovations, and to
provide policy makers with information for policy decisions. Direct support
for extension in 15 regions would be provided as a necessary complement to the
research program. In this context, the Project would also assist with the
establishment of a pilot program to provide adequate extension services to
rural women as an integral part of the agricultural extension effort.
7.    Proiect Description.  The proposed 5-year Project supports the
implementation of a first phase of a program of institutional reform and
strengthening of research and extension. The research component includes:



(a) introduction of programming and budgeting by objective, and strengthening
of the orgarizational, financial management and evaluatiori capacity of the new
research entity; (b) construction of laboratories, machinery sheds, workshops,
offices, staff housing and provision of scientific, office and printing
equipment and vehicles for research in 10 priority themes aimed at the
increase in production of cereals, pulses, red meat, olives, fruit and
vegetables, and research in forestry, soil and water conservation, irrigation,
recycled water use and farm machinery; (c) provision of fellowships and
consultancies for scientific, technical, managerial, on-the-job and external
training and advice; (d) establishment of three regional research centers,
strengthening of 8 experimental stations, implementation of on-farm research;
(e) establishment of improved institutional linkages with extension at
national and regional level. The extension component would support the
organization of a Central Extension entity and Regional Extension Divisions
through: (a) establishment of an extension, mass media, editing and printing
service and monitoring and evaluation unit a< central level; (b) strengthening
of regional extension units and sub-regional supervisory units; (c)
strengthening of about 550 CRAs, including 54 new constructions; (d)
expansion of T&V-based management principles; (e) training, fellowships and
technical assistance.
8.    The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$34.0 million with a
foreign exchange component of US$17.8 million (522). A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A; amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank group
operations in Tunisia are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7549-TUN dated May 8, 1990
is being distributed separately.
9.    Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following actions:
(a)   Establishment of an entity in charge of agricultural research
coordination and management, and a central entity for agricultural
extension, with resources and terms of reference acceptable to the
Bank by December 31, 1990.
(b)   Establishment of a National Council for ..gricultural Research and
a National Council for Agricultural Extension with terms of
reference and composition acceptable to the Bank by December 31,
1990.
(c)   Establishment for both the Research and Extension components of a
project execution unit with terms of reference and resources
satisfactory to the Bank, as a condition of loan effectiveness.
10.         Benefits.  The Project's successful implementation would develop
and expand the use of new technology as a means to promote sustained economic
growth in the sector. The Project would cause stronger and more efficient
research and extension services, improved research and extension linkages,
greater farmer participation in research and extension planning, greater
accessibility of extension information to farm women and better protection of
the environment as important elements for medium and long-term sustained
development of the sector.

11.         Risks.  Possible risks include a slower than anticipated
implementation of organizational restructuring and a tight- operational and
budgetary situation. To minimize these risks, the concentration of tasks of
various agencies is expected to counteract much of the estimated incremental
operational expenditures.
12.         Recoqmeination.  I am satisfied that the proposed project would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
