Some of the key lessons learned\n            include: 1) Programming and budgeting by objective is a\n            complex approach that required some three years for\n            Institute of Agricultural Research and Higher Education\n            (IRESA) to adopt properly. 2) When agricultural research is\n            to undergo complex restructuring, expecting rapid\n            disbursement from the start of the project is unrealistic.\n            3) To achieve regionalization of research, the project\n            should have placed more emphasis on the necessary\n            prerequisites. 4) Considering the time and energy needed to\n            develop comprehensive systems for programming and budgeting\n            by objective, simpler procedures to redirect research\n            budgets effectively during project implementation constitute\n            a good compromise. 5) Implementation was obstructed by the\n            need for regulatory changes that were not envisaged at\n            appraisal. 6) To facilitate reforms, more thorough\n            preparation to understand better and to tackle\n            decisionmaking processes and bureaucratic procedures might\n            be envisaged. 6) The introduction of a national extension\n            system based solely on the training & visit extension\n            methodology system proved inadequate in the Tunisian\n            context. 7) To improve the motivation of field staff,\n            project management should give serious consideration to\n            preparing proposals for legislation that would upgrade the\n            status of extension staff to be submitted to decisionmakers\n            for their consideration."}, "docdt": "1997-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
