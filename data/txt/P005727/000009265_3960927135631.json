Project support,\n            covering 10 priority research themes, consists of : a)\n            introduction of programming and budgeting objectives; b)\n            strengthening of organizational, managerial, monitoring and\n            evaluation capacities; c) construction and improvement of\n            laboratories, sheds, workshops, stables, offices, and staff\n            housing for 5 main research centers and 8 field stations; d)\n            provision of equipment, fellowships and consultants.  For\n            extension, the project's objectives will be\n            accomplished through : 1) concentration and improvement of\n            extension support, mass media production, monitoring and\n            evaluation at the central level; 2) strengthening and\n            improvement of 15 regional specialized extension services;\n            3) strengthening of 550 and construction of 54 local\n            extension centers; 4) provision of equipment, foreign and\n            local training, and consultants; and 5) a pilot extension\n            program for women."}, "docdt": "1990-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
