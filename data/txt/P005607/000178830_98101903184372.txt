REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF T1lE PRESIDENT
TO 1Tll EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO BANQUE NATIONALE DE TUNISIE
WIT1I I1E GUARANTEE OF TH1E REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
AND A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TIIE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan and a proposed credit totalling an amount in varlous currencies
equivalent to $8.0 million for an agricultural credit project. The loan
of $5.0 million would be made to Banque Nationale de Tunisie (BNT) withl the
guarantee of the Republic of Tunisia. The credit of $3.0 million would be
made to the Republic of Tunisia and its proceeds relent to BNT.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan and credit would be the Bank Group's second
operation in Tunisia's agricultural sector. In 1967, the Bank and IDA
financed the Cooperative Farm Project (Loan No. 484-TUN; Credit No. 99-TUN)
wliiclh, after changes in Tunisia's agricultural policies affecting the
character of the project, had to be revised.    In late 1969, the Government
asked for Bank Croup assistance in the private agricultural sector. This
project was prepared with help from tlhe FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program and
appraised in June/July 1970.
3.        Negotiations for the proposed loan and credit were held in
Washington from March 25 to 31, 1971. The Tunisian delegation was headed
by Mr. Ghenima, President and Managing Director of BNT, and included
Mr. M'rad, Ministry of Planning, Mr. Ben Khedlher, Ministry of Agriculture,
Mr. Chatti, President and Managing Director of Societe Tunisienne
d'Industrie Laitiere (STIL), Mr. Hamrda, BNT, and Mr. Badra from the
Tunisian Embassy in Wasliington.
4.        My Report and Recommendation dated May 17, 1971 on a proposed
loan to Tunisia for a highway project (P-942) includes a summary state-
ment of loans and credits to Tunisia at April 30, 1971 and conments on
certain problems encountered on projects prcviously financed.

PART III - TliE PROJECT
6.        An appraisal report entitled "Agricultural Credit Project -
Tunisia' (No. PA-79a) is attaclhed.
7.        Measured in constant 1966 prices, the contrIhution of Tunisia's
agricultural production to GDP has, despite a higli level of investmuent,
dropped froîn a one-time hlglh in 1965 of almost $200 -million to some $150
million In 1970, or little more tlian tlie 1960 production level.   lhis
disappointing performance can be explained by a nuinber of reasons. Bad
weather and the heavy floods in fall 1969 depressed production.    Tihe pro-
gram of organizing agricultural cooperatives incressingly led to inisalloc,i-
tion of resources and reduced productivity. Private farmers benefitted
little from public Investment programs, and when finally threatened wittl
loss of their land to cooperatives, liquidated a large part of their live-
stock and equipment.
8.       Tlle Covernment is beginniiig to redefine agricultural policies.
While this will take somie time, inuiiediate measures arc reqtiired to increase
productivLty in order to contaili rising food imports. The Government lias
decided to give inmmediate assistance to the modern agricultural sector
wlîiclh would be most responsive, by introducing a program wbiclî is expected
to lead to considerable import savings on cereal and dairy products and to
yicld valuable foreign exchange from date exports.    The project whose total
cost amount to $15 million would be part of this prograni.
9.        The major part of the project (61 percent) will be for the mecha-
nization of grain farming in northern Tunisia. Credit facilities would be
opened to farmers for purchasing wheel and crawler tractors, combines and
related agricultural machincry.   BNT would, simultaneously, provide from
its owll sources short-term credit for financing inputs like high yielding
seeds and fertilizers.
10.       Fourteen percent of the funds available under the project would
go into development of dairy farming in northern Tunisia and would help
rebuild livestock herds wliicl farmers liquildatecd in 1969 after the transfor-
inatiori of all arable land into cooperatives had been announced.   Investment
for thlis subproject would comprise the purchase of livestock, instal]ation
of groundwater pumps for small-scale irrlgated fodder production, improvement
and modernization of barns and mechanical equipnment.
11.       About 22 percent of project funds would be earmarkedl for date
plantations in southern Tunisia. New oases would be created in the desert
on water fronm artesian aquifers. Tlhis would require drilling of bore-holes
up to 600 meters deep, installation of pumps where underground pressure would
not be sufficient, irrigation and drainage equipment, land and soil prepa-
ration, planting of (late palms and wind breaks, and ancillary installations.
This suh-project would be carried out by Societe Tunisienne de l'Industrie
Laiticre (STIL), a company witlh no direct State participation which has
already gained considerable experience in oasis development.



- 4 -
12.       The remainiing 3 percent of project funds would finance support-
ing services to improve BNT's project appraisal section, the techulical staff
of STIL's plantation) management and thie public dairy farnm extension service.
13.       Banque Nationale de Tunisie (1NT) would be the Borrower of the
$5 million Bank loan. The IDA credit of $3.0 million would be niade to tie
Republic of Tunisia and re-lent to BNT oni the terms and conditions of the
Bank loan except thal the interest rate would be 1 percent.
14.       BNT is the second largest Tunisian commercial bank, and engages
mainly in agricultural credit.   T he Government holds 25 percent of its
capital, other public bodies 60 percent, and 15 percent is held privately.
The institution is well managed and its staff competent. A fairly high
present financial engagement vis-a-vis Societe Tunisienne d'Industrie
Laitiere (STIL) whicli will be tlie sub-borrower for the date-palm sub-proj-
ect, has now been adequately secured and will be gradually reduced under
a covenant of the Loan Agreement.
15.       BNT would make project sub-loans at 8 percent annual interest.
Grace and repayment periods would correspond to requirements of sub-projects
and would be longest for the date-palm sub-project where the total repayment
period would be 15 years. Interest rates for agricultural credit in Tunisia
are presently around 4 percent. The increase to 8 percent for project
sub-loans would mean an important chanige in the present low interest policy
and would lead to better resource allocation.   To moderate tie impact of
the interest rate increase the Government would temporarily pay farmers a
direct subsidy towards investment cost. Tihis subsidy would not exceed the
equivalent of 2 percent annual interest so thal farmers would pay a minimum
effective rate on sub-loans of 6 percent per annum. The same condition
would apply if farniers eligible for project sub-loans would apply for loans
from otlher fun-ds administered by BNT. In tic meantime, agricultural subsi-
dies as well as the system of higlh agricultural taxation are expected to
be reviewed as part of an overliaul of agricultural policies which the
Governnient is now undertaking.
16.       At the request of the Government, it was agreed that the Government
re-lend the IDA funds to BNT at 1 percent. The average cost of Bank/IDA
funds (4.9%) and of bNT's own resources (4%) would tlien result in a blended
cost of 4.7% giving 13NT an overall margin on project operations of 3.3%.
This margin would be adequate to cover project overheads, lncluding adminis-
trative expenses ancd provisions for bad debts, and would help in establishing
adequate reserves for BNT.
17.       At present BNT's liquidity position is strained because of large
advances made to cooperatives amounting to D 5.6 million, which have not
yet been repaid. These loans had been granted under a Government guarantee
andl the Government has now agreed to repay in five equal installments an
anmount of D 2.6 million owed by cooperatives whiclh were dissolved in the
wake of the 1969 policy changes. Already in the agreements amending Loan
Agreement No. 484 and Credit Agreement No. 99 dated November 23, 1970, it



- 5 -
had accepted to reschedule D 3.0 million owed by cooperatives which were
rmaintained on State lands after 1969. These debts will be repaid over five
years partly by the Government and partly by these cooperatives.
18.       Most of the goods and services needed for tlhe project would, not
be suitable for bulk procurement, and would, therefore, be bought through
existing commercial channels.   Supplies arc adequate, prices competitive
and servicing facilities available. Drilling contracts under the date-
palm development sub-project would be awarded after international competi-
tive bidding except for four impending operations to be completed before
August 1971 where application of international bidding procedures would
delay groundwater development and cause the loss of a planting season.
19.       Financial rates of return on the project would be higlh.   For the
grain farming sub-project, they would vary from 21 to 25 percent according
to farm sizes, reach 26 percent for the dairy farm sub-project and 14
percent for tie date development.   The overall economic return on the project
is estimated at 22 percent.
20.       The Bank/IDA contribution would meet th1e foreign exchange expendi-
ture anmounting to 53 percent of project cost. 17 percent would be provided
by BNT, and farmers would contribute tlhe remaining 30 percent. Bank/IDA
would disburse 75 percent on eachi sub-loan made by BNT which would correspond
to the 53 percent overall foreign exchange component.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTIIORITY
21.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank ancd Banque Nationale de
Tunisie, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Tunisia and
the Bank, the draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Tunisia and tlhe Association, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Bank's Articles of Agreement, the Re-
commendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of
the Articles of Agreement of the Association, tlhe text of a Resolution ap-
proving the proposed Loan and the text of a Resolution approving the pro-
posed D)evelopment Credit are being distributed to tlhe Executive Directors
separately.
22.       The draft Loan, Guarantee and Devclopmenit Credit Agreements conform
substantially to the pattern of agreements for agricultural credit projects.
I would call your attention to the following features:
(1)  Botlh tlhe Loan and Development Credit Agreements have
idenitical provisions witli respect to thie allocation of
thle proceeds of tlhe total financing to bc providecl by
tlhe Bank anid the Association for tlue Project (Sclhcdule
2 of botli Agreements);



- 6 -
(il)  The Loarn will not be disbursed until tlie amnount of the
Developiment Credit has beeii fully withdrawn or coinnitted
(aforemneiitioned Sclhedule 2).
23.       The Loan, Guarantee and Credit Agreements will be subject to rati-
fication.
24.       I amn satisfied that ttue proposed loan and credit would comnply witli
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and of the Association.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
25.       A brief statement on the Tunisian economy was included in my
Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan to Tunisia referred to in
paragraph 4 above.  A basic data sheet is attached.
PART VI - RECOMIENDATION
26.       I recormmend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan
and the credit.
