The Bank served as a\n            vehicle to bring about policy changes towards the project.\n            Some of the shortcomings encountered in the implementation\n            could have been mitigated through careful scrutiny of: (a)\n            construction designs and costs at appraisal stage; and (b)\n            qualitative aspects of plantation development and\n            beneficiary issues during the supervisory phase. The main\n            lessons of this project experience are: Preparation and\n            appraisal missions should have a clear focus on local\n            funding needs, budgetary procedures and flow of fund\n            arrangements. Equally important is the need, both at\n            preparation and appraisal stages, to ascertain the\n            availability of land, physical plans and designs for civil\n            works and pay attention to details of construction costs,\n            including physical contingencies. Sustained management of\n            community planted forests is only likely if the communities\n            themselves have a large measure of responsibility for site\n            selection, and plantings. If their harvest rights are known\n            from the beginning, innovative projects requiring a large\n            degree of beneficiary involvement are likely to be slow in\n            starting, and this should be allowed for preparation."}, "docdt": "1991-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
