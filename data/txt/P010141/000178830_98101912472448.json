first\n            phase of a twenty year national forestry program aiming to\n            develop community forestry in the Hills and to establish\n            training facilities in Nepal to satisfy needs for qualified\n            forestry, soil and water conservation personnel. The\n            proposed project would increase supplies of fuelwood in Hill\n            areas through establishment of new plantations and\n            rehabilitation of degraded forests. The Ministry of Forest\n            would be reorganized and strengthened through the provision\n            of supporting services and training facilities. Technical\n            assistance would be provided to assist in execution of field\n            planting programs, in organization and administration of the\n            new Community Forestry and Afforestation Division, and in\n            establishment of the training and research programs.\n            Production from project plantings would reach a peak in year\n            20 of the project when timber from the Panchayat Forests is\n            clear-felled; total production in that year would provide\n            about one-third of the total fuelwood requirements of the\n            1.9 million people in the 340 panchayats participating in\n            the project. The annual sustainable yield of fuelwood from\n            Panchayat Protected Forests and private plantings would be\n            sufficient to provide the full requirements of 10 percent of\n            the project area population."}, "docdt": "1980-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
