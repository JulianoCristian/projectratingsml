were moderately\n            satisfactory; the risk to development outcome was\n            significant; the risk to GEO outcome was significant; the\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the project structure and\n            objectives had a focus on learning, but the lack of an\n            adequate monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system\n            prevented to capture some of the lessons learned during\n            implementation. From the identification the Bank should\n            support the implementing agencies in establishing and\n            maintaining a valid M&E system, in case of insufficient\n            capacity. This project was designed as pilot which objective\n            to test sustainable development mechanism involving\n            conservation and economic activities. The project had\n            altogether 10 indicators which were difficult to achieve\n            given the economic and political situation of the country at\n            the time. Small project should have modest objectives and\n            indicators. A combination of integrated development planning\n            outcomes with policy reform would have been beneficial to\n            the project outcomes, by setting the legal or administrative\n            basis for the use of spatial development plans after the\n            project closes."}, "docdt": "2007-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
