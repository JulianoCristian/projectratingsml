1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The project was appraised in March 1999 at the time when Mozambique was undertaking
ambitious reform programs, which led to increased investment in many sectors, including
agriculture, mining, tourism, energy, and industry. Mitigation measures were necessary to
ensure that the rapid investment increase in these sectors would not lead to a rapid
degradation of natural resources, and that the natural resources were appropriately
managed. Ensuring sustainable development was therefore a priority, and appropriate
capacity building at provincial and local levels was particularly important. A clear
framework with well defined processes for investment, planning negotiations agreements
and investment with communities was critical for attracting environmentally sustainable
private sector investments in the coastal area.

Key issues in the coastal zone included unmanaged coastal development, in particular
illegal tourism operations; unclear user rights; overexploitation of fisheries; loss of
supporting coastal ecosystems such as mangroves; lack of community involvement in
decision making and management; breakdown of local resource management systems;
pressure caused by refugees and resettling populations; weak institutional and limited
financial capacity to manage coastal resources; unclear legal framework in the
management of certain coastal and marine resources; and overlaps and gaps in
institutional mandates and jurisdictions exacerbated by limited coordination. The
situation was worsened by the inadequacy of the protected area system, which did not
protect and ensure sustainability of valuable resources, especially considering the
diversity of habitats and economic importance of littoral zone.

The project was designed to test an integrated coastal marine biodiversity management
approach in Cabo Delgado and Nampula provinces, in northern Mozambique. The project
was specifically aimed at testing the following:
            Mechanisms for integrating economic development aspirations of provincial
            governments and local communities with the requirements of biodiversity
            conservation at the provincial and district level;
            Institutional arrangements for developing coastal and marine resource
            planning and management at provincial and local levels;
            Mechanisms to bring selected globally significant ecosystems and species
            under effective protection, including developing and implementing
            management plans, and piloting mechanisms for their sustainable use;
            Participatory process for developing and implementation of local natural
            resources management plans outside official conservation areas, including
            capacity building;
            Mechanisms to enhance public awareness and understanding of biodiversity
            conservation and sustainable use concerns, particularly among decision
            makers and resource users, including understanding of current threats,
            possible solutions and current and future social, economic and development
            options; and



                                              1

             Policies, institutional and legal framework for coastal and marine biodiversity
             conservation and management, including furthering definition of respective
             roles and responsibilities of government, NGOs, communities and private
             sector stakeholders and definition of conservation classification systems.

The Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Management Project (CMBMP) was strategically
aligned with the government strategy, defined by the National Environment Management
Program (1994), which identified the need for integrated coastal zone management as one
of the five priorities. The Bank Country Assistance Strategy (1997-1999) focused on
poverty reduction and recognized that prospects for sustainable growth were linked to
rural development, coupled with sound management of natural resources.

The pilot was aimed at contributing to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) strategic
pillars by focusing on: (i) private sector; (ii) improving governance and empowerment;
(iii) increasing human capabilities; and (iv) strengthening development partnerships. In
particular the project aimed at establishing an enabling framework for minimizing
potential environmental and social risks for private sector development; promoting
environmentally and socially acceptable development of coastal and marine resources,
including the identification of alternative income-generating activities for target
beneficiaries; and promoting stakeholder participation in development planning systems.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The development objective of the CMBMP was to carry out on a pilot basis, an integrated
approach to sustainable development in the project areas, including: strategic integration
of conservation measures with regional economic development; establishment and
protection of conservation areas; initiation of conservation oriented community activities;

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries of this project are estimated at 470,000 dwellers of the six coastal
districts of Palma, and Mocimboa da Praia (Cabo Delgado Province), Nacala-Velha,
Nacala-Porto, Mossuril, and lha de Moçambique (Nampula Province) in northern
Mozambique. The primary target group encompasses the local communities in the
vicinity of the protected areas, or key habitats of targeted species, users of local natural
resources such as fisherman, selected managers of local natural resources including
public sector agents and decision makers at all levels, private sector; and non-
governmental organizations.

1.7 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1 Strategic Development Plans (US$1.7 million of which US$0.2 GEF)

The main objective of the Strategic Development Plans (SDPs) component was to
provide provincial governments and the pilot districts with strategic planning tools to
facilitate conservation and sustainable development planning at provincial and district
levels. Five main activities were planned as part of the SDPs: (i) land use capacity
assessment; (ii) social assessment; (iii) incorporation of biodiversity values including
designation of key conservation areas and appropriate use and management regimes for
areas of remaining natural habitat and biological corridors; (iv) integration into a single
strategic development plan for each pilot area; and (v) review and adoption of SDP by
local and provincial government and stakeholders.

Component 2 Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Community Development
(US$3.6 million; US$3.4 GEF)

The objective of this component was to focus on establishing and strengthening the
management of protected areas in two conservation areas of global importance, biological
monitoring, and community development fund. This component had the following three
sub-components: (i) conservation and management; (ii) biological monitoring; and (iii)
community participation and development.

Conservation and Management. This sub-component was designed to focus on
implementation of biodiversity conservation, and management in the Quirimbas and
Nacala-Mossuril conservation areas. The project objective was to support the gazettement
of two conservation areas by rationalization and zoning their boundaries for appropriate
use, based on ecological and social assessments undertaken during the preparation stage
of the Project Development Funding (PDF). The project was also designed to finance
technical assistance; preparation and implementation of detailed management plans for
the marine conservation areas and their buffer zones; community land demarcation;
limited equipment and infrastructure (such as guard posts and boundary markets); and
appropriate training and capacity building for park staff and communities to work
together on co-management of natural resources and development of revenue generating
mechanisms.

Biological Monitoring. This sub-component was designed to support ecological surveys
and monitor key indicator species (e.g. turtles and dugongs) and habitats (e.g. coral reefs)
to determine what impact the project has on biodiversity protection. Monitoring was to be
undertaken both within the key marine conservation areas and in adjacent coastal and
marine habitats. Under this component, training was to be provided to local communities
to build capacity for data collection, relevant to the establishment of management
guidelines for key marine resources. Data on migratory species would contribute to the
Ministry of Coordination of Environmental Affairs (MICOA) existing databank and
would be shared with other regional agencies as part of regional monitoring programs.




                                             4

Data on the condition and recovery of coral reef was to be relayed to Global Coral Reef
monitoring network.
Also, in support of the coastal zone management decentralization strategy and monitoring
and evaluation system, the project included support for the establishment and operation
of two field station.

Community Participation and Development. This sub-component was designed to
support community-based micro-projects that directly or indirectly would promote
conservation of biodiversity. Grant financing for micro-projects was to be complemented
by 10 percent community or local level contributions. The micro-projects were to target
communities within, or in the vicinity of the key conservation areas of Quirimbas and
Nacala-Mossuril as well as other biologically important areas identified as compatible
with the management objectives of the conservation areas, and technically feasible.

Component 3 Private Sector Development (US$1.3 million; US$0.1 GEF)

The objective of this component was to identify one of the two pilot project areas that
would be suitable for a substantial private sector investment (e.g. ecotourism investment
with a target value of US$10 million to US$30 million). The aim was to pilot a real
example of how the principles used to create strategic development plans can translate
into, and leverage a much larger investment in the area covered by the Plan. The
proposed tender was to attract private sector investment into the project area and serve as
an incentive for local, provincial and national governments to adopt the integrated SDP
approach. The GEF component was aimed at supporting environmental, social,
commercial and legal expertise needed to translate biodiversity management and social
expectations of the local community into specific aspects of the technical specifications
of bidding documents. Since technical specifications were to control directly the way the
development would be designed, constructed and operated, environmental and social
sustainability was anticipated.

Component 4 Training and Public Awareness (US$0.7 million)

Training. The training component was to focus on building capacity for the following
stakeholders: (i) technical staff of the implementing agencies, particularly at the
provincial level; (ii) communities and local users of natural resources; (iii) local
government staff and other local administrators (traditional leaders, religious leaders,
local NGOs, etc); and (iv) decision makers in general. Three categories of training were
planned: short-term, medium, and long-term training each with its focused group.

Public Awareness. This sub-component was designed to target two of the four target
groups, namely decision makers and local resource users. This was done because these
two groups were considered the most critical in raising awareness concerning the need
for biodiversity management in the pilot areas.

Component 5 Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (US$2.4 million;
US$0.4 GEF)



                                             5

Project Management. The project was to finance equipment purchase, and the costs of
operational and incremental staff involved in project coordination and management at the
central and local levels. As there were many players involved in the management of
coastal zone resources, the project was to support regular coordination meetings and
communications between components, by undertaking activities under the project as part
of the management component. The project was also to support costs associated with
coordinating meetings of the sustainable development council (annually), the inter-
institutional technical committee for coastal zone (quarterly), the project technical
committees, and local coordination committee (monthly).

Monitoring and Evaluation. This sub-component was to support the development and
implementation of monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, necessary to meet both the
overall program as well as project specific requirements. This component was
specifically designed to: (i) assess the overall effectiveness of the project development
objectives; (ii) evaluate the effectiveness in achieving project specific outputs and
development objectives; (iii) incorporate and expand ecological indicators for the broader
project areas including assessing the impact at the landscape level (building on
component 2.2); (iv) monitor social conditions the status in the pilot areas, measured
against the baseline established in component 1; and (v) advise on the most effective
institutional structure for the future collection and evaluation of monitoring data
concerning the state of the coastal zone.

                       supported by the Government and IDA at local level;
                       and ii) a programmatic approach and integration with
                       coastal management program supported by
                       DANINDA in Gaza and Inhambane provinces by the
                       Sustainable Development Center (CDS) based in
                       Xai-Xai.

Component 2            Revised and re-oriented to: (i) align with emerging   Biodiversity
Biodiversity           priorities of the country as articulated in PARPA and Conservation and
Conservation and       other development strategies; and (ii) integrate      Community
Sustainable            biodiversity conservation into economic               Development
Community              development through the establishment of

Development               follow-up activities related to the definition of
                          tourism development zones. The delays in
                          implementing component one (SDP) led the team to
                          a decision for the cancellation of this component and
                          recommended the government to concentrate on
                          finalizing the different aspects of the SDPs to ensure
                          that they would be fully integrated in the district
                          planning. The cancellation was consistent with the
                          recommendation of the MTR.

Component 4               Merged with component 5 to streamline all                 Training, Public

1.9 Other significant changes

Other Significant Changes. Three other significant changes were made. First, the Bank
approval of government request under component two to construct one big research
center in Pemba instead of two small research stations. The main technical justification
was to concentrate technical, human and financial resources, to be able to provide a
center of excellence for marine and coastal management of international standing that
addresses issues of importance for coastal communities and industries in Mozambique;
Second, under project management it was agreed to limit national level activities to (i)
policy and program coordination; and (ii) provision of administrative and service
functions to provinces especially in financial management, procurement, monitoring and
evaluation, training and awareness. The project level activities were to be implemented at
the provincial level, supported by technical advisory services from Sustainable
Development Center (CDS) and other partners as needed. Third, the PDO and GEO were
also adjusted at MTR to reflect the changes in components and are presented in the Table
1.2 below.

Project Extension. There was one extension of IDA credit, and two of GEF Grant. The
first extension of the IDA Credit and GEF Grant was on November 8, 2004 for two years.
The aim of Credit and Grant extensions was to ensure that the project met its objectives.
The two-year extension was important to ensure that the DO was achieved. There was no
further extension of the IDA Credit, and the project closed on June 30, 2007. The second
extension of the GEF Grant was on June 28, 2007, to enable the completion and
strengthening of community micro-projects, and support to the acquisition of equipment
for the Research Center.

Funding Reallocation. During the implementation, the Development Credit Agreement
(DCA), and GEF Development Grant Agreement (DGA) were revised three times each to
reallocate the funds among expenditure categories.

IDA reallocation: The first reallocation was in January 2003, to include under category 2,
training in addition to consultant services and clarify the meaning of operating costs; the
second reallocation was in June 10, 2004, to cover the expanded design of the center to
cater to the research needs of all the coastal provinces of Mozambique, and an expected
increase of costs on the transportation of materials, from Maputo to Cabo Delgado
Province; and the third reallocation was on May 2006, to cover costs of the construction
of the research center given that the civil works costs were higher than expected. The
Pemba Research Center was already under construction, and both the project team and
GOM agreed that, in order to achieve the PDOs, its construction, as envisaged, was
crucial.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Lessons of Earlier Operations taken into Account. The background analysis that
underpinned the project preparation correctly reflected the lessons learned from Bank's
portfolio, in particular from the Transfronteir Conservation Areas Project (TFCA). Key
lessons were incorporated in the design of this project, mainly on the need for: (i) inter-
governmental coordination, (ii) early consultation with key stakeholders, (iii) institutional
and human capacity and the need for decentralized implementation, and (iv) timely
provision of counterpart funding by the government to ensure financial sustainability.

The project objectives were relevant and aligned with sector strategy as well as with the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The PDO focused on assessing sustainable
development approaches and developing instruments such as integrated development
plans, institutional capacity building at provincial and local levels for sustainable
management of natural resources and biodiversity conservation. The community
involvement in the management of natural resources was timely tested. However,
associated PDO indicators were process and output based. Also, the project lacked a
results framework approach to link project interventions to results through operational,
clear and measurable indicators.

Although the project looked at the lessons learned from previous Bank projects, its design
was complex and required considerable capacity, and its implementation required
coordination with different agencies at the national level. More than six different
implementation agencies were involved at the central level (DINATUR, CPI, INIA, UEM,
DNFFB, and MICOA). In addition they had very limited coordination history among
them. Consequently, soon after the project started, these institutions experienced
problems in working together, and associated with lack of clear incentives and direct
benefits, they withdrew from the project, leaving MICOA alone with little experience in
project management and operational work.

Risk and Risk Mitigation Measures. The Project Appraisal Document rated as
substantial the overall project risk. Two elements were conclusive for this assessment: i)
possible resistance to coordination between implementing institutions leading to
emphasis on sectoral objectives; and ii) concession tender could not attract sufficient
interest from investors as a result of its location, perception of national stability, and
investment climate or other hindrances to investment in the project area. The risk
assessment was correct in both cases, but the mitigation plan to involve all institutions in
the project design, as well as the communication on the implications of Strategic
Development Plans (SDP) for reducing investor interest risk as part of the promotional
strategy, did not yield the intended results. Apparently, this resulted from lack of direct
incentives such as direct access to resource management by the institutions involved.
Regarding concession tender, the project did not reach that level of implementation
because considerable time was spent to complete the SDP. Consequently the private
sector component was dropped at the mid-term review. The PAD could also have



                                             10

discussed the sustainability of the SDP, and how lessons learned for this pilot would be
applied. The project could have included a policy reform to provide legal basis to
recognize the SDP in the district planning process.


2.2 Implementation

Two factors played an enabling role for project implementation. First, there was a clear
identification of the project geographical area and beneficiaries. Second the
decentralization of the project implementation from central level to provincial and local
level institutions.

There were also several issues that adversely affected the quality of implementation: (i)
lack of counterpart funds for more than a year after Credit and Grant effectiveness; (ii)
delays with regard to getting the Strategic Development Planning consultancy underway
and the dependency of other components on the outputs from the Strategic Planning; (iii)
lack of ownership of the project by partner agencies; (iv) lack of familiarity with the
Bank procedures regarding procurement, disbursement and financial management; and
(vi) exposure of the implementing agencies to the World Bank procurement and financial
management procedures.

The Bank team brought these issues to the attention of government during supervision
missions, and at the mid-term review an agreement was reached to restructure the project
to achieve the following goals: (a) streamlining to ensure more realistic outputs within
the remaining time frame of the project implementation; (b) decentralization at provincial
and community level; (c) integration with coastal and marine resource management
programs supported by other donors; and (d) identification of innovative mechanisms for
ensuring sustainability of activities initiated under the project after closure of the project

Factors Subject to Government Control

Provision of Counterpart Funds. Provision of counterpart funds has been a problem from
the beginning and throughout the implementation period of CMBMP. In the first year of
implementation the project was not registered at the National Budget and therefore was
not eligible for counterpart funding. Towards the end of the project, more than a year had
passed before the government made available counterpart funding to pay the contractor
involved in the construction of the research center in Pemba. These delays affected
substantially project implementation, and on all occasions the Bank team brought the
issue to the attention of government. The government met its obligations but in most
cases with substantial delays.

Lack of Ownership of the Project by other Agencies Involved. Despite efforts made at the
design to ensure effective participation by partner implementing agencies, soon after
effectiveness, they experienced problems in working together and withdrew from the
project. At the mid term-review the Bank team recognized the need for decentralization
of project implementation to the provinces and districts where incentives were much
clearer.


                                             11

Factors Subject to Implementing Agency Control

Lack of Management Experience. Lack of management experience of the PIU was a
constraint. This could have been addressed more proactively through the training
component, and improve the capacity for the implementing agency for procurement and
financial management. The training component could have been used also to improve the
familiarity with the Bank procedures regarding procurement, disbursement and financial
management; as well as the exposure of the implementing agencies to the World Bank
procurement, and financial management procedures. The Bank team brought these issues
to the attention of government, and in addition arrangements with the country office to
provide more support to the PIU on disbursements and financial management issues.

Implementation Delays. Disbursements fell considerable behind schedule at the
beginning of the project. As of December 2002 only 13% of the resources had been spent
(8 % from IDA and 21% from GEF), but it caught up substantially by the fourth quarter
of 2005. Initial delays were caused by lack of adequate coordination of the project with
different levels of government, weak implementation of the community development
fund, and inadequate provision of counterpart funds.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design. The Project was designed in 1999/2000 before the Bank introduced the
results framework template. Therefore, the project followed the old model. Therefore,
most of the KPI were outputs but aligned with the CAS and Coastal Zone Management
Plan. The project had nine PDO indicators at the design and two GEO. At MTR the PDO
indicators were reduced to eight and GEO were not changed. However, most of the
indicators continued to be output oriented rather than outcomes.

M&E Implementation. The development of an M&E plan started late in 2003. In
addition to late start, the project M&E developed a comprehensive M&E approach and
integrated coastal zone management which was not part of the project. A draft plan was
produced in January 2004 and revised in July. But while this was seen as a good
framework for overall coastal zone management, the project felt it needed more specific
M&E against the project PDOs and outputs. This plan was presented in draft form in
April 2005. Therefore, there was a rather significant time gap between the start-up of
project activities and the finalization of a comprehensive M&E system and this prevented
capture of most of the learning. In addition, the PDO indicators were outputs rather than
outcomes.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

This was a category B project and the safeguard and fiduciary issues were fully complied
with by the project. Substantial weakness in the financial management was noted in 2001
and 2002. Following supervision inputs from the Bank there was in general a marked
improvement in quality and compliance with guidelines in the financial management
reports.


                                             12

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The government put together post-completion measures that include partnership with
donors and other development agencies to capitalize some of the lessons learned from the
implementation of CMBMP, provide adequate capacity to district administrators to use
SDPs, and secured equivalent of US$340,000 from the Budget for 2008 activities for the
Research Center.

There is no follow-up operation, but the government made requests to donors to
capitalize the experience and lessons learned from the implementation of community
development initiatives (micro-projects) under the CMBMP, to design new a program
with national focus on improving management of fishing in the coastal zone.

Post-completion arrangements include provision of capacity to district administrations in
all for districts to use the SDPs as a tool to prepare the district annual plan (PES), and the
district strategic plan (PDD).

Related to Pemba Research Center, a 5-year business plan has been prepared, and the
government approved its constitution which gives it an adequate level of autonomy and
less dependency on government budget. The constitution also gives the research center
enough independency and flexibility to sign agreements locally and internationally, as
well as access to a range of potential financial sources of funding. As a result, the
Research Center signed in 2007, a 5-year agreement (2008-2012) with the University of
Bangor, UK, to establish a national center for aquaculture and applied marine science
research which, apart from bringing resources, will address the current lack of facilities in
Mozambique and in the region.

It is estimated that the Center will require about US$400,000 per annum to cover
expenses for its normal functioning and for 2008 the government secured 9 million
Meticais (US$340,000) from the budget to cover administrative and recurrent
expenditures for the Center. Since second quarter of 2007 the Center is run by a
management commission and this arrangement will continue until the government
approves the human resources plan that was proposed under the business plan. One of the
tasks of the commission for 2008 is to mobilize adequate resources to cover the balance
from the government budget.

While the constitution of the Center is flexible, with potential to become a sustainable
entity by mobilizing revenues at the national, regional and international, there is need for
adequate management capacity, given the level of investment realized and the amount of
resources required for maintenance.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The CMBMP objectives are still relevant to Mozambique's development priorities as
defined by the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PARPA II), and the Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS 2008-11). The CPS focused on poverty reduction through
sustainable and broad-based growth (Pillar III). The CPS recognizes that economic
growth is closely related to significant investments to unleash the potential of the rural
economy, coupled with sound management of the natural resource base and capacity to
respond to disasters.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment
Objectives

The overall achievement of the project development objective and global environment
objectives is moderately satisfactory. The achievement by component is summarized
below and includes: completion of SDPs in all four pilot districts that incorporates
biodiversity dimension and are under implementation in two districts (Palma and
Mossuril); demarcation of two conservation and preparation of management plans and
approval by government; construction of the research center and start biological
monitoring of marine ecosystems including small scale fishing; successful
implementation of more than 50 community development projects; and strengthened
environmental management capacity of communities and local government for
sustainable management of natural resources.

Component 1 Integrated Development Plans

The implementation of the integrated development plans component was successful in
many aspects and the achievement of the project is rated as moderately satisfactory. It
was designed to provide provincial and district administrations with strategic planning
tools to facilitate sustainable use of coastal and marine resources. Three major
instruments have been produced under this component: i) successful completion of
spatial development plans in all four pilot districts; ii) completion of a coastal
management strategy; iii) the project supported the preparation, completion and
implementation of the regulation for prevention and protection against marine and coastal
pollution including restrictions for circulation of vehicles in the coastal areas and in the
beaches.

The completion of the SDPs in all four pilot districts Palma, Mocimboa da Praia (Cabo
Delgado Province), Mossuril, and Nacala-Porto (Nampula Province) and subsequent
approval by provincial government and district administration, is assessed as the major
achievement under this component. In addition, two SDPs for Mossuril and Palma
districts are under implementation. All four SDPs incorporate biodiversity values of key
conservation areas and management plan. Social assessments were undertaken during
their preparation and included participatory assessment of community use and
dependence on natural resources, and a demographic and social attitude survey. However,


                                            14

the completion of SDPs was delayed and consequently prevented implementation of
other project activities. The completion of the first SDPs was originally scheduled 24
months after project effectiveness (October 2003), but due to implementation delays, the
first SDPs were only completed near the end of project implementation, March 2007. The
delays in completion of the SDPs had direct implication on the implementation of other
project activities, especially the private sector component that was dropped at mid-term
review due to its dependency on the SDPs.

There is no doubt that the SDPs are valuable instruments for the provincial and district
authorities and will strengthen the current planning process underway at the district,
namely the preparation of the annual PES and district strategic plans (PDD) as is the case
of Mossuril and Palma districts. But the lack of adequate legal status within the planning
framework puts their future use in doubt, or at least at the personal desire or
understanding of the district administrators. The project could have benefited from policy
and institutional reform to provide legal basis and recognition of the SDPs as a legal
entity in the district planning process. Currently it is not clear what legal basis these plans
will be given.

In addition to the SDPs the project supported the preparation of other instruments such as
Coastal Zone Management Strategy, and the regulation for prevention and protection
against marine and coastal pollution. This regulation includes also restrictions for
circulation of vehicles in the coastal areas and in the beaches.

Component 2 Biodiversity Conservation and Community Development

This component achieved partially its objectives and it is rated moderately satisfactory.
The objectives were to support the establishment of two biodiversity conservation areas
of global importance and to strengthen protected area management; to support biological
monitoring; and community development fund. The achievement by sub-component is
summarized below.

Conservation Areas Management. This sub-component achieved satisfactorily its
objectives. Two biodiversity conservation areas of recognized global importance have
been identified and demarcated. The process of establishment is well advanced. A draft
proposal for the establishment of two conservation areas and the respective management
plans were approved by respective provincial and district governments in March 2007.
The proposals were subsequently submitted by MICOA to Ministry of Tourism (MITUR)
for definition of the conservation category. The next stage is submission to the Council of
Ministers for approval. The two proposed conservation areas are in Mossuril (Nampula)
and Palma (Cabo Delgado) districts. MITUR expressed concerns about the potential
resettlement, but the potential resettlement issues were adequately covered in the
Resettlement Policy Framework by the project.

MITUR together with MICOA and other partners are formulating a new conservation
policy which will result in the definition of new categories for conservation areas. The
policy will offer greater flexibility in land use, greater empowerment to local



                                             15

communities and more opportunities for the private sector. Since none of the existing
categories under the current legal framework for conservation areas is considered
appropriate for the areas proposed under the project, mainly because of the communities
living inside of the areas, the government decided that gazettement should wait until the
new policy is approved. This situation might present some challenges for declaring these
areas as conservation areas after the project closes, and these concerns have been
presented to government by the Bank team.

Biological Monitoring. The objective of this sub-component was partially achieved. The
sub-component was designed to support ecological monitoring of key indicator species
and habitats to determine what impact the project had on biodiversity protection
including the construction of two small research stations.

At the mid-term review, the Bank approved a request from the government to construct
one big center instead of two small research stations. The main technical justification for
this option was to concentrate technical, human and financial resources. The total cost
was US$3.9 million representing a substantial increase from the SDR300,000 estimated
at appraisal. In addition to the technical justification, the Bank approved the construction
of the center also based project savings as a result of the changes introduced at MTR. The
savings originated from Category 2 (consulting services) and Category 3 (operating
costs). Decentralization of the project decreased operating costs producing savings of
approximately XDR 500,000 under Category 3. In addition, dropping the private sector
component made savings on consultants producing further savings under Category 2.
These savings were reallocated to fund the research center. The Research Center was
built and equipped in Pemba and it is intended to conduct high quality marine and coastal
research programs, and regular monitoring and assessment of marine ecosystems that
address issues of importance for coastal communities and industries in Mozambique.
Additionally, it will provide environmental education, which will contribute positively to
the lives of coastal communities in Mozambique.

The Center initiated its activities in April 2007, and as part of the biological monitoring
of the coastal zone, and in coordination with Institute for Fisheries' Research is
undertaking monitoring of small scale fishing in the six coastal districts of the Cabo
Delgado Province. Other biological monitoring activities are planned for 2008 to be
funded by government budget and will be implemented together with UEM. During
2007 the Center also undertook one regional training programs funded by the Western
Indian Ocean Marine Science Association involving 30 participants from Kenya,
Mauritius, Mozambique, and Tanzania.

The Pemba Research Center will provide a center of excellence for marine and coastal
management of international standing that addresses issues of importance for coastal
communities and industries in Mozambique. It will provide a facility for Mozambican
organizations and individuals as well as regional and international researchers and
scientists. The products that it will offer are applied research projects and contracts,
consultancy services, laboratory analysis, research facilities and space for visiting




                                             16

scientists, office space and facilities for external parties, courses, conference facilities,
aquarium, museum and visitor center.

The current arrangements for the sustainability of the center are satisfactory. They
include the legal status of the center which gives it enough autonomy from government
and flexibility to mobilize resources. As a result the Center signed an agreement with the
University of Bangor, UK, for the establishment of aquaculture and the development of a
training program. This program will be funded by Nuffield Foundation for the
establishment of a field laboratory in Pemba. The program will improve infrastructure by
providing a national center for aquaculture and marine research training that is currently
lacking in Mozambique. It will contribute to human capacity development in several
ways. The specific results from this partnership include: establishment of the Nuffield
laboratory; training of three staff at a Masters level to support the delivery of the course
in Pemba; development of course content, teaching materials and delivery of short
courses; master level research programs initiated and completed at the Center; externally
funded, higher level research projects utilizing the Center.

Community Participation and Development. The overall implementation of the micro-
projects is satisfactory. This sub-component was designed to support delivery of micro-
projects that directly or indirectly promote biodiversity conservation. After a slow start-
up, this component gained significant momentum after the mid-term review with
simplification of procedures for communities to apply for the matching grants. In the last
two years of project implementation, more than 50 micro-projects were approved and
delivered to communities in all six districts of the project area, benefiting more than 1800
households. Interviews with communities and government officials undertaken during the
preparation of this report support the view that the implementation of micro-projects
reduced unsustainable exploitation of natural resources by local communities by
providing them with alternative sources of income. The Project succeeded in stimulating
nine different types of activities with no single activity capturing more than 40% of the
available funding envelope. The success in providing piloted examples of income
diversification opportunities thus provides a positive outcome of the project.

The economic analysis are provided in the Annex 3, and the collective financial IRR on
income generation micro-projects is estimated to be 32.7%; including all investments and
a pro-rata share of project management overheads would place the financial IRR of this
activity at 23.3%.

Despite high IRR, this sub-component is not a given higher rating than satisfactory due to
sustainability after the Project closes. Some micro-projects in industry, fishing and
tourism were implemented towards the end of the project, and it is likely that many of
them will fail without further project support. Extension services are necessary to sustain
the return on micro-project investment. However, the CMBMP will close with no ability
to provide a few years of critical monitoring and operating support for the investments.
Discussion with the Aga Khan Foundation, a very active institution in northern
Mozambique, indicates the potential for MICOA to partner with the Foundation and other
parties to help identify an after care program for micro-projects. The likely program path



                                             17

would be to facilitate a transition period for the micro-projects where they would be
given technical support and access to micro-financing to enable them to continue their
activities on a more business-oriented and sustainable basis.


Component 3 Private Sector Development

The Private Sector Development Component was not rated, but it was designed to pilot
how the principles used to create the SDPs can translate into, and leverage, private
investment in the area covered by the strategic development plan. But it was dropped at
MTR due to: (a) delays in completing the spatial development plans; and (b) the influx of
private investors in all of the districts. The spatial development plans were delivered only
in March 2007, three months before IDA credit closed. There was also an unexpected
influx of private sector in the districts before the completion of the SDPs, and different
government departments also had different visions on priorities for the districts; e.g.,
MICOA favored conservation practices; fisheries wanted to promote fisheries; provinces
and district governments wanted rural development and community livelihoods. With
delayed SDPs it was difficult to get a common vision. The private sector component was
the one that was dropped by taking out the indicator in the DCA.

Component 4 Training, Public Awareness, Project Monitoring and Coordination

The overall implementation is satisfactory. It was designed for the training of technical
staff, communities and district offices. Several communities involving more than 450
people were trained on sustainable management of natural resources as well as leadership
and community conflict management, among other activities. More than 60 district
facilitators were trained in community awareness and capacity building; and more than
25 communities befitted from training workshops in the project area. Lastly, eight
government employees were provided Masters' Degree courses in environment and
natural resources management, among other training.

3.3 Efficiency

An economic analysis (see Annex 3) of the Project was undertaken that encompasses the
IDA- and GEF-funded activities under the assumption that all activities will have been
completed by 31 December 2007.1 The economic analysis is limited to analyses of
readily identified economic benefits; the lack of baseline information and absence of a
results framework within project monitoring prevents a reliable estimate of avoided costs
from being made. Also, the cancellation of the private sector component prevented
realization of any of the substantial employment and efficiency benefits (>$30 million)
that were identified at project appraisal. The economic analysis thus focuses on: (i) the
economic efficiency gains from the micro-projects; (ii) the cost-effectiveness of delivery
of micro-projects; (iii) the potential effectiveness of the Project as a whole in capturing


1GEF financing will close at 31 December 2007 to permit completion of micro-project investments.




                                                    18

future economic benefits associated with marine and coastal conservation; and,
(iv) financial sustainability of key investments in micro-projects and the Biodiversity and
Marine Research Centre.

Micro-project Economic Viability. The Project generated a portfolio of 52 micro-projects
financed at an aggregate level of about US$700,000 over the Project life, plus an
additional in-kind contribution from beneficiaries valued at US$70,000. Of these, all
micro-projects were designed for direct income generation, although some included some
form of long-term investment (e.g., mangrove rehabilitation, habitat restoration) that
would improve local welfare or would support other income generating alternatives. The
collective financial IRR on just those designed for income generation is estimated to be
32.7%; including all investments and a pro-rata share of project management overheads
would place the financial IRR of this activity at 23.3%. This excludes the social benefits
associated with reported (but not substantiated through monitoring) avoidance of non-
sustainable activities in the coastal areas.

Cost Effectiveness of Micro-project Delivery. The average cost overheads associated with
the micro-projects are 29% of delivered funds; given that this is the smallest fund
surveyed, this compares favorably with similar micro-project funds elsewhere in the
region delivered through WB/GEF channels: Uganda: 26% (EMCBP2); Tanzania: 24-
33% (TASAF2, MACEMP); Mozambique: 18% (Zambezi Valley Smallholder
Development Project).

Potential Future Benefits of Effective Coastal Protection. Although the Project failed to
realize the explicit protection of key coastal habitats, it did put some systems and plans in
place that make realization of such benefits in the future more likely. At this stage,
however, there is no reliable basis for estimating the total economic value of natural
habitats in the target area. At the time of project preparation, these were conjectured to
form part of a potential US$500 million tourism industry annually. Capturing even a
portion of this benefit still requires commencing implementation of the management
plans of Palma and Mossuril conservation areas2, and giving the SDPs a legal standing
that confers some certainty over tenure and resource use (by communities and potential
private sector investors). At this stage, the Project has not yet realized these key
preconditions hence none of these potential benefits can be directly ascribed to the IDA
or GEF investments.

Financial Sustainability. Project impact on financial sustainability for the country as a
whole is likely negative. The Project generated no new revenue streams during the
Project life, and income streams realized through the micro-projects are minor and
themselves at risk (because the Project will close with no ability to provide a few years of
critical monitoring and operating support after the investments have been made). The



2Indeed the two specific areas include the Rovuma River National Reserve in Cabo Delgado, and an extension to the existing
Matibane Coastal Forest Reserve in Nampula. Both of these new areas are yet to be gazetted pending finalization of Government
decisions on how to treat resource access.




                                                            19

ongoing annual monitoring and extension support costs for these micro-projects are
US$35,000 for two years after project closure and about US$9,000 annually thereafter.
The Research Centre remains a potential direct cash liability; although it has some
flexibility in securing its own funding, its recurrent operational requirements (excluding
depreciation) are estimated to exceed US$350,000 annually.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory. The project met most of PDO and
GEO indicators designed to carry out ­ on a pilot basis ­ an integrated approach to
sustainable development in the project area. The project achieved successfully seven out
of eight PDO indicators set in the DCA. The two GEO indicators were also achieved. The
only PDO indicator that was not achieved is related to establishments of new concessions
for private sector in compliance with SDPs. The Coastal and Marine Biodiversity
Management Project was designed around four components and all remain relevant in the
context of costal zone management strategy for Mozambique, PARPA II and the Bank
CPS.

Although the project achieved most of the project indicators two factors were conclusive
for the moderately satisfactory rating: First, due to late completion of some key project
activities, the project will close with no ability to provide a few years of critical
monitoring and operating support after the investments have been made. This is
especially relevant for the SDPs, community micro-projects, and research center. Second,
the project was designed as a learning project, with periodic reporting and review
meetings for dissemination of the lessons learned but an inadequate monitoring and
evaluation system prevented capture of most of the learning.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

In general, CMBMP interventions are likely to have had some poverty alleviating impact
through improved capacity of the government and better planning for allocation of
resources. In addition there were more than 450 community members and leaders that
benefited from training through the public awareness campaigns. Annex 3 provides an
analysis of CMBMP with poverty reduction as well as the likely extent of its impact.

During the project life itself, however, it provided only a modest improvement in poverty
reduction within selected communities; it fell far short of its potential impact through
mobilizing additional private sector resources. Within the Project's stated beneficiary
population (470,000 coastal dwellers in six coastal districts of Nampula and Cabo
Delgado provinces) the total direct impact on incomes is estimated to be at most
US$6.2 million over the life of the Project, representing only 0.6% of the local income on
an annualized basis. The permanent income generated by the micro-projects represents
approximately 0.1% of total beneficiary income. It should be noted, however, that the


                                            20

micro-projects were successful in stimulating a wide diversity of alternative income
generating activities. Many such funds tend to see 80% of their financing spent on only
one or two repetitive activities but the Project succeeded in stimulating nine different
types of activity with no single activity capturing more than 40% of the available funding
envelope. The success in providing piloted examples of income diversification
opportunities thus provides a positive outcome of the project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

This project targeted institutional strengthening that included capacity building in
decision support systems (such as spatial development plans), in management systems
(such as conservation area management plans), and in human resource training for
communities, and government at the national, provincial, and district levels.

The project put in place instruments that will strengthen institutional reform and capacity
building for the sector and make realization of institutional reforms and changes for
rational use of the natural resources more likely in the future.

The project has also contributed to enhanced staff performance and communities as
results of training. This includes training on leadership and conflict management, basic
techniques for coastal zone management for technicians and district administrators.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The construction of the Research Center in Pemba worked as a tourism investment
anchor project. Due to increased accessibility of the area where the research center was
built, and the expansion of electricity, there is increased land occupancy by tourism
operators. While increase investment in area is beneficial and there is now increased
pressure on land and care should be taken to avoid pressure on the environment, marine
and other natural resources in the area.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

No beneficiary survey was undertaken.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment
Outcome

Rating: Significant

The risk of the Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome is significant
for two reasons.

First, one of the major outputs of this project was the completion of the SDPs. But,
despite their potential use to improve territorial planning and allocation of resources,
there are some issues with the replication of the model in the country due to the following



                                            21

reasons: (i) limited human and financial resources; (ii) weak technical and institutional
capacity to meet future demand for SDPs; (iii) need to clarify the roles of each sector in
the application of the SDP methodology; and (iv) requirement to enforce the SDPs as
legal instrument.

Second, is related to sustainability of community development initiatives (micro-projects).
There is also no doubt that micro-projects were successful in stimulating a wide diversity
of alternative income generating activities. And discussion with local authorities, local
government and beneficiaries themselves, indicate that community development
activities have contributed to shift communities away from unsustainable exploitation of
natural resources by providing alternative ways of livelihood. But as discussed,
sustainability of the community development initiatives such as fishing, industry and
tourism after project closes represents a significant risk.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The lack of human capacity for project implementation and management was evident
from the project design stage. Although the Bank team undertook social and economic
analysis during the preparation, the design of various components ­ particularly the
strategic development planning, and private sector development components ­ failed to
carefully address these dimensions in the project design. Consequently, the spatial
development plans were delayed, and only completed at the end of the project. The
private sector component dropped at the mid-term review given its dependency on
successful adoption of the spatial development plans.

The project was complex and had many institutions involved that had no previous
coordination experience among them, and thus required considerable coordination
capacity on the part of the implementing agency. Simpler design adjusted to the
implementation capacity could have improved implementation and project outcomes.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's multi-disciplinary team that supervised the project was professional and
proactive, and the frequency of missions was satisfactory. During supervision missions,
the team focused on issues that affect implementation, identifying solutions, documenting
and referring them to management attention. The Bank worked closely with the
government counterpart to address the problems, and the team closely monitored
procurement and financial management, conducting post-procurement review activities.
Financial management was safeguarded and monitored, and was generally satisfactory.
Having the TTL based in the country office had a significant impact to ensure speeded


                                           22

clearance of disbursement and procurement requests from government. This contributed
in part for the turn out of the project after the mid-term review. There were frequent
supervision missions, and the team paid attention to details and the proactive stance that
the supervision team took ensured effective implementation of the MTR
recommendations to achieve the intended PDO.

It was unfortunate that the Bank team was unable to take much stronger position after the
MTR to address the monitoring and evaluation system. This could have included a
project restructure and put in place a revised results framework with clear and measurable
PDO outcome indicators.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The relevance of the project objectives is significant to Mozambique given the size of the
coastal line and the need for sustainable management of the coastal marine and
biodiversity conservation. The Bank played an important role in developing and
implementing this Project and in helping the Government of Mozambique (GoM) to
proceed with the design of the Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Management Project, the
Coastal Zone Management Strategy, and the preparation of SDPs set the basis for rational
management and use of coastal space. The construction of the Research Center in Pemba
enabled the government to start the implementation marine and coastal ecosystems
monitoring as part of a broader coastal zone management program monitoring and
evaluation plan prepared in January 2004 with the project support. The community
development, training and awareness also set the basis effective management and
protection of coastal marine and biodiversity species. Basic design issues and low level of
readiness negatively affected the implementation of the project. The project could have
benefited from better guidance at the mid-term review to improve monitoring and
evaluation. Intensive supervision by the Bank team mainly in the last two years
contributed significantly to the achievement of the PDO.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The overall Government performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Four major
shortcomings could be noted: (i) lack of adequate provision of counterpart funding
affected negatively the project performance throughout its implementation. In the first
year of project implementation, the project was not eligible to counterpart funding since it
was not registered at budget with the Ministry of Finance; (ii) delays in hiring the
consultant for the implementation of strategic development plan component affected
negatively the project; (iii) changes of Ministry staff following national elections affected
it negatively; and, (iv) implementation agencies withdrawal from the project and weak
oversight affected it negatively. As oversight institutions for the project implementation,
the sustainable development council was scheduled to meet annually, and the inter-


                                             23

institutional technical committee for the coastal zone was to meet quarterly. These bodies
never met.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The performance of the implementing agency was moderately satisfactory. At the
beginning of the project, the central institution did not have a clear strategy of inter-
institutional coordination and provision of stakeholder engagement. After the mid-term
review, the implementing agencies performance improved as a result of a better division
of responsibilities between national and provincial level institutions. The participation of
provincial district government was very positive and was crucial to achieve the PDO.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Government had very
good technical support mainly at the provincial and district levels, and this was decisive
for project delivery and achievement of the development objective. The performance of
the implementing agency and the willingness to quickly address identified problems
resulted in the increased capacity at the provincial and district levels and compensated for
the weak performance recorded in the beginning of the project.


6. Lessons Learned

The following lessons arise from a review of the CMBMP experience:

        Monitoring and evaluation system should be integral part of the design. The
        project structure and objectives had a focus on learning, but the lack of an
        adequate M&E system prevented to capture some of the lessons learned during
        implementation. From the identification the Bank should support the
        implementing agencies in establishing and maintaining a valid M&E system, in
        case of insufficient capacity.

        Modest objectives and indicators for small pilot projects. This project was
        designed as pilot which objective to test sustainable development mechanism
        involving conservation and economic activities. The project had altogether 10
        indicators which were difficult to achieve given the economic and political
        situation of the country at the time. Small project should have modest objectives
        and indicators.

        Multiple implementing agencies make implementation difficult. The number of
        agencies involved in implementation increased the complexity of the project and




                                            24

       its coordination, and made the implementation difficult. Project design should be
       kept simpler for a low capacity environment.

       Linkage between integrated development planning component with policy
       reform. A combination of integrated development planning outcomes with policy
       reform would have been beneficial to the project outcomes, by setting the legal or
       administrative basis for the use of spatial development plans after the project
       closes.

Component 4 Training and Public Awareness and Management

The training component was to focus on building capacity for the following stakeholders: (i)
technical staff of the implementing agencies, particularly at the provincial level; (ii)
communities and local resources users; (iii) local government staff and other local
administrators (traditional leaders, religious leaders, local NGOs, etc); and (iv) decision makers
in general. Three categories of training were planned: short-term, medium, and long-term
training each with its focus group. The project was to finance purchase of equipment, and
operational and incremental staff costs of the project coordination and management at the
central and local levels.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

This Annex provides a discussion and analysis of selected issues relating to the economic
and financial performance of the Project. The annex treats:
        Project economic impacts, focusing on quantifiable indicators associated with
        activities that directly generated verifiable benefits
        Project poverty impacts, focusing on cash income impacts (in lieu of consumption
        impacts) within the target beneficiary population
        Project financial sustainability impacts, focusing on potential financial exposure
        created by Project investments.

A3.1 Economic Impacts
A3.1.1 Introduction
At the time of appraisal, the project was foreseen to have a number of beneficial
economic impacts, including employment generation, reduction of non-sustainable uses
of the resource base, and diversification of incomes. Some of thee impacts would have
direct financial and cash benefits, while other economic benefits might be les readily
quantifiable. The PAD did not project or calculate an anticipated NPV or IRR for the
US$9.7 million project cost as many of the costs were for institutional capacity building
and public awareness, with no readily identifiable or capturable benefits. Moreover, the
pilot nature of the project makes economic analysis at the outset less important as
experimentation in pilot activities is routine, with economic efficiency and cost
minimization of secondary concern.

Some of the largest tangible benefits identified during the appraisal were an anticipated
US$10 to 30 million injection into the economy from private sector through concession
sales. The largest intangible benefits involved protection of coastal values in general,
which ­ for Mozambique as a whole ­ were speculated to be of the order of
US$500 million annually.

A3.1.2 Caveats and Assumptions
While it is normally more reliable to conduct economic analyses after the fact, there are a
number of factors that complicate the economic analysis in this case. These are:
        The absence of baselines and lack of a results framework for impact monitoring
        presents few verifiable indicators for economic analysis. This means that any
        economic analyses are subject to less certainty, and in many cases it is not
        possible to determine the incremental economic impacts of the Project.
        This style of project often generates some of the most significant impacts after the
        project is completed. The time scales involved with institutional capacity
        development and with the protection of critical habitats and ecosystems are
        usually of the order of decades. This suggests that even if a results framework is
        available, the impacts may not be evident from monitoring that occurs within the
        Project implementation period.
        The complexity of the project dictates that different activities cannot and (should
        not necessarily) be treated using the same analytical techniques. It is not



                                            38

         appropriate to calculate a single NPV or IRR for the entire Project. The analysis
         thus focuses on selected areas.
In conducting this analysis, common assumptions that are consistently used are:
         Costs include not just direct project expenditures but also government
         commitments and community contributions in-kind valued at market prices.
         Benefit and revenue streams generally focus on those realized during the project
         and are projected forward (past the project closing dates) based on the extant
         production processes (in the case of micro-projects) or protected ecosystem values.

Analyses relied on project design documents (PAD, MTR), monitoring and
implementation supervision reports (ISRs), and relevant consultancy outputs generated
during project execution (e.g., the December 2005 business plan for the Biodiversity and
Marine Research Centre). Macroeconomic and similar information relied on indicators
available through the World Bank databases related to Mozambique and its provinces.
For comparison purposes, information was supplemented by project information from
similar projects in the region, including the following.
         Uganda Second Environmental Management Capacity Building Project
         (EMCBP2). Supports environmental management efforts at central, district and
         community level, with complementary support to other government line agencies;
         includes small grant schemes to address community-based priorities.
         Tanzania Marine and Coastal Environment Management Project (MACEMP).
         Supports marine park establishment, offshore fisheries management, and coastal
         district planning on the Mainland and Zanzibar; includes grants through coastal
         village fund delivered using demand driven model.
         Tanzania Second Social Action Fund (TASAF2). Supports infrastructure and
         income earning demand driven projects addressing key MDG indicators; also
         used as a conduit for addressing other specific priorities relating to coastal
         management, HIV/AIDS and forestry.
         Mozambique Market Led Smallholder Development in the Zambezi Valley.
         (MLSDZV). Supports farm-based and market development for smallholder
         farmers in the Zambezi Valley; complementary investments improve prospects
         for sustainable land management and decrease vulnerability to climate change.

A3.1.3 Coastal Benefits and Impact of Institutional Strengthening
Much of the financing of the project was targeted for institutional strengthening,
including capacity building in decision support systems (such as spatial development
plans), in management systems (such as conservation area management plans), and in
human resource training. At this time, none of these plans are being implemented, hence
no direct benefits of improved management can be ascribed to the Project interventions.

It is clear, however, that coastal ecosystems do have great potential value, and any
capacity building potentially removes barriers to the realization of such values. In the
targeted provinces, for example, there are 350,000 ha of coastal marine habitat consisting
of seagrass beds, beaches, mangrove and coral reefs. Some of these areas are of regional
and global significance and are consequently targeted for eventual protection and
management. Concrete steps have been taken towards gazetting the Rovuma River



                                            39

National Reserve in Palma, and extending the existing Matibane Coastal Forest reserve in
Mossuril. Steps towards implementing management plans for these areas are also
underway. Spatial development plans are in place to assist future economic planning in
these areas. The implementation of a series of alternative income generating micro-
projects close to these areas also represents an important step to gaining local respect for
the need to protect coastal resources and their associated values.

The general literature on total economic value can potentially put a value to these areas.
Normally, the values are a function of direct and indirect uses (such as recreational values,
sustainable fisheries, coastal protection and other ecosystem function values); plus non-
uses (such as existence and bequest values). Estimation of these values is beyond the
scope of this analysis, but it is notable that similar exercises in the region have generated
significant values for various riparian and coastal functions. For example, the Zambezi
Basin Wetlands and its ecosystem functions support economic activities worth some
US$150 million annually for local residents.3 Similarly, in South Africa diverse areas of
marine habitat bordering terrestrial conservation areas have been valued in the literature
at US$155­161/ha/yr4; these estimates include recreational values and fish spawning
habitat values. If such estimates were transferable to the Cabo Delgado and Nampula
coastal marine areas, the combined value would be in the neighborhood of US$55 million
annually.

A3.1.4 Analysis of Micro-projects
The project successfully delivered 52 micro-projects in the two provinces, across a broad
range of activities. The total delivered value of these is US$700,000, with an additional
US$70,000 representing a 10% in-kind community contribution.5 Of the total funding,
40% went to Cabo Delgado and 60% went to Nampula. A summary list of micro-projects
by investment category is provided in Table A3.1.

Because the micro-project investments have not been completed at the time of this
analysis, the financial analyses of these projects was based on similar sectoral projects in
neighboring areas. The economic returns from fishery and small-scale industry projects
were assumed to be comparable to that in Tanzania in MACEMP project areas.6 Other
non-fishery micro-projects are assumed to be comparable to those being conducted as
part of the MLSDZV Project in Mozambique's Zambezi Valley. Farm level models of
various similar small-scale activities were conducted as part of the 2006 appraisal process
of the MLSDZV. These are regarded as providing a reliable comparator for impact
purposes. The methodology used to match the CMBMP project to those of the reference
projects included the following steps and assumptions:
         CMBMP projects were classified by micro-project type and industry type to
         match those of the MLSDZV or MACEMP analyses, including only income
         generating activities.
         Farm level returns from MLSDZV were transferred to CMBMP by industry type
         for all identifiable income generating projects, using the farm level models in
         MLSDZV. Fishery and related industry returns were transferred from MACEMP
         studies. This permitted estimates to be derived for micro-projects representing
         76% of the total funding.
         A weighted average of IRR and associated cash flows for these identifiable
         projects was calculated.
         For those income generating projects in CMBMP that had no comparables in
         MLSDZV or MACEMP, the weighted average IRR was assumed to hold. This
         assumption is believed to be valid in this case: as the micro-projects were self-
         selecting and demand driven, these other activities would otherwise have had a
         disproportionately large share of the total investment (if their IRR>>average), or
         would have been absent from the portfolio (if their IRR<<average).

For the impact as a whole of the micro-project component, further adjustments to the IRR
were made to reflect the investment burdens associated with the non-income earning style
of investments, and additional overhead costs of the micro-projects (see below).

The IRR results of the analyses show:
          Income earning micro-projects                                                                32.7%

The IRR excluding unmeasured benefits from avoided damages is:
          Income & non-income earning micro-projects                                                   30.0%
          All micro-projects including management overheads                                            23.3%

A3.1.5 Cost-effectiveness of Micro-project Delivery
The average overheads associated with the micro-projects in the CMBMP are 28.6% of
delivered funds; this compares favorably with similar micro-projects elsewhere in the
region delivered through WB/GEF channels. Table A3.2 provides a comparison with
other projects. The ratio is taken as:
          Micro-project Delivery Costs (incl government share and monitoring)
          Micro-project Investment amount (including community contribution)
The ratio for CMBMP represents a preliminary estimate based on information available
to final project closure and audit. It includes a pro-rata share of project management costs
for the project as a whole, and any identifiable expenditures in facilitating delivery of the
grants. It includes all projected disbursements to project closure, but excludes "after-
care" costs of monitoring. In addition, the contribution from beneficiaries themselves is
an estimate (taken as 10% of total investment) consistent with the eligibility terms of
individual micro-projects.

A3.1.6 Other Unquantifiable Economic Impacts ­ Hazard Reduction
Economic benefits are associated with demonstrable decreases in hazard incidence
(through reducing flooding impacts, for example) or through implementation of
mitigation measures to prevent hazards for affecting certain areas (e.g., oil spill
contingency planning). The Project did contain two activities that potentially reduce
hazard incidence as follows:
          Oil spill contingency planning was addressed in a brief consultancy, but no
          implementation actions materialized from the activity. No specific economic
          benefits can be ascribed because of this.
          The spatial exercises developed growth and economic development nodes that
          reflected potential areas of water scarcity and water surplus. The resultant


                                                             42

        mapping permits planning to be sensitive to hazards associated with droughts or
        flooding, making overall production within the landscape less prone to losses
        associated with such events. In the absence of a specific development plan or
        scenario, however, it is not possible to quantify the potential economic benefits
        with this effort.

A3.2 Poverty Impacts
A3.2.1 Introduction and Context
Mozambique has a comprehensive program for alleviating poverty throughout the
country, which is described diagnostically and programmatically in the Action Plan for
the Reduction of Absolute Poverty 2006-2009 (PARPA II) and forms the basis for
ongoing budget support by the international community. PARPA II describes poverty as:
        the impossibility, owing to inability and/or lack of opportunity for individuals,
        families, and communities to have access to the minimum basic conditions,
        according to the society's basic standards.
The most recent indicators of poverty show that some 10 million Mozambiquans, or
about 50% of the country, live in conditions of poverty. Poverty cannot be captured by
one indicator alone, and regional differences do exist. Historically, public service levels
tended to be highest in the South, for example, and this is reflected in higher relative
literacy levels arising from differences in educational opportunities. People in the
northern and central provinces also have had poor access to health care services and
higher rates of infant and maternal mortality, high levels of malnutrition, and low rates of
vaccination. Moreover, transportation and market services in central and northern parts of
the country were historically unreliable, which restricts the benefits to be gained from
improved market access through economic liberalization. However, despite some
narrowing of regional differences, PARPA II still calls for targeting of the poorest among
the poor, focusing among those regions and areas that have highest poverty incidence.

The provinces of Cabo Delgado and Nampula targeted by this Project are among the
poorest in the country. Table A3.3 summarizes some key indicators for these provinces
against national statistics. These can be regarded as the baseline measures.

Although it is acknowledged that poverty must be represented through a series of
traditional economic measures (such as consumption) and other indicators (such as health
and education), the focus in this section is on some of the standard income measures



                                            43

(which provide a second-best proxy for consumption) because no impact measurements
were conducted during the project period. Within this context, the analysis provides a
brief look at: (i) the income impacts of the micro-projects; and (ii) the diversity impacts
of the micro-projects. For the other non-micro-project activities, it is noted that the local
temporary impacts (i.e., excluding leakages for imports) were of the order of
US$6.2 million,7 representing an average annual impact of US$2.20 per beneficiary
within the target regions, or about 0.6% of the per capita income of US$350/yr. Many of
these benefits would not however, have accrued directly to the poor in these provinces
and, in any event, they are temporary to the extent that they represent impacts only from
expenditures during the investment period of the Project.

A3.2.2 Income Poverty Impacts of Micro-projects
The activities from which permanent impacts are possible are those relating to the micro-
projects. Most of the expenditures relating to the micro-projects were disbursed within a
single one-year period; these would have an equivalent impact of US$1.27 per
beneficiary for the last year of the project. The income stream generated by this
investment provides a permanent income equivalent to US$0.49 per capita; this
corresponds to 0.14% of the current per capita income.

A3.2.3 Diversity Impacts of Micro-projects
Although the direct poverty impacts on income may not be large, the micro-projects were
successful in stimulating a wide diversity of alternative income generating activities.
Many such funds tend to see 80% of their financing spent on only one or two repetitive
activities but the Project succeeded in stimulating nine different types of activity with no
single activity capturing more than 40% of the available funding envelope (Table A3.1).
The success in providing piloted examples of income diversification opportunities thus
provides a positive outcome of the project.

A3.3 Financial Sustainability Impacts

Project impact on financial sustainability for the country as a whole is likely negative.
The Project generates no new revenue streams, and income streams realized through the
micro-projects are minor and themselves at risk (because the Project will close with no
ability to provide a few years of critical monitoring and operating support after the
investments have been made). The primary long-term liabilities are associated with
extension services for the micro-projects and recurrent costs of the Biodiversity and
Marine Research Centre.

Micro-projects. Because the micro-projects are being undertaken at the end of the Project
life, there is no ability of the Project to provide necessary follow-up support that permits
monitoring and feedback. In the absence of such support, it is more likely that some of
these investments will fail and that potential beneficiaries will return to non-sustainable
practices. Lessons learned from other micro-project investments in sub-Saharan Africa


7The leakages are based on financial estimates in the original PAD.




                                                       44

have shown that post-investment annual extension support is required for a sustained
return on investment. A review of other such micro-projects in the region (those in
Table A3.2) suggests that the after-care costs are typically about 5%/yr of the investment
value, and should continue for two years minimum. In addition, studies elsewhere in
Mozambique (see Zambezi Valley project) suggest that annual extension services to such
activities should budget US$1 of annual maintenance costs for every US$80 of
investment. Consequently, the ongoing annual monitoring and extension support costs for
these micro-projects in the CMBMP are US$35,000 for two years after project closure
and US$9,000 annually thereafter.

A potential direct cash liability remains the Biodiversity and Marine Research Centre;
although it has flexibility in securing its own funding, its recurrent operational
requirements are estimated to exceed US$350,000 annually and are not yet entrenched in
the government budget. This amount excludes non-cash liabilities such as depreciation
(estimated at a further $250,000 annually) but includes a number of discretionary
expenses that would be readily recovered through service fees (such as laboratory
expenses and some travel costs). Based on the business plan conducted for the Centre, the
core costs of the institution excluding such discretionary expenditures are about
US$287,000 annually. It is noted that the decision to have created one large centre
instead of two smaller local centers decreases the overall operational flexibility and
sustainability because of high fixed recurrent costs. The high permanent staff cost
component in the business plan (US$216,000 annually or 75% of the overall core
operational costs) is also a concern for sustainability as such costs are difficult to reduce
in the event that revenue or donor funding targets are not achieved. By comparison, the
original project appraisal catered for two small field stations at a total cost not exceeding
US$430,000; these two stations together (at time of appraisal) were estimated to have
long-term recurrent costs of US$50,000 annually. The current facility as constructed cost
approximately US$3.4 million

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1. Introduction

The project was designed by the first government of Mozambique after the first
multiparty elections in 1994. The priorities of the government at the time were political
stability, peace, and mobilization of resources for rapid economic and social recovery of
the country after the long and destructive civil war.

The government, even with other crucial priority tasks at that the time, addressed the
country's environment concerns. Thus, it created the Ministry for Coordination of
Environmental Affairs (MICOA), putting, for the first time, the environmental agenda at
the ministerial level. The agenda was to be made operational by the National
Environmental Management Program, launched in 1994, which identified the need for
integrated coastal zone management as one of the top five priority concerns. This led to
the development of a draft National Coastal Zone Management Policy and Program (not
yet approved; and instead A National Strategy for Coastal Zone Management has been
developed and completed), which aimed at addressing coastal zone issues cross-sectoraly
in an integrated and coordinated manner.

Soon after the end of the civil war, Mozambique requested GEF and IDA funds to pilot
an integrated approach to achieving sustainable development, taking into account
Mozambique's coastal zone is uniqueness in the Eastern Africa Marine Region. Most
areas were still in pristine conditions but under threat due to rapid increase of
development activities. The project was to one in a series of steps towards developing
integrated coastal zone management process for the entire country.

The project was within the context of existing and proposed Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for Mozambique, which focused on poverty alleviation through
environmentally and socially sustainable economic growth. The project also fitted well
with GEF Biodiversity Operational Strategy and Operational Program on Coastal and
Marine Ecosystems, by stressing in situ conservation activities of coastal and marine
ecosystems, and supporting conservation and sustainable use of vulnerable marine
habitats and species, justifying, in this way, GEF support.

Project Development Objectives and key indicators

    Test and refine an approach to achieve sustainable economic development of coastal
    zone resources, through an integrated strategic development planning process that
    integrates their ecological, social, economic and physical values and balances the
    varying interests involved.

Key Indicators (reflecting changes at mid-term review) to measure progress toward the
development objective were the following:




                                            50

(i)    Strategic development plans adopted and under implementation by provincial and
       national government in the two project areas (4 coastal districts);
(ii)   Strategic Development Plans endorsed and under implementation in at least two
       districts in the Project Areas by the fourth Project Year
(iii)  All new concessions issued in at least two districts of the Project Areas are in
       compliance with SDPs by the fourth Project or after 6 months of endorsement of
       said plans, whichever is earlier;
(iv)   Management Plan for at least one identified conservation area is endorsed by the
       Borrower and under implementation by the end of the fourth Project year;
(v)    Monitoring and Evaluation Plan prepared by Mid-Term Review and fully
       operational by the end of third Project Year ;
(vi)   At least five community development projects identified by the end of the Project
       Year;
(vii)  Training Program for Part D of the Project developed and under implementation
       by the end of the fourth Project Year
(viii) Increased Involvement of NGOs in monitoring and implementation of the Project
       by the end of the fourth Project Year
(ix)   Improved coordination achieved by the fourth Project Year among stakeholders
       evidenced by the # of recorded agreements from regular management meetings of
       the Borrower's National Steering Committee

Key indicator (reflecting changes at mid-term review) to measure the progress toward the
global objective was:

(i)    Institutional capacity evaluated as sufficiently improved to allow broader
       implementation; and
(ii)   Area and number of globally significant habitats and species under some level of
       restricted use increased

Main Beneficiaries

The main target groups of the project were (i) the governmental entities (resource
managers and decision-makers), mainly at provincial (Nampula and Cabo-Delgado
Provinces) and district levels (Mossuril District and Nacala-Porto Municipality, and
Mocímboa da Praia and Palma Districts), and (ii) local communities, by testing and
refining mechanisms for integrating their economic development aspirations with the
requirements of biodiversity conservation at the provincial and district level.

The project was also to benefit (iii) the private sector, and (iv) NGOs by testing
mechanisms for establishing partnerships (public-private sector) for management and
sustainable use of natural resources.

Project Components- Reflecting MTR Changes




                                           51

Component 1: Integrated Development Planning. These plans were to fully integrate
conservation with regional development. This component included the preparation,
discussion, agreement with stakeholders, and implementation of spatial development
plans in four pilot districts, and that all new concessions issued, by the end of the project,
would have to be in compliance with these plans. For this end, there would be testing and
refinement of mechanisms for integrating economic development aspirations of
provincial government and local communities with the requirements of biodiversity
conservation at the provincial and district level.

Component 2: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Community Development.
Establishment and strengthen protection of key terrestrial and marine conservation areas
and initiation of conservation-oriented community activities in and around these areas.
This component was to involve testing mechanisms to identify and sustainable use and
conserve important components of coastal and marine biological diversity in at least 3
pilot districts, by (i) preparing, discussing and agreeing with key stakeholders the
management plans for at least two identified conservation areas; (ii) increasing the area
classified as under full or partial conservation status; (iii) implementation of on-going
biological monitoring; (iv) identification and implementation of community micro-
projects; and (v) identification of suitable financing modalities.

Component 3: Private Sector Component. Designed to establish best practice for
environmentally and biodiversity-friendly economic development. This was to be
achieved by preparation of a concession tender for one project pilot area specifying the
minimum environmental, social and technical performance requirements of the proponent,
and the responsibilities of other stakeholders. The specifications of bid documents would
have to be prepared and agreed by stakeholders, and an investor would have to be
identified and negotiations ready to begin by the end of the project.

Component 4: Training, Public Awareness, Project Monitoring and Coordination.
Capacity building and public awareness rising of key government and non-government
stakeholders responsible for biodiversity protection. This component would be achieved
by strengthening capacity for management of coastal and marine biological diversity at
national and local level of government. This component was also to improve institutional
arrangements for devolving coastal and marine resource planning at provincial and local
levels. This was to be achieved by increasing coordination among stakeholders and
establishment of a monitoring system to facilitate sustainable use of coastal and marine
resources in pilot districts.


2. Project Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation

Implementation. The overall implementation of the project was satisfactory.
Implementation was delayed during the first years of implementation due to the
following:




                                             52

        Difficulties in accomplishing component one (the core engine for the entire
        project), due to delays in hiring the consultant, and low performance of the
        consultant, which ended up by termination of the contract;

        Financial management problems, including lack of counter-part funding and
        inadequate financial management capacity at the project level; and

        Low efficiency of project management due to lack of familiarity with World Bank
        rules and procedures.

All these issues have been adequately addressed throughout the life of the project, mainly
after the mid-term review mission (where the main restructuring element was the
decentralization of project implementation down to provincial level). Component one
was redirected to use DANIDA ICZM Project approach and produce Macro Zoning Plans
for the four IDA/GEF areas; counter-part funds were made available from the
Mozambique Government; and financial and project management improved significantly.


Monitoring and Evaluation. A Plan for monitoring and evaluation was produced, but not
implemented, due to its complexity. Attempts to simplify did not also work. But a
consultant was engaged to simplify and implement the M&E System to measure (i)
progress towards anticipated project outcomes; (ii) factors contributing to, or impeding
outcomes; (iii) contribution to outcomes through outputs; and (iv) the effectiveness of
strategic partnership.

3. Project Achievements of the Outputs Indicators

Assessment of outputs was based on the revised log-frame produced in the Mid-Term
Review. Most of planned outputs were fully achieved. Details can be seen below.

3. Sustainability

Plans to implement spatial development plans. SDPs and Macro-zoning plans have been
produced, for entire project area, and delivered to provincial and district authorities.
Macro-zoning plans were used for definition of Rovuma National Reserve and to the
production of the proposal for trans-frontier conservation area between Mozambique and
Tanzania. Actions will have to be followed mainly by MICOA and MITUR, from the
Mozambican side to follow up this process.

In relation to SDPs, cost-benefits and economic analysis should be produced to easily
guide their implementation by the local level authorities.

The whole country is presently engaged in the production and implementation of District
Development Plans, following the new development approach which focuses to the
district as the center. This offers a very good opportunity to quickly widespread the
inclusion into these DDPs, the spatial component. This aspect has been raised many times,
and follow-up activities, started by this project with workshops in Beira and Maputo,
involving MICOA, the Ministry of Planning and Development, and many others, are
underway, with MICOA (DINAPOT) assuming the central role, taking in account its
expertise in this area.

The challenge is to simplify the process of producing spatial development plans, which
are based on "high tech" processed information, mainly using GIS, and high skills in
computing. These skills which are rare at provincial and districts (in fact even at central
level) are the bottle neck for quick adoption, production and implementation of spatial
development plans throughout the country.

Long-term staffing plans for the research center in Pemba. In the initial project design
(see the Project Appraisal Document), in support of the coastal zone management
decentralization strategy and monitoring and evaluation system, the operation included
support for the establishment and operation of two field stations. MICOA and UEM
would assume the recurrent costs of the two stations following project completion.
During operation implementation, UEM showed unwillingness to own one of the stations,
and therefore MICOA had to engage alone in the process and instead of two, only one
research station was built in Pemba. The size and overll quality of infra-structures, and
equipment, represent an extraordinary gain to the country. This can be illustrated by the
huge interest shown by the different national, regional and international institutions in
quickly starting to use it. Several proposals have been presented. CEPAM is one of
concrete elements that will contribute to follow up activities, after operation completion
in promoting sustainable use of coastal and marine resources.

The project has established an installing commission to prepare the start of CEPAM
activities before the end of the project, or soon after the end. A series of activities were



                                           57

carried out by this commission, under DNGA and Project Management Team supervision,
including the inauguration of CEPAM, and production of a series of proposals for quick
start of the center, including the personnel for the initial phase. This was approved and
advertisements were made throughout the country, using the most important newspapers.
Actions are currently underway for contracting the staff to the centre. A coordinator was
appointed within MICOA staff and placed in Pemba to guide the start of functioning of
CEPAM.

Furthermore, a series of meetings, including one regional workshop were organized by
this commission, under MICOA supervision, with participation of different national
entities, like the Ministry for Science and Technology, Ministry of Fisheries, Universities,
Provincial Government, Private Sector, foreign entities, like the Oceanographic Research
Institute of South Africa, Institute of Marine Sciences of Zanzibar, Western Indian Ocean
Marine Sciences Association, etc. These events identified development potentialities of
the Research Center of Marine and Coastal Environment (CEPAM), including potential
partners and funding opportunities. Some concrete research/training projects/programs,
with secured funding, have been identified for immediate implementation. Activities have
already initiated regarding monitoring of artisan fisheries for the whole Cabo-Delgado
Province, in coordination with IIP. Actions are underway to start this year the installation
of a national aquaculture training facility within the center, in cooperation with IIP, the
School of Marine Sciences in Quelimane, and the University of Bangor (Wales, United
Kingdom); and a regional course on integrated coastal zone management will be carried
out, in the center, later this year, supported by the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science
Association (WIOMSA).

Some of the institutions allocated their staff to help CEPAM start with the activities, and
capacitate the new recruited people.

4. Assessment of Bank and Government Performance

World Bank

Team Composition and Quality of Supervision. Composition of Bank team was generally
good, made up by high profile and experienced people, and covering a wide range of
expertise, from environment, natural resources, biodiversity, ecology, social aspects,
economics, finances, procurement, and other technical areas. Supervisions missions were
regular and were successful in identifying problems and quickly find solutions of the
problems identified. However, some of the recommendations were, in some cases, more
theoretical, that is, not fully reflecting the reality of the country and wishes of the national
institutions. This could be in part due to low involvement or perception of the national
entities in the supervision process and can be illustrated by the recommendations given to
Component one, under the Mid-Term Review process, which faced many problems for
their implementation, including their recognition by some important participating
institutions. Other examples are several steps recommended by the Mid-Term Review
that were never implemented. This confused participating stakeholders, created delays in
project implementation and affected the project performance, to some extent.



                                              58

The Social Adviser appointed under the project to advise the government on community
development had unfortunately failed to produce any of the outputs required by the terms
of reference, and thus the contract was terminated.

Rely on consultants for different activities of the project on consultancies, although in
most cases, excluding the production of SDPs, produced quick and good quality results,
affected significantly capacity building in the national participating institutions, and
consequently sustainability for implementation of similar activities in the future.

Related to supervision missions, different perceptions of members of each supervision
mission resulted in different recommendation in each mission. An example is the agency
accounts, recommended by one group and cancelled by another. Other example is the
substantial changes in approach, from one mission to other. In fact the request to the
agencies to return back the funds made available to their accounts for implementation of
activities of the project was determinant on the loose of interest to the project by
implementing agencies, less than the lack of experience in coordination.

It should be highlighted, however, that the team composition and quality of supervision
was good and beneficial for project implementation.

Financial Management and Procurement. With the exception of misunderstandings that
happened at the beginning of the project, which ended with other central institutions
having to refund back the funds to MICOA, the performance of Bank team was in general
good. They helped to timely identify the problems and indicate the right solutions,
according to Bank procedures.

Government Performance

Overall Government Performance. Government performance was significantly low in the
first years of project implementation, and improved continuously and reasonable towards
the end of the project. This illustrated by (i) the lack of government contribution funds for
more than one year after Credit and Grant effectiveness, due to non inscription of the
project at the government budget; (ii) delay in hiring the consultant for SDPs, affecting,
in this way, timed project implementation; (iii) unclear strategy for inter-institutional
coordination and provision of incentives for stakeholder engagement and ownership. It
should be highlighted that this low performance was partly due to lack of technical skills
of the technical people initially allocated to the project management team, and that,
because of that, had to be changed. Their replacement was not immediate, affecting, in
this way, the project, during the initial phases. There other factors were lack of familiarity
with Bank procedures on procurement, disbursement and financial management capacity
both at the national and at the provincial level.

Inter-institutional coordination was heavily affected, since the time the central involved
institutions had to refund the money back to MICOA, and also because the NIITC
(National Inter-Institutional Technical Committee for Coastal Zone), which until the start



                                            59

of this project used to function and serve as the national coordinating committee, failed to
function properly from then until today. Lack of functioning of NIITC can be attributed
to desegregation of coordination of coastal management issues between the Department
for Coastal Zone Management, and Centre for Sustainable Development, which formerly
were forming the Unit for Coastal Zone Management. This desegregation was not only
structural, but also geographical.

It should be underlined that government performance increased significantly towards the
end of the project, mainly after mid-term review mission when it was decided that
national levels activities would be limited to (i) policy and program coordination; and (ii)
administrative and service providing functions to provinces in the areas of financial
management. Project activities would be implemented at the provincial level. This was
decided due to complexity of project design and lack of ownership of the project by
partner agencies.

High rotation of staff at MICOA involved in project management affected negatively the
project. After the elections of 2000, and 2004 there was high rotation of staff and this
affected negatively the performance of MICOA on its coordinating role.

Furthermore, the National Steering Committee (NSC), which included provincial
governors, and expected to give ministerial oversight on the CMBMP, although had some
meetings, did not function effectively, mainly on maintaining close ties with the activities
implemented by the project, in order to give timed guidance and in gathering and
analyzing the lessons learned from pilot activities for adoption at national policy level.

At the provincial/district levels, coordination was to be facilitated through local
coordination units formed for this purpose. There was a delay at the start of this project in
appointing the provincial field coordinators. These affected project implementation.
Other important aspect, which had a negative impact on project implementation at
provincial level, was the changing of provincial governors, after the elections of 2000 and
2004, taking into account their important role in the coordination of the project at
provincial level.

5. Lessons Learned

During project implementation there were some difficulties and challenges that the lssons
learned could be built one:

    Project implementation arrangements should take in account the number of
    implementing agencies involved. The bigger the number, the simpler should be the
    arrangements. Otherwise implementation would be so complex that would affect the
    success of the project. Other aspects should also be equally considered like the
    capacity of the agencies involved, strengths and weaknesses, experiences, history of
    coordination among them, etc.
    For implementing successfully the project from right the start, details related to
    financial management capacity of the main coordinating agency, which will handle



                                           60

financial aspects, should be thoroughly addressed. This includes a good knowledge of
Bank procedures, otherwise training should be done at the start. Also keeping the
same advisory team of WB, during the missions, is extremely important at the initial
phases to keep consistency with the recommendations.
Any change in the institutional set up of the main implementing agencies, mainly
soon after elections and appointment of new governments, with consequent change of
key project personnel should be immediately addressed since can highly affect project
implementation. This can be achieved by sending supervision missions soon after
appointment of new governments.
Monitoring and Evaluation is crucial for good project implementation, for easy
lessons learning process, and for keeping sustainability by the involved stakeholders.
M&E have to be implemented throughout the life of the project and for that end it
should be as easy as possible and practical to be implemented.
The use of consultancies for project implementation, although important and
sometime inevitable, should be, as much as possible, limited to the minimum
indispensable in order to guarantee sustainability and maximize capacity building for
the involved stakeholders.
During supervision mission a wide range of national stakeholders should be contacted
and deeply involved, paying special attention to their level of understanding, capacity,
commitments and willingness to implement the recommendations taken.
Good choice of consultants and very close evaluation of their performance should be
undertaken, and whenever low performance or deviation is detected, very strict
measures should be applied to safeguard suitable project implementation.
