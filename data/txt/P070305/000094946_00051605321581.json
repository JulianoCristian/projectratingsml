This pilot project is part of a long-term\n            national coastal zone program, designed to subsequently\n            adopt, and broadly replicate through the entire coastal\n            zone. The project components will fully integrate\n            conservation with regional development, and, establish, and\n            strengthen protection of key terrestrial, and marine\n            conservation areas, initiating conservation-oriented\n            community activities in those areas, through a spatial\n            development plan. Best practices will be established for a\n            bio-diversity friendly economic development, while, capacity\n            building, and public awareness will raise key government,\n            and non-government stakeholders responsibility for\n            bio-diversity protection.
