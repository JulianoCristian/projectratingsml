and\n            Extension Project aims to improve the efficiency of\n            Guinea's agricultural research and extension services,\n            and develop an institutional framework for promoting\n            farmer's organizations. The main objective being to\n            assist farmers who operate at a very low level of technology\n            in improving the productivity of their farming systems.\n            These objectives will be accomplished through: (a) providing\n            the support to plan, manage, and monitor a National Research\n            and Extension Program; (b) funding and expanding commodity\n            research; (c) testing of locally available crop varieties\n            and production techniques; and (d) creation and\n            consolidation of links among research, extension, and\n            farmers. Further, the project will also provide for the\n            development of an institutional framework for promoting\n            farmer organizations and a major training program to develop\n            the Guinean capacity for designing, managing, and\n            implementing research and extension operations."}, "docdt": "1988-08-24T00:00:00Z"}
