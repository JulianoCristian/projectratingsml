Agricultural\n            Research and Extension Project for Guinea was satisfactory.\n            The project achieved most of its objectives, institutional\n            development was partially achieved, sustainability is\n            likely, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, a project design which combines research and\n            extension within one agricultural services project, such as\n            in NAREP, is more likely to succeed if it builds on the\n            synergy of the two services. Second, the institutional\n            relationship between research and extension needs to be\n            clarified early on so that one service does not overshadow\n            the other. Third, the Bank needs to assess more\n            realistically the Borrower's capacity to provide\n            counterpart funds in a timely manner. Finally, the Bank\n            should be more even-handed in its supervision of project components."}, "docdt": "1997-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
