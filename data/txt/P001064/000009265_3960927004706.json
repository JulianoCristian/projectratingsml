The main objective being to\n            assist farmers who operate at a very low level of technology\n            in improving the productivity of their farming systems.\n            These objectives will be accomplished through: (a) providing\n            the support to plan, manage, and monitor a National Research\n            and Extension Program; (b) funding and expanding commodity\n            research; (c) testing of locally available crop varieties\n            and production techniques; and (d) creation and\n            consolidation of links among research, extension, and\n            farmers. Further, the project will also provide for the\n            development of an institutional framework for promoting\n            farmer organizations and a major training program to develop\n            the Guinean capacity for designing, managing, and\n            implementing research and extension operations."}, "docdt": "1988-08-24T00:00:00Z"}
