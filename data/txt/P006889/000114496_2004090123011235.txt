Re:
Colombia: Public Financial Management Project
Loan No. 3669-CO - Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Dear Dr. Ocampo:
1.
Please refer to the Loan Agreement for the above Project between Colombia (the 
Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) 
dated February 9, 1994 (the Loan Agreement), as amended as of August 25, 1996, and to 
the letter dated April 15, 1997 of the Project Coordination Committee (COCOR) on the 
subject.
2.
Two amendments to the Loan Agreement have been requested. First, raising the 
aggregate limit set forth in paragraph C.2 of Section I of Schedule 4 to the Loan 
Agreement for procurement of mini-computers, other goods related to mini-computer 
systems and miscellaneous office equipment and supplies, through shopping from the 
equivalent of US$1.0 million to the equivalent of US$2.0 million. Second, reallocation 
of Loan proceeds between some of the Categories set forth in the table in paragraph 1 
of  Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement, as follows:
(i)
decreasing by 6,600,000 the amount allocated to Category (1);
(ii)
decreasing by 100,000 the amount allocated to Category (4); and
(iii)
increasing by 6,700,000 the amount allocated to Category (2).
3.
As regards the first amendment, keeping in view the fact that procurement of 
goods through shopping procedures is to be resorted to only in exceptional cases and 
that, as far as the DIAN is concerned, additional mini-computer systems needed to meet 
emergent requirements can be procured by utilizing the quantity variation clause of 
the contract recently and competitively awarded under the Project, I am pleased to 
inform you that the Bank agrees to raise the aggregate limit for procurement through 
shopping procedures to US$1.5 million. Accordingly, Paragraph 2 of Part C of Section 1 
of Schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement will be amended to read as follows:
      “2.
Goods referred to in 1 above and miscellaneous office equipment and 
supplies may be procured after soliciting price quotations from reputable suppliers to 
the extent that each contract, and the aggregate of all contracts, so awarded do not 
exceed the equivalent of $100,000 and $1,500,000, respectively; provided, however, 
that if any such contract is estimated to cost $50,000 or more, the list of suppliers 
to be used and the specific procedures to be followed shall be previously agreed 
between the Borrower and the Bank.” 
4.
Further, I am pleased to inform you that the Bank agrees to the proposed 
reallocation of Loan amounts between the different Categories of the table, as shown 
in paragraph 2 of this letter. Accordingly, such table is hereby revised as shown in 
Annex 1.
5.
If you are in agreement with the terms of this letter and the amendment proposal 
in its entirety, please sign on behalf of the Borrower, as its representative under 
Section 7.01 of the Loan Agreement, the form of confirmation attached to this letter. 
Once the said form has been signed, kindly have it sent to us for our records.
Sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
