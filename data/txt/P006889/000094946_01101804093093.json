outcome is\n            satisfactory, sustainability highly likely, and\n            institutional development impacts are high. It is important\n            to note that the accurate project design - aimed at\n            supporting second generation reforms, and at building on the\n            previous public financial management operation - was\n            conducive to the achievement of complex, and far-reaching\n            institutional changes, supported by long-term commitments\n            and a continuity approach by both the Bank, and Government.\n            But regardless of success, lessons also indicate that\n            although computerization is necessary to improve revenue\n            administration, and public expenditures, it is not\n            sufficient; rather, underlying institutional weaknesses\n            should be addressed: it is suggested that to achieve lasting\n            results, the appropriate institutional development approach\n            should be adopted, dealing with issues relating to normative\n            framework, human resources, organizational, management, and\n            business processes. However, to build support for\n            institutional reforms, clear links between system\n            improvements, and broader social goals (e.g., transparency,\n            accountability, and citizen participation) should be\n            established. In addition, in light of the various autonomous\n            agencies involved in the project, the Coordination\n            Committee, in order to manage operations, and resolve\n            technical issues, should have set coordination arrangements."}, "docdt": "2001-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
