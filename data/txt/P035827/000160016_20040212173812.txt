Background

1.        The Integrated    Child Development        Services (ICDS)       program    was established    in 1975 and
is India's response to meeting       the challenge     of the basic biological     and social needs of women
and children   of poorest households.        It currently   reaches out to 33.2 million      children and 6.2
million   pregnant   and lactating   women through        600,000   village centers.    India's tenth plan has
allocated more than USD 400 million             annually  for ICDS.     A large portion    of the expansion   of the
ICDS program      has been assisted by IDA since 199 1 through              4 projects.  This proposed    project
restructuringis a continuationof the agreementbetweenthe Bank andGovernmentof India to
move to a more holistic       "program"    approach and to build a medium           and long term vision for
reduction   of malnutrition     through   ICDS in India.

2.        Malnutrition    is the single most important       human development         indicator  in India that
continues   to show poor progress despite the large investments              made in nutrition,    health, education
and poverty    alleviation.    Indirectly,  this is also the most significant      indicator   and has affected
learning   outcomes     in children  and subsequently      productivity     of large number    of poor people, and
has hindered    economic     progress of poorest households.         The restructured      project will have a
strategic multi-sectoral     approach based on lessons learnt from earlier IDA assistance to ICDS and
will improve    outcomes     in reduction   of severe and moderate        child malnutrition     over the medium
andlong term. The adolescentgirls' componentof this project will specifically addressesgirl
child issues and attempt at breaking        the intergenerational      cycle of malnutrition.

3         The objectives    of ICDS are to improve         the health and nutrition     status of children  under
six years of age, with special emphasis on O-3 years old, pregnant-lactating                 women    and
adolescent   girls, and to lay foundations       for proper psychological,       physical and social development
through   providing    early childhood     education    to children   3-6 years of age. Earlier IDA assistance
to two ICDS projectsmainly aimedat expandingservicedelivery. In ongoingassistanceto the
program,    the primary    emphasis has moved from ensuring coverage to improving                  access, service
quality,  and cost effectiveness.       There is a continuing     dialogue    with Government      of India and the
states in order to review national       nutrition  policies and activities     of ICDS that directly address
malnutrition   outcomes.      The proposed restructuring        of the WCD project is an outcome          of
intensive   consultations   on service quality improvement          initiatives   that will better address
development     outcomes     of the project.

4         The earlier projects also invested in considerable           infrastructure   development     and program
expansion.    However,     consistent with the poverty       focus of the Bank, these projects were located
in four states (Andhra     Pradesh, Orissa, Madhya         Pradesh, and Bihar) with high rates of
malnutrition andhigh proportionsof their populationsliving in poverty.ICDS I closedin 1998,
fully disbursed.    However,     the impact objective      was met only in Andhra Pradesh but not in
Orissa.   ICDS II closed in 2002 and also disbursed fully.             The end-line    evaluation   for ICDS I was
completed    after the ICR was written        and reported   unsatisfactory     achievement     on development
objectives.   ICDS II which was restructured           late in the project cycle was also unable to achieve

                                                           2


satisfactory  development       objectives.   This was also due to the fact that the task team did not
attempt to revise the key impact and performance             indicators  according   to the needs of project
implementation.      However,     it is important  to note that the ICDS II project has been successful in
expanding    service delivery     of ICDS in the poorest states on very large scales and in the long term
development     assistance framework,        the services of ICDS will be vital in achieving        the
millennium developmentgoalsfor India. It is critical thatthesestatesalsocontinueto be funded
for sustained gains in reducing        child malnutrition.

Implementation        Progress     and Rationale     for Restructuring

5         The WCD project was approved            by the ITF committee      on June 29, 1998 and made
effective  on October 4, 1999. Although           the project was approved      and processed as an ITF Credit,
the Interim Trust Fund wasterminatedin accordancewith IDA/R2001-0071datedMay l&2001.
Under the provisions      of IDA/R200      l-007 1 (paragraphs     7-9 "Termination"),     upon termination    ITF
creditsbecomepart of IDA generalresourcesandIDA may act for itself with regardto such
resources rather than as administrator         for ITF.   The approval    of the Executive    Directors  of IDA is
thereforebeing soughtfor this amendment.Therewasa long delayin project effectivenessdue
to the Government      of India and the states' having to obtain administrative           and financial  approvals
as well as preparing     the implementation       plans for the very large national     training  component
(US$lOOmillion)       that was added on to the project at negotiation.          In view of delayed
implementation      in the initial project year, the Bank's task team flagged it as a "problem           project"
in June 2000.     Continuous     close monitoring     of implementation     and an early assessment of savings
due to rupee devaluation,       was jointly   done by the Bank and Government           of India, as a result of
which Governmentof India approachedthe Bank with arestructuringproposalin November
2000.

6         While discussions were ongoing           with the Department     of Women     and Child Development,
Government      of India, Department       of Economic     Affairs  also approached    the Bank for re-
allocation   of US$60     million    towards  the Gujarat Earthquake      Reconstruction      Program.   This was
approved    by the Bank in 2001 with an understanding             that supplemental    IDA would be made
availableif requiredin the laterprojectyears.

7         Subsequently,basedon the agreementwith Departmentof Women andChild
Development       substantive   changes in project activities are now being introduced           in order to
improve focuson the developmentoutcomes. WCD hasbeenremovedfrom the list of "problem
projects"  in June 2001.     The review mission in December           2002 and mid term review
consultations   in May 2003 have indicated          sustained improvement       in project implementation.
Disbursement     to date is SDR 103.2 million,        which is 46.4% of the original      credit.  There are large
statements   of expenses awaiting        approval   of this amendment     in this project.   This will improve
disbursements     considerably      in the remaining   period of the project.    The proposal     submitted  by
Government      of India for restructuring     is for SDR 97 million     for the remaining     project period.

8         Close supervision     and dialogue     on critical guiding   principles  of restructuring   has led the
Departmentof Woman andChild Developmentto look into issuesof programaccess,targeting,
quality of services and impact.         For example,    there is more emphasis of the program         on reaching
out to under threes.     The recent ICDS national        data has indicated    a 31.4% increase in registration
of six months to three year old children         in the program    between   March 2001 and March 2002.
Similarly   registration   of 3-6 year old children     in the same period has increased by 29.9%.
However,this needsto berevalidatedin the courseof the implementationof the WCD project in
order to confirm     that this increase is not merely due to expansion         of services in new blocks but

                                                            3


also in terms of children      actually receiving     services at each village center.     Another    good
initiative  in targeting  ICDS to the poorest households           has resulted through    a government      directive
issued in order to relocate the existing centers to hamlets and unreached               localities  within   the
village.   Staff recruitment     has been completed       in all project states and pre-service     training  is also
progressing    well.   Under the assistance of the WCD project, the basic ICDS training                 curricula  has
beenrevisedafter 1991in 2003. This curriculanow formally introducesthebehaviorchange
module    for all ICDS functionaries.

9.        There have been significant         delays in receipt of audit reports from the implementing
states in the past leading to suspension of disbursements.              A time-bound     action plan has been
agreed with the Borrower         for submission     of these overdue audit reports.      All audit reports for the
year 2OOL 02 have been received except for the state of Jammu and Kashmir.                       It has been agreed
with theborrowerthat expenditure             in respect of the state of Jammu and Kashmir          would not be
claimed from the bank and would be met out of the counterpart                 funding.

Proposed     Restructuring

10        This restructuring     proposes to emphasize the implementation            of the software
components,     (i) particularly    to address targeting    of the under-three    year old children,    and (ii) the
intergenerational     malnutrition    cycle by focusing     on reduction    of adolescent    anemia on a large
scale in the project    states. It will also facilitate    program    decentralization   in order to strengthen
field level institutional   and technical      capacities.  This restructuring    also proposes to consolidate
gains made by earlier IDA assisted projects and initiate dialogue               for new assistance.     Specifically
therestructuringwill follow the guiding principles asbelow:

* improving accessof ICDS to thepooresthouseholds;
* targeting   under-three    year old children      especially by focusing     on improving     home     based infant
     feeding practices;
* implementing       Communications         for Behavior    Change (CBC) effectively;       and
* implementing       the Adolescent      Girls' Component      effectively.

11        The WCD project        supports the core ICDS activities         (Service Delivery    and Program
Support) in the states of Maharashtra,          Rajasthan,   Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.
Additionally,    it also assisted ICDS training       nationally   (all states and Union    Territories).    The
proposedamendmentseeksto (i) scaleup therevisedadolescentgirls' schemein selectedstates;
(ii) strengthen   training  infi-astructure    at the village level by creation of cluster resource centers in
selected states; (iii) provide     more funds for state specific high impact innovations            in selected
states; (iv) fund enhanced       field staff   remuneration     in project states and some selected states; and
also (v) fund core ICDS activities         in the states of Uttaranchal,    Chhattisgarh,    Jharkhand,    Madhya
Pradesh, Bihar, and Orissa. The reallocation           within    components    has been made accordingly         to
achieve the above.

12.       This amendment        is retroactive   from November       1,200O with a view that the bifurcated
states(Chhattisgarhfrom Madhya PradeshandJharkhandfrom Bihar) be fundedeligible service
delivery   and program     support activities     from their date of creation, and the states of Madhya
Pradesh and Bihar be funded          eligible   service delivery and program       support activities   that could
not be funded     under the Bank assisted ICDS II project           (Cr. 2470-IN,    closed on January 3 1,2003)
as IDA was reallocated       to the Gujarat Earthquake       Reconstruction      Program.

                                                        4


13        The disbursement     percentages   for the retroactive   period for the mentioned      states are
being retained as in the ICDS II project as the Gujarat Earthquake reallocation             was not recouped,
and the project agreements      for Chhattisgarh    and Jharkhand     could not be signed within      the closing
date of the ICDS II project as requested by the Borrower.            In view of the delay in signing the
project agreements,     or seeking supplementary      IDA for the ICDS II project,       for the bifurcated
statesthe Bank suggestedthatthesestatesbe includedand fundedundertherestructuredWCD
project.   The Borrower    has agreed to this provided      the same financing     plan is retained   for the
retroactiveperiod for the erstwhileICDS II states.

14.       The revised key performance       monitoring    indicators   have included    monitoring    of the
access of services to the poorest households.        The revised ICDS curricula        will be implemented     in
all project blocks particularly    to address under threes and improved         home based feeding and
caringpractices. The scalingup of the adolescentgirls activities particularly the micro-nutrient
intervention   of iron supplementation     will address intergenerational      malnutrition   in all project
states.District pilots onhigh impact activities will allow for closemonitoring of revisedproject
strategies and impact achievement.

15        The impact objectives     will be evaluated   in the original   project states. However,      the
   l


overall changes in the national     training  strategy and the constitution     of cluster resource centers
(establishing   model village centers) under the program        support component       will aim at quick
service quality improvement       across the national   program.     A third party evaluation     of the national
training  under the restructured    project is underway     that will evaluate service quality improvement
and training   impact.

16        The proposal reduces the original      rupee outlays of the current five project       states to
emphasizeperformancebasedfunding. Thereis a 74% downwardrevision in the categoryfor
medicines    and medical   supplies and a 54% upward        revision in the category for civil works, as the
provision   of medicine   kits for all states and union territories    under the project has been replaced
by the creation of cluster level training    infrastructure.    The medicine     kits are now being funded
out of the government's      planned budget.     There is a 99% upward      revision in incremental
operatingandmaintenancecostasthe honorariaof the field basedstaff hasrecentlybeenrevised
by the government     for the overall ICDS program        in the country.   The details of this restructuring
havebeendiscussedwith the Governmentof India, the concernedstates,andtheproject
implementing      agencies.

17        Finally, based on the lessons learnt from earlier IDA assistance to ICDS, this
restructuring   proposes to reassess the ICDS program         at the macro level, as well as review the
Bank's project design, for example,       drop the legal covenant      on supplementary     feeding and
emphasize instead on a behavior        change communication       strategy within    the existing training   and
other quality improvement       components.     Accordingly,    revised key performance       monitoring
indicators  have been agreed with the borrower.         Baseline and end line data from Bank assisted
projectshasprovidedadditional analysisof the program/projectimpact. This will form thebasis
for dialogue   with Government      of India for further assistance to ICDS.        However,    the stated
developmentobjectivesof the WCD project still remainrelevantto this restructuredphase.

18        The main project risks include the failure to improve         targeting,  failure to increase training
quality and outcomes,     and the failure to improve     overall monitoring     and evaluation    in the project.
These are modest risks as the ICDS program          is undergoing     considerable   reform,   especially in
termsof servicequality improvement. On thebasisof this restructuring,the project is expected
to disburse fully and meet its development        outcomes.
