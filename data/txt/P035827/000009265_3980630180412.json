of pre-school-aged\n            children and women, by increasing the quality, impact, and\n            cost-effectiveness of the Integrated Child Development\n            Services (ICDS) program. There are 4 components. The first\n            consists of two subcomponents: 1) It strengthens service\n            delivery at the village level. It finances supplies,\n            equipment, medicines and medical supplies as well as\n            incremental operating costs for supplemental feeding of\n            children up to 6 years, pregnant and lactating women, and\n            adolescent girls; and regularly monitors malnutrition. It\n            immunizes against 6 childhood diseases to reduce infant and\n            child mortality; and provides appropriate and timely health\n            care. It promotes overall psychosocial development of the\n            child, including pre-school education, and promotes\n            caregiver awareness. 2) It provides adolescent girls with\n            iron supplements and de-worming treatment. The second\n            component 1) supplies equipment at the district, state, and\n            central project management unit (CPMU) levels, as well as\n            vehicles, salaries, rent, and other operating costs; 2)\n            strengthens district training teams; and 3) supports\n            material and media services, communication training and\n            campaigns as well as community mobilization activities.\n            Component 3 establishes a central management unit (CPMU) at\n            the center. Component 4 trains staff, strengthens or sets up\n            training centers, establishes training teams, and develops\n            training materials."}, "docdt": "1998-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
