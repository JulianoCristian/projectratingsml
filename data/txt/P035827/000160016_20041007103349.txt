                            B. Backgroundon Polio Eradication

2.       Global situation. Tremendous progress hasbeen made inthe global fight against
polio since 1988, when the World Health Assembly resolved to eradicate the disease.
The Bank has beensupporting the Global Polio EradicationInitiative, the largest
internationalpublic health effort to date, from its beginning. After 15 years that
galvanized the support o f more than 200 countries and an international investment o f
US$ 3 billion, the number o fpolio cases world-wide has decreased from an estimated
350,000 in 1988 to under 700 cases in2003. By July 2004, only 13 countries reported a
total o f 440 wild polio cases and more than 90% o fthese cases are from Nigeria, Pakistan
and India. The WHO estimatesthat nearly 5 million children, who could otherwise have
been paralyzedby polio, are walking today. Once polio has been eradicated, the world
will reap substantial financial, as well as social, dividendsdueto forgone polio treatment
and rehabilitation costs. Dependingon national decisions on future use o fpolio vaccines,
these savings could exceedUS$1 billionper year'.

3.       Government of India's Polio EradicationProgram. The Government o f India
(GOI) has been implementingpolio eradication activities since 1995 with technical
support from WHO and UNICEF. Inaddition to UNagencies, several bilateral partners
including DFID, DANIDA, EU, USAID, KFW, Japan and international NGOs such as
Rotary have been supporting India's polio eradication program. The India Expert
Advisory Group (IEAG), a body o f renowned national and international technical
experts, guides the program and an Inter Agency Coordination Committee (ICC)
facilitates integrated partnerresponse. The core program strategy includes
implementationof supplementarypolio immunization activities by organizingnational
and sub-national immunization days. An elaborate surveillance system for detecting all
cases o f acute flaccid paralysis supported by an efficient laboratory network to test the
stool samples for presence o f wild polio was established in 1997 and has been
consistently providinghigh quality surveillance. India's polio eradication program
progressedwell until 2001. The program suffered a major setback in2002 with an
outbreak inthe state o f Uttar Pradesh(UP). Highlevel political commitment and prompt
management responseto this challenge resulted inmarkedreductiono fpolio cases during
2003. The enhancedherd immunity following the 2002 epidemic also partly contributed
to this decline.

4.       Association's Support to PolioEradicationin India. The Association has been
supportingpolio eradication activities inIndia since 1999 along with other development
partners. This was done initially through the Reproductive and Child Health Project
(CR. NI080-IN), and subsequently through the India Immunization Strengthening Project
(Cr. 33400-IN) with an IDA credit o f SDR 106.5 million (US$ 142.6 millionequivalent).
The latter project was approved on April 25,2000 and became effective inAugust, 2000.
The 2002 epidemic placed a huge financing burdenon India's polio eradicationprogram
which was met through a supplemental credit o f SDR 59.5 million (US$ 83.41 million
equivalent) from the Association inDecember 2003 (Cr. 33401-IN).

   C. The ProposedAdditionalSupportfor India's Polio Eradication Program and
                          Rationalefor Association's Intervention

 5.      The India Expert Advisory Group (IEAG) meetingheld inJune 2004 concluded
 that the year 2004 provides a unique opportunity for India to achieve polio free status.
 This year, India has reported the lowest ever number of wild polio cases and the smallest
 immunitygap (proportion of nonpolio acuteflaccidparalysis cases with 0-3 doses of
polio vaccine). The GO1has approved a comprehensive 3 year polio eradication program
 (2004-2006) recommendedby IEAGinFebruary2004. This program, inaddition to
 continuingthe ongoing polio eradication activities, involves substantive scaling-up o f
 activities in 2004. There is a marked increase infundingrequirements for the program
due to greaternumbero fnationalimmunizationdays in2004 (5 national and 1sub
national), and 29% increase invaccine costs (due to price increase and exchange rate
 fluctuations). These were not envisaged at the time of seekingthe supplemental credit.

6.       The three year polio eradication program is estimated to cost US$ 482 million.
Out ofthis US$300 million would berequiredfor the supplyo f oral polio vaccine while
the balance (US$ 182million) would be neededfor operational costs (Table 1, Schedule
A). Current partners financing thepolio program (Centers for Disease Control, USA;
Department for International Development, UK; Government o f Japan, and KFW,
Germany) have committed to finance 35% o fthe program costs and GO1is projecting
another 5.5% further support from them (Table 2. Schedule A). The GO1i s contributing
about 9% o fthe program costs while the existing IDA credit would cover 22%. The GO1
i s seekingto meet the remaining financing gap o fUS$ 136 million from IDA. Out o f this,
at least US$ 93.6 million would be requiredduringthe next 12 months. This financing i s
critical for sustaining the ongoing polio eradication program and to scale-up the activities
during2004 as recommendedby the IEAG.

7.       This proposal requests the restructuring o f five projects inorder to enable the
reallocation of SDR 65.35 million (approximately US$ 96 million equivalent2) o f Credit
proceeds under these projects to meet urgent financing needs for the polio eradication
program inIndia. This will address the immediate financing gap for polio eradication and
we will be seekingBoard approval at a later date for financing the remaining gap (about
US$40 million) either through the second Reproductive and Child Health Project (RCH
11) currently underpreparation or through a stand alone operation.

8.       The proposed reallocationfrom the 5 projects would be from the savings which
are mainly due to favorable exchange rate variations between Special DrawingRights
(SDRs)and Rupees, revisedcost estimates or changes inthe project scope. Inall these
projects, the reallocations would neither compromise their original objectives nor affect
their overall economic viability. Details of implementationprogress ofthe 5 projects
proposed to be restructured are presentedin Schedule B.

9.       A Letter of Amendment would be used to restructure and to reallocate the credit
proceeds from eachof the five projects. As detailed inpart C o f this proposal,
arrangements similar to that o f the ongoing ImmunizationStrengthening Project will be

2  SDR to US$exchange rate as of August 16,2004

                                               5


usedto implement Polio EradicationActivities financed through reallocations from each
o f the five projects proposed to be restructured.

10.      Rationalefor Association's Intervention. The proposed restructuring is fully
consistent with the over-riding CAS objective of assisting Indiato reduce poverty.
Poliomyelitis affects the poor disproportionately and can cause premature death or
lifelong disability that reduce the capacity o f an individual to benefit from education and
employment opportunities as well as place a heavy burden on the health care system. As
already stated, along with UNICEF and WHO, the Association has been supporting
global polio eradication initiative and has evolved an innovative way o f financing for
polio, the IDAbuy down. Working with Gates Foundation andRotary Intemational, the
Association has prepared IDA buy down operations for Nigeria and Pakistan, which
along with Indianow report the largest number o fpolio cases inthe world. WHO feels
that 2004 provides a unique opportunity to eliminate polio from the globe and it is most
critical to ensure sustainable financing for this end stage. As has beenthe practice, the
Association would be the lender o f last resort.

Program0bjectives

11.      The main purpose o f the proposed restructuring i s to assist GO1ineradicating
poliomyelitis from the country which will contribute to global polio eradication. This will
supplementthe ongoing ImmunizationStrengthening Project (Cr. 33400-IN) and the
Supplemental Credit (Cr. 33401-IN)by financing additional "polio eradication activities"
which include supply o f Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), training, orientation, honorarium,
consultant services, IEC material and services and mobility support needed for
supplementaryimmunization activities during2004-2005.

Description

12.      A new component on Polio EradicationActivities'' will be added to the legal
                               "
documents o f the five projects proposed to be restructured to include financing for the
polio eradication program in India. IDA will finance a part o f the procurement of OPV
and operational costs for implementing the supplemental immunization activities during
2004-05 which include:
     (a) Five National ImmunizationDays (NID) and one Sub National ImmunizationDay
         (SNID)duringApril 2004 to February2005; and
     (b) Two large scale SNIDs during March 2005 to June 2005.

ProgramCosts and Financing

13.      As stated inparagraph 6, the GO1has requestedthe Association to meet the
immediate financing gap o fUS$ 136 million. This immediate financing gap is proposed
to be met as follows:

                            Total                           U S D 136 million

                           E. ProgramImplementationArrangements

     14.     The proposed activities will be implementedby the existing public health
     structures inthe states o f India, and the Ministryo f Health and FamilyWelfare
     (MOHFW)will overseethe implementationwithin the framework ofthe five projects
     proposed to be restructured. GO1has updated the Project ImplementationPlan o f the
     ImmunizationStrengthening Project to reflect the additional activities. Monitoring and
     Reporting for these activities will be camed out on the basis o f same arrangements that
     were formulated underthe Immunization Strengthening Project.

     15.     Procurement. Procurement procedures applied underthe Immunization
     StrengtheningProject will be continued for the polio eradicationactivities under the five
     projects proposedto be restructured. OPV procurement will beunder direct contracting
     from UNICEF, as is beingdone under the Immunization Strengthening Project.

     16.    Disbursement. Polio eradication activities include supply o f Oral Polio Vaccine
     (OPV) and operational costs. The Association has been reimbursing90% o f the total
     expenditure under the ongoing Immunization Strengthening Project and the same
     arrangement i s proposed under the five projects proposed to be restructured. Services of
     UNICEF will be usedby GO1for the supply o f OPV and the Association will advance
     90% o f the total OPV cost to UNICEF allowing 3 months leadtime required to place
     orders. UNICEF will provide quarterly reports on the utilization o f the funds to the
     Association. For the operational costs, the GO1will initially incur the expenditure and
     seek reimbursement from the Association subsequently. A summary o f the disbursement
     schedule based on GOI's financing requirementis presented below and details are given
     inSchedule C.

                                                 7




 17.     We propose to disburse the reallocated proceeds of the credits under the five
projects proposed to be restructured in such a manner as to utilize these proceeds within
the current closing dates of the respective projects.

 18.    Financial Management. An acceptable financial management, accounting and
reporting system has beenestablished for the Immunization Strengthening Project,
includingarrangements for audits. The same systemwill continue to be usedfor the new
polio component o f the five projects proposed to be restructured. A more detailed
financial management assessment i s given in Schedule D.

Lessons learnedfrom past operationsinthe countryhector

19.     The proposed program for 2004-05 is built on the key lessons from the polio
eradication activities inIndia since 1995. Firstly, strategic use of surveillance will be
made for planningthe Supplemental Immunization Activities (SIA) including identifying
and reaching the un-reached populations. The program i s very strongly built on a polio
surveillance network which consistently monitors its quality indicators and i s rated to be
one o f the best inthe world. Secondly, India's polio eradication program i s guided by the
India Expert Advisory Group (IEAG) which consists o f eminent international and
national experts. Thirdly, timely supply of vaccine i s very critical for SIA activities.
UNICEF has done a commendable job inensuringthe timely supply o f OPV for the SIAs
since the inception o f this program. It i s therefore proposed to continue procurement
through UNICEF for the proposed reallocations also. Finally, the entire polio eradication
program inIndia is built on partnerships with an active role played by the Interagency
Coordination Committee (ICC).

Environmentand socialaspects

20.     The environmental category for the polio eradication activities is C as the
program does not pose significant environmental risks. Oral vaccination, with the
attenuated virus, has no significant negative environmental impact that would need to be
addressed. The program will contribute significantly to the eradication o f wild polio virus
from the environment.

21.     As polio affects the poor disproportionately and immunizationcoverage is lowest
inthepoor and socially disadvantaged groups, the polio eradication programhas a strong
pro-poor focus. The program addresses the social inequities by developing specific
strategies to immunize the "hard-to-reach" populations, using surveillance data. It places
high priority on mobilizing communities and other key stakeholders to partner with
government staff in the preparation of micro plans for polio eradication activities and
their implementation. Traditional and religious leadershave beensensitized over the last
few years and are now committed to the cause. Rejectiono fpolio vaccination i s now
very low.

                                F. RisksandSustainability

22.      Risks. While the global strategy has demonstratedresults inseveral countries,
there i s a high risk that Indiamay not achieve polio free status by 2005. The reduced
number o fpolio cases in2003 couldbepartly due to herd immunitycausedby the 2002
outbreak. There are also the usual risks associatedwith poor program management such
as delayed funds flow for operational expenditure and weak implementationby the
endemic states due to shortage o f field staff and frequent transfers o f key program
managers. Some o f these factors seem to have contributed to an outbreak inNorthern
Karnataka in2003 which subsequently spread to the neighboringdistricts o f Andhra
Pradesh. Technically, there i s a remote risk o f the live weakened form o fpolio virus used
for the vaccine mutating into a more aggressive, disease-causingform and this requires a
comprehensive strategy to handle the post vaccine period.

23.      Risk mitigation. Out ofthe 125 polio endemic countries thatjoined thepolio
eradication initiative 15 years back, only 6 countries still remainendemic for polio. This
suggests that current global strategy is appropriate. Surveillance data from India suggests
that strategies inthe endemic states o fUP and Biharsuch as increased surveillance by
medical officers, block monitors and special social mobilization activities helpedin
reducing the immunity gap (proportion of non polio acuteflaccidparalysis cases with 0-3
doses ofpolio vaccine). GOI, with the support o f WHO and UNICEF, is extending similar
approach to vulnerable pockets inother states. This along with the proposed intensive
nation-wide coverage during 2004 i s expected to reduce immunity gap innon endemic
states.

24.      Sustainability. The GO1and the states are strongly committed to polio
eradication and medium- term fiscal implications o f the program are relatively small.
The supplemental immunization activities will end with eradication and there will be no
needto sustain these. The program also enjoys support from key development partners
including the DFID, EU, CDC, USAID, UNICEF and WHO, and other stakeholders.

         ImplementationStatus of Five ProjectsProposedto be Restructured


Malaria Control Proiect (Cr. 29640-IN). The SDR 86.11million Credit was approved
on June 12, 1997 and became effective on September 30, 1997. As o f August 16,2004,
 about SDR 57.65 million have beendisbursed. The original credit closing date was
extended twice and the current closing date i s March 31,2005. InMay 2003, at GOI's
request, US$46.5 million were cancelled from the project. Slow start-up, implementation
delays and procurement problems are main reasons for the sluggishprogress. A
comprehensive action plan prepared by GO1during2004 has projected a savings o f about
US$l0 million available from the credit for cancellation or reprogramming,

Orissa Health Systems Development Project (Cr. No. NO410-IN). The SDR 56.8 million
Credit was approved on June 29, 1998, and became effective on September 8, 1998. As
o f August 16,2004, SDR 21.86 millionhave been disbursed. InMarch 2004 the project
was restructured and credit closing date was extended up to March 2005 after a
comprehensive review o f the action planprepared by the Government Orissa. At the
time ofrestructuring, a saving of about US$25 millionequivalent was estimated. This
was mainly due to delayed start up o f the project, slow implementation and the super
cyclone that causedmassive devastation incoastal Orissa. These factors resulted in
savings from salaries o f additional staff and operational and maintenance expenses. In
addition, cancellation of major civil works like the Health Department Buildingand
exchange rate fluctuations further contributed to the savings.


India Tuberculosis ControlProiect (0.No. 2936-IN). The SDR 89.22 million Credit
was approved by the Board on January 30, 1997 and became effective May 08, 1997. As
o f August 16,2004, SDR 54.81 million have been disbursed. The project suffered from
start up problems and saw delayed expansion o f tuberculosis services inthe early years.
This ledto considerable savings which were amplifiedby exchange rate fluctuations and
unexpected fall inthe prices o f goods and equipment to be procured under the project.
Followingthe mid-termreview, the project was restructured inMay 2002. The project
has subsequentlymade impressive progress both interms o f infectious patients
successfully treated as well as ininstitutionalization o fprogram reforms. Nevertheless,
the achievements on the ground have not been matched by disbursements under the
project, mainly due to under-utilization o fthe budgeted allocations to States. An interim
cancellation o f SDR 9.176 millionwas carried out inJanuary 2004. Based on a recent
financial review, the GO1has requested the Bank to extend the project by one more year
and reallocate estimated savings o f SDR 10.975 million.

Womanand Child Development Project (Credit N-042-IN). The SDR 222.50 million
Credit was approved on June 29, 1998, and became effective on October 04, 1999. As of
August 16,2004, SDR 96.30 millionhave been disbursed, o fwhich SDR 28.8 million(of
the originally allocated SDR 46.4 million) have been usedto finance activities under the
Gujarat Earthquake Reconstruction Program, leaving an undisbursed balance o f

                                              11


approximately SDR 126 million. The main reasons for slow disbursement include 18
month delay inobtaining administrative and financial approvals and preparing
implementation plans for the training component (US$100million). Limitedproject
management capacity at the national and sub-national levels has also led to poor follow-
up of implementationprogress. Currently aproposal is being submittedto extend this
project for a period o f 9 months. Out o fthe allocations made from the project for the
Phase-I o f Gujarat emergency earthquake rehabilitation, SDR 17.58 million (about
US$26 million equivalent at current exchange rate) remained unutilized and this amount
i s no longer required for earthquake rehabilitation. The Department o f Economic Affairs,
MinistryofFinance, GO1has requestedthe Bank to reallocate these savings for urgent
financing of polio eradication activities. Training component inthree project states i s
under SOE suspension. These reports havebeen recentlyreceivedandthe Bank is inthe
process of lifting the suspension. Inaddition, an action plan i s beingfinalized to improve
financial management arrangements inthe project.


Guiarat EmernencvEarthquake Reconstruction Project (Cr. 3637). The SDR 356
million Credit was approved by the Board on May 02,2002 andbecame effectiveby July
15,2002. As o f August 16,2004, SDR 128.82 million have been disbursed. During
2004, the Government o f Gujarat (GOG) has made an assessmento f likely project
savings inview o f reduced demand for housingreconstructioninurban areas, lower
physical and price contingencies, and strengthening o f SDR vis-a-vis US$. According to
their determination ofproject savings, the GOG recommended to the Government of
India Department o f Economic Affairs for cancellation o f US$20.0 million out o fthe
credit amount. A further assessment will be undertaken by the GOG when contracts for
the majorpublic infrastructure, such as roads anddams are finalized. While the project is
not under SOE suspension, the audit reports o fprevious years had many observations.
The project has submitted an action planto settle the observations as soon as possible.

FundsFlow and Reporting

Financing qf vaccines. Inthe ongoing Immunization StrengtheningProject the OPV has
been procured by UNICEF basedon an direct advance from IDA (on a request from the
GO190 % o f the contract value i s advanced by the bank to UNICEF). UNICEFsubmits
quarterly utilization statements to IDA indicating the funds utilized, the status of
procurement and dispatch. Reports up to the quarter endedJune 30,2004 have been
received by IDA.As per existing arrangements no audit report i s required for this activity
carried out by UNICEF and we propose to use the same arrangement under the five
projects proposed to be restructured.

Omrating Costs. Inthe Immunization Strengthening Project, the Operating Costs for
polio eradication activities are transferred to the states and implementingagencies under
standard arrangements. Based on Statement o f Expenditure (SOE) reports from the
districts and the states, the GO1claims reimbursement from the Association. Again the
same arrangement is proposed to be usedunder the five projects proposed to be
restructured.

Risk Factors& Mitigation.

The financial management arrangementshave been weak under the existing
Immunization Strengthening Project, with delayed reporting and submission o f SOE and
delays in submission of audit reports. These arrangements at State and District levels are
beingstrengthened (with emphasison staffing, development o f a Financialmanual etc.)
underthe Reproductiveand Child HealthI1 Project currentlyunderpreparation.

Audit Arrangements

Under the existing Immunization StrengtheningProject, audits at the state level are
carried out by independent Chartered Accountant Firms.The audit reports are sent to the
Ministryo fHealth& Family Welfare who inturn forwards the same to the Association.
No separate audit report i s received for the procurement of the OPV byUNICEF and
*onlythe quarterly statement i s relied upon. This i s however covered by the Auditor
General o f India as part o f the audit o f the MOHFW. The same arrangement will be
maintained with respect to the polio eradication component proposed to be included in
the five projects proposedto berestructured. There are no overdue audit reports or states
under SOE suspension under the Immunization Strengthening Project. The following
audit reports will be monitored inAudit Reports Compliance System (ARCS):

Among the five projects beingconsidered for restructuring, there are no pending audit
reports or SOE suspensions for three o f these projects. The status o f other two projects is
summarized below:

Women & Child DeveloDment Proiect (N-042). Three project states are under SOE
suspension under the Training Component o fthe Women & Child Development Project
(N-042). The reports have beenreceived and we are inthe process o f liftingthe
suspension. Inaddition we will be receiving an action planto improve the financial
management arrangements inthis project which has an unsatisfactory FMrating inthe
PSR.

Guiarat Emergency Earthquake Recon. Proiect (3637). While the project i s not under
SOE suspension, the audit reports ofthe previous years have hadmany observations,
which also ledto a refundo fRs. 990 million. The project has submitted an action planto
settle the observations as soon as possible.


DisbursementArrangements

For procurement of vaccines the Association will advance funds (90 % o f the contract
va1ue)to UNICEF based on prior review o f the contract. With respect to operating costs
these will be reimbursedto the GO1based on SOE reports. As per the arrangements
underthe Immunization Strengthening Project, all expenditures for polio eradication
activities are proposedto be reimbursedat 90%.

Sustaining the growth of the recent past and India's progress inpoverty reductionwill
also requiredramatic improvements inbasic infrastructure and the investment Climate.
Major changes will needto be made to ensure effective delivery of basic Services, such
as improved health and education, to all o f India's citizens.

                               DEVELOPMENTPROGRESS

Inrecent decades, Indiahas significantly improvedthe well beingofits people. Since the
 1970s, India's economic growth rate has risen, poverty has declined, and social indicators
have improved. The average life expectancy at birth has increased from 49 years to the
current 63 years. The total birthrate for India's one billionpeople has beenlowered from
six childrenper woman to three since the 1960s. In 1950, 146 out of 1,000 infantsdied at
birth.Now, that numberis down to an average o f 90 out of 1,000 live births. Inthe early
1950s, nearly halfo f India's populationwas living inpoverty. Real declines inthe
incidence o fpoverty began inthe mid-1970s. The 1990switnessed high levels o fpoverty
reduction and important advances in literacy with enrollment o fprimary school-aged
childrenrising from 68 percent in 1992/93to 82 percent at the end o f the decade. India
today has 108 million children aged 6 to 10 attending primary school, makingit the
world's second largest education system, after China. While these improvements illustrate
achievements ina challenging environment, India's social indicators remain weak by
most measures o fhuman development.

Supported by wide ranging reforms, India's economic growth averaged 6 percent inthe
last decade. Despite this growth, persistent and large fiscal deficits remain a major
concem. Services, the least regulated sector inthe economy, continue to be the strongest
performer, while manufacturing, the most regulated sector, i s the weakest. The extemal
position of India's economy has also improved dramatically. The rapid growth o f
informationtechnology (IT) service exports and highremittances have resulted incurrent
account surpluses. Together with modest capital inflows, this has generated a substantial
increase inexternal reserves, which now exceed US$lOObillion. Low
levels o f short-term external debt give the country a further cushion to
counter any speculative attack.

Inparallelwith this faster growth, Indiahas made impressive progress towards reducing
income poverty, an important element o f the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs).
Continued progress has also been made on many social indicators, particularly literacy,
which rose from 52 percent in 1991to 65 percent in2001. These improvements are both
real achievements for India-and     unquestionably o f global significance. Acknowledging
the relative achievements of the stabilization andreformprograms duringthe 1990s,
India's future progress inreducing poverty and improving social indicators critically
dependson the country's ability to accelerate economic growth and maintain a stable
macroeconomic framework.

                                              16


With the growing global focus on the MDGs, including halving the proportion of people
livingon less than one dollar a day and achieving universal primary educationby 2015,
success in India is critical to the achievement of these goals. These goals won't be
met without renewedefforts to expand economic opportunity and reducethe obstacles to
reducingpoverty andthus improving peoples' lives. For India, this is especially true at
the state level.

                                  CURRENT CHALLENGES

Reducingpoverty remains India's greatest challenge. With a per capita gross national
income (GNI) of $470 in2002, there is abroad consensusthat poverty inIndiahas fallen
inthe pastdecade. Yet, more thanoneout ofevery four Indiansispoor. Official
estimates show a decline inthe poverty rate from 36 percent inthe early 1990sto 26.1
percent in 1999/2000, but attempts to adjust the householdsurvey underlying the
 1999/2000figures to make it comparable with earlier surveys result ina smaller
degree ofpoverty reduction; how muchsmaller is a matter of considerable debate, and
estimates vary widely. Recent work suggests that poverty has fallen at a somewhat lower
rate-from     36 to 29 percent ofthe population by 1999/2000.Either way,
over one quarter of India's population is poor.

Ifneedslikehealthandeducationaretakeninto account, thenIndia's poverty is even
more challenging. Despite the emergenceo f tens of millions from poverty during the
1990s, average incomes across Indiaremain low, and there hasbeenlittle movement on
some critical social indicators. There's been little improvement inthe mortality rates for
children underthe age o f five, as well as mortality ofmothers during childbirth since.
Years o fprogresscould be lost to HIV/AIDS. The disease is spreading quickly, with risk
factors that put the country indanger of a growing epidemic.Some estimates say less
thanone percent of the adult population is currently infectedwith HIV. Yet because
o f India's large population, India will soon havemore people infected with HIV than any
other country inthe world.

InIndiatoday, there also remains a substantialandpersistent disparity ofopportunity,
particularly inthe education, health, and economic prospects o fwomen and other
vulnerable groups such as the Scheduled Caste/ScheduledTribe populations. One
example of this disparity is the strikingly low ratio of girls to boys, which, rather than
improving with India's development progress, appears to beworsening. A growing gulf
has emerged as well in growth betweenthe richer and poorer states within
the country-with the result that poverty is increasingly geographically concentrated.
Today, almost half of India's poor, approximately 133 millionpeople, live inUttar
Pradesh, Bihar, or Madhya Pradesh. Over three quarters ofthe poor live inrural areas.
Given these disparities, and the increasing concentration ofpoverty by region and by
state, it can be said that India occupies two worlds simultaneously. Inone, economic
reform and social changes, such as improved education for girls, havebegunto take
hold and where growth has had an impact on people's lives and opportunities. Inthe
other, citizens appear almost completely left behind bypublic services, employment
opportunities, and brighter prospects. Bridgingthe gap betweenthese two worlds is
perhaps India's greatest challenge today.

                                               17


What i s required? Continued high economic growth to drive incomes higher, in a
sustainable way. It will also require greater focus on ensuringthat the benefits o f growth
are shared more evenly. Sustaining the growth o f the recent past and India's progress in
poverty reductionwill also require dramatic improvements inbasic infrastructure and the
investment climate. Major changes will needto be made to ensure effective delivery o f
basic services, such as improved health and education, to all o f India's citizens.
And these improvements will needto be achieved within the context ofthe longer-term
strategic challenges that India faces: ensuringenvironmental sustainability inthe context
of diminishingwater sources, increasing pollution, andglobal climate
change; the demographics of continued, albeit slower, population growth; and the
possible course o f HIV/AIDS.

                           THE WORLD BANKGROUPININDIA

The 2005-2008 India Country Strategy-the        World Bank Group's roadmap for
assistance-was      discussed inAugust 2004 by the Bank's Board o f Executive Directors.
This document outlines the World Bank Group's development priorities and indicates the
type and level o f assistance to be provided. This strategy i s closely aligned with the
Government o f India's poverty reductionstrategy which emphasizes growth with social
justice and equity. The World Bank's strategy provides the framework for analytical
work, lendingoperations, and dialogue with other groups focused on India's development
goals.

The overarching challenge of the Bank's strategy inIndia is this: how to maximize and
leverage the diverse resources of the World Bank to help improve the quality o f life for
some o f the world's poorest citizens, helping India move closer to achieving the MDGs.

The main pillarso fthe strategy are:
    (i)      Focusingon outcomes, to ensure that all o f the work o f the Bank Group i s
             explicitly geared towards supporting India's achievement o f its development
             goals;
    (ii)     Applying selectivity, to target limitedresources to activities where assistance
             i s welcomed and where contributions can also be the most effective; and
    (iii)    Expanding the Bank Group's role as a politically realistic knowledgeprovider
             and generator.

The new strategy also focuses on three main areas for support:
    (i)      Infrastructure: roads, transport, power, water supply and sanitation, irrigation,
             and urban development-to     underpinboth accelerated growth and improved
             service delivery;
    (i)      Human development: education, health, social protection-priorities      to
             support specific MDGs; and
    (ii)     Rural livelihoods: with an emphasis on community-driven approaches.

The World Bank i s partnering with India to reduce poverty and improve living standards
to all citizens. nimportant shift envisioned for FY05-08 strategy i s the use o f new
approaches, including co-financing with other development partners under common
arrangements, for nationalprograms inthe areas most critical to meetingthe MDGs. The

                                               18


recently approved US$500 million credit to fund India's Elementary Education Program
i s an example o f efforts inthis direction. The Bank's approach to India's states i s also
going through some important shifts. Since 1997, the strategy has included a focus
on states undertaking comprehensive reforms in order to support the leaders o f change
and serve as a catalyst to the state-level reform process. With the widening gulfbetween
the reforming and non-reformingstates inIndia, leading to a concentration o f
poverty and poor social indicators injust a few states, some changes inthis approach are
warranted. Though the strategy will retain an essentially reform- and performance-based
approach to the states, it will also change inways that are intendedto go as
far as possible inopening up new opportunities for engagement with these largest and
poorest states. Despite these shifts inthe way that the Bank partnerswith both the Indian
Federal Government and the states, the Bank Group's Program Priorities will retain
considerable continuity with the previous strategy. The emphasis on improving
government effectiveness, investing inpeople and empowering communities, and
promotingprivate sector-led growth remains relevant to India's own priorities and
development goals. The stepped-upprogram will provide increased opportunity for
collaboration across the Bank Group to promote innovative public-privatepartnerships
for infrastructure development.

For the Bank, global knowledge support-policy         dialogue, analysis, technical assistance,
and advisory services-will     be refocused to better support the program priorities. The
strategy calls for enhanced focus on major analytical work on emerging issues o f
national interest, as well as strengthening the demand-driven nature o fthe Bank's
advisory work.
