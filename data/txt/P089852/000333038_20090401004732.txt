F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The Program's overall objective, as laid out in the HUSAL Project Document (PD), was
very broadly stated and focused on assisting the Government's efforts to improve the
living conditions and access to real estate of Mexico's low to moderate income
households.

Although the project was never restructured, the development objective changed for
HUDPL II and III. The new objective for the Program became: (1) to support the
Government's efforts to improve the policies and institutions in place for housing and
urban development; (2) to make the federal housing system more efficient by designing
and implementing a unified system of subsidies to facilitate access to housing by low-
and moderate-income families; (3) to bolster the systems in place for disbursing housing
loans and generating savings and to move them down-market; (4) to strengthen urban real
property registries and rights; (5) to coordinate and support physical and social
investments in poor neighborhoods; (6) to increase the supply of and access to urban land
for poor people and improve this market's functioning; and (7) to increase the capacity to
prevent and manage the damage caused by natural disasters.

              Box 1. Lexicon of affordable housing and urban poverty in Mexico

BANSEFI (Bank of National Savings and Financial Services)--Federal institution created in
2001 to promote household savings, help popular financial institutions adjust to the 2001 Law for
Popular Savings and Credit (which phased in new requirements between 2001 and 2004), and
coordinate Government support to such institutions, which focus on serving low- and moderate-
income households. (http://www.bansefi.gob.mx/)

CONAVI (National Housing Commission)--Federal institution formed in 2001, originally part
of the Social Development Secretariat (SEDESOL) but autonomous as of 2006. Develops and
coordinates housing policy. Starting in 2007, with SHF also operates the new subsidy scheme,
Esquemas de Financiamiento y Subsidio Federal para la Vivienda. (http://www.conavi.gob.mx/)

CORETT (Land Regularization Committee)--Federal agency under SEDESOL responsible
for regularizing informally urbanized ejido land. Operating on a massive scale, buys
(expropriates) such land, regularizes titles to it, and sells it to existing occupants.
(http://www.corett.gob.mx/)

Ejido land--Form of communal property (often called "social land") created by the Mexican
Constitution to protect rural farming communities and regulated by a complex set of federal laws
and institutions. Two-thirds of land on the fringes of Mexican cities now consists of ejidos, which
are the main source for new housing parcels.

Esta es tu Casa ­­(Federal housing finance and subsidy scheme ) Program launched in February
2007 by CONAVI and operated by SHF. It provides an up-front subsidy for housing loans
(including housing improvement, self-construction and serviced lots) for households earning less
than 4 minimum wages (MW)

FONAEVI (National Fund for Low-Cost Housing)--Trust fund, administered by FONHAPO,
that disburses funds under the up-front housing subsidy program Tu Casa.

FONHAPO (Low-Income Housing Fund)--Trust fund that serves as the main source of federal
support for low-income housing and channels FONAEVI's funds. FONHAPO's main program is
Tu Casa (www.fonhapo.gob.mx)

FOVI (Financial Housing Aid Fund)--Second-tier institution that provided market-rate
mortgages until SHF was created in 2002. Now administered by SHF, FOVI primarily performs
functions related to covering liabilities created by its former lending operations.

FOVISSSTE (Housing Fund, Social Security Services Institute for Public Sector
Workers)--Housing fund that receives 5 percent of the salaries of federal workers, which it uses
to provide below-market-rate mortgages, with lower rates for poorer households. In 2004
provided approximately 10 percent of mortgage loans. Also part of the pension system (ISSSTE)
for contributing workers.

INFONAVIT (National Housing Fund for Private Sector Workers)--Pension fund and
housing lender funded by a compulsory contribution of 5 percent of the salaries of private formal
sector workers. It provides below-market-rate mortgages, with lower rates for poorer households.
Governed by representatives of workers, employers, and Government. Provided 50 percent of
mortgage finance in 2006. Also part of the pension system for contributing workers.

Low-income household--Household earning up to three minimum wages.


                                                xvi

Minimum wage--Income measure used for social programs, including housing. One minimum
wage is approximately US$140 a month.

Moderate-income household--Household earning between 3 and 6 minimum wages.

PROSAVI--Subsidy program created by FOVI and later run by FONHAPO that provided
housing grants of approximately US$5,000 to households earning 3­5 minimum wages.
Beneficiary households combined the grants with mortgage loans (from SHF-funded SOFOLs,
which channel the grants to specific projects) and down payments to buy expandable units (each
approximately 40 square meters and costing US$16,000). PROSAVI has been replaced by the
new subsidy scheme, Esquemas de Financiamiento y Subsidio Federal para la Vivienda.

Ramo 33­­Earmarked federal transfers to States and municipalities. It accounts for almost half of
all the federal transfers and is divided in seven spending categories (or funds). Ramo 33
subsidizes subnational government's provision of services with national externalities (such as
health, education and basic infrastructure).

SEDESOL (Social Development Secretariat)--Federal ministry responsible for, among other
things, urban development. (www.sedesol.gob.mx)

SHF (Federal Mortgage Corporation)--Created in 2002 as the successor to FOVI to lead the
development of primary and secondary market-rate home lending. A second-tier institution that
provides liquidity and guarantees to first-tier lenders (mainly SOFOLs), SHF funded 13 percent
of mortgage finance in 2002; but only 5 percent in 2006. (www.shf.gob.mx)

SOFOLES--Nonbank financial institutions/specialized lenders set up as a result of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that have become Mexico's main source of private
home lending since banks left the market in 1995. These institutions can make loans and raise
capital on capital markets, but cannot accept deposits from the public. SOFOLs are legally
allowed to finance a limited number of activities (for example, for consumer goods, education,
and health). This document refers only to Mortgage SOFOLs (SOFOLs Hipotecarias.)

Tu Casa (formerly VIVAH)--Subsidy program run by FONHAPO that provides housing grants
of approximately US$3,000 for a new finished unit, or US$1,400 for housing improvements, to
households earning 3 minimum wages or less. The grants must be matched by state and local
governments, typically in the form of serviced lots for finished housing. Local governments
contract construction of basic units (up to 30 square meters), which beneficiary households buy
by combining the grants with down-payments.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Macroeconomic Framework: The first loan of the programmatic series was appraised
during the second half of President's Fox six-year term, in February 2004. Mexico had
recently undergone a recession caused in large part by the negative impact of the US
economic slow down during 2001-2002.           During this economic downturn, Mexico
managed to maintain fiscal and price stability, and due in large part to its successful
management of the national debt, saw no erosion in its access to capital markets. Unlike
past episodes of economic weakness, the 2001-2002 recession was the first in Mexico's
recent history not associated with a balance of payments or a financial crisis.

During this period, the government's economic policy focused on price stability, a
modestly restrictive monetary policy aimed at controlling inflation, and tight fiscal policy
as preconditions to economic growth. These policies supported other structural reforms to
boost private investment and increase the country's medium-term competitiveness.
However, the need to keep the budget in control combined with declining tax receipts
meant that Mexico's infrastructure needs were extremely high and growing.

Housing Sector: Despite the Government's ability to sustain macroeconomic stability at
the beginning of the decade, poverty in Mexico remained widespread. Low and
inequitable growth kept income poverty high. These challenges in social development
were magnified by the young age structure of the population which put pressure on the
existing housing deficit, estimated at 4 million units. The growing demand (700,000 new
households formed each year) was exacerbated by a lack of federal funding and
dysfunctional real-estate markets. Additionally, the poor faced limited access to financial
services which limited their ability to save, invest and manage risks. Banks provided
financing only to the higher income brackets and SOFOLES focused mostly on the low to
middle income housing segment.

Faced with these realities, the Fox administration made the housing sector a priority and
proposed increasing the construction of new housing units from 400,000 per year to
750,000 per year by the end of the presidential term. In order to accomplish this goal, the
Government put in motion structural reforms to support housing and land markets, to
funnel assistance to the poor, and to generate economic growth through investment in
housing. The Government shifted its role from financing the construction of units to
providing guarantees to SOFOLES. The goal was to allow these niche mortgage lenders
to more effectively tap the capital markets for both construction and long-term mortgage
financing.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

On June 8, 2004, the Bank Board approved the Programmatic Affordable Housing and
Urban Poverty Sector Adjustment Loan (HUSAL) prepared under the guidelines
provided by then active Operational Directive (OD) 8.60 on adjustment lending


                                           1

operations. The loan became effective on December 17, 2004. This was the first of a
series of three quick-disbursing loans to support Mexico's low income housing and urban
development program. The Second and Third Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty
Reduction Development Policy Loans (HUDPL II and HUDPL III, respectively) were
subsequently approved on November 29, 2005 (effective on December 16, 2005) and
November 27, 2007 (effective on December 14, 2007), respectively under Operational
Policy (OP) 8.60 on Development Policy Lending. The overall Program includes 3 sector
adjustment and development policy loans and a US$7.7 million Housing and Urban
Technical Assistance Loan (HUTAL).

The three-loan Program was aligned with the Government's National Housing Sector
Programs for 2001-2006 and 2007-2012, and the National Urban Development and
Territorial Planning Program for 2001-2006.

The Program's overall objective, as laid out in the HUSAL Project Document (PD), was
very broadly stated and focused on assisting the Government's efforts to improve the
living conditions and access to real estate of Mexico's low to moderate income
households. No key indicators were identified under the HUSAL program to measure the
achievement of the Program's objectives or outcomes and the PDO itself was not on the
Policy Matrix since these requirements were put into effect only with OP 8.60.

1.3 Revised PDO (if any, as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

Although the project was never restructured, the development objective changed for
HUDPL II and III. The new objective for the Program became: (1) to support the
Government's efforts to improve the policies and institutions in place for housing and
urban development; (2) to make the federal housing system more efficient by designing
and implementing a unified system of subsidies to facilitate access to housing by low-
and moderate-income families; (3) to bolster the systems in place for disbursing housing
loans and generating savings and to move them down-market; (4) to strengthen urban real
property registries and rights; (5) to coordinate and support physical and social
investments in poor neighborhoods; (6) to increase the supply of and access to urban land
for poor people and improve this market's functioning; and (7) to increase the capacity to
prevent and manage the damage caused by natural disasters. The new PDO is very
similar to the project outcomes.

The formulation of the new PDO reflects the evolution in operational rules for the
preparation of fast-disbursing policy-based lending operations from OD 8.60 to OP 8.60.
However, the new PDO was the result of growing recognition that the original PDO was
too vague and ambitious and that it would be unachievable without the direct
participation of other key stakeholders in the mortgage market in Mexico such as
INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE. The new PDO was also more connected to the project
outcomes than its predecessor and hence more results-oriented.

HUDPL II and III did not identify indicators to measure the achievement of the PDO.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):
The Program supported a broad-based agenda of policy reforms needed to meet the
ambitious goals in the Government of Mexico's National Housing Sector Program and
National Urban Development and Territorial Planning Program. As noted above, the
revised Program addressed eight key policy areas within the Government program:

       1. Macroeconomic Framework.
       2. National Housing Policies and Institutions
       3. Improving the Housing Subsidy System
       4. Housing Finance
       5. Urban Property Registries and Rights
       6. National Urban Policy, Slum Upgrading, and Institutional Strengthening-
       7. Low- and Moderate-Income Land Development
       8. Disaster Prevention and Management

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)
NA

1.6 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

· Policy Matrix: The Policy Matrix of HUDPL II incorporated indicators to measure
    Program's outcomes and was kept under HUDPL IIII.               Many outcomes were
    appropriately dropped from the original Program's Policy Matrix (under HUSAL)
    because they actually constituted project outputs, rather than outcomes. The new
    Policy Matrix streamlines and better focuses the list of expected outcomes.

· Timing: HUDPL III was originally programmed to be approved 24 months after
    HUSAL. However, the presidential elections of July 2, 2006 delayed the approval of
    new loans with multilateral donors, as the groundwork for engagement with the new
    administration was laid. HUDPL III was eventually approved on November 27, 2007.

· Bank's financing: The GoM requested an increase in the amount of HUDPL II to
    US$200.51 million instead of US$100 million as was originally envisioned by the
    programmatic series; this request was approved. The Government requested this
    change in order to cover its borrowing requirements without needing to issue bonds
    under the unfavorable market conditions at the time. The new amount was well within
    the overall limits endorsed by the Bank in the Country Partnership Strategy of March
    2004.

· Trigger actions: Due to administrative, procurement and financial hurdles, the bidding
    for the quantitative analysis of the costs and benefits of different modes of low and
    moderate-income land development for SEDESOL was not completed in time for the
    second operation. The Bank recommended the waiver due to the strong performance
    of other components of the Program, including gains in disaster mitigation, national

    urban policy, and a sustained commitment from the GOM to meeting the agreed-upon
    output.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:
· Timing of Government and the Bank actions: Inconsistencies between the GoM and
    the Bank's procurement procedures affected the synchronization of the outputs
    supported by the Program parallel to the agencies' budgets. The budgets of public
    agencies cannot be rolled-over year to year and delays in procurement can therefore
    imply a loss of such funds and future diminished budgetary allocation for the agency.
· Institutional weaknesses: These also affected the delivery capacity of some of the
    counterparts, particularly SEDESOL and CONAVI. SEDESOL experienced five
    changes of administration during the lifetime of the Program.
· Changes in the institutional and legal framework affecting the housing sector: These
    changes affected the quality and degree of coordination between agencies in housing
    and urban development matters leading to confusion about which agency is
    responsible for which policy outcome. This can be seen in the current impasse
    between CONAVI and SEDESOL concerning which agency provides housing
    assistance for the very poor and indigenous populations and which agency holds
    decision-making power on land management and development for low-income
    housing. The risk of poor coordination among executing agencies was identified
    from the beginning as an important potential risk to the multi-faceted reform being
    carried out under the Program.
· Institutional coordination: SHF was designated by the borrower, the SHCP, to be the
    financial agent and to administer the loan. SHF was also responsible for monitoring
    overall loan implementation and coordinating all the executing agencies.          SHF
    demonstrated strong leadership in carrying out these activities and helped to
    overcome administrative inefficiencies in the other executing agencies that threatened,
    at one point or another, the implementation of the programmatic series.
· Delays due to elections: The need to wait for the new Administration to take office in
    December 2006 delayed the Program's implementation for more than a year.
· Poor articulation with state and municipal governments on housing and urban policy:
    State and municipal governments are the ultimate decision makers in matters of land
    development, public registries, and matching funds for federal subsidies. The limited
    coordination between the three levels of government in these areas restricted the
    depth and scope of the reforms supported by the Program.
· Lack of housing statistics and a unified information system for housing subsidies:
    Although there have been advances on data gathering, data remains fragmented
    across agencies and limited in scope. CONAVI's efforts in the development of an
    internet-based housing information system and housing monitoring indicators have
    not delivered a transparent, accessible and reliable system. Data availability and
    quality were not adequately monitored under the Program.




                                           6

· Delay in making HUTAL effective: The long delay in making HUTAL operational--
    which became effective only in December 2005--impacted negatively the capacity of
    CONAFOVI, SHF, and SEDESOL to contract out key studies required for advancing
    the objectives of the Program.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The monitoring and evaluation exercise for the Program was weakly designed,
implemented and utilized. The quality of the Policy Matrix for HUSAL was poor as it
incorrectly identified outputs for outcomes. Key inputs of M&E like PDO, outcome and
outputs indicators were not specified in HUSAL reflecting its lack of orientation to
measuring results. Broad supervision arrangements which eventually fell under the
responsibility of SHF were not explicitly addressed in the PD either.

The complex and multisectoral nature of the Program, added to the number of agencies
involved in delivering the actions outlined in the Policy Matrix, should have required
putting together a unified information system that would have allowed the Government to
assess its progress in the housing and urban development sectors. Even though HUDPL
II corrected some of the basic shortcomings of HUSAL in M&E, the outcome indicators
specified did not reflect the stated outcomes. The indicators did not specify targets to
measure progress against. Hence the proposed M&E framework did not provided
sufficient evidence to assess the Program's experience. The baselines that were provided
were for 2005 and therefore do not adequately cover the lifespan of the Program. The
Government lacked relevant outcome indicators, which could have been incorporated
into the Program. This would have been the most appropriate approach given the lending
instrument of this operation. As a result, there was very little ownership of the proposed
M&E arrangement by the various Program stakeholders; although the need to provide
subsidy indicator information for the Program informed the agreed subsidy reporting
format developed by the Subsidy Working Group, which has improved overall subsidy
reporting. The lack of indicators to measure the PDO was left unaddressed by HUDPL II
and III. Routine supervision activities did not address and correct the weaknesses in
design of the M&E framework.

Progress reports on the indicators have not been delivered to the Bank in a user-friendly,
versatile and consolidated platform but rather through separate reports and spreadsheets
which has affected the use of up-to-date information in supervision activities.

The lack of comprehensive and reliable information for housing subsidies makes
assessing this component a challenging task.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

The Mexico Private Housing Finance Markets Strengthening Project (P112258) was
approved by the Bank on November 6, 2008. The project's objectives are: a)
strengthening the financial capacity of SHF to stabilize mortgage markets in the short
term and to expand mortgage access to lower income groups over the medium term; and



                                           7

b) improving SHF's technical capacity to expand access to mortgages over the medium-
term.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The Program was relevant with respect to the Bank's Country Partnership Strategy of
2004. The objectives and design of the Program touched on all four pillars of the CPS:
reduce poverty and inequality, increase competitiveness, strengthen institutions and
promote environmental sustainability.

The objectives of the Program in housing remain relevant and well-aligned to the
National Housing Program 2007-2012. The Program's objectives and outcomes, as stated
in HUDPL II and III, remain current and pertinent to today's challenges in achieving an
equitable housing subsidy system; developing mortgage products accessible to the poor;
modernizing property registries and harmonizing these with cadastres; advancing land
development for sustainable housing; and designing regulation and mitigation measures
to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters.

The actions supported by the Program in practice constituted the first step of the policy
reform process in the housing and urban development sectors. The reforms in the areas
outlined above, remain incomplete and the outcomes, as presented in the Program's
Policy Matrix, have not been accomplished yet.

The shallow depth in some of proposed actions, with respect to the outcome, was in some
instances justified by the level of political willingness to carry out the reforms, the
inauspicious institutional and legal framework or the limited amounts of federal, state and
municipal funding. Today, some of these obstacles have been overcome and themes like
microfinance, public registries and land management are priorities in the current
government's agenda. A second generation of in-depth reforms in the areas identified by
the Program, with improved articulation between the housing and urban development
sector strategies, would contribute to achieve the goals set out by both the Government
and the Bank.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by operations and
outcomes)

The Program's outcomes and the revised Program Development Objectives are very
similar. The lack of PDO indicators makes it very difficult to gauge the Program's
progress in achieving its goals; however, as a result of this similarity between the
outcomes and the PDO, this section assesses the outcomes as means to approximate the
achievement of the Program Development Objectives. When data for the Program's
outcome indicators is incomplete or not adequate to measuring the outcomes, alternate



                                               8

indicators and sources have been incorporated into the analysis in an effort to bridge this
gap.

Assessment of outcomes

Note: This ICR covers the implementation and results of a series of three programmatic
operations: HUSAL, HUDPL II and HUDPL III. The contribution of HUSAL to the series
was already discussed and rated satisfactory for PDO achievement in an SICR (refer to
datasheet for SICR outcome ratings for the different components). IEG has reviewed the
SICR and downgraded the PDO achievement to moderately satisfactory. These ratings
will continue to apply. This full ICR accordingly rates the contributions of HUDPL II and
III to the results of the programmatic series.

Macroeconomic Framework


  Expected Outcome:
  Macroeconomic stability supports achievement of program objectives

  Actions supported by Program:
         · HUSAL, HUDPLII and HUDPLIII: Maintenance of sound macroeconomic framework
               consistent with the policy objectives and programs described in the Letter of Development
               Policy.


During the lifetime of the Program, Mexico has consolidated its domestic and external
economic            stability.        The     strengthened      macroeconomic           environment        has   been
characterized by sustained low inflation; a falling current account deficit; a steady decline
in the public debt to GDP ratio; low levels of external debt; a fully flexible exchange rate
regime; and strengthened financial regulation and supervision. All these factors have
made Mexico increasingly resilient to external shocks and have helped the Mexican
financial markets to better resist the recent global financial volatility.

Solid macroeconomic performance has stimulated unprecedented growth in the housing
sector as it has boosted investor's confidence. However, the funding gap faced by small
and medium-sized construction companies as they seek to tackle the enormous housing
deficit in Mexico persists.

Given the favorable outcomes, the macroeconomic framework is rated satisfactory.

National Housing Policy and Institutional Framework


  Expected Outcome:
  National Housing Policy established, along with supporting institutional framework to reach overall
  goal of producing 750,000 new housing solutions per year by 2006.

  Actions supported by Program:
        · HUSAL: Approval of the National Housing Development Policy and setting up CONAFOVI
               as the overall coordinator for housing policy.


The specific objective of this component of the Program was fully aligned with the
national program's goal of meeting the housing demand generated by Mexico's young -
age structure. This facilitated the rapid achievement of progress in this area. Since 2001,
the Government has implemented two coherent and sound National Housing Programs
(NHP 2001-2006 and NHP 2007-2012) which have granted continuity to the ongoing
pace of policy reforms in the sector, have allowed the Government to expand its medium-
and long-term goals, and have made environmental sustainability a key consideration for
the development the sector. The NHP 2001-2006 was directly supported through
HUSAL.1

The Program supported the creation of the National Housing Commission (CONAFOVI,
now CONAVI) to coordinate housing policy at the national level. This development
triggered the policy and institutional transformation of the sector.2 The actions supported
by the Program in this component contributed to:




1One of the biggest accomplishments in terms of NHP, though not directly attributable to the Bank's
Program, was the passing of the Housing Law of June 27, 2006.
2Under the Housing Law of June 2006, CONAFOVI was made autonomous, converted into CONAVI and
placed above SEDESOL. The law provided a more comprehensive institutional setting for the sector, and


                                                                10

· redefining the roles and responsibilities of the different federal agencies involved in
    the housing sector;
· creating an institutional framework that aimed at improving inter-institutional
    coordination; and
· augmenting the transparency of the federal agencies, public funds, and mortgage
    lenders operating in the housing sector.

In support of improving information about explicit and implicit subsidies, HUTAL
financed a ground-breaking study on the present value of the subsidy packages offered by
INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE. The study made significant policy recommendations
that have been adopted by these agencies and have enhanced the agencies' financial
transparency as well as the services and attention they have provided to lower income
borrowers. The Program also enhanced the institutional transparency of these agencies, as
evidenced by the fact that the allocation of credit is no longer dominated by client, party,
or labor union association. These agencies have become more coupled to the national
housing system, and CONAVI relied heavily on their operations to meet the objective of
producing 750,000 housing solutions per year by 2006 (and one million in 2007). This is
a key output given that INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE continue to be the main players in
the current system.

Despite the improvements in the institutional framework supported by the Program,
CONAVI's effectiveness in coordinating and harmonizing housing policies and programs
across agencies is limited.3 Institutional and financial imbalances exist between CONAVI,
which coordinates housing policy and has the lion's share of the resources for up front
subsidies, and FONAEVI/FONHAPO. The role of FONHAPO, which was originally
focused on assisting the very poor in accessing the housing system, has been particularly
unclear since CONAVI was granted autonomy from SEDESOL in 2006.

INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE, the most important players in the housing market;
continue to operate largely independently from the government's public policy and
budgetary management priorities. Nonetheless, in recent years coordination between
CONAVI, INFONAVIT, and FOVISSSTE on the levels of implicit subsidies and
eligibility rules for explicit subsidies for the formally employed has been improved.

Other shortcomings under this component include:

· Federal, state and municipal housing policies and programs are not yet fully
    coordinated and harmonized.
· Institutional responsibilities are currently unclear in the housing sector, leading to
    confusion concerning which agency is responsible for which policy outcome. This
    can be seen in the current impasse between CONAVI and SEDESOL, concerning



expanded CONAVI's responsibilities to defining the housing policy, coordinating Government efforts in
the sector as well as monitoring and evaluating the implementation the NHP, among others.
3The quantitative indicators that are presented in the Policy Matrix don't address the quality of the policy,
on progress in inter-institutional coordination in the housing sector

    which agency provides housing assistance for the very poor and indigenous
    populations and which agency holds decision-making power on land management and
    development for low-income housing.
· The urban development policy and the housing policy components were not designed
    or implemented in a coordinated manner. Since 2001, policy reform in the housing
    sector has moved faster than in urban development. This has been aggravated by the
    institutional fragmentation of the two sectors (which were previously housed under
    SEDESOL but are currently separated) as well as by the lack of a coherent urban
    development policy.
· A unified housing information system has not been established to harmonize policy
    and procedures between agencies. This initiative was proposed under HUTAL but,
    due to a lack of institutional interest, was never implemented. Today, CONAVI is
    developing such a system but it is not available as of yet.

Program results show that from 2005 to June 2008, the number of total housing solutions
available to households earning less than 4 MW increased substantially. However, the
share of these households in the total number of housing solutions remained static
through the end of 2007, evidence that the poor did not represent the majority of
households accessing these solutions during this period. This is problematic given the
Program's focus on the poor. The first half of 2008, saw noticeable improvement. For
the first time more than half of all housing solutions went to households earning less than
4MW.

Balancing out the accomplishments and shortcomings in this component, outcomes are
rated moderately satisfactory.

Housing Subsidies


 Expected Outcome:
     · Federal housing subsidies unified: amounts of housing subsidies across programs and income
         segments are harmonized and the package of programs offered fulfill all the main subsidy
         policy objectives.
     · Greater clarity of objectives, enhanced transparency, improved targeting and beneficiary
         selection systems, creation of equity, and avoidance of negative market effects.

 Actions supported by Program:
     · HUSAL: The Government has mandated a unified housing subsidy program to be administered
         by FONHAPO/FONAEVI that is efficient, progressive, and equitable as established through
         presidential decree.
     · HUDPLII: The Government has completed an evaluation of the federal housing subsidy
         programs, taking into account land and infrastructure subsidies delivered at the local level to
         federally-assisted housing projects. The results are reflected in the subsidy programs that have
         been designed for 2006.
     · HUDPLIII: The Government has reformed the existing subsidy system to: improve equity
         across programs; prevent the combining of subsidies from multiple federal programs; establish
         consistent rules for beneficiary selection, including by income group; and link the receipt of
         subsidy to household savings through (i) the design of operational rules; corresponding budget
         allocations (2007), and the implementation of a new federal subsidy program; and (ii) the
         modification of the operational rules of the existing subsidy programs.


The Program has directly and indirectly contributed to limited progress in improving the
operations of the housing subsidies through the following outputs:

· The subsidy system inter-agency working group, which did not exist before HUSAL,
   has become more active and has exerted influence in the coordination of the different
   subsidy programs. The working group produces a regular subsidy report covering
   both implicit and explicit subsidies using methodology originally proposed under the
   HUTAL. HUTAL improved the quality of the dialogue that has taken place within
   the government concerning the use of housing subsidies.
· The HUTAL-financed study on the present value of the subsidy packages offered by
   INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE shifted institutional attitudes and led the agencies to
   concentrate more effort towards working with the low income housing market. This
   study constitutes an important achievement under both HUTAL and HUDPL II as it
   was a relevant product and adequately articulated both operations. The study
   harmonizes how explicit and implicit subsidies are accounted for and is a major step
   forward in dealing with subsidy policy. Furthermore, INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE
   have adopted the recommendations stemming from the study with strong ownership.
   SHF's leadership was instrumental in the discussion of, and consensus-building
   process around, the study.
· In the case of INFONAVIT, the study was an important factor in shifting access to
   implicit subsidies (below-market interest rates, cross-subsidies) to lower-income
   formal sector workers, as well as in mobilizing private sector developers to deliver
   lower cost, quality housing solutions for this market. These factors have contributed
   greatly to INFONAVIT's recent success in servicing workers earning no more than 4
   MW. In 2007, 19% of INFONAVIT credit beneficiaries earned less than 2 MW and


                                                 13

     43% earned between 2 and 4 MW.                 During the first six months of 2008, 66% of
     beneficiaries earned less than 4 MW.4
· The federal funds used to support low-income housing have reduced their operational
     inefficiency, in part by limiting FONHAPO's role to the administration of Tu Casa
     subsidies.5

The component's specific objectives for the subsidy system did not correspond to the
Government original priorities, which were focused on leveraging the system of subsidies
to meet the goal of delivering 750,000 housing solutions a year by 2006 while targeting
low/moderate-income households. In 2004, the Government's priorities did not include
monitoring the characteristics of the beneficiaries of the different subsidy programs.

The component's objective was to put in place a consistent and unified housing subsidy
policy that was efficient, progressive and equitable. The ambitious objective called for
preventing double-dipping and facilitating low/moderate income family access to housing
while leveraging savings and private credit finance. However, the Program's objectives
were not in sync with the Government's actions, given that, in 2004, the Government had
not established a coherent policy concerning housing subsidies. The policy foundation for
the formulation of an equitable and inclusive federal subsidy program was not put in
place until the enactment of the 2006 Housing Law. For the Bank to anticipate the
creation of a unified system that was equitable, unified, coherent and progressive without
such a policy and a concrete road-map was overly optimistic.

The evolution in the institutional framework of the housing sector affected the operations
of the traditional up-front subsidy programs. For example, FONHAPO's PROSAVI was
eliminated in 2007 and replaced by CONAVI's SHF-operated Esta es Tu Casa program,
which was supported by HUDPL III.6 The new program tied access to the federal
subsidies to credit approval, as PROSAVI did; however in addition to traditional
mortgages, potential beneficiaries were also given the option of pairing subsidies with
micro-credit for housing improvements. This reflected a broader reorientation to support
incremental housing solutions (improvement and self-construction), which are commonly



4 Access to up-front federal subsidies for workers earning less than 2.6 MW was of importance in
refocusing mortgages on lower-wage beneficiaries. 2008 figures are from
http://www.infonavit.org.mx/inf_general/noticias/informes/2008/686.shtml.
5Given the negligible or negative impact reported by SEDESOL's evaluation of Tu Casa on variables such
as household income and health, currently subsidies are being directed to housing improvements. A follow
up survey to the 2006 impact evaluation of the Tu Casa subsidy program (based on a non-representative
sample) was contracted by SEDESOL. It found that a large percentage of the subsidized dwellings were
empty or abandoned. This finding was largely attributed to the poor quality of the housing solutions, lack of
public services, insufficient economic opportunities and the large distances separating the areas in which
housing had been developed under the Program.
6PROSAVI in 2004 was an SHF program which was moved in 2005 to FONHAPO. The shift in the
institutional setup has also been reflected in the budgetary allocation of the federal programs. On the one
hand, Tu Casa, which targeted households living in patrimonial poverty, has seen its allocation of federal
funds for subsidies decrease from MXP 3.15 billion in 2003 to MXP 1.63 billion in 2008. On the other
hand, the new subsidy program had a significantly expanded budget allocation of MXP 3.89 billion to
provide up-front subsidies to workers earning 5MW or less.


                                                   14

used by poorer and informal households. It also reflected an effort to leverage private
sector resources by fostering lending to the poorer segments, including informal workers.
The new credit-linked subsidy program lowered the amount provided to beneficiaries to
increase their number, as well as to make the total financing available to the beneficiary
closer to the real cost of the housing solution. Finally, the new subsidy program provided
incentives (an additional subsidy of 20%) for houses that incorporate environmentally
sustainable features in their construction.

After the adoption of the 2006 Housing Law, and the replacement of PROSAVI with
Esta es Tu Casa in early 2007, the Bank and the Government engaged less actively in
discussions on how to build a system that was equitable, progressive, and that would
prevent double dipping (the characteristics initially proposed by the Program); however,
the Bank did continue to comment on subsidy design when asked and as part of the
ongoing dialogue around the HUTAL.

The design of this component also reflects the recognition that in a sophisticated middle-
income country such as Mexico, the burden of responsibility for implementation of
institutional coordination and restructuring lies with the Government. In this context, the
Bank's initial lack of an adequate institutional assessment of the sector has been
important. For instance, FONHAPO's administrative hurdles, its long history of
inefficient management and weak collections (which affected the efficient operation of
their programs), was well-known by the time FONAEVI was created with the support of
HUSAL.7 The Bank's decision to support the creation of FONAEVI, without first
performing an adequate assessment of the institutional and financial sustainability of the
housing programs that had been created under FONHAPO, was therefore short-sighted
since FONHAPO's performance today continues to be poor. This again points to the
Program's lack of a coherent vision or plan as to how to achieve the proposed outcome
for this component.8 On the other hand, the Program played an important role in limiting
FONHAPO's role to the administration of housing subsidies and in eliminating their
lending activities. Lending by FONHAPO had experienced a long history of inefficient
management and weak collections.




7These inefficiencies were responsible for the continuous decrease in the number of subsidies that
FONHAPO was able to deliver and the rates of double-dipping that the system exhibited.
8By 2008, FONHAPO's subsidy operations remain undermined by the lack of or low quality of matching
funds provided by state and local governments for Tu Casa beneficiaries. Also, currently FONHAPO has
seen a severe budget cut and is seen as an irrelevant player in the allocation of federal subsidies, which
leaves a gap on the market for housing for the very poor.

The 2006 Housing Law and the associated institutional and program changes resulted in
advances in several important Government objectives:
· Significant progress was made in moving away from decades of relying on opaque
   and market-distorting interest rate subsidies to using up front subsidies that are more
   transparent and are better-oriented towards meeting the housing needs of the poor. In
   2004 only 1% of subsidy money was provided through up front grants, but by 2007
   18% of subsidy funds were provided as up front subsidies (see above table).
· By extending subsidy eligibility to cover incremental solutions (serviced lots,
   improvements), poor households, the majority of which build incrementally, were
   more likely to be eligible for subsidy assistance.
· Better targeting of implicit (especially INFONAVIT) and up front (CONAVI's new
   Esta es Tu Casa) subsidies meant that in 2007 about 61% of subsidy recipients earned
   less than 3 MW. These recipients received 40% of all implicit and up front subsidy
   funds.       This is a considerable increase over the 2004 baseline of 7% for both
   indicators.

The introduction of the Esta es Tu Casa subsidy program in March 2007 was an
important element in the HUDPLIII program. Evaluating the performance of Esta es Tu
Casa is challenging given the lack of a unified information system on what subsidies
have been offered and the limited access to the existing data on the characteristics of the
beneficiaries. This has been particularly challenging in evaluating the efficiency of the

program.9 Unfortunately, the outcome indicators in the Policy Matrix for HUDPL II and
III do not capture the main dimensions that the Program proposed for the new subsidy
program; namely equity and efficiency.

In terms of the equity of the new subsidy program, the following items support the
argument that the current program resulted in limited improvement in equity from its
introduction in 2007 to the first half of 2008.

The operating rules (ORs) of August 24, 2007 of Esta es Tu Casa (Table 4) establish
lower income cut offs for formal sector employees, which partially compensates for their
better access to mortgage credits and for the additional implicit subsidies they receive
from INFONAVIT, FOVISSSTE and other similar agencies. Informal sector employees
are not eligible for these additional implicit subsidies.10

The use of MWs to target Esta es Tu Casa to poor people is not fully consistent with the
measure of household poverty referred to in the 2006 Housing Law (Title IV, Chapter
IV), which refers to the 2004 General Law of Social Development and its associated rules.
The Consejo Nacional de Evaluación de la Política de Desarrollo Social (CONEVAL) is
responsible for establishing how poverty is measured. During the period of the Program,
the Law referred to a measure of patrimonial poverty consisting of 13 qualitative
variables measuring the relative poverty of the household (including household size, age
of the head of households, main assets, etc). In late 2008, CONEVAL began to consider
the incorporation of monetary income as a measure of poverty.

Although this measure has been very useful for cash-transfer programs such as
Oportunidades, it is not useful for a credit-linked subsidy program which depends on a
financial intermediary giving a loan to an individual and the individual paying back that
loan. This financial institution will always need to measure the monetary income to
determine the payment capacity and hence provide a loan accordingly. As Esta es tu
Casa is intended to provide up front subsidies to beneficiaries who are able to access
financing, the subsidy program uses the minimum wage received by individual workers
as the income criteria used to determine eligibility for the program. Households who are



9No data is available to measure the cost efficiency of the subsidy.
10According to INEGI data based on the National Survey on Household Income and Expenditure 2005, at
least half the workers with an income between 2 to 4 MWs are self-employed and thus lack proof of
income.

not able to access financing are expected to be targeted by the Tu Casa program of
FONHAPO.

The lack of harmonization between the beneficiary selection criteria of the subsidy
programs, as mandated by the Housing Law, calls into question whether the subsidies
being granted are efficiently reaching their intended beneficiaries. This is particularly
troubling given the fact that 60% of the workers that benefit from INFONAVIT and earn
2 MW or less have a combined household income between 4 and 10 MW and the
beneficiaries themselves are not heads of households.

The Government was more successful in expanding Esta es Tu Casa to informal and
poorer households by expanding access to households needing incremental housing
solutions, who were able to pair subsidy access with new SHF-supported micro-credit for
housing. As shown in the table below, by the first half of 2008, more subsidies were
provided for improvements than for acquisition of new or used housing. This is an
important trend. As subsidies for housing improvements are smaller than those for
acquisition, the share of Esta es Tu Casa financing provided for acquisition of housing
continues to dominate, but has decreased from 86% in 2007 to 80% in 2008.

Gains in including informal households by allowing support for incremental solutions
(improvements) in conjunction with micro-credit, should be evaluated against an overall
increase in the level of double dipping from 2005 through 2007, when the number of
people benefiting from both an implicit subsidy from INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE as
well as an up front subsidy increased from 3,283 (or 1 % of the total number of subsidies)
in 2005 to 72,804 (or 9% of the total number of subsidies) in 2007. Both the number and
share of double dipping beneficiaries increased sharply from 2006 to 2007 against the
principles of the program. This increase resulted from CONAVI's imperatives to fully
disburse funds before the end of the year.                    CONAVI saw its partnership with
INFONAVIT as the only way to meet this goal. Data for 2008 were not available in time
for this report, but there is fragmentary evidence that double dipping rates may have
declined during the first half of the year as the number of subsidies paired with
unsubsidized SHF micro-credit programs increased from 16,766 recipients (15% of all
recipients) with a value of 83,595,048 (3% of Esta es Tu Casa funds) in 2007 to 54,122
recipients (36% of all recipients) with a value of 274,412,009 (10% of funds) in 2008.11

The limited equity in the system has been aggravated by the persistent lack of affordable
credit options available to large portions of the population, particularly informal workers
earning below 4 MW, who make up the majority of the poor. Esta es tu Casa is not an
attractive program for SOFOLES and their private developer clients due to (i) increased
competition with INFONAVIT, whose low income clients have had preferred access to
subsidies while also benefitting from the institution's deep interest rate subsidies; and (ii)
private developers preferring to work with INFONAVIT because of its efficient
procedures12.

Some of the Program's stakeholders perceive the absence of an institutional commitment
to address the lack of housing solutions for the very poor, who are overwhelmingly
informal, as a persistent challenge to the equity of the system.

Based on the information available for this ICR, the progressiveness of the subsidy
system is still in question, particularly for the CONAVI and FOVISSSTE programs (see
graph below). INFONAVIT, which provides about half of all mortgages, is the only
institution which can cautiously claim to have implemented a somewhat progressive
system as a result of its targeting of implicit subsidies to lower-wage beneficiaries.




11It should be noted that the 2007 figures have been adjusted by the implementing agencies to take into
account new modalities in 2008.

In sum, progress under this component was mixed. Gains were made in developing and
applying a methodology for calculating implicit subsidies, reducing the relative
importance of implicit subsidies and increasing that of up front subsidies, and in a higher
share of all subsidy finance reaching people earning less than 3 MWs. However, despite
an ongoing dialogue between the Bank and the Government regarding this component,
the Esta es Tu Casa program does not exhibit the characteristics of an equitable system
that prevents `double dipping' and which supports the establishment of consistent rules
for beneficiary selection across federal subsidy programs. Based on the discussion above,
the component is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Housing Credit and Household Savings


  Expected Outcome:
  More loans, greater funding availability and penetration at market lower levels demonstrated by
  housing financial system.

  Actions supported by Program:
      · HUSAL: Congress has approved a set of reforms that strengthen the legal framework at the
           national level for mortgages (credito hipotecario), allowing for the adjudication of defaulted
           mortgage liens in federal courts, simplifying the documentation required to prove the existence
           of the lien, and allowing for extra judicial foreclosure of collateral trusts;

      · Congress has approved a new financial transparency law related to mortgage loans, providing
           standardized, clear and comparative information and contract to borrowers. SHF has issued
           rules for the licensing of property appraisers and the calculation of costs disclosed for
           residential mortgage loans.

      · HUDPLII: SHF has designed and implemented a pilot project to finance housing
           improvements and expansions in accordance with the standards agreed to by the Government
           and the World Bank.

      · HUDPLIII: SHF mainstreams financing for home improvement, addition, and purchase of
           existing housing in accordance with the standards agreed to by the Government and the World
           Bank, through the introduction of new partnerships and products for housing micro-finance.


This component was designed to increase, develop and stimulate the mortgage financing
options available and to make them more accessible to the poor.

Actions supported by HUSAL included important mortgage-related reforms which
considerably strengthened the legal and regulatory framework for housing finance in
Mexico. These reforms improved the functioning of the primary and secondary mortgage
markets, an improvement that was mainly driven by the enhanced transparency of the
system and the reduction in the associated risks for primary lenders and financiers. SHF
played a key role in this outcome, acting, until recently, as the leading financial partner
for the primary lenders in the housing finance market.

The prolonged macro-economic stability in Mexico also contributed to mobilize private
resources and increase liquidity in the market.13 This, in turn, has yielded an increase in
investment in the housing sector, not only by SHF but also by private banks and
SOFOLES. All these factors have made mortgage lending more efficient, accessible,
competitive, and cheaper for households buying a home. Since 2005, the dominant role of
SHF as a supplier of second-tier financing to SOFOLES has diminished considerably as
the latter have grown stronger and have increasingly replaced SHF funding through their
own investments and access to capital markets.




13 However, the funding gap faced by small and medium-sized construction companies as they seek to
tackle the enormous housing deficit in Mexico still persists.

The integrated credit-risk database for mortgage risk assessment that SHF designed and
implemented, with HUSAL's support, recently suffered a setback due to SHF's
diminished role as supplier of second-tier financing to SOFOLES. This database had
corrected the lack of information that prevented an adequate measurement of risk
exposure by market participants, and SHF made this information available to market
participants for efficient risk assessment and to lower the costs of credit to its customers.
As the dominant role of SHF has decreased, so has the information reported by
SOFOLES to SHF. The net result of this turn of events is that the database is currently
out-of-date and less relevant. To correct this problem, a law is being contemplated which
would mandate financial institutions to report lending information to SHF to keep the
database relevant and to continue to lower the costs of credits.

In the area of microcredit, the Program supported SHF's efforts to diversify the range of
lending products it offers in order to penetrate the market at lower levels and make
housing more accessible to the poor. Since 2005, SHF has successfully introduced itself
in the housing microcredit market (Graph 5). By June 2008, a total of 52,862
microcredits had been approved by SHF for an amount of US$22.82 million.

However, compared to other middle-income countries in the region, housing
microfinance products and market penetration in Mexico is in its infant stages.

Under the microcredit modality, the most important product which the Program
supported was the issuance of credit for housing improvements. However, despite having
agreements with eight different financial intermediaries, SHF has piloted this new line of
lending largely with one institution, Financiera Independencia (FI). Between 2005 and
2007 FI had allocated almost 62,000 micro credits (almost 5000-6000 credits monthly in
2008), ranging from MXP 10,000 to 15,000 to workers earning 4 to 5 MW. The main
obstacle to working with other financial intermediaries has been the need for technical
assistance to develop lending product specificities. Since the spring 2008, SHF has also
started working this line of lending with Te Creemos.

In terms of the Program's support for developing savings options as a means to improve
the poor's access to housing credit, progress has been limited and has been achieved
primarily through HUDPL III. The original savings accounts programs launched by
BANSEFI with support of HUSAL and HUDPL II had low levels of market penetration.
Issues affecting the performance of this program included: (i) limited knowledge about
how low-income households make savings decisions; (ii) limited awareness of how these
savings accounts could be linked to SOFOLES and bank lending decisions; and (iii)
limited willingness by developers to work with customers whose loans were linked to a
savings account.

In late 2007, informal workers' access to credit became more restrictive due to their
almost double levels of default rates. In response to this, SHF modified the design of the
savings program to better target this population. The new Ahorra SHF program assists
informal sector workers, who often cannot offer proof of income, to access housing
credits by approximating their credit repayment capacity to their contributions to the
mandatory savings accounts. This reduces the risk perceived by the financial
intermediaries.

Some of the new savings program's limits include the fact that people who participate in
the Ahorra SHF program do not have access to guaranteed credit even if they
successfully contribute to their savings account for six continuous months, as stipulated.
Developers are still reticent to hold units for the 6 month period it takes workers to
`graduate' from the savings program and receive funding.

There are two main shortcomings to this component's performance. First, the market
penetration of housing credits remains low, particularly in the rural areas, and
microfinance still only reaches a very small number of clients. The estimated market
penetration is less than 10 percent overall: this means that demand for these services far
exceeds their supply. To address the limited reach of Financiera Independencia in rural
areas, SHF anticipates intensifying its work with the cajas solidarias. Penetration has
also been limited by the number of intermediaries to whom SHF can lend according to
the rules established by the Ley de Ahorro Popular. Second, the interest rates provided
for microfinance loans are high due to high administrative costs. They can range from



                                                           23

3.6% monthly on outstanding balances to 50-110% on the original credit amount, with
the terms of the loan ranging from 6 months to 2 years.

The recent development of housing microfinance and the ensuing high interest rates make
microcredit expensive and inaccessible to low income households. As a result of this,
SHF's products don't yet reach the very poor (those earning less than 3MW) but instead
reach moderate income customers (earning between 3-5MW). A lack of viable
competition also limits the development of microfinance. However, microcredit is an
emerging market and further development could prove a viable path for low income
informal households to compete with INFONAVIT beneficiaries under the current
subsidy system, which matches the federal subsidy to credit. A stronger microcredit
system has the potential to address the gap in the current system.

Despite the slow progress in the component and the considerable challenges that lie
ahead, credit, microcredit and savings have been reinstated as options for the poor in
conjunction with access to the housing subsidy system. The actions supported by the
Program constituted important first steps in the advancement of these areas, and their
spill-over effects are already being seen in the system as financial intermediaries rely less
on SHF funds and the number of housing credits to those earning between 3 than 4 MW
increase. With the advance in microcredit as an option to those earning less than 3 MW,
the Program has contributed to address this segment's needs. Therefore this component is
rated satisfactory.

Urban Property Registries and Rights


  Expected Outcome:
  The time required to register a mortgage lien in pilot states is substantially reduced.

  Actions supported by Program:
      · HUSAL: Two state governments have started to implement property registry modernization
           programs with support from CONAFOVI.
      · HUDPLII: Five more state governments have implemented programs to modernize their
           property registries according to the guidelines agreed to by the GoM and the World Bank.
      · HUDPLIII: Property registry modernization program is expanded to cumulatively cover at
           least 18 states (representing 11 additional states).


Important progress has been accomplished through the Program and HUTAL in
modernizing and harmonizing public registries and rights in the 32 states of Mexico.14
This process has shifted states' perspectives on the value of public registries from their
legal and archival value to their value in enhancing states' business environment and
increasing investors' confidence.

The Program facilitated the dialogue between states and notaries concerning a basic
model for public registries; this effectively harmonized the 32 disjointed registries that
had previously operated in the country.15 This was not a minor task given the difference
in the human, technical, and financial capacities of each state's registry and the vested
interests existing around their operations. Aside from fulfilling the respective triggers for
each operation, the different stages of the Program contributed to the different stages of
the modernization process: HUSAL supported the dialogue between states, notaries, and
other stakeholders; HUDPL II supported building consensus around the harmonized
model; and HUDPL III supported the early stages of the implementation of the model in
some states.

The Program's work in this component engaged the different levels of government and
contributed to increased awareness about the importance of the registries and the priority
that public registries had in their agenda. This is reflected in the approval of the first
national policy on public registries and an increase of MXP417 million in funding for the
area in 2007 during the first year of President Calderon's administration. These factors
contributed to the political sustainability of the reforms the Bank supported and fostered
strong ownership of the public registry model within the states. The financial
sustainability of the public registries will be achieved mainly through their budgetary




14HUTAL has contributed to addressing the pending challenge with respect to the harmonization between
the public property registries and the cadastres which are under the responsibility of municipalities through
three studies.
15The model for the public registry was developed and piloted in three states, Sonora, Colima and Baja
California, with technical cooperation funds from the Inter-American Development Bank. The model that
was ultimately supported proposed the streamlining of all public registry procedures on-line and the
reduction of face-to-face interactions to reduce the possibility of bribery, increase access to services,
enhance the efficiency of the system, and increase its transparency.

allocation by the states and their revenue raising capacity; ideally this should make the
registry operations self-sustainable.

From an international comparative perspective, the recent progress in this component has
been slow but noticeable, particularly with respect to the cost of registering property, as
evidenced in the Doing Business 2008 database in Table 8.

The pending issues in this component involve the simplification of registry procedures,
the designing of low-cost operative systems that comply with the principles set out by the
agreed upon public registry model, and the advancement of harmonization between
states' public registries and each municipality's cadastres.

The Program fell short in recognizing that the modernization of public registries is a time
consuming process which can take 3 to 5 years to complete. For this reason, and given
the precarious situation of public registries across the country at the onset of the Program,
the outcome for this component as stated in the Policy Matrix was overly ambitious and
was unlikely to be accomplished during its lifetime. However, given the progress made in
establishing the foundations for the harmonization of the public registries system and the
priority it has in the current Government's agenda, as evidenced by increased budget
allocations to this area, it is very likely that the outcome will be accomplished in the near
future. Therefore, this component is rated satisfactory.




                                                              26

National Urban Policy, Slum Upgrading and Institutional Strengthening


  Expected Outcome:
  Increased efficiency of slum upgrading under Hábitat as measured by greater community participation,
  investment planning, and improved sequencing of investment.

  Actions supported by the Program:
      · HUSAL: The Government has approved and presented the National Urban Development and
           Territorial Planning Policy and has strengthened transparency through the presentation of an
           annual report on policy implementation and the provision of information on related programs
           to the public through the internet; and
      · SEDESOL poverty mapping has been completed and used for targeting social programs
           (Hábitat, Oportunidades, Liconsa).
      · HUDPLII: SEDESOL has strengthened Hábitat through participatory planning, coordination,
           and sequencing of investments.

The Bank's contribution to integrating the infrastructure and social development
interventions for the very poor living in slums under the single umbrella of Hábitat,
during the preparation of the Program is widely recognized by the Government.16
However, despite this previous accomplishment, the design of this component under the
Program was short-sighted in terms of the real challenges to urban development policy
and how the component's actions fit with respect to Hábitat's priorities.

The persistent lack of a coherent national urban policy in Mexico has limited the potential
impact of programs such as of Hábitat and Espacios Públicos which are both under
SEDESOL's responsibility. Today, these programs represent the government's policy
and strategy in urban development, but the isolated nature and demand-driven culture of
the interventions undertaken by both Hábitat and Espacios Públicos have limited their
impact on the overall urban development challenges facing the country. For instance,
Hábitat is promoted as anti-poverty rather than as an urban-development program. A
national urban development strategy must recognize that the challenges in the sector
include both poor and non-poor.

In this context, the Program, under HUSAL and HUDPL II, did not contribute to the
formulation of a high quality, coherent and relevant national urban development policy.
It also failed to contribute to coordinating the housing and urban development sectors,
which, even before housing policy was removed from SEDESOL, were very much
uncoordinated. Improving the coordination of these sectors under the Program would
have been a logical strategy. The institutional limitations to making advances in urban
development were evidenced with the lack of interest to undertake a sector environmental
assessment through HUTAL, as was originally proposed in the Program's Policy Matrix.
The lack of accountability in SEDESOL for their responsibility over the urban issues also
remains a limiting factor in the sector.




16The Bank's contribution came through intense AAA work and dialogue between SEDESOL and Bank
specialists.


                                                   27

The Program's direct support under HUDPL II was directed to integrating community
participation in the investment planning process of Hábitat in order to increase the equity,
transparency and sustainability of the proposed interventions. However, the use of
community participatory processes or consultations today is neither part of the Hábitat's
Rules of Operations nor of the logical framework of this program. Community
participation did not fit into the priorities of Hábitat. Furthermore, community
participatory processes for Habitat projects are still widely unpopular among
municipalities; they are seen as time consuming processes which delay the execution of
public works. Also, in most cases Habitat's resources make up a small share of the total
resources allocated to the particular project by the municipality; this does not grant
SEDESOL the leverage required to push for increased community participation.
Municipalities have addressed the community participation process in Habitat through the
creation of community centers which, according to SEDESOL's 2008 Evaluation of
Habitat's Community Centers, are mostly limited to funding recreational activities.

The results obtained today show that the number of slums that use participatory planning
as part of their self-diagnosis has not increased. Furthermore, these numbers relative to
the 940 slums that Habitat has intervened on since 2003, remain insignificant.

The biggest accomplishment of the Program under this component was supporting
through HUSAL the development of poverty mapping to improve targeting and the
efficiency in the delivery of the services to Habitat, Oportunidades and Liconsa
beneficiaries. SEDESOL developed detailed geo-referenced poverty data down to the
block level for eligible municipalities for these programs that have in turn improved the
efficiency in targeting of allocating federal resources in these social development
programs.

Given the issues presented above this component is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Low and Moderate Income Land Development


 Expected Outcome:
 Costs and time required for land development reduced. Increased scale of, and private-sector
 involvement in, low- and moderate-income land development.

 Actions supported by the Program:
      · HUSAL: SEDESOL has completed a full assessment of state and municipal land regulations in
            2 regions to rationalize and simplify land development process (States of Baja California, Baja
            California Sur, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Nuevo Leon, Sinaloa, Sonora and Tamaulipas).
      · HUDPLIII: The Government has completed a quantitative cost/benefit analysis of land
            development and has implemented a pilot program that facilitates low- and moderate-income
            land development.

Progress under this component has been based on the production of isolated outputs such
as regional assessments of state and municipal land regulations, land inventories, a cost-
benefit analysis for land development, and unrelated pilot projects. These outputs
however, have not contributed to achieving the outcome under this component. On the
one hand, the Program should have increased the depth of its proposed actions or
provided technical assistance to support converting these outputs into policies and
bringing the outputs closer to the outcome. On the other hand, the component's design
was constrained by the lack of a national policy or strategy on land development for low
and moderate income housing, therefore the political and institutional willingness of
SEDESOL to advance this component was limited. The Program also did not support a
dialogue on land development between federal, state, and municipal governments who
are the ultimate policy makers in this area.

Progress in this component after HUSAL depended on the completion of a cost-benefit
analysis of land development for low-income households, which was originally a trigger
action under HUDPL II. However, frequent administrative changes in SEDESOL and
internal disagreements within SEDESOL over the scope of the study and over the use of
the Bank's quality-based cost selection procurement procedures (which are unusual in
Mexico) prevented the condition from being met under HUDPL II. Instead, the condition
was waived and met under HUDPL III. Since the cost-benefit analysis was only recently
completed, there has been no follow-up to the study and therefore its impact and
relevance at this point in time cannot be assessed.

    Source: SEDESOL


The decrease in the number of serviced lots financed through Habitat (Table 11) is
explained by the large advance investments that local governments have to make to
service the land for housing and the relatively low level of Habitat financing that they
receive.



                                                            29

Given the delays associated with finishing the study, the pilot programs for low- and
moderate-income land development that were supposed to be based on the results of the
cost-benefit analysis were done by SHF instead of SEDESOL. In 2007, SHF launched the
Macro Desarrollos Sustentables Project which consists of four pilots on land
development for housing in the states of Michoacán, Yucatán, San Luis Potosí, and
Quintana Roo. These pilots intend to leverage private sector resources to improve the
quality and sustainability of the housing developments in these states and are expected to
deliver 182,000 housing solutions by 2012.

Balancing the incomplete progress on this area and the production of valuable knowledge
through the outputs, this component is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Disaster Prevention and Management

 Expected Outcome:
 Vulnerability to natural disaster events is reduced significantly in Mexico's major cities that receive
 support from Hábitat.

 Actions supported by the Program:
      · HUSAL: SEDESOL has carried out at least 30 community-level risk analyses and 15
           sensitization and mitigation projects under Hábitat program.


Support for this component by the Program was provided through HUSAL and HUTAL.
The component's assessment is similar to that of the land development component:
progress has been based on the production of isolated outputs and these outputs have not
contributed to achieving the component's outcome.

HUSAL supported Habitat in implementing three important types of projects to reduce
disaster vulnerability. Also, in 2005 Habitat's operational rules were strengthened to
allow co-financing of land and urban development plans that incorporate disaster
prevention criteria. Additionally, the new rules also increased co-financing for risk
atlases and risk maps from 50% to 66%, the highest of any Habitat component, in order
to encourage governments to invest in disaster prevention. However, until the end of
2006, there had been no substantial increase in the amount of Habitat's resources invested
in the component for Risk Prevention and Environmental Improvement, which could
point to a lack of interest of Habitat's beneficiaries for this type of project. Under the
Program, HUTAL has financed the preparation of risk atlases and 200 training courses.

The obvious downside of having designed this component under the umbrella of Habitat
is that local disaster prevention and management is still not part of an urban development
strategy and the component's impact was limited to those polígonos Habitat where there
was interest. Another serious shortcoming is that risk atlases remain un- or underutilized
due to a lack of specific technical capabilities in the municipalities that would enable
them to translate the risk atlases into effective mitigation projects and regulations for
disaster prevention and management. Today, the outputs supported through this
component and of HUTAL have not considerably reduced the vulnerability of large cities
to natural disasters. Therefore, the rating for this component is moderately
unsatisfactory.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)
Overall Outcome Rating: Moderately satisfactory.

Given the arguments presented above for each component and the contribution of each
operation to the overall outcome, the outcome ratings for the individual operations are as
follows: (i) HUSAL is rated moderately satisfactory;17 (ii) HUDPL II is rated moderately
satisfactory and; (iii) HUDPL III is rated moderately satisfactory.

The stakeholders interviewed agreed that the Program had three core areas: (i) housing
subsidies, (ii) access to credit and ability to save, and (iii) reform of the property registry
system. As a result of this consensus, the overall outcome rating attributes a greater
weight to these components.

                           Positive Aspects                                        Negative Aspects

Review.

The overall outcome rating assigned to the Program also takes into account the following
general conclusions:
· The Bank played an important role in convening power across agencies and created
    momentum for the reforms.
· Housing policy was coherently addressed by the Program with respect to the
    Government's strategy, providing an institutional framework for policy formulation.
· The Program's emphasis on analytical work, particularly through HUTAL, made
    significant contributions to the Government's efforts.
· The Program failed to coordinate the actions supported by the different components
    (e.g. subsidies and credit) and the different sectors (housing and urban development).
· The inequity in the Esta es Tu Casa subsidy program is a troublesome outcome as it
    has been accompanied by an increased servicing of INFONAVIT beneficiaries
    through subsidies as well as a reduction of resources to subsidy programs targeting
    the poorest.
· The HUTAL-financed study on the methodology to measure present value of the
    implicit and explicit subsidy packages offered by INFONAVIT and FOVISSSTE
    shifted institutional attitudes and has led these agencies to concentrate more effort
    towards working with the low income housing market. This study constitutes an
    important achievement.
· Despite the investments made by the Program and the Government, challenges
    continue to exist in addressing the housing needs of the poor that are employed in the
    informal sector.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate.

The ratings for risk to development outcome for the individual operations are: (i) HUSAL
is rated moderate; (ii) HUDPL II is moderate; (iii) HUDPL III is significant.

· The political and financial risks to the interventions of the Program in its housing
    policy and urban public registries components are negligible. This is due to the fact
    that the actions the Program supported in both of these outcomes are currently backed


                                              32

     by coherent Government policies. The political risk to the actions supported by the
     urban development components, on the other hand, is significant. This is due to the
     current lack of a coherent long-term sector policy, combined with the fact that the
     Rules of Operation for Habitat has not institutionalized the community-participation
     element that the Bank supported.
· In the area of housing subsidies, there is strong political willingness to deliver one
     million housing solutions per year. However, the political willingness within the
     sector institutions to address the inequities that plague the main subsidy program,
     Esta es Tu Casa, is less evident. The social risk posed by the distortion in the current
     system, if left uncorrected, can potentially threaten the long-term flow of net benefits
     to the poor. Hence, the risk to development outcome is rated significant under
     HUDPL III.
· SEDESOL lacks the technical capacity needed to transform the outputs that were
     supported by the Program through the disaster management and land development
     components into regulations, mitigation plans and pilot programs. This deficiency
     may have a negative effect on the relevance of these outputs with respect to an
     eventual urban development policy.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory

Quality at entry ratings for the individual operations are: (i) HUSAL is rated satisfactory;
(ii) HUDPL II is rated moderately satisfactory and; (iii) HUDPL III is rated moderately
satisfactory. The following items support these ratings:

· Years of constructive dialogue between the Bank, expert consultants and the
     Government preceded the final design and approval of HUSAL. The Bank's
     contribution of knowledge and technical expertise, both through staff and consultants,
     at the design stage is widely recognized and praised by the Government.
· The Bank strategically supported the Government in implementing a set of policy
     reforms in the housing sector. The outcomes of the policy and credit components
     were well aligned to those of the Government's program on the sector. For the
     subsidy component, the level of political willingness to carry out the reforms was less
     clear. The strategic relevance of the components on urban development is low given
     that the sector did not and does not have a coherent policy for the sector.
· The quality of the original Policy Matrix included in HUSAL was poor. Its design
     was not oriented to measure the Program's results and impact as reflected by the lack
     of indicators for PDO and outcomes and by the erroneous identification of outputs for
     outcomes. The PDO itself is not mentioned in the Policy Matrices of HUSAL,
     HUDPL II and HUDPL III. The Program did not have any M&E previsions and it




                                            33

    was unclear from the project document who would monitor its implementation. Given
    all these facts, the Program had low evaluability at entry.
· At entry, the Program involved only three agencies in the implementation stage while
    many others were involved in the dialogue required to harmonize and unify policies
    and systems. The coordination arrangements between all these institutions should
    have had more emphasis in the design of the operation.
· Shortcomings in the area of quality of supervision, which is discussed next, fed into
    QAE of follow-up operations.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements)
Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory

Ratings for quality of supervision for the individual operations are: (i) HUSAL is rated
satisfactory; (ii) HUDPL II is rated moderately satisfactory and; (iii) HUDPL III is rated
moderately satisfactory.

· The Bank's contribution of knowledge and technical expertise, both through staff and
    consultants, continued during supervision, but activities focused more on the housing
    subsidies, credit and savings and urban property registries components. Technical
    needs under the national urban policy, low and moderate income land development
    and disaster prevention and management components were left less attended.
· In order to respond to institutional pressures to advance the Program within the
    agreed timeframe, monitoring the fulfillment of prior actions for new operations was
    sometimes prioritized over a focus on the development impact of the Program.
· Data compilation was not a routine activity in the Program as the absence of suitable
    Government indicators meant that the indicators developed for the Program lacked
    strong ownership and were not regularly tracked. This negatively affected the ability
    of the team to supervise the program.
· There was a perceived lack of flexibility by the Bank in responding to the
    implementing agencies shift in thematic priorities, institutional hurdles and the
    budgetary constraints in SEDESOL under HUDPL II and III.
· Clients, particularly SEDESOL, perceived a deteriorated relationship with Bank
    counterparts as the Bank's team became more focused on preparing the follow-up
    operation than on providing support for resolving technical difficulties arising in the
    recently established outputs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Overall Bank Performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

The ratings for overall Bank performance for the individual operations are: (i) HUSAL is
rated satisfactory; (ii) HUDPL II is rated moderately satisfactory and; (iii) HUDPL III is
rated moderately satisfactory.

The overall rating is a result of the average of the loan's ratings at its various points: the
loan had a moderately satisfactory quality at entry; a moderately satisfactory quality of



                                           34

supervision; and an overall moderately satisfactory outcome rating.           Despite the
shortcomings in the areas of M&E and supervision, its convening power was a key factor
in engaging the different stakeholders in the policy dialogue surrounding the housing
sector. The overall rating also takes into consideration the Bank's role in supporting the
Government in creation and maintenance of a consistent housing policy, which contrasted
with the unfocused policy environment in existence prior to the Program's actions. The
Bank also provided valuable expertise to the Program through the excellent consultants
that were contracted. Lastly, the Bank played a key role in effectively promoting the
importance of modernizing the urban registries to the Government, which has in turn
adopted this as a main policy area for the period spanning from 2007 to 2012.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory

Government performance under HUSAL, HUDPL II, and HUDPL III are each rated
satisfactory, respectively. The following items support these ratings:

· Both the Fox and the Calderon governments successfully maintained a stable
    macroeconomic environment that weathered the turbulence of the global markets and
    also boosted private investment in the housing sector.
· Despite the change in administration in 2006, the Government maintained and
    strengthened its ownership of the Program's core components--housing, credit, and
    urban registries. The Government also proposed expanding its goals in the housing
    sector and has incorporated environmental sustainability of the sector as a main
    concern of its program.
· However, the Government has failed to produce a coherent urban development policy
    and to link this sector to housing policy which would have enhanced the Program's
    overall impact.
· Given the nature of the lending instruments utilized by the Program, the Government
    did not provide higher budget allocations to the implementing agencies that were
    responsible for carrying out the key prior actions. This, in turn, affected the
    implementing agencies' timely compliance with some of the Program's key actions.
    Additionally, under the HUTAL the use of the Bank's procurement procedures
    slowed contracting.
· The Government should emphasize monitoring the quality of the policies and outputs
    in the housing subsidies area and their coordination with other poverty alleviation
    programs in order to correct any distortions in the system which could have a
    negative spillover effect over the welfare of the poor.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory

Ratings for implementing agencies (namely, SHF as main coordinator and executing
agency and CONAVI and SEDESOL as additional executing agencies) performance for




                                           35

the individual operations are: (i) HUSAL is rated satisfactory; (ii) HUDPL II is rated
moderately unsatisfactory and; (iii) HUDPL III is rated moderately satisfactory.

· SHF satisfactorily preformed its role as coordinator of the Program for the different
    agencies involved. Additionally, SHF stepped in to cover for SEDESOL's
    shortcomings in the land development component under HUDPL III.18
· CONAVI's political willingness to engage in a dialogue about the performance of
    the Esta es Tu Casa program is unclear.
· Changes to the institutional placement of CONAVI have resulted in difficulties in
    establishing a more open dialogue with SEDESOL. CONAVI was initially under
    SEDESOL, then given autonomy and finally placed above SEDESOL. This has
    resulted in an inefficient dialogue between the agencies and the continued lack of
    coordination between the housing and urban development sectors.
· The lack of a unified subsidy information system that spanned across the different
    agencies involved in the Program, and particularly the lack of an M&E system at
    CONAVI, has been an obstacle to the appropriate supervision and evaluation of the
    Program.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall borrower performance ratings for the individual operations are: (i) HUSAL is
rated satisfactory; (ii) HUDPL II is rated moderately satisfactory and; (iii) HUDPL III is
rated moderately satisfactory.

Government performance for the Program is rated satisfactory, while the implementing
agencies' performance is rated moderately satisfactory.                    The overall borrower
performance is rated moderately satisfactory, as the shortcomings regarding CONAVI's
M&E provision contributed to the Program's low evaluability and SEDESOL's
institutional hurdles caused delays in producing the cost-benefit land study that was a
condition of HUDPL II.

6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)
    · There are trade offs between ambitious and comprehensive sectoral reform
         programs, which are potentially more beneficial, but inherently more risky, and
         more focused programs that address a limited range of issues for which both the



18Administrative hurdles within SEDESOL caused delays in meeting one of the conditions under the low
and moderate income land development component and this in turn jeopardized the Program's ability to
effectively carry out reforms in the urban development sector. These delays in turn affected the
implementation of the pilot projects in this area by SEDESOL to the extent that SHF had to step in and
implement them.




                                                  36

        potential benefits and risks are lower. The Program's relevance decreased when
        there was no coherent Government policy established in the sector where the
        Bank intervened, like urban development.
    · A policy-based loan is not the best instrument to address technical issues
        requiring considerable investment and which are not backed by an adequate
        policy framework. Instead, a combination of policy and investment loans might
        have been more effective in meeting the Program's goals.19
    · Inefficiencies and redundancies were produced due to the involvement of too
        many institutions, which were often at odds with each other over policy issues.
        This was largely due to the large number of components and sectors under the
        umbrella of the Program. A more focused approach, as previously mentioned,
        could have reduced these inefficiencies and redundancies.
    · The comprehensive nature of the Program required that adequate M&E provisions
        be written into the design of the operation; however this was not done until
        preparation of the second operation was well advanced. HUTAL should have
        played a role in fixing the shortcomings of the Program and its implementing
        institutions in this area.
    · The timing of HUTAL should have been better aligned with the Program in order
        to provide added value to each component.

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

(b) Cofinanciers

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
(e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)




19Combining policy and investment loans at the same time, however, might have crowded out other
important activities. A second option would be to follow policy loans with investment loans as is being
done with the recently approved Mexico Private Housing Finance Markets Strengthening Project
(P112258), which is a SIL.

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1) Final Comments on draft ICR provided by CONAVI

It may be noted that the study "Evaluación de los programas de subsidio directo a la
vivienda en México" (Evaluation of direct housing subsidy programs in Mexico), made
by GEA, Grupo de Economistas y Asociados, comprises the years 2002 to 2006, and was
completed in April 2008. The results obtained will be taken into account for the program
"Esta es tu Casa" that was created in 2007. It should be noted that several findings
resulting from that study are being addressed or applied in the program "Esta es tu Casa."

Mexico's housing subsidy policies have been subject to permanent changes, both in terms
of the targeting of programs and operating rules as well as variables that have been added,
for example, in terms of sustainability, to make the scope of each program more effective.
In view of such dynamics, it is very difficult to assess the scope of the upfront or implicit
subsidies as a function of the rate of changes.

                               PROGRAMMATIC LOAN

Development and Evaluation of Loan Agreement 7491-ME

In January 2005, the Directorate of International Financial Agencies (Dirección de
Organismos Financieros Internacionales) of the Finance and Public Credit Secretariat
(Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público) instructed the Federal Mortgage Society
(Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal) in its capacity as Development Bank, to act as Project
Coordination Unit, as Implementer and Financial Agent of the Affordable Housing and
Urban Poverty Policy Development Programmatic Loan in Mexico (HUDPL).
Consequently, the stages of identification and preparation of the respective operation
were carried out between February and June 2005, resulting in the Policy and
Compliance Matrix for each of the three stages in the loan.

The program preparation mission took place on April 25 & 26, 2007, resulting in the
basic document that was presented by the World Bank (Project Appraisal Document), to
negotiate the credit's legal documents (Loan Agreement). In that sense, on October 29,
2007, the Finance and Public Credit Secretariat (SHCP), the National Housing
Commission (Comisión Nacional de Vivienda, CONAVI), the Social Development
Secretariat (Secretaría de Desarrollo Social, SEDESOL), the World Bank and the
Federal Mortgage Society (SHF), the institutions involved in the program provided their
agreement and the corresponding minutes of understanding were signed.



                                           43

In view of the robust Housing and Urban Development Program attained by the
Government of Mexico, mainly as a result of the reforms introduced in terms of housing
subsidies, the World Bank was asked to increase the loan amount to US$200, 000,000.00

As a consequence, on November 28, 2007, the World Bank and the Federal Government
(SHCP), formalized the respective Loan Agreement, and the SHCP committed, as an
effectiveness condition, to submitting an Agency Agreement executed by the SHCP, the
Project Coordination Unit and the Financial Agent, which was signed that same say.

At the same time, on December 11, 2007, as follow up on the prior conditions to declare
the effectiveness of the loan, the Federal Mortgage Society opened a Special Account in
the Bank of Mexico to receive the disbursements from the International Financial
Institution and, together with the SHCP's counsel, prepared the legal opinions on the
above mentioned agreements; with these proceedings, the World Bank declared the
effectiveness of Loan 7491-ME on December 14 of that year.

Finally, the Federal Mortgage Society presented the single disbursement request for 200
million dollars, and received the respective funds on December 14, 2007 in the special
account, for later transfer to the Mexican Treasury on December 24, 2007.

Implementation and Operation.

The HUDPL III program had the purpose of continuing to support the efforts of the
Government of Mexico in establishing reforms in eight key areas of affordable housing
and reduction of urban poverty through its 3 co-implementation agencies, CONAVI,
SEDESOL and SHF:
    · Macroeconomic Context.
    · National Housing Policy and Institutional Framework.
    · Housing Subsidies.
    · Housing Credits and Household Savings.
    · Property Public Registries.
    · National Urban Policy, Improvement of Neighborhoods and Institutional
        Strengthening.
    · Development of Land Market for Low and Moderate Income Sectors.
    · Disaster Prevention and Management.

To attain the program's objective, the commitments agreed in the Policy and
Commitments Matrix were all completed in a satisfactory manner. Likewise, baseline
information on the monitoring indicators was delivered for each of the matrix
components.

In addition to these indicators, mention may be made of some achievements attained in
the various action areas:

In connection with the maintenance of a harmonic macroeconomic context consistent
with the program's objectives, México maintained its macroeconomic stability. As from

June 2007, the economic activity measured through the Global Index of Economic
Activity (Índice Global de la Actividad Económica, IGAE), showed a slower pace of
growth based on the information presented by the National Institute of Statistics,
Geography and Information Technology (Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e
Informática, INEGI). However, this result was affected by the lower number of working
days considered in said month as compared to the same month of the previous year.
When correcting for this effect, it may be seen that economic activity experienced an
annual growth rate of 2.7%.

In order to avoid an effect on inflation expectations, the Board of Governors of the Bank
of Mexico decided to increase the bank funding rate by 25 basis points, setting it at
7.50% as of the month of March (see Graph 3).

The rebound of the interest rates (Mexico's bank funding) and the reduction in the target
rate of the United States Federal Reserve, as part of the measures to counterbalance its
economic slowdown, were reflected in a sustained appreciation of the rate of exchange in
the last months of 2007 and up to April 2008, when it reached 10.51 pesos per US dollar,
a level that had not been observed since the beginning of 2006.

The House of Representatives authorized resources for subsidies in 2007, through
CONAVI, to which $3.892 billion pesos were assigned; and through FONHAPO, which
was allocated $2.104 billion pesos to give continuity to its progressive housing and urban
and rural environment improvement programs.

Regarding CONAVI's "Esta es tu Casa" (This is Your House) program, a cooperation
agreement was signed with the SHF, to operate as distribution mechanism for the
subsidies at the national level, while incorporating various program implementation
entities through an adhesion agreement.

With the purpose of targeting the subsidies on those who need them most and allocating
them with transparent arrangements, caps were set for the prices of plots, new or used
housing and self-construction or improvement projects, all of them expressed in multiples
of the minimum salary and with criteria for higher subsidies for lower prices, as well as
the possibility of covering insurance premiums or credit guarantees with the subsidy, to
decrease the potential risks.

Also, a study to evaluate the housing subsidy programs in Mexico was completed; it was
partially financed with resources of the Housing and Urban Development Sector
Technical Assistance Program (HUTAL). Its results made it possible to obtain important
information on the demand and supply of housing, urban services and infrastructure,
problems in the housing subsidy programs and in the institutions responsible for their
operation:
    · Houses have been gradually modified in accordance with Mexico's social,
        political and economic conditions, both in terms of size and quality and this has
        changed the characteristics of the subsidies and the forms of financing.
    · The scheme of direct subsidies is currently linked, directly, to the conditions
        established by the formal urban housing supply in its minimum expression
        (economical housing), which does not necessarily guarantee that such subsidized
        housing really satisfies the housing needs of the lower income sectors.
    · The purchase of housing is related to the economic capacity, with the welfare
        levels in each zone of the national territory being related to the infrastructure
        services and urban equipment.
    · The demand for housing is not necessarily related directly with the housing
        backlog. The calculation of the demand for housing needs to consider both the
        potential demand (individuals who are looking for housing units for rental or
        purchase) and the real demand (potentially demanding population with payment
        capacity to purchase a dwelling).
    · The establishment of contacts among neighbors for greater social networking of
        the population relates to the quantity and quality of urban services in housing
        developments. Surveillance is the service that is most greatly demanded by the
        residents of housing developments, followed by street lighting, transport and
        health care services.
    · Housing holdings: Of the population analyzed, 15.8% reported having finished
        paying for their previous dwelling, which indicates that a not insignificant
        proportion of subsidies is targeted at a group of population that were already
        owners of a dwelling.
    · Housing conditions: Only 40% of the housing units with subsidy are acceptable to
        the buyers, the rest are not satisfied, particularly with regards to size. When they
        have less than 5 years of occupancy, on average, a fifth of the sample with
        subsidy report that they would sell their dwelling (same proportion for non-
        subsidized), which indicates that they reject the products that are being offered to
        them by the developers.
    · Infrastructure: Local governments lack the appropriate management instruments
        to plan and establish priorities for public service infrastructure works; the


                                            47

  programming of infrastructure works suffers from serious continuity problems
  and the officials of municipal governments are focused on obtaining resources
  from the federal and state governments instead of paying due attention to the
  management of the local public services.
· The lack of planning and coordination in urban development ordinarily generates
  higher prices for the supply of land available for housing construction, sometimes
  due to lack of an adequate territorial reserve and in other cases due to lack of
  urban infrastructure.
· Impact of the direct subsidy policy:
     o Targeting: It should be measured according to two criteria; income
         (households with incomes below 3 minimum salaries); poverty, based on
         the poverty index defined by SEDESOL. According to the sample, 79.3%
         of the respondents are within this income range, and comply with the
         requirements of the operating rules. Likewise, 82.5% of the population
         served is suffers from some type of poverty (capacity poverty, asset
         poverty), however, the sample did not capture any family in a situation of
         food poverty, which is an indication that the granting of the credits favors
         households with higher relative incomes to ensure compliance with the
         payments, so that there is an implicit bias in the selection scheme and
         process against families with lower relative incomes.
     o Progressiveness: To the extent that the support is fixed (independently
         from the income of the beneficiary population), progressiveness is ensured
         given that for households with lower incomes, as a share of their income a
         greater support is being granted. However, the progressiveness of the
         support does not imply that there is also progressiveness in the purchase of
         the basic housing unit, since the service of the remaining debt, as a share
         of income, will necessarily have a regressive effect.
         Recommendation: Setting the amount of the subsidy as a function of the
         payment capacity of the beneficiary, that is, inversely proportional to their
         level of income; linking the direct subsidy upfront with implicit interest
         rate subsidies; establishing income monitoring of the beneficiaries in order
         to determine if the household receiving the subsidy does have or not the
         capacity to cover the payments stipulated in the mortgage loan.
     o Equity: SEDESOL has established that one of the objectives to be met by
         the subsidies program in the assumption of the existence of equity and
         progressiveness, is that it should be proportional to the mass of the
         deprived, that is: 52.7% for food poverty, 18.6% for capacity poverty and
         28.7 for asset poverty; which is not in agreement with the field findings.
· Impact of the public policy on the beneficiary population: Households with higher
 income levels, a larger number of members, greater age and schooling, have a
 lower probability of participating in the subsidy programs.
 The selection probability decreases with the size of the housing unit and increases
 in the case of the families that show a higher overcrowding index.
 The share of income devoted to paying their mortgage by the households that are
 beneficiaries of the subsidy program is ten points higher than non-beneficiary
 households.



                                     48

    · Recommendations: Allocate the subsidy as a function of the payment capacity of
        families and thus redefine the subsidy program to grant a bigger subsidy to lower
        income families.
       Redesign the subsidy program to consolidate growth in two areas:
           o House remodeling, expansion, improvement or for basic minimum units
                for families in a condition of food- and/or capacities-poverty, without
                mandatory credit requirements.
           o Purchase of housing for families in a condition of assets-poverty, with
                mandatory credit requirements.
       Unifying subsidies (direct and indirect), in accordance with the beneficiary's
       affiliation system, in order to prevent discrimination between entitled and non-
       entitled population.
       Designing mechanisms together with the municipal governments, to ensure that
       housing developments consisting of a majority of minimum basic units meet
       sustainability conditions to guarantee an adequate long term development and
       access to basic services similar to those in the formal new housing developments.

In terms of housing financing, during 2007 a total of 1,035,040 housing solutions were
granted by the housing organizations, equivalent to an investment of 252,066.70 million
pesos.

which has the objective of covering the housing needs of the low income rural and
popular urban population, by granting short term credits for housing improvement,
expansion and self-construction.

This program showed major progress in 2007, exceeding the target of granting 25,000
microcredits. The incorporation of new intermediaries as SHF clients is now in progress
under the new credit culture.

As for the modernization of the Property Public Registries, something that is fundamental
for the development of the primary and secondary housing credit market and the property
sector as a whole, important progress was achieved to generate the conditions of legal
certainty regarding the ownership of assets subject to registration and thus promote and
reinforce the rule of law in real estate transactions.

With this nation-wide program, documented knowledge is generated, based on a single
methodology for all the states in Mexico, fostering legal certainty for property
transactions throughout the country and strengthening the framework of property rights.
In that regard, modernization agreements were signed with 18 states (Baja California,
Colima, Mexico City, State of México, Guanajuato, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Jalisco,
Michoacán, Morelos, Nuevo León, Querétaro, Quintana Roo, San Luis Potosí, Sinaloa,
Sonora, Tamaulipas and Zacatecas), to identify the actions needed to mitigate the
weaknesses of their property public registries in the areas of:
    o Legal status and registration system (signature and electronic parcel-based
        registration system).
    o Re-engineering of registration processes.
    o Agile capture, enquiry and processing systems (information technologies).
    o Quality management.
    o Recognition of the registration profession.



                                                          50

    o Institutional policies for public registries with technical autonomy and their own
        assets.
    o Preservation of the inventory of documents through their handling and
        consultation using electronic media.
    o Participation and linkage with the cadastres.
    o Quality in operational statistics and services.
Regarding the components of National Urban Development Policy, Development of Land
Markets and Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, the targets were restructured with the
new administration with the purpose of improving the quality of life in the cities,
especially for the poorest, by providing social infrastructure and adequate housing, as
well as through the consolidation of efficient and competitive cities.

To this end, it is essential to generate favorable conditions for the development of
competitive, sustainable and less costly metropolitan zones and cities; prevent urban
sprawling; provide suitable land and facilitate access to services and facilities for suitable
development.

In that connection, the study "Costos y Beneficios de los Mercados Formal e Informal de
Suelo para Familias de bajos ingresos" (Costs and Benefits of the Formal and Informal
Land Markets for Low Income Households) was completed. It generated information on
the spatial and socio-economic characteristics which condition the operation of these
markets, in addition to proposing the necessary reforms to optimize the application of
public resources targeting low income households in terms of urban development and
housing.

In particular, land prices; the various financing schemes; the externalities resulting from
the various typologies; the legal and administrative aspects with impact on the processes
of exploitation and incorporation to urban uses including those that regulate, condition,
restrict, and promote adequate processes, derived from federal or local rules,
corresponding to administrative, agrarian, environmental or urban matters.

The following major findings may be highlighted:

· The urban land "formal market" is unable to offer land/housing products in a suitable
    quantity and price for the needs and purchase possibilities of an important part of the
    population, especially that with lower incomes. This situation has given rise to the
    emergence of several types of "informal markets" (or submarkets) with various
    degrees of integration among themselves and with the formalized market, which have
    become almost the only housing solution for low income households.
· In the informal markets (or submarkets), the low income population not only obtains
    land/housing at prices affordable for their income, but also fundamentally, obtains
    them in accessible quantity and payment terms, that are suitable for their economic
    possibilities and their culture.
· One of the factors that has most affected the prices of the land/housing products in the
    urban land market and its submarkets in recent times has been the land regulations
    imposed through urban planning policies, plans and instruments, such as zoning,



                                           51

  permitted land uses and intensity of exploitation, as well as the regulations on basic
  infrastructure conditions. Such regulations imposed by the planning instruments have
  a greater impact on the price of the land/housing the more consolidated the planning
  system and the less flexible its application.
· The particular characteristics of each city, in terms of its specific geographic location,
  its economic and cultural basis, as well as the particular traits of the property
  transacted, as a result of having a unique non reproducible location, generate regional
  and local specifications in the land markets of each city.

· Independently from the market in which the land/housing products are transacted,
  their price is determined by the quality, quantity and prices of the housing that can be
  built in each parcel of land and therefore there is a correlation between the price of
  land and the household income in a zone.

The main proposals include:
· Reversing the recent formal and informal urbanization processes which have
  produced the accelerated and disorderly expansion phenomenon that generates diffuse
  urban spaces and low density peripheries with large urban voids.
· Curtailing the land prices stemming from the short supply of land/housing, in
  accordance with the income of a majority of the population.
· Reviewing and establishing land use planning and urban development plans and
  programs to establish a programming for the use of urban lands to ensure a sufficient,
  well located and accessible supply for the whole of the population.
          o Forced urbanization traverses.
          o Price freezes in new development zones.
          o Mandatory land use and occupation intensities.
          o Establishing land use as the cadastre basis.

· Application of the concept of land provisions for the large housing developments that
  exceed the locality's mean growth rates
          o New city urban structure with efficient mobility and endowment of
              services and facilities.
          o Sufficient supply of well located urbanized land, accessible to all the
              population.
          o Adequate connection with the existing city.
          o Prohibiting the fragmentation of the urban territory into urban
              development sections that do not provide the services and facilities
              required for the total population.

· Application of subsidies for the purchase of land and/or housing focusing on three
  dimensions:
          o On the neediest households and according to their size, based on minimum
              habitability indexes, amount per household income/size.
          o On the urban environment, by establishing areas or traverses where the
              subsidies will be applied, based on the plans and programs.




                                         52

           o At the national level, by establishing cities where the subsidies will be
               applied, in support of the distribution of population and strengthening the
               national urban system.

· Expansion of the subsidy scheme for the purchase of land and/or housing for the
    social production of housing:
           o Neighborhood improvement and bonding, by means of subsidies applied
               to micro-credit schemes for productive activities, housing improvement,
               new housing in family plot and family condominium.
           o Saturation, densification and recycling, through trust schemes that allow
               for the joint participation of several households in partnership among
               themselves, with the government or with a private or social developer.
           o Inclusion of the neighborhood in the Habitat program.

Likewise, a pilot project was initiated in Mexicali, Baja California, for the design of
integrated schemes to expand the supply of land for urban development in order to
conduct housing actions for the poor.

This pilot provided recommendations and proposals for reform to turn the cadastre into a
land financing and management instrument, with a comprehensive impact on the
instrument available to municipal authorities for the property tax policy, assessment,
technology and exploitation. The major findings include:

· Municipal Urban Context: Deficient urban integration, irregular semi-occupied
    developments, plots without services, public development of vacant plots, minimum
    services, recent investments in water and drainage infrastructure, low urbanization
    investment (roads, pavements and facilities), vandalized vacant housing, depressed
    property market, backlog in property tax collections, among others.
· Institutional land processes:
           o Formal: in compliance with the rules on land use of the Mexicali Urban
               Development Plan, the Fractioning and Construction Regulations. This is
               the process that gives rise to most of the land and housing actions that are
               carried out by private developers, with public financing.
           o Informal: it takes place outside all urban and administrative regulations
               and fractioning rules. There is a demand for this type of plots from the
               population as a form of savings and investment. The legal irregularity of
               the plots in the irregular settlements represents an equity risk for the
               population that purchases them and prevents the financing of urbanization
               works, due to the difficulty in investment recovery.
           o Supply/Demand: There is sufficient land designated as reserve for the next
               17 years. There is sufficient supply of housing as a result of private
               initiative actions (excessive supply). As of 2007, it was estimated that a
               surplus of 33,088 units existed; 24,067 vacant housing units in the city;
               16,112 vacant plots under 500 m2 in urban colonies; internal housing
               capacity of around 19,800 units. The supply by public agencies represents

             only 3% of the land and housing offering. As of 2007, low availability of
             public reserves and low capacity to purchase new lands.
          o Public/private behavior: the government's negotiation capacity for land
             acquisition is limited as compared to the private sector. The government
             lacks the capacity to generate block land reserves and focuses on
             participating in co-investments with the private sector, leaving in their
             hands the handling of the sale to the purchasers.
 Evaluation: For electric energy, drinking water and sanitation services, the operating
 agencies offer feasibility of services. Regarding municipal public services (police,
 street lighting, maintenance of parks and gardens, solid waste collection, street
 cleaning), their expansion does not keep pace with the rate of urban expansion.
 Considering the availability of vacant plots within colonies that are consolidated or in
 the process of becoming consolidated, there is a potential capacity to accommodate
 around 19,800 housing units.

 Housing use in the city represents 57% of the occupied urban area as at 2006. The
 share of irregular growth in the city amounted to 457 hectares per year as at 2006 and
  corresponds to housing developments without a fractioning license.
  The city of Mexicali tends to deconcentrate the population towards the periphery; the
  proximity conditions are not being leveraged and the central spaces are becoming
  empty.
  The quality conditions of the urban environment for the development of new reserves
  demonstrate that the interior sectors have the lowest development levels.
  The land and housing supply is dominated by the private sector. There is a rampant
  production that results in an excessive supply of housing and the vacancy of housing
  in the inner city.
  As a result of the structural policy transformations the definition of the terms for
  social supply has been left to the market, limiting the action of the public sector in
  view of the favorable private sector competition conditions.
  The housing policies implemented at the municipal level provided the necessary
  financing to promote housing for sectors previously not served by the market.

· Proposals and recommendations: Process reengineering to determine the legal
  framework that needs to be updated. Implementation of legally binding electronic
  proceedings to decrease operating expenses and indirect costs. The housing policy
  requires a more robust legal and financial leveraging in support of the state's subsidy
  policy.
  Manage the creation of the "Land and Housing Municipal Observatory".
  Administrative, legal and regulatory reforms, institutional coordination, capacity
  building in administrative and promotion areas, as well as program dissemination.
  IMPI strengthening, activating the Habitat function and the Urban Observatory,
  linkage of the urban and environmental proceedings and setting up the State Council
  for Social Housing Promotion.
  Promotion of intraurban housing development companies and the reconstruction of
  housing; second mortgages, tax incentives and subsidies to integrated localization.

Lessons relevant for the future

As a result of the various supervision missions conducted by the World Bank's work
team, a good relation has been established with the Project Manager and the group of
specialists, which has resulted in a constant feedback on the definition of the program's
actions and targets, in addition to enriching and strengthening the technical assistance to
comply with the objectives.

Consequently, the National Housing Commission and the Federal Mortgage Society have
expressed their interest in continuing to work together with the World Bank through the
financing of new programs and technical cooperation.
