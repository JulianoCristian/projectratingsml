Ratings for the\n            Second Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project in Mexico were as follows: outcome\n            was unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. Ratings for\n            the Third Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project in Mexico were as follows: outcome\n            was moderately unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome\n            was significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory and\n            borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Lessons\n            learned include: the expected outcomes and scope of an\n            operation should be subject to several reality checks at\n            appraisal. An important one is to ensure that essential\n            partners such as INFONAVIT (National Housing Fund for\n            Private Sector Workers) in this case-are fully on board and\n            committed to the operation. If they are not, or cannot be\n            engaged for reasons of political economy, then an\n            operation's scope should be contained to cover the more\n            modest outcomes that can reasonably be obtained without such\n            partners. In large and sophisticated middle-income countries\n            like Mexico, an operation should avoid promising sector-wide\n            reforms when commensurate results cannot be realistically\n            achieved in the short timeframe and with the relatively\n            modest scale of assistance offered. Operations aiming to\n            support affordable housing and urban poverty reduction need\n            to be explicit about their target beneficiary populations,\n            with quantification of baselines and targets, and at\n            completion, achievements. Contrary to down-market aims,\n            establishing a sound reputation in financial markets and\n            sustaining a high quality and expanding portfolio can lead a\n            new mortgage financier up-market, by targeting higher income\n            borrowers with larger loans. Markets perceive such loans as\n            less risky. They are also less costly to manage and\n            contribute more to business growth."}, "docdt": "2010-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
