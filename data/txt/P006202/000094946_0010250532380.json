performances by both the Bank and the Borrower. Lessons\n            confirm that policy environment is crucial to achieve\n            success, and mitigate poverty; particularly, rural\n            development facilitates decentralized approaches, provided\n            devolution to local governments is accompanied by social\n            empowerment. This was demonstrated by the link between the\n            project and the Popular Participation Law, since it\n            energized implementation, transforming the law into an\n            instrument for rural development. In addition, the\n            participatory process allowed local communities, and\n            municipalities alike, to organize demands timely, based on a\n            consensus-building effort, which suggest that, despite\n            limited resources and capacities, the emphasis governing\n            investments, took into account the greatest impact over the\n            largest number of people, thus increasing local governance.\n            This municipal participatory planning raises the quality of\n            investments, since it identifies, and prioritizes demands,\n            reducing inter-mediation, and, likely ensures community\n            involvement, and improved service quality. However,\n            participation requires responsiveness, to avoid lack of\n            funding or investments accessibility, based on Government\n            commitments to facilitate national, and local priorities."}, "docdt": "2000-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
