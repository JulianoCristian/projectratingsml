The most\n            important lessons drawn from the experience in implementing\n            the project are: 1) Borrower's involvement is key for\n            an effective collaboration between Borrower and implementing\n            agency. The Bank can play an important role to promote this\n            collaboration by ensuring Borrower's representation\n            during Bank's mission, project visits, and major\n            project events. 2) When an ongoing operation is used to\n            provide supplemental financing for technical studies\n            associated to potential future operations, this supplemental\n            financing should be assigned only after ensuring that\n            sufficient funds are available for ongoing activities under\n            the project. 3) When there is more than one implementing\n            agency involved, individual project agreements between each\n            implementing agency and the Bank should be provided. This\n            will improve efficiency in the management and accounting of\n            loan funds and increase accountability from each\n            implementing agency."}, "docdt": "2000-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
