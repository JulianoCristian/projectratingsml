While sustainability of the cost\n            accounting system is probable as SONELEC (National Water and\n            Electricity Company) has demonstrated its capability of\n            using and maintaining it, sustainability of the distribution\n            network is unlikely due to overall poor management.\n            Specifically, the management cell for the distribution\n            network, which was set up to ensure good management, was\n            disbanded before the end of the project. The key lessons\n            learned are: 1) need for coherent sector development plan\n            prior to investment; 2) resistance to adopt procurement\n            procedures that would enable smooth project implementation;\n            3) need to critically assess management capacity; 4)\n            phase-out of technical assistance must be carefully planned;\n            5) project's objectives must be supported by targeted\n            components; 6) participation of other donors needs to be\n            sealed very early in the project; and 7) financial\n            equilibrium is at times a more appropriate goal than rate of return."}, "docdt": "1998-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
