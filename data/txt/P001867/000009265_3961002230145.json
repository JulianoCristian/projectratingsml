It also aims\n            at improving the population's standard of living,\n            promoting economic development through the provision of\n            water supply infrastructure, and at the same time reducing\n            the sector's dependency on the government budget. The\n            Societe Nationale d'Eau et d'Electricite's\n            (SONELEC's) investment program is subdivided in five\n            parts, the first four covering Nouakchott and the fifth\n            covering the secondary centers:  (1) studies, network\n            expansion and repairs; (2) rehabilitation and construction\n            of reservoirs; (3) expansion of production system; (4)\n            expansion of distribution system; and (5) water systems for\n            secondary centers.  The project consists of a coherent set\n            of actions, assembled as part 1 of this investment program\n            which are independent of the remainder of this plan.  They\n            include the monitoring of the salt water intrusion in the\n            existing Trarza aquifer and a study to establish a\n            groundwater management plan for the exploitation of the new\n            Tenadi wellfield, further from the advancing saline front.\n            The project also includes a program for leak detection, a\n            repair and rehabilitation program of the existing\n            distribution system in order to supply some of the poorest\n            parts of the population with water through privately\n            operated standpipes."}, "docdt": "1992-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
