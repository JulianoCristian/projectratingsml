would\n            undertake a pilot rehabilitation project in the state\n            enterprise sector. It would consist of: (a) a US$3.5 million\n            line of credit and a comprehensive technical assistance and\n            institution building program for the Malian private\n            industrial and traditional sector, and (b) the\n            rehabilitation and expansion of Union Laitiere de Bamako\n            (ULB). There are no significant project risks, although\n            hesitation on the part of modern institutions to assist the\n            traditional artisan community could affect project\n            performance. However, assistance to artisans has been\n            designed to minimize the possibility that available\n            assistance might not reach that community."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
