"The Highway Project consists of road\n            construction, feasibility studies, detailed engineering, a\n            highway maintenance study and the purchase of maintenance\n            equipment. The existing road from Chonju to Masan is narrow,\n            poorly aligned, badly drained, and has a rough gravel\n            surface, except for short paved sections near Sunchon and\n            Masan. The Masan-Pusan section is paved, but is narrow and\n            becoming increasingly congested. The new highway will be\n            built on a new alignment and will have a two-lane asphaltic\n            concrete pavement. It will be 56 km shorter than the\n            existing road. The Masan-Pusan alignment was chosen to\n            connect with an intra-urban link in Pusan to be financed and\n            built by the Government. Construction supervision will be\n            carried out by consultants acceptable to the Bank."}, "docdt": "1971-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
