The existing road from Chonju to Masan is narrow,\n            poorly aligned, badly drained, and has a rough gravel\n            surface, except for short paved sections near Sunchon and\n            Masan. The Masan-Pusan section is paved, but is narrow and\n            becoming increasingly congested. The new highway will be\n            built on a new alignment and will have a two-lane asphaltic\n            concrete pavement. It will be 56 km shorter than the\n            existing road. The Masan-Pusan alignment was chosen to\n            connect with an intra-urban link in Pusan to be financed and\n            built by the Government. Construction supervision will be\n            carried out by consultants acceptable to the Bank."}, "docdt": "1971-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
