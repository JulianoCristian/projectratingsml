The\n            project's original objective was quite simple: to\n            reconstruct and rehabilitate war-damaged secondary schools\n            and primary teacher training colleges in the three Eastern\n            States. However, in the process of reviewing their future\n            manpower needs in the light of postwar priorities, the three\n            States decided not only to restore facilities to their\n            prewar level but also to consolidate and expand them and,\n            more importantly, to implement reforms in the secondary\n            school curriculum. Nearly half the secondary school student\n            places and nearly three-quarters of the primary teacher\n            training college places to be financed by the proposed loan\n            represent additions to these institutions' prewar\n            enrollment capacity. Apart from the obvious advantage of\n            this modification to and expansion of the original\n            rehabilitation project, other less visible but equally\n            important benefits will follow."}, "docdt": "1972-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
