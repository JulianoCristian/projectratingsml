The lessons learned indicate that a good\n            combined effort by the IDA macro-economic and transport\n            sector teams and a real dialogue with the Government,\n            leading to firm commitments from the latter, can make\n            possible the undertaking of vast reform programs. More\n            specifically, the complementary relationship between the\n            adjustment and investment lending can ensure the success of\n            sector wide reforms. The Bank needs to coordinate all its\n            support and insure that the Government will not design\n            conflicting schedules in strategies implementation: the\n            rural roads strategy, for example, has not been rendered\n            sustainable so far because it interfered with much broader\n            decentralization issues that could not be dealt with at a\n            pace compatible with the project. The organization of road\n            maintenance and the sustainability of its funding requires a\n            gradual approach. A solid framework shared with other donors\n            with good coordination, coupled with a large stakeholders\n            involvement, is key to generating positive outcomes for reforms."}, "docdt": "2004-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
