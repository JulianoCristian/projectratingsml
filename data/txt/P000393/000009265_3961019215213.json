These objectives will be\n            achieved by: 1) state divestiture from transport operations\n            in favor of a greater involvement of private operators, and\n            institutions more focused on planning, regulation and\n            definition of sector policies; 2) better balance in resource\n            allocation between prudent investments and maintenance\n            expenditures, and sustainable resource mobilization; 3)\n            improved regulatory framework resulting in more\n            liberalization, increased competitiveness and more\n            competition; and 4) development and implementation of a\n            sector policy to protect the environment. The project\n            comprises the following components: 1) civil works on paved\n            roads, unpaved roads, rural roads, port, and the rail and\n            air transports; 2) goods; and 3) technical assistance and\n            training. More specifically, the project will consist of: 1)\n            execution of a three-year time-slice of the road\n            rehabilitation and maintenance program and bridge\n            maintenance program on primary roads of the priority\n            network; 2) execution of a rural transport infrastructure\n            maintenance program; 3) construction of two weighing\n            stations; 4) purchase of data processing supplies and\n            equipment of related offices; 5) provision of technical\n            assistance and consulting services; 6) training; and 7)\n            surveys and seminars."}, "docdt": "1996-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
