Lessons for nutrition\n            projects suggest that it is possible to reduce severe\n            malnutrition in a relatively short period of time, provided\n            mothers are better trained by specialized workers, and\n            educated with intensive counseling on food supplements.\n            Moreover, under-nourishment of women during pregnancy can\n            also be reduced through adequate education, and food\n            supplements. Lessons for community-based programs include\n            participation and involvement, to induce behavioral changes,\n            through widespread community mobilization, particularly\n            women's involvement in communication activities, in the\n            preparation of supplementary foods, and in growth monitoring\n            of their children. General lessons suggest the inclusion of\n            operational research, along with integrated, complementary\n            approaches, which should be incorporated early on in the\n            project design, to include efforts that increase household\n            food security, and nutritional services, coordinated by\n            nongovernmental organizations."}, "docdt": "2002-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
