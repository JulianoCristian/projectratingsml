is to improve nutritional status so that\n            malnutrition would eventually cease to be a public health\n            problem. The project will have three components.. The\n            National level nutrition activities component includes four\n            sub-components: 1) program development and institution\n            building, to develop national capacity in nutrition and to\n            promote needed policy research and operation research; 2)\n            information, education and communication (IEC) development\n            to assess current behavioral aspects relevant to nutrition\n            an develop appropriate messages and materials for use in IEC\n            activities through inter-personal methods at the community\n            level and through the mass media at the national level; 3)\n            strengthening of existing nutition activities; and 4)\n            project management, monitoring and evaluation. The\n            community-based nutrition component focuses on growth\n            monitoring and promotion activities with targeted and\n            supervised supplementary feeding at the village level in\n            community nutrition centers, which will serve as a locus for\n            inter-personal IEC and mobilization of community actions to\n            promote nutrition. The inter-sectoral nutrition program\n            development will improve nutrition by emphasizing\n            nutritional aspects of activities in various sectors and by\n            supporting innovative actions with potential nutrition impact."}, "docdt": "1995-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
