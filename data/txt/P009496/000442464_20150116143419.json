In\n            1995, the government launched the Bangladesh Integrated\n            Nutrition Project (BINP) with support from United Nations\n            Children's Fund (UNICEF) and a 59.8 million dollars\n            credit from the World Bank. By the end of 2001, the project\n            had reached more than 3 million households in over 13,000\n            villages across Bangladesh, providing services such as child\n            growth monitoring and food supplementation for those most at\n            risk - children under the age of two, women who are\n            breast-feeding, and pregnant women. In 2000, the World Bank\n            approved another 92 million dollars for a broader-reaching\n            national nutrition program, aimed at expanding\n            community-based nutrition services and activities. This new\n            initiative is seeking to ensure diverse and nutritious food\n            is provided to a group comprising nearly one-third of the\n            Bangladeshi population."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
