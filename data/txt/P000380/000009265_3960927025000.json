raise producer income, in particular of poor\n            livestock herders, and reduce the burden on the Government\n            of services it provides to the livestock sector. The project\n            will accomplish this by combining policy reforms and\n            investments to : (i) improve the efficiency of the\n            traditional and emerging modern livestock production sector;\n            (ii) promote the role of the private sector in the provision\n            of services to producers; (iii) make parastatal\n            organizations profitable and competitive; and (iv)\n            strengthen the planning and extension capabilities of the\n            livestock services of MINEPIA (Ministere de l'elevage,\n            de la peche et des industries animales)."}, "docdt": "1988-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
