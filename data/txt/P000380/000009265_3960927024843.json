The project\n            will accomplish this by combining policy reforms and\n            investments to : (i) improve the efficiency of the\n            traditional and emerging modern livestock production sector;\n            (ii) promote the role of the private sector in the provision\n            of services to producers; (iii) make parastatal\n            organizations profitable and competitive; and (iv)\n            strengthen the planning and extension capabilities of the\n            livestock services of MINEPIA (Ministere de l'elevage,\n            de la peche et des industries animales)."}, "docdt": "1988-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
