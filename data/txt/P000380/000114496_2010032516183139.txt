SCHEDULE
5
Special Accounts
1.
For the purposes of this Schedule:
 
(a)
the term "eligible Categories" 
means the following Categories set forth
in the table in paragraph
1
of Schedule
1
to this Agreement:
 
(i)
in the case of MINAGRI, Categories (1) through (5); and
 
(ii)
in the case of IRA, Categories (6) through (10);
 
(b)
the term "eligible expenditures" 
means expenditures in respect of the
reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and to be financed out
of the proceeds of the Loan
allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in accordance with the
provisions of Schedule
1
to this Agreement; and
(c)
the term "Authorized Allocation" 
means an amount equivalent to
$1,000,000
in the case of MINAGRI, and $300,000 in the case of IRA, to be withdrawn from the Loan 
Account and deposited
into the corresponding Special Account pursuant to paragraph
3
(a) of this Schedule.
 
2.
Payments out of a Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible 
expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.
3.
After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that a Special Account 
has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent
withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:
 
Page  12
(a)
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed the
aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or 
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account
and deposit into the appropriate Special Account such amount or amounts as the
Borrower shall have requested.
 
(b)
(i)
For replenishment of either Special Account, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the
Bank requests for deposits into the Special
Account at such intervals as the
Bank shall specify.
 
(ii)
Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to
the Bank the documents and other evidence required
pursuant to paragraph
4
of
this Schedule for the payment or
payments in respect of which replenishment is
requested. On the 
basis of each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account
such amount as the Borrower shall have requested and as shall have been
shown
by said documents and other evidence to have been made out
of the Special
Account for eligible expenditures. All 
such deposits shall be withdrawn by the
Bank from the Loan
Account under the respective eligible Categories and in the
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said documents
and other evidence.
 
4.
For each payment made by the Borrower out of a Special Account or a second 
generation special account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and other evidence showing that
such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.
 
5.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into a Special Account:
(a)
if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or
 
(b)
once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 
Categories, less the amount of any outstanding special commitment entered into by the
Bank pursuant to Section
5.02
of the General Conditions with respect to the Project,
shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such
procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.
Such further
withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been
satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Accounts as of the
date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.
 
6.
(a)
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of a 
Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant 
to paragraph
2
of this Schedule; or
(ii)
was not justified by the evidence furnished
to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such 
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or
(B)
deposit into the Special Account
(or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount 
of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified.
Unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into a Special Account shall be
made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as
the case may be.
(b)
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in a Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the
Bank such outstanding amount.
 
(c)
The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in a Special Account.
Page  13
(d)
Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraph 6 (a), (b) and (c) of this 
Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including
the General Conditions.
