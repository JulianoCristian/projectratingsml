Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Livestock Sector Development Project\n            for Cameroon. The major objectives of this project were to:\n            (i) increase meat and milk production, (ii) improve\n            producer's incomes; and (iii) reduce the financial\n            burden on the Government services provided to the livestock\n            sub-sector. To reach these objectives, both policy reforms\n            and investments were used. The project did not achieve most\n            of its objectives, which were too many and too ambitious and\n            the project design was too complex, covering the whole\n            country. Although, during preparation, appraisal and the\n            first year of implementation, the Government was committed\n            to the project, this attitude changed with time and its\n            support became less evident, in part because of the repeated\n            suspensions of disbursements (country related), and the\n            resulting spacing of project supervisions. Apart from the\n            difficult macro-economic circumstances that affected the\n            whole country, the original project size and its complexity\n            hindered its sustainability. Overall, Bank performance was\n            mixed. Project objectives were consistent with Government\n            priorities and Bank strategy for Cameroon. The project\n            outcome is unsatisfactory because, it is not expected to\n            have any substantial development impact. Lessons learned\n            included: 1) Any operation related to the field of livestock\n            development in Cameroon should limit the involvement of the\n            public sector to a minimum; 2) The mid-term review should\n            have been organized earlier and not 4 years after the\n            project inception; and 3) The successful performance of the\n            Tsetse control component and the role played by the MSEG\n            demonstrated again the importance of: (a) decentralization;\n            (b) the one-line-command approach; and (c) the highest\n            possible degree of autonomy."}, "docdt": "1997-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
