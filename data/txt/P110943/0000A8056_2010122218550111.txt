                           The CDP is performing satisfactorily. Three main operations are financing the CDP.
                         1 -- Under the original H409TG (17.2mUS$) the implementation of community sub projects is advancing faster than initially planned and disbursement is at 60%. By the end of FY

                         2011 it is expected that disbursement may well be over 80%. Under original CDP a high number of community sub-projects (442 overall) has already been financed in all five regions
                         of Togo - 225 infrastructures and 217 income generating activities. The CDP is enjoying a significant level of visibility.
                         2 - GFRP additional financing (TF093124 - 7 m US$) . The school feeding component which was launched in 2008 as an additional financing of the CDP has successfully completed
                         its two years of operation serving more than 20,000 primary school students in 92. The GFRP allocation has also financed an agricultural component which has purchased fertilizers
                         and seed and supported capacity building. (out of the US$7m of the GFRP 75% has been disbursed).
                         3. CRW H6020 (8.7m US$). The School feeding Component of the PDC has now been refinanced for another two years (reaching almost 40,000 children) in 180 schools of Togo,
                         through an IDA Crisis Response Window Allocation. Under the same CRW intervention a new component to the CDP has been added to provide 25,000 people with temporary
                         employment opportunities to rehabilitate small infrastructures, roads, and to support reforestation.
                         The mid term review of the PDC is scheduled for January 2011.
