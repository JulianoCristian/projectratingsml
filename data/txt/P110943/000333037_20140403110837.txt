﻿Implementation Completion and Results Report
Togo Community Development Project
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
During a prolonged governance and economic crisis (1990-2005), the people of Togo fell into a
spiral of poverty and destitution. GDP per capita dropped at an average rate of 1% per annum,
health services deteriorated, and only 17% of 11 year old children were enrolled in school. In
2006, 62 percent of the population lived below the poverty line. During this period, international
aid was reduced and then suspended. Following a Presidential election in 2005 and legislative
elections in 2007, Togo engaged in a dialogue with the international community which led to the
re-establishment of full economic and financial relations.
Between 2005 and 2008 Bank involvement focused on analytic work and on a LICUS TF funded
Emergency Program for Poverty Reduction (EPPR) based on a community driven development
(CDD) approach. Government and Bank strategies were set out in a Government Interim
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) and a Bank Interim Strategy Note (ISN), both of
which targeted improved governance and transparency, return to private sector-led growth, and
provision for urgent social needs.
The Community Development Project (CDP) was a centerpiece of the Bank ISN. The project
was the main instrument for delivering on the ISN's third pillar of addressing urgent social needs.
Building on the positive CDD experience of the EPPR, the project was to help the Government
deliver visible results to the population through improving access to, and supply of, basic social
services for the most vulnerable groups. The CDD approach was seen to be particularly
appropriate given the low capacity, fragile context and the need to stimulate participation at the
grassroots level. The design included support for construction/rehabilitation of primary schools,
health posts, water points, rural roads, and other socio-economic infrastructure, as well as
support for community-driven income generating activities. Support was later added for school
feeding, labor intensive public works, and agricultural inputs as part of the Bank's response to
the global food, fuel, and financial crisis.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
Initially financed by a grant of USD 17.2 million (IDA grant H4090), the Togo Community
Development Project was approved by the Bank Board in June 2008 as an Emergency Operation.
The original Project Development Objective (PDO) was to provide poor communities with
improved basic socio-economic infrastructures and income generating activities by financing at
least 350 subprojects to be identified and implemented directly by communities. The original
key indicators were as follows:
1


﻿+ Repartition of financing of sub-projects consistent with regional targeting criteria by the 2006
Welfare Survey ('QUIBB')
+ Number of new sub-projects functioning one year after completion
+ Number of communities that, following sensitization and training, have presented a proposal
which was approved by the regional support agency (AGAIB) approval committee
+ Minimum number of subprojects which reflect the priorities of targeted communities and
beneficiaries at mid-term review (MTR) and at end of project
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
In response to escalating food prices, the Bank provided additional financing of US$7.0 million
(TF-91324) for the PDC in October 2008 from the Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund, four
months after Board approval of the initial financing. As a response to rising food prices, the
additional financing supported an additional sub-component for school feeding and a new
component for enhanced cereals production. The support for school feeding was meant to
respond to the impact of the food price crisis on children in rural and poor areas of the country.
The rationale for the enhanced cereals production component was to counteract rising cereals
prices by boosting productivity in the sector through provision of seeds and fertilizer, which
were in limited use in the country. The PDO was formally amended as follows (changes
marked): 'To provide poor communities with improved basic socio-economic infrastructures
and income generating activities by financing, among others, at least 350 subprojects to be
identified and implemented directly by communities.' With the new focus on child nutrition and
food production, two additional results indicators were added to the results framework. The
additional project outcome indicators tracked the number of beneficiaries of school feeding
activities, the quantity of cereals delivered, and number of farmers benefiting.
The Bank again made use of the flexibility of the project implementation mechanism with a
second additional financing of $8.7 million (Grant H6020) in June 2010 to respond to the global
financial and economic crisis. The second additional financing, with resources from the Pilot
Crisis Response Window (CRW), scaled up school feeding and introduced a new sub-component
for labor-intensive public works as safety net mechanisms to help blunt the impact of the global
crisis. The PDO was formally amended for a second time, as follows (changes marked): 'To
provide selected poor communities with improved basic socio-economic infrastructures, income-
generating and labor intensive activities and access to food, by financing, among others, at-least
350 sub-projects to be identified and implemented directly by communities.'
At the same time, the outcome indicators were revised to reflect the additional sub-components
and to strengthen the relevance of the indicators to the PDO, particularly to measure improved
access. Two indicators were added, and two were dropped so as to streamline the number of
indicators being tracked and reported on, and one indicator was amended.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The primary target groups of the project were poor communities in all five regions of Togo, as
identified through the 2006 Welfare Survey (QUIBB).
1.5 Original Components
The original components were: (1) community sub-projects (USD 12.5 million) to improve
access to education, health, water and sanitation and other socio-economic infrastructures, and to
increase income generating opportunities; (2) training (USD 1.7 million) at community, regional
and national levels; and (3) management, operating costs and audits (USD 3.0 million). Total
project cost was USD 14.2 million, plus an imputed community contribution of USD 0.63
million.
1.6 Revised Components
The restructuring to accommodate the additional resources made available to the project in
September 2008 and June 2010 resulted in the following project structure:

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The original operation was an emergency project prepared under Operational Policy 8.0 (Rapid
Response to Crises and Emergencies) designed to consolidate the Bank's re-engagement with
Togo. The project was designed for rapid impact within the shared goals of the Government's I-
PRSP and the Bank ISN, particularly poverty reduction, satisfaction of urgent social needs, and
the strengthening of local and regional capacity for sustainable development.
The flexible and modular design provided a framework within which further activities and
financing could be added. Involvement of government agencies, central, regional and local civil
society institutions and other Development Partner (DPs) in preparation ensured that project
design reflected objectives and experience of all stakeholders and created ownership of the
resulting project.
The identification of the specific problems to be addressed - poverty, health, institutional and
educational status - was accurate, and the resulting design responded to these problems by
providing income generation, health and educational services provision and access, and nutrition
for the most vulnerable group, children.
The project was designed on the basis of past experiences both worldwide and in Togo
(particularly the EPPR). Lessons incorporated included: (1) simplicity of design (at least
initially); (2) participatory processes that strengthened community ownership; (3) a planning and
4


﻿implementation process that combined strong leadership from the center with effective regional
planning and implementation support and, at community level, well-tested bottom up
institutional mechanisms , notably the village development associations ('CVDs'), of which
1,700 already existed across the country; and (4) clear and comprehensive implementation
procedures set out in manuals. The comprehensive 2006 Welfare Survey (QUIBB) provided an
effective basis for targeting. The reliance on the existing regional Grassroots Development
Support Agencies (Agences d'Appui aux Initiatives de Base-AGAIB) and implementation
procedures that had already proved effective meant that the project was ready for implementation.
Risks and mitigating measures, most of them common to all CDD projects, were assessed as
follows:

lower risks and greater experience.
These risks were correctly identified (and the mitigation measures proved appropriate and largely
effective).
A further risk assessment was conducted for the September 2008 additions to the project (School
Feeding and Enhanced Cereals Production). A hygiene risk was identified for School Feeding
and was appropriately mitigated by measures to ensure hand washing and cleanliness. The risks
identified for Enhanced Cereals Production - further escalation in global food prices, tension in
communities concerning the selection of beneficiaries, and negative health and environmental
effects of fertilizer and pesticide use - were formally correct, but did not capture many of the
main risks of a subsidized input distribution program (such as undermining of nascent
commercial markets, rent-seeking behavior, low cost recovery, and absence of sustainability or
development impact).
5


﻿Risks assessed in the Project Paper presented to the Board for the LIPW program added in 2010
were limited to possible resettlement issues and tensions regarding the selection of beneficiaries
and did not touch on other common risks attached to LIPW projects - poor quality of assets
created and difficulty of ensuring sustainability of those assets.
2.2 Implementation
Despite the implementation risks identified at appraisal (see 2.1 above), implementation was
largely satisfactory, even though extra activities were successively added to the project. The
project was rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory throughout implementation except for a
period between October 2009-February 2010 when the project was rated moderately
unsatisfactory because of implementation delays, especially in regard to Income Generating
Activities and community training. The delay arose because of poor performance of the FM and
M&E specialists and procurement delays in purchasing vehicles. The team agreed with the
Government on corrective measures, such as replacing staff and standardizing community
training, which resulted in the project returning to satisfactory performance in four months.
Much of the overall smooth implementation is attributable to the energy and quality of the staff
of the project coordination unit ('the PCU') and regional implementing agencies ('AGAIB') staff
and to the practice of contracting implementation support to locally based NGOs and consultants.
Management of the PCU and the five AGAIB was generally sound and professional. Staffing
was adequate, although some posts were slow to be filled (M&E specialist, for example, see 2.3
below). The decision to trim ten posts from the AGAIB in 2012 reduced the AGAIB's
supervision and capacity building performance, and the elimination of the PCU procurement post
at the same time slowed up remaining procurement.
Based on the village development associations (CVDs) and a light touch participatory planning
process, the delivery of Community Subprojects, the heart of the project, was on the whole
efficiently implemented. There were only minor execution delays and procurement problems
despite the risks in devolving functions to community level. Technical quality was good (96% of
infrastructure of satisfactory standard), and costs were lower than for comparable infrastructure
under other programs in Togo.
Implementation of the Income Generating Activities was contracted out to NGOs which had
varying capacity to identify, screen and support the activities. Two common implementation
problems encountered were that the financial resources available to the NGOs (10% of the
project cost) were inadequate to support implementation, and the two year duration of the
support was too short to ensure the activities were properly established and stakeholders fully
trained. Nonetheless, the activity was fully implemented and reached four times the number of
people targeted.
The School Feeding program, an implementation challenge because of the dispersed nature of
beneficiary schools and other factors, benefitted from good cooperation between the regional
implementing agencies (the AGAIB) and the local branches of the ministries responsible for
education and social services. Implementation through local NGOs with ongoing programs and
experience in each region and the provisions for close follow up and inspection contributed to
6


﻿success. The main implementation challenges were the wide geographic distribution of
beneficiary schools, very high supervision requirement to ensure proper management of funds
and meal delivery, and the cumbersome system of payments. Despite these constraints, the
component satisfactorily delivered 50% in excess of targets (17 million meals in 256 schools,
against a target of 12.1 million meals in 180 schools).
Despite the inherent and particular complexities attached to the implementation of labor-
intensive public works (LIPW), implementation encountered only moderate problems which
were eventually resolved. Challenges involved institutional arrangements, application of the
criteria for targeting of beneficiaries, and execution across 128 forestry sites and 123 other sites.
Contractual arrangements between the AGAIB and the National Agency for Forestry (ODEF)
took time to be concluded and put into practice, which led to delays. Arrangements for paying
workers through the postal system proved very slow and also contributed to delays before being
finally resolved after the post office increased staffing for the payment processing. Nonetheless,
the activity was completed and delivered 12% more work days than targeted.
The Enhanced Cereals Production component required cooperation between a number of
agencies. Implementation problems occurred with the seeds supply activity due to the limited
experience of the Ministry of Agriculture in assessing seed requirements and handling seed
stocks. The component nonetheless delivered on its (limited) targets.
Training was delivered by NGOs and was generally of satisfactory quality. Some deficiencies
occurred in the training of village development associations (CDVs) and local groups carried out
through NGOs which, although committed and possessing good local knowledge and relations
with communities, sometimes lacked technical knowledge and also lacked the in-house resources
for follow up once the two year training contracts were completed.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The M&E system was designed to capture the outcomes and outputs of project activities across
several dimensions: the quantity and quality of physical infrastructure, the manner in which
project resources were targeted geographically, inclusion and gender representativity, and the
respect of project procedures. The M&E system relied on two main components: (i)
consolidation at the central level by the Technical Secretariat of results monitoring data produced
by the AGAIBs, for which a computerized management information system was to be developed,
and (ii) a series of evaluations of quality and results, including two technical audits, two
evaluations of income generating activities, an evaluation of school feeding, an environmental
and social audit, and annual financial audits. Initially the project did not attempt to assign targets
for the number of sub-projects or beneficiaries in each of the respective sectors in which the
project operated (education, health, water, etc.) as the choice of sectors was left to communities
and unknown a priori.
To conform to new Bank-wide mandatory core indicators, the June 2010 additional financing
and restructuring added outcome indicators on numbers of beneficiaries overall and across
different types of activities and sectors. The estimation of numbers of beneficiaries and sub-
projects in each sectors was aided by the experience of the project up to that point, specifically
7


﻿the distribution of community priorities across sectors. At the same time, in order to prevent the
number of outcome indicators from being too large, two of the original outcome indicators
measuring community empowerment were dropped. In retrospect, it might have been preferable
to retain at least one of these indicators as a measure of the aspect of the PDO relating to
community empowerment. The June 2010 project paper also planned for a randomized control
trial impact evaluation on the labor intensive public works component. Funds were not allocated
under the Bank financing to fund this costly impact evaluation with the expectation that trust
fund resources could later be mobilized.
At the beginning of project implementation, M&E was slow to get underway. The first M&E
specialist had health issues resulting in lengthy medical leave. AGAIBs produced data on the
progress of project activities but consolidation at the central level was slow. Certain indicators,
such as those concerning the number of students attending schools, and the number of
beneficiaries of water points, were found to be very labor intensive to collect and as a result were
infrequently updated. In 2011 a new project M&E specialist was recruited and an international
consultant brought in to set up and computerize the M&E system, which finally became
operational in 2012 at both the AGAIB and central level.
Towards the end of the project, the Bank and Technical Secretariat took stock of the indicators.
To consolidate efforts and reduce the burden of AGAIBs, it was agreed to finance a large end-of-
project beneficiary survey to collect data that not been conducive to regular collection for
financial and logistical reasons. TORs were developed covering indicators such as the numbers
of students attending schools, the number of beneficiaries of water points and health posts, the
representation of women in community groups, the quality of community training, and
beneficiary satisfaction. The survey was completed in September 2013 and results summarized
in Annex 5. The Bank task team's application for trust fund resources to finance the randomized
control trial impact evaluation on the labor intensive public works component was not approved
and no other resources could be identified, rendering this aspect of the M&E efforts not possible.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Environmental, social and resettlement impacts were assessed at appraisal as limited and the
environmental category was B. An ESMF and RPF were prepared and focal points in each
agency were responsible for supporting their application. Training was conducted at all levels,
use of checklists was systematic in all applications for project financing, and all works contracts
contained provisions for environmental and social protection. Instances of non-compliance with
requirements occurred but these were corrected through further training and did not affect results.
An end-of-project audit found only minor anomalies and the Togolese Ministry of Environment
issued a certificate in October 2013 to confirm that the project had complied with environmental
and social protection requirements.
Procurement and financial management complied with Bank procedures and no major problems
were identified during either statutory audit or verification by World Bank procurement and
financial management specialists. A fiduciary issue did arise in 2011 when the AGAIB salaries
were raised without prior approval of the Bank. This led to temporary downgrading of the
8


﻿overall project rating (to Moderately Satisfactory), but was corrected when staff repaid the
unauthorized increases.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
Arrangements to ensure sustainability post-completion are as follows:
Community Subprojects: At the completion of implementation, responsibility for operation and
maintenance (O&M) lies with the village development associations (CVDs) and - in the case of
education and health facilities - with the local branches of ministries. Training and support were
provided during implementation to develop the capacity of the CVDs and to help them develop
sources of funds for O&M - for example, revenue raising plantations of cash crops or trees on
common or public land.
Income Generating Activities: Responsibility for O&M of assets and for business management
lies with the producer association party to the contract. Training and support were provided
during the implementation period.
School Feeding: As the poorest communities generally lack the resources to fund school feeding
operations on their own, continuation of the program requires sustained donor and government
financing. The school feeding operations under the PDC succeeded in convincing Government
to begin providing financing for school feeding out of domestic resources beginning in 2014.
Together with resources under the PDC's successor project (PDCplus), continued operation of
school feeding is assured for the next few years. Over the longer-term, efforts will need to be
made to ensure predictable and adequate Government funding for this activity.
LIPW: For reforestation works, the Ministry of Environment and Forest Resources has taken
responsibility and an agreement to this effect was signed between the Ministry and the PDC.
CDVs are responsible for other LIPW-created assets.
Agricultural inputs: As a short-term emergency measure, the component supporting agricultural
inputs focused primarily on meeting the immediate need for inputs while supplying modest
capacity-building support for advancing with the design of a more sustainable system for
provision of agricultural inputs. The project was not meant to take a larger role in the dialogue
on agriculture sector policy, which instead was left to the Bank's agriculture task team.
Section 4 below discusses the risks that arise from these arrangements.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High
Relevance of Design. The design of the project was highly relevant, given the context of low
capacity, poor access to basic social services, low levels of participation, and an urgent need to
deliver visible results to the population in a fragile context. The CDD approach permitted direct
9


﻿community participation in the decision-making process and implementation of subprojects,
thereby permitting rapid results despite low government capacity, particularly at the local level.
Design supported Government and Bank strategies (see 1.1 above) by strengthening institutions
and providing for urgent social needs.
Relevance of Objectives. The PDO was conservatively formulated to focus on outcomes for
which the project was directly accountable, and the results targeted were clear, realistic and
important. The objectives captured both the need to improve access to basic services through
creating infrastructure as well as the desire to do so through a participative, community based
approach targeting poor areas of the country.
Both the original components and the successive additions to the project responded to the PDO
and expected outcomes. One drawback initially was that, although the outcomes set out in the
initial Project Paper targeted improved access, the key indicators rather concerned physical
outputs (sub-projects completed and functioning etc.). This was corrected in the 2010 Board-
approved revisions when the revised outcome indicators measured access across all components.
Relevance of Implementation. As the project was implemented, it remained highly relevant.
The community-based approach, modular design, and local implementation support structure
made the project highly flexible. Over the course of implementation, this flexibility allowed the
project to expand to address further needs as they became urgent priorities, particularly those that
arose from the global food, fuel and financial crisis (such as school feeding, public works, and
agricultural inputs).
A testament to the relevance of the project is the extremely high levels of applications for
community sub-projects received from communities-in some sectors more than 10 times more
applications were received than the project had the ability to finance.

﻿The project objectives remained relevant through implementation to the end of the project.
While by the end of the project, the situation was no longer one of emergency, Togo still faced
acute needs for infrastructure related to basic services delivery, social safety nets, and access to
economic opportunities through income generating activities. Indeed, as evidence of the
continued relevance, at the end of the project, the Government requested support from the World
Bank for a second phase of the project, which was approved in March 2012 in the form of the
Community Development and Safety Nets Project (PDCplus).
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Substantial
The project's development objective and outcome indicators were restructured twice: first in the
Additional Financing of October 2008 and again in the Additional Financing of June 2010.
According to the August 2006 ICR Guidelines (revised Oct 5, 2011), the project outcome should
be assessed against both the original and revised project objectives. Both the original and
revised PDO statements can be divided into three dimensions:
A. Providing basic socio-economic infrastructures, income generating and labor-intensive
activities and access to food;
B. Targeting poor communities;
C. Empowering communities to identify and directly implement project activities.
A. Providing basic socio-economic infrastructures, income generating and labor-intensive
activities and access to food

Sub-projects functioning one year after
completion (%) (outcome indicator from
original PAD which was retained in both
restructurings)
The project exceeded the majority of outcome indicators related to providing basic socio-
economic infrastructures, income generating and labor-intensive activities and access to food.
The overall number of beneficiaries (268,119) was 134% above the target. The technical audit
confirmed that the project had performed very well in terms of the quality of infrastructure built,
with 100 percent of sub-project sampled in the technical audit being functional one year after
completion. The areas which fell slightly short of targets were i) the provision of agricultural
inputs, which was able to reach 98 percent of expected beneficiaries; ii) reforestation activities
carried out through public works which covered a land area of 2,032 ha, or 92 percent of the
2,200 ha envisioned; and iii) the proportion of female beneficiaries, which reached 44% as
opposed to 50%. The shortfall in regard to female beneficiaries was largely due to girls only
constituting only 42% of students in the classrooms built, and 40% of workers on labor-intensive
public works (see Section 3.5).
The original PDO targeted the completion of at least community 350 sub-projects. This goal was
achieved with the completion of 584 community sub-projects, including 290 socio-economic
infrastructures and 294 income generating activity sub-projects. The language specifying the
number of sub-projects was dropped in the June 2010 restructuring.
Component 1.1(a): Socio-economic infrastructure. Construction and rehabilitation of socio-
economic infrastructure, such as primary schools, health posts, water points, rural roads, and
other socio-economic infrastructure, was the largest aspect of the project in terms of resource
allocation (see Annex 2 for a breakdown of sub-projects by type). The project exceeded all
outcome targets for numbers of beneficiaries benefitting from improved access to infrastructure.
While setting sectoral targets in a CDD project is risky because the choices of communities
cannot be known a priori, the project achieved the output targets related to education (190
primary school sub-projects building or rehabilitating 621 classrooms benefitting 97,367
students ) and water (37 water subprojects resulting in 76 water points benefitting 63,440
people2). Due to community preference, fewer health facilities were built than originally
estimated (23 v. a targeted 40). In some cases, health authorities were sometimes not able to
provide personnel or operating funds and so a requested health sub-project was not approved for
financing. The beneficiary survey at the end of the project found that the 23 health centers hosted
144,096 patient visits in 2013 alone. The number of unique beneficiaries of the health centers
was not able to be calculated because of the possibility of repeat visits by patients.
1 Targets were for 360 classrooms benefitting 72,000 students.
2 Targets were for 30 water points benefitting 30,000 people.
12


﻿The outcome indicator measuring the quality of the socio-economic infrastructure aimed to
measure the percentage of infrastructure functional one year after completion (target = 90%).
This indicator originated in the original PAD and was maintained through the two restructurings.
The technical audit at the end of the project found that 96 percent of socio-economic
infrastructure sub-projects were functional one year after completion, thereby exceeding the
target. In fact, given the gap between the completion of the socio-economic infrastructure
between 2009 and 2011 and the technical audit which was completed in September 2013, the
technical audit measured the functionality between two and four years after completion. Four of
the 89 infrastructures samples (4 percent) were found to be non-functional. Three of the 89
infrastructures (2 percent) examined by the technical audit were found to be functional but with
serious deficiencies. The remaining 83 infrastructures sampled (93 percent) were functional with
acceptable technical quality, though 54 (61 percent) presented cosmetic or minor problems not
limiting the usefulness of the infrastructure at the age of two to four years.

Component 1.1(b). Income generating sub-projects. The project support 294 income
generation sub-projects, nearly doubling the target of 150. The number of people benefitting
from income generation sub-projects was almost four times the target (5,981 v. a target 1,500).
Income-generating sub-projects were primarily agricultural, including market gardening, grain
production, livestock, fish farming, food processing, and milling (see Annex 2).
No project supporting entrepreneurial activities can expect universal success among the ventures
supported, and in terms of the success rate of sub-project the PDC performed reasonably well.
The 2013 evaluation of the income generating sub-projects found that 75 percent were still
supporting improved livelihoods for beneficiaries, with 58% 'working well' and 17% 'working
moderately well.' 25% were found to be structurally unprofitable or abandoned. A quantitative
assessment of the profitability of these sub-projects was extremely difficult due to beneficiaries'
tendency to underreport their revenues to the implementing agency for fear of taxation and to
13


﻿make the case for further support. The evaluation of the income generating activities was able to
gather complete data on profitability for only 6% among the sample of income generating
activity sub-projects, not a large enough sample to draw any conclusions. Qualitatively,
interviews with beneficiaries found that 78% thought that they had improved their livelihood
through the sub-projects, with 12% reporting their situation being unchanged and 10% reporting
being worse off. Beneficiaries also reported that the incomes generated meant they did not have
to make high-cost short term borrowing.
The income-generating activities sub-component had the most success of any project
intervention in benefitting women. According to the evaluation, 67 percent of beneficiaries of
this sub-component were female.
Component 1.2: School Feeding. The approach of the school feeding program was based on a
system of village women who prepared and distributed meals under the supervision of Parent-
Teachers Associations (PTA) and experienced local NGOs. The approach, which by the end of
the project covered 256 schools in all five regions, promoted local economies by procuring all
food locally and employing local women. An evaluation of the school meals program carried out
in 2010 showed that the program provided two thirds of the daily nutritional needs of beneficiary
children. The evaluation also found that most children (72%) were satisfied with the quantity of
food and that while meat or fish was served 3 times per week, fruits were rarely served due to
budget constraints. Despite limited access to clean water in some areas, hand washing was
systematic in 85% of schools. Convinced of the value of the program, the Government allocated
its own resources to continue the school feeding program after PDC in conjunction with IDA
resources under the successor to the PDC, the PDCplus.
Component 1.3: Labor-intensive public works. A review of the LIPW activity found that 12%
more labor days were created than targeted. A total of 2,032 hectares (target 2,200 hectares)
were reforested on 128 public and community sites. Another 123 LIPW sub-projects were
completed (target 75 sub-projects). These non-forestry LIPW sub-projects included
rehabilitation of rural roads, construction or rehabilitation of village ponds and other community
water structures. Excluding trees damaged by a fire in the region of Savanes and which were
later replanted too late for the technical audit, the success rate for reforestation was 80% against
a target of 75%. The technical audit visited a small sample of other type of infrastructure
realized through LIPW, which were technically satisfactory but the sample size is too small to
draw any overall conclusion. The activity fell short on its (ambitious) gender and youth
employment targets (see 3.5 (a) below).
The cancellation of the randomized control trial impact evaluation due to the inability to secure
trust fund resources prevents the assessment of the project in relation to two output indicators
would have required such an evaluation (LIPW beneficiaries who were below the poverty line,
and related increases in incomes of targeted LIPW beneficiaries compared to a control group).
As no impact evaluation was carried out, data on these two indicators - and on the broader
impacts of the project on health, education etc. - are not available.
Component 4: Enhanced Cereals Production. This component was designed with a narrow,
short-term objective of supporting the purchase and delivery of inputs to increase the domestic
14


﻿production of cereals. The component reached 98 percent of expected beneficiaries covering a
land area of 2,032 ha, or 92 percent of the 2,200 ha envisioned. The component met its
quantitative targets of fertilizer and seed distribution and recorded yields were approximately 1
t/ha above the average for the region, which was the target. Therefore the component does seem
to have been successful as an emergency measure in increasing production and yields in the
short-term; the longer term impact was not quantified but is not likely to be significant. Cost
recovery was not an explicit objective, and the component recovered 87% of the full cost of
inputs. The counterpart funds generated through the cost recovery of inputs were used by the
Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Community Development to support young
entrepreneurs in agriculture and agri-business, and to strengthen targeted parts of the agricultural
value chain. The usage of these funds was agreed between the Government and the Bank task
team following inputs from the Bank's agriculture task team covering Togo.
The component also supported modest capacity building to help advance work on the design of a
sustainable system to deliver and distribute fertilizers and seeds, an area that continues to be
supported by the Bank under the Agriculture Sector Support Project.

Despite a general lack of data in a fragile state environment, the project sought to ensure to the
degree possible that project investments were directed towards the poor. To measure this, the
original PAD included an outcome indicator to verify that the allocation of resources for sub-
projects closely followed the relative levels of poverty among regions, explicitly excluding the
relatively less poor capital of Lom& and its close surroundings. This indicator was maintained
through the two restructurings. At the end of the project, the actual pattern of resource allocation
only differed by 3.5% from the distribution of poverty among regions as measured by the 2006
QUIBB, thereby achieving the outcome indicator target.

The Government and Bank team also recognized the desirability of a more fine-grained
geographical targeting beyond the region level, but wanted to leave a margin a manoeuver to
permit allocation to communities that had recently been affected by severe floods. Therefore,
below the region level, AGAIBs were given data at the beginning of the project on poverty level
by prefecture4 to guide allocation-but were also instructed to consider flooding and access to
socio-economic infrastructure as criteria in resource allocation. Below the prefecture level, there
was no poverty data available to guide targeting. This issue was resolved by the development of
a new poverty map and selection criteria which were incorporated into the revised PIM. This
was only available in 2012, too late to influence selection of the communities under the project,
but its use has been key to permitting more granular targeting in the follow-up project.
Support to school feeding was targeted geographically and categorically to schools meeting the
following criteria: (i) geographically isolated or difficult to access schools; (ii) schools in disaster
affected areas (floods, fire); (iii) schools prone to child trafficking due to proximity to borders;
(iv) schools with high drop-out rates; (v) informal or community schools without adequate
infrastructure or teachers; (vi) schools with low attendance rates; and (vii) schools with high
levels of gender disparity. The selection of schools meeting these criteria was made by the
regional offices of the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Social Action, and the AGAIBs, and
then validated by the steering committee.
As with the community sub-projects, resources for LIPW were allocated geographically across
regions on the basis of each region's contribution to poverty in the 2006 QUIBB. Below that
level, communities were selected based on (i) poverty level; (ii) need for environmental
rehabilitation; (iii) lack of economic opportunities; (iv) ability to undertake maintenance; and (v)
availability of workforce. At the beneficiary level, community selection of beneficiaries and the
wage rate of FCFA 1350 (USD $2.78) per day aimed to discourage less poor people from
working. An analysis of the effectiveness of this mechanism was not possible due to the lack of
resources for a randomized control trial impact evaluation.

﻿The Enhanced Agricultural Production component specifically targeted farmers who were
members of production groups, who had at least one hectare of agricultural land, and who could
pay cash up front for half of the inputs supplied. The aim was to target the most productive
farmers in the respective production groups; it is likely therefore that this component did not
benefit the poorest.

(Refers to socio-economic infrastructure

Given the fragile state context and the desire to ensure community participation, the project
design called for community associations to play the central role in the choice and
implementation of sub-projects. As in all CDD projects, training of communities was of key
importance to ensure the success of the approach. Community groups received training on
community driven development methodologies, project identification and preparation of a
project proposal, procurement, and financial management. Training and coaching of
communities was provided by the regional AGAIBs and NGOs recruited to assist communities.
As a prerequisite of being approved, all projects had to be identified by communities after
receiving training and submitted by communities for approval to a regional approval committee
composed of the AGAIBs, local government officials, and sectoral Ministry officials. All 584
socio-economic infrastructure and income generating sub-projects followed this process,
exceeding the target of 350.
All 290 socio-economic infrastructure projects reflected the priorities of targeted communities
and beneficiaries, exceeding the target of 280. This was verified by the end of project
beneficiary evaluation (see Annex 5) which found that 99% of a sample of 2,152 community
members surveyed felt that the infrastructure sub-project was among the community's top
priorities.
17


﻿At the end of the project, an assessment of the long-term retention of trained community
members was carried out. Retention of concepts around the role of the community and basic
concepts of community driven development was strong, with 95% of community members
passing a short quiz on key concepts around this theme. Retention of concepts relating to
financial management was high at 97%. As topics became more complex, the number of
beneficiaries retaining key concepts decreased but was still significant; 68% retained knowledge
on project implementation and monitoring and 59% on procurement (see Annex 2). Overall, 75%
(or 1,663) of beneficiaries retained knowledge on at least 4 of the 6 themes measured, short of
the unrealistic initial target of 2,100, which would have required over 95% of beneficiaries to
meet this combined standard.
Communities also played an important role in school feeding and labor intensive public works
activities. In school feeding, Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) managed the delivery of meals
in each school, with the support of local NGOs. In public works, the project cycle operated in
the same manner as for community sub-projects, with communities taking responsibility for sub-
project identification (though wages were paid by a third party to avoid conflicts of interest).

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial
Given the emergency nature of the operation and its CDD approach, no evaluation of EIRR was
conducted at appraisal or ex post. Still, for most of the project components and sub-components,
M&E and cost data provides an understanding of the cost efficiency of project activities.
Component 1.1: Community Development Sub-Projects. The Togolese Ministry of Education's
forthcoming 2014 Report on the Status of the National Education System (Rapport d'etat du
systeme educatifnational-RESEN) finds that the PDC represented the least expensive approach
for building classrooms in the country. The similarly community-driven Education and
5 Table follows OPCS Guidelines for Implementation Completion and Results Reports, Appendix B: Attachment to
the Guidelines for Outcome Rating of Projects with Formally Revised Project Objectives (p. 44)
18


﻿Institutional Strengthening Project (Projet Education et Renforcement Institutionnel-PERI),
also administered by the Bank with financing from the Global Partnership for Education (GPE),
had similarly low costs. As shown in Figure 2, the PDC's costs for classroom construction were
below those for comparable infrastructure executed by ministries and other public agencies
(USD 116/M2 compared to costs of USD 131-230/M2 under other programs). The report finds
that delegation of procurement responsibility to communities was a key factor in keeping costs
down.

In regard to Income Generating Activities, the end of project evaluation of the income generating
sub-projects suggests that for the more profitable enterprises, FRRs can reach 30%, but the data
and sampling on which the estimate is based are fragmentary. A complete quantitative
assessment of the profitability of these sub-projects was extremely difficult due to beneficiaries'
tendency to underreport their revenues to the implementing agency for fear of taxation and to
make the case for further support. Overall, 80% of participating groups provided at least some
return (in cash or kind) to their members. As mentioned in the previous section, the end of
project evaluation of the income generating sub-projects found that 75 percent were still
supporting improved livelihoods for beneficiaries, with 58% 'working well' and 17% 'working
moderately well.' 25% were found to be structurally unprofitable or abandoned. Qualitatively,
interviews with beneficiaries found that 78% thought that they had improved their livelihood
through the sub-projects, with 12% reporting their situation being unchanged and 10% reporting
19


﻿being worse off. Beneficiaries also reported that the incomes generated meant they did not have
to make high-cost short term borrowing.
Component 1.2: School Feeding. Costs per child for school feeding were US$57 per year under
the project for a daily hot meal averaging 1,200 Kcal. Adjusted to 700 Kcal per day and a 180-
day school year for international comparison purposes, this equaled a standardized cost of $28
per student per year6. For comparison, Bundy et al (2009) found that in 2006, before the global
food price crisis, the range of similar on-site feeding programs was estimated to be between
US$28 and US$63 per year depending on the type of food provided, or about US$40 on average.
Given that global food prices approximately doubled between 2006 and 2010, according to the
World Bank Global Food Price Index, the costs of the school feeding program appear to compare
well to international standards.
Component 1.3: Labor Intensive Public Works. For the LIPW activity, the primary objective was
a cash transfer to the beneficiaries, with creation or rehabilitation of physical assets as a
secondary objective. In this context, the primary indicator of efficiency was the percentage of
resources spent on LIPW sub-projects allocated to wages. This indicator exactly met the target
of 70 per cent of the total cost going to wages (Annex 2). The remaining 30 percent primarily
financed materials and equipment.
Component 3: Management, operating costs and audits. Implementing agency operating costs
were reasonable in relation to investment costs, with AGAIB project management expenses on
target at about 15% of disbursements for sub-projects (see Annex 2). This appears to be in line
with norms from other CDD projects. For example, an IFAD study comparing administrative
costs of CDD projects found costs ranging from 10 to 24 percent, with average administrative
costs of 16 percent.
Component 4: Enhanced Cereals Production. Cost efficiency of the provision of agricultural
inputs is difficult to ascertain due to the lack of randomized selection of a treatment and control
group which would permit the isolation of the effects of the intervention. Nevertheless, project
administrative data puts the average yield of producers of rice and corn receiving the inputs at
2.90 and 2.03 tons per hectare respectively. This compares favorably to the average annual
yields over the past ten years which have ranged from 1.57 to 2.83 for rice and 1.15 to 1.29 for
corn.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
The relevance of the project to Togo's situation and strategic priorities was high at the time of
appraisal and remained high throughout implementation. The project was highly appreciated by
Government as the Bank operation that had the strongest impact on poor populations throughout
the country. The PDO, as measured by achievement (or more) of a good majority of the key
indicators, has been met. Efficiency can be measured by fewer indicators - and the lack of data
is a shortcoming - but on the basis of what information can be gleaned and through qualitative
6 Andrews et al (2011), p. 25.
20


﻿assessments, efficiency is rated as satisfactory. An overall 'Highly Satisfactory' rating could
have been justified had there been greater clarity on the operation's impact and efficiency.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Generally, the benefits reached the target group of the poor and vulnerable, because the project
was conducted in areas that, according to the QUIBB, were poor. Geographical targeting faced a
lack of data at lower levels (see 2.2 above) but there is no evidence that this led to significant
skewing or leakage towards the non-poor. However, in the absence of impact evaluation, no
clear evidence exists on poverty reduction or distributional impacts other than the a priori reality
that activities benefitting the health, educational and nutritional status of poor and vulnerable
populations and increasing their incomes will have a poverty reducing impact. An impact
evaluation would have allowed useful extension of this generality, for example by quantifying
leakage or inequitable distribution of benefits and by quantifying which activities had the most
poverty-reducing impact and which were the most cost-effective.
The Enhanced Agricultural Production component was carried out in the same poor areas but
specifically targeted farmers who were members of production groups, who had at least one
hectare of agricultural land, and who could pay cash up front for half of the inputs supplied: it is
likely therefore that this component did not benefit the poorest.
The proportion of female beneficiaries reached 44% as opposed to the target of 50%. The
shortfall in regard to female beneficiaries was largely due to girls constituting only 42% of
students in the classrooms built, and 40% of workers on labor-intensive public works. The
percentage of female students in the constructed classrooms was below the national average,
likely because of the focus on rural areas where girls, particularly poor girls, are less likely to be
in school. Given the large proportion of schools among the infrastructure built, the target of 50%
female participation was overambitious in the absence of any complementary measures to boost
girls' enrollment. The lower than targeted female participation in LIPW was likely due to the
types of infrastructure selected, with women tending to participate significantly less than men in
road rehabilitation, despite some measures such as on-site child care aimed at boosting the
numbers of women workers.
CVDs were asked to have at least one woman in a leadership post, and the beneficiary survey
found that this was the case in 97% of CVDs. However, overall CVD membership was not
sufficiently representative: only 68% of CVDs had women make up at least one quarter of their
members against a target of 90%. This calls for a stronger emphasis on quotas to enforce
women's representation in the future.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The project was initially set in the context of the Government's and Bank's priority of
strengthening institutions in support of local economic and social development (see 1.1 above).
The important training component (USD 1.7 million) was designed to strengthen capacity at all
21


﻿levels, and the involvement of all stakeholders in the implementation of this CDD project also
had an important capacity building impact. Although no evaluation data are available regarding
capacity building at community level (other than that 9,400 community members were trained,
with a 75% success rate, success being measured by a test of trainee's knowledge and
competence following the training), the CDVs and associations touched by the project certainly
acquired enhanced capacity for all phases of local development and management and for dealing
with public and NGO partners. The capacity of the AGAIB and the PCU was also significantly
built up, although some of this capacity - as well as motivation - was reduced as a result of the
2012 staff lay-offs (see 2.2 above). The follow-on PDCplus project is benefitting from this
capacity. One question is whether the time is right to transform the PCU into a permanent
organization, and a related question is the future of the AGAIB (see Section 6 below on these
two questions).
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
None.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
At the end of the project, a beneficiary survey was undertaken to measure beneficiary
satisfaction with different aspects of the project, as well as to assess the extent to which
community members had retained knowledge around key themes of community training, and to
measure the numbers of beneficiaries of infrastructure sub-projects.
Beneficiary satisfaction for sub-projects was extremely high. Globally, 98% of beneficiaries
were satisfied with the sub-project, of which 55% were very satisfied and 43% satisfied. 94% of
beneficiaries felt that the project belonged to the community (4% answered that it belonged to
the AGAIB and 2% to the village chief). 97% were satisfied with the financial management of
the sub-project and 95% were satisfied with the quality of the infrastructure (37% very satisfied
and 58% satisfied).
Results from the beneficiary survey regarding community training are discussed in Section 3.2,
and detailed numbers given in Annex 2.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant
The principal risks to sustaining the development impact of the project are:
Without continuation of capacity building support, the CDVs, groups, PTAs etc. may have
problems in sustainable O&M of assets created. Risks stem from the short term nature of NGO
and project support, which prepares communities to maintain the assets before their completion
but does not provide continued support in the operations phase after the start-up of operations.
The typical input to capacity building of community institutions has been two years of contracted
support during conception, implementation and start-up of operations. This may not be adequate
22


﻿for the types of activity considered (O&M of community social infrastructure, income generating
activities, school feeding). There is a risk, too, that CVDs will not be able to raise the revenue
needed to pay for O&M.
Related to the above, there is a risk that the momentum of community-led development planning
and management may falter without follow-up support, structured medium and long term
community-led development planning and further investment in community-selected sub-
projects. The bottom-up development dynamic which has been created may be at risk.
There are specific risks of sustainability attached to Income Generating Activities. The failure
rate is already 25% or more (see 3.2 above) and global experience shows that access to advisory
services into the medium term may be needed to sustain these businesses. There is a risk to
sustainability if follow up training and trouble-shooting are not provided.
Prospects for the sustainability of the School Feeding program are brighter than before the
project due to Government's recent commitment to begin providing funding for school feeding.
Combined with Bank support in the follow-on PDCplus project, support for school feeding is
assured for the coming years. However, if government financing cannot be sustained, the school
feeding program would be at risk. Although PTAs and local structures can play an important
part, continuation of the program in these poor communities will certainly require government
financing, and also continued follow up from the AGAIB.
Specific risks also attach to the assets created by the LIPW activity. Arrangements for
management and maintenance are essential to sustainability. Even with a convention (see 2.3
above), the Ministry of Environment and Forest Resources may have difficulty in financing and
executing management on so many small, scattered plots.
Finally, there is a risk to the overall institutional and operational arrangements for CDD in Togo
as long as the apex organization remains an ad hoc PCU. The future of the AGAIB also remains
a question (see Section 6 below).
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank team correctly identified this project operation as the best way to help Togo rapidly
within the agreed strategies of the I-PRSP and ISP. Design was well founded on local and global
experience and on existing implementation capacity. Measures were built in to the project to
ensure that implementation capacity would be strengthened, and that safeguards and fiduciary
requirements were respected. The operation was appropriately processed as an emergency
project. The components were well aligned with the PDO and targeted outcomes, and the
flexible design allowed further modules to be added over the two years after appraisal. The risk
assessment was well conducted.
23


﻿The Bank faced a difficult dilemma in responding to the urgent needs related to the global
economic and financial crisis. On one hand the Government expressed demands for support in
regard to multiple discrete activities, all of which were important priorities. On the other hand,
incorporating all of these activities in one project created the risk of an overly complex project
that could have been difficult to implement and supervise. The Bank judged that the urgent
needs outweighed the risks, and sought to make the community-driven approach the common
thread linking together the different activities supported by the project (except the Enhanced
Cereals Production component). The correctness of this choice was borne out by the project's
ultimately satisfactory performance.
There is an argument to be made that the Enhanced Cereals Production component could have
been designed in a way that could have promoted a more sustainable impact or been more
poverty-targeted. However, the nature of the activity - emergency response to the food crisis -
precluded a more cautious approach.
More attention could have been paid in the design phase to monitoring and evaluation, especially
given the pilot nature of some of the activities. The initial Results Framework lacked indicators
that would have tracked the key outcome of improved access to services, though at the time of
project preparation the institutional emphasis within the Bank on outcome indicators was not as
strong as it was by the end of the project, or indeed even by the time of the second Additional
Financing.
Overall, the Bank team played a key role in ensuring that the operation was designed to achieve
the agreed strategic objective and that these objectives were reflected in the PDO. Fiduciary and
safeguard requirements were well integrated. Taking account of the relatively minor
shortcomings on risk assessment and M&E, Bank performance on assuring quality at entry is
rated as satisfactory.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank fielded frequent supervision missions well-staffed with all appropriate competences.
Aide memoires and ISRs were full and well prepared, and management provided clear guidance
throughout. A thoroughgoing mid-term review was carried out.
The complexity risk was mitigated by frequent supervision, the presence of a consultant on the
ground, and regular communication by phone and email with the Technical Secretariat. The
frequent contact and close support was a constant throughout supervision despite turnover of
TTLs. Supervision of safeguards and fiduciary aspects was thorough and ensured that extra
training was provided and that the minor problems which arise were quickly corrected. Bank
missions provided continual hands-on support to Togolese agencies and were appreciated by
those agencies as training and technical assistance.
24


﻿Bank team leaders kept a constant eye open for opportunities to strengthen impacts through
addition of further activities. On the basis of project success, the Bank team recommended to
management a major expansion of the Community Subproject and School Feeding activities.
This proactive approach in fact resulted in the appraisal of a follow-on project ('PCDPlus').
One shortcoming was the slow response to getting M&E underway. The Bank team might have
acted more resolutely to get the system operational earlier in the project life. Another
shortcoming was the limited linkages with other Development Partners. Particular emphasis was
placed in the original 2008 Project Paper on donor partnership, particularly with UNDP, the EU
and French Cooperation, and it was envisaged that the project would be implemented in close
collaboration with these partners, within the overall donor framework of re-engagement with
Togo. In the event, there was little evidence of the proposed collaboration, and opportunities
may have been missed to associate other Development Partners in financing (for example in the
recent negotiation of the EDF financing program). A further issue that arose towards the end of
the project period was several changes in TTL responsibility, which may have impaired the
continuity and knowledge base of the Bank's inputs.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank played the key role in designing this project and ensuring quality at entry, and
provided proactive and hands-on supervision of high quality and frequency and with continual
focus on development impact. With ratings of Satisfactory on both Quality at Entry and
Supervision, the overall rating is Satisfactory. Only relatively modest shortcomings kept the
rating below the top level of Highly Satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The two Government ministries which, successively, oversaw the project provided adequate
support. They convened the steering committee responsible for oversight, approval of work
plans and budgets etc. One shortcoming was the lack of engagement with other potential sources
of finance.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The PCU's role was primarily to assure the fiduciary functions and to support execution through
the AGAIBs. Its notable contributions included: (i) preparation of the PIM, ESMF and RMF; (ii)
implementation of the training component; (iii) support to implementation of the Community
Sub-Projects; (iv) development and implementation of the procurement plan; (v) developing and
implementing sound financial management and accounting procedures; and (vi) direct
implementation of the School Feeding activity. The AGAIB's role was primarily to support
implementation by community organizations.
25


﻿Management of the PCU and the five AGAIB was generally sound and professional. Staffing
was adequate, although some posts were slow to be filled. The 2012 decision to retrench staff
(see 2.2 above) reduced the AGAIB's supervision and capacity building performance and slowed
up PCU procurement. Overall, although the project became relatively complex in terms of
numbers of activities and of agencies involved, implementation was relatively trouble free and
most output targets were met or exceeded. Much of this is attributable to the energy and quality
of the PCU and of the AGAIB. Again, the slow start-up of M&E was a shortcoming, although
the PCU partially compensated through an intensive effort towards the end of the project to
ensure collection of all needed results data.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
This project represented a challenge for Togolese implementation structures, given relative lack
of experience with CDD approaches and the increased technical, safeguards and fiduciary risks
inherent in the degree of decentralization of decision-making and implementation to community
level. The addition of further activities, some of a pilot nature and all demanding in terms of
their implementation and supervision, increased the challenge. The Togolese institutions
nonetheless managed to implement the project satisfactorily and achieve almost all the targeted
outputs. An overall rating of Satisfactory is justified.
6. Lessons Learned
The project was highly effective in providing a quick response to Togo's difficult situation after
fifteen years of socio-economic decline. The experience showed that rapid impact on poverty in
such a situation can be achieved by a CDD approach backed up by an institutional structure that
empowers local communities by decentralizing decision taking and strengthens their capacity
through sustained support and capacity building. The principal lesson is that effective poverty
reduction through community-level initiatives requires well-structured support and
implementation mechanisms together with intensive supervision and capacity building. In the
particular case of Togo, the resulting recommendation is that the Government and Bank now
need to focus on how to institutionalize, strengthen and finance the functions currently carried
out by the central (Technical Secretariat) and regional (AGAIB) organizations to provide the
continued investment finance, institutional and technical support and capacity building necessary
to sustain the CDD momentum in communities already supported and to extend the CDD
approach to all poor communities nationwide.
7 The Bank team has already been examining these issues proactively. At the national level, the PDC Technical
Secretariat seek over time to transfer its capacity to its parent ministry, for example by twinning arrangements where
Ministry staff will learn on the job from TS staff. In regard to the regional level, a recent report for the Bank
(Theunynck 2013) examined three options for the future of the AGAIB: (1) sustainability by diversifying financing
sources; (2) converting the AGAIB into private entities and giving them a more 'business' orientation; and (3)
conversion to a decentralized development agency. These options were explored for other countries, including
Benin, Senegal and Madagascar. See: La Delegation de Maitrise d'Ouvrage en Afrique en 2007. Bilan, enjeux et
perspectives. Christian Diou, Michel Henry, Babaly Deme, PPIAF, Republique du Senegal. Avril 2007.

﻿A more specific recommendation derives from the relatively high level of risk to the
development outcomes (see Section 4 above). This is to ensure sustained follow up, capacity
building and (ideally) further investment for the communities and activities successfully
supported under the present project in order to ensure the sustainability of project impacts and to
maintain the undoubted CDD momentum created.
Although the rationale for the addition of the enhanced cereals production activity was
persuasive, the development impact was limited. The lesson is that the benefits of such a
component can be enhanced if it is integrated within an ongoing support program to agriculture,
and the recommendation is that as much effort as practicable should be afforded to ensure
integration within programs for sustainable development of farmer services and production.
The Bank faced a balancing act between keeping the project design simple, particularly in the
low administrative capacity environment, and responding to the many pressing needs. As the
project progressed, the project became increasingly complex as additional activities were added
to respond to urgent needs. Additional financing was preferred to preparation of new projects for
speed, in order to piggyback on the ongoing project's satisfactory performance, and in order not
to create a proliferation of projects in the Togo portfolio. Fortunately, the added complexity in
this case did not affect the project's eventual satisfactory performance, but it did create added
risks. The lesson is that selectivity is difficult for the Bank in situations such as this where the
Government may not have many alternative avenues to address urgent needs other than the Bank.
The recommendation is to ensure in cases where selectivity is difficult that the project teams
have the supervision resources necessary to manage such complex projects in low capacity
fragile environments where extra implementation support can be neecsary.

﻿Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
Given the emergency nature of the operation and its CDD approach, no evaluation of EIRR was
conducted at appraisal or ex post. A summary estimation of rates of return for Income Generating
Activities (Ouedraogo 2013: 28) suggests that for the more profitable enterprises, FRRs can reach 30%,
but the data and sampling on which the estimate is based are fragmentary.
Three indicators of efficiency were tracked. First, implementing agency operating costs were reasonable
in relation to investment costs, with AGAIB project management expenses on target at about 15% of
disbursements for sub-projects (see Annex 2). This appears to be in line with norms from other CDD
projects. For example, an IFAD study comparing administrative costs of CDD projects found costs
ranging from 10 to 24 percent, with average administrative costs of 16 percent.
The second indicator concerns unit rate costs, where a 2013 evaluation by the Ministry of Education
found that Project investment costs for classroom construction were below those for comparable
infrastructure executed by ministries and other public agencies (USD 1 16/m2 compared to costs of USD
13 1-230/m2 under other programs).
For the LIPW activity, a third indicator measured efficiency as the proportion of labor costs to total costs,
where the result exactly met the target of 70 per cent (Annex 2).

﻿Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
At the end of the project, a beneficiary survey was undertaken to measure beneficiary
satisfaction with different aspects of the project, as well as to assess the extent to which
community members had retained knowledge around key themes of community training, and to
measure the numbers of beneficiaries of infrastructure sub-projects.
Beneficiary satisfaction for sub-projects was extremely high. Globally, 98% of beneficiaries
were satisfied with the sub-project, of which 55% were very satisfied and 43% satisfied. 94% of
beneficiaries felt that the project belonged to the community (4% answered that it belonged to
the AGAIB and 2% to the village chief). 97% were satisfied with the financial management of
the sub-project and 95% were satisfied with the quality of the infrastructure (37% very satisfied
and 58% satisfied).
The beneficiary survey also measured the participation of women in the community associations
(CVDs) supported under the project. Unfortunately, while the project performed well in
ensuring that women were represented in leadership posts in CVDs, it did not meet its goals for
overall women's' participation. CVDs were asked to have at least one woman in a leadership
post, and the beneficiary survey found that this was the case in 97% of CVDs. However, overall
CVD membership was not sufficiently representative: only 68% of CVDs had women make up
at least one quarter of their members against a target of 90%. This calls for a stronger emphasis
on quotas to enforce women's representation in the future.
Overall, as a member of the community association, were you satisfied with your role in
the implementation of the sub-project?

﻿Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
The Borrower's ICR (September 2013) does an excellent job of describing and evaluating project design,
implementation and results. The narrative is consistent with the Bank's ICR.
The report highlights several issues:
*  The problems encountered in 'picking winners' for the Income Generating Activities and in
providing the necessary flexible and sustained support. A particular issue raised is the need for
longer term, paid engagement by the NGOs supporting these start-ups.
*  The implementation of the School Feeding program. This required constant follow-up, which
proved onerous.
*  For the LIPW activity, the report highlights the payment difficulties and their consequences, and
also the difficulty of maintaining the high labor content for certain subprojects which required
mechanized civil works or high raw materials inputs.
*  The training component was hindered by shortcomings in the quality of some NGO services, and
also by the short term nature of the input. Continued hand-holding of the community
organizations over a longer period would have been preferable.
*  The Enhanced Cereals Production component was negatively affected by the low recovery rates
and by the poor handling of the seed supply activity.
*  The effectiveness of the PCU and the AGAIB was impaired by the staff reductions in 2012.
Lessons learned were:
+ The project was an effective instrument for reducing poverty.
+ The CDD approach empowered communities as agents for their own development.
+ The project was efficient in delivering infrastructure at low capital cost.
+ In order to judge project impacts, a working baseline and M&E system are essential.
+ Successful implementation was enhanced by the efficient inter-sectoral cooperation amongst
agencies.
+ The Bank provided not only needed guidance but also hands-on capacity building, and this
contributed to the successful project outcome.
Recommendations were:
> Standardize design for Subproject infrastructure as far as possible.
> Revise the models used for latrines, as the model used during the project was not readily accepted
by communities.

﻿Adopt a flexible approach to the NGO contracts for Income Generating Activities in order to
allow, where needed, for more sustained and longer term support.
> Integrate literacy programs into the CDD approach in order to raise the level of understanding of
communities.
> Revise the approach for School Feeding to make it more efficient and to involve the health and
education services.
> Develop a long term resource mobilization strategy for the continuation of project activities.
