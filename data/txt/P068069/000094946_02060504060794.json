the implementation of the\n            country's current reform program, through the following\n            components: 1) the public sector reform component will\n            support improved budget planning, streamline budget\n            execution, and control as well, a transparent budget\n            process. Also supported by this component is natural\n            resources management; 2) the state-owned enterprise (SOE)\n            component focuses on strengthening oversight of financial,\n            and operational performance of SOEs, enterprise\n            restructuring, and rationalizing the regulatory framework.\n            Relevant issues in the power sector are also addressed in\n            this component; and, 3) the financial sector component seeks\n            to stabilize the financial conditions of the banks, to\n            strengthen them, and to launch micro-rural finance for\n            poverty reduction. Nonetheless, potential risks may occur\n            due to insufficient political will to complete reforms, to\n            lack of capacity and weak administrative incentives to\n            improve performance, and, to the possible political backlash\n            from electricity tariff, and other SOE price\n            liberalizations. However, benefits outweigh potential risks,\n            and, efforts to minimize risks include strong commitments to\n            reform, technical assistance to be provided under the\n            Financial Management Capacity Building Project, and, close\n            collaboration with the International Monetary Fund and major\n            bilateral donors."}, "docdt": "2002-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
