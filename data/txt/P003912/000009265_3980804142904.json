        performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            technological basis for a conservation focused watershed\n            based strategy for the development of upland areas has been\n            shown to be partially successful. A watershed management\n            strategy which includes run-off control and soil\n            conservation and farm planning and diversification can\n            provide the elements for agricultural development in the\n            upland areas. However, long run sustainability in\n            agriculture for those areas can be achieved if changes in\n            the cropping pattern also take place at the same time.\n            Marginal changes which include improved crop management and\n            the introduction of some perennial fruit and multi-purpose\n            tree species have brought about increases in income.\n            However, there is an acute need for the development of a\n            crop technology to support the physical technology developed\n            under the project."}, "docdt": "1998-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
