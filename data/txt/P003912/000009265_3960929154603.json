The project\n            will address the major needs of upland areas: effective and\n            affordable soil and moisture conservation measures,\n            increased farm productivity, and institutional support for\n            planning and implementing site-specific change.  The project\n            will implement components on:  upland agricultural\n            productivity and watershed stabilization; credit and grants\n            for productive investment by upland hamlets and villages;\n            road and bridge improvements; and institutional\n            strengthening of relevant line agencies.  It will focus on\n            better moisture retention and runoff control and more\n            productive farming practices in microwatershed areas.  A\n            project-supported research station that concentrates on\n            upland agriculture will be established.  Concurrently,\n            throughout Yogyakarta's upland villages, a menu of\n            on-farm technology options will be demonstrated, more credit\n            facilities will be provided, essential social services\n            expanded, and in remote areas, village roads and bridges\n            upgraded.  Using existing line agencies and staff, the\n            project will provide extensive skills-based and managerial\n            training support to all implementing agencies."}, "docdt": "1991-02-22T00:00:00Z"}
