MEMORANVUtM AND RECOMM@ENDATION OF TtlE PRESIDENT
OF 'TIHE INTERtNATIOtNAL BANK FOR RECONSTIRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO TU1E EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
O01 A PROPOSED 1.OAN TO INDONESIA
FOR 'rilE YOGYAY.APTA UPLAND AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The foJlowwiig iniemior'mdtui and recommitenidation oni a proposed loan to
tle Rlep'tIlic 1  ol Indonesia lor $1.5.5 million eqluivaletLt is subnmit.ted for
aIptZoval.  'l'lih lprolposed loani would be for 20 years, including five years of
guL'ake, at the Banik's statlnid varlable ititerest rate, and would lielp finance a
fLo.uw-upt tupland area development project in the YogyakaLta province of Java.
Z.         Upland Agtriculture antd Poverty AlleviaLiol.  T'he issues of
ag.I.CuILotual productLvi.ty and ilncomlie, iLteitwitied witit resource matiagetmetiL anld
cofsCi,vat ioll, are cLitical in Iiidonesia, notably in tihe rainfed uplands of
Java.  Wil.1 G0 lpercenit of Indonesia's populatioin concentrated on Java, most of
tlie land is In productive use, including 75 percent in agriculture, with not
muchi scope for expansion.  At tihe same titne, Java conifronts iticreasing
p)pulaLion pressure and an agticultural resource base being depleted by
urbanization and in(lustrialization in the lowlancds and by deforestation,
expLotl.ative production systelts, antd erosioni in the uplands.  Thie upper
watersheds, withl fragile sedimenitary soils, are the area considered most at
rlsk due to erosion.  A Batik study estimates the cost of erosioni to Java at
$350-420 milliotn per annum.  Whiile siltation of rivers and downstream dams and
canials causes economic disruption, the larger impact (80 percent) is
atLributed to on-farm ptroductivity loss in tihe uplands due to soil depletion.
3.        Compirisitig two thirds of Java and accommuilodating 30 millioi people,
Llhe uplands are distiniguislhed from thie lowlands by lower agricultural
p)roductivity and farm income, less off-farm employment, and lower density of
roads, maLketing facilities and government services.  While data on the extent
of the muost critical watersheds (eroding or In danger of eroding) and of thie
occurrence of poverty are limited, it is p)robable that about 12 million people
livinlg itn the critical parts of tire uplands are among the poorest farmers in
Java and that about 40 percent of them are below the poverty level. They are
seriously limited in their ability to naintain or improve productivity and
income.  Yet, reversal of thie trend toward ecological degradation and
unsustaitnable farming practices Is paramount to ensure a viable upland
economy, and stable, equitable development in Java overall.
4.        Goveritment Focus.  Mainitaillinig its emphasis otl p)oveLty alleviationt,
employment generationt and equitable development, the Government of Indonesia
(GOI) has increasingly recognized that souIId agricultural and conservation
practices are required to improve productivity, generate and sustain farm
itncoutes, and lhusbaLd resources over the long term.  Doing so means undertaking
more comupiehetisive measures thian its ongoing Regreening Program comprising
bench teLeacing, tree planting and checkdams.  Under Repelita V (1989-94), GOI
has begun to look more intensively at land-use patterns and watershed
mlaniagemiietit, innovative cropping patteLns, vegetative soil conservation
tecthniques, anld locally orieLnted research on agricultural practices.
Addressing these possibilities over widely diverse agroecological conditions
has necessitated more decentralized decision-making, more participatory
involvement of producer communities, and concerted efforts at institution
building atnd intersectoral cooperation through training of relevant govertunent
wotkers.



- 2 -
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Over more than a dpcade, the Bank
has supported government's evcdving priorities regarding upland development
throughl four projects, including the previous project, Yogyakarta Rural
Development (Cr. 946-IND, $12 million, completed ix 1989). Numerous lessons
have been learned from this experience, as well as from bilateral and
government-sponsored progLams for upland development. The major lesson is
that both technology and the approaches to develop replicable and cost
effective measures require refinement to halt resource degradation and
increase upland agricultural productivity and incomes. This proposed project
embodies refinements in both, building on promising elements gleaned from
experience: managing and treating soil stabilization on a microwatershed/
commtnity basis; shifting from physical structures such as bench terraces and
checkdams to cost-effective grass and shrub barriers to stem soil erosion;
providing alternative soil conservation techniques for farmers rather than
emphasizing a single solution; demonstrating site-specific technology options
from which farmers can choose the most appropriate and affordable farming
system; and engaging farmers in the development and adoption of soil
conservation measures. Once equipped with sound technical options, upland
communities also require improved social (credit, extension) and physic,il
(roads, bridges) infrastructure that enable access to Inputs, markets and
other government services in order to secure income and upgrade living
standards. Experience also points to the need for significant amounts of
technical and managerial training of government pl nners, implemente-s,
extension workers and researchers and within line agencies, and the particular
challenge of forging links and working relationships across separate,
sometimes overlapping, structures of government.
6.        The Yogyakarta Province provides a basis and environment in which
refined technologies and administrative processes can be developed most
rapidly for possible wider replication. Over the medium term, the Bank can
help GOI to develop the processes, institutions and technologies to support a
program to foster sustainable development throughout Indonesia's most critical
upland watersheds with the objectives of protecting their environments from
erosion and of reducing the number of people living below poverty levels.
Experience with the first Yogyakarta project indicates that levels of poverty
could be halved in five to ten years, with actions such as those proposed in
this project together with income growth through spontaneous development. The
estimated per capita investment levels and returns compare well with
irrigation scheme rehabilitation, and are significantly more viable than
investments in new irrigation for rice cultivation. If the levels of costs
and benefits were to be extrapolated for the areas and populations in Java
with similar critical conditions, they would show that a sustainable
development program reducing the costs of soil erosion and lowering the
poverty incidence from about 40 to 20 percent of 12 million inhabitants of
Java's critical uplands is an attainable objective. The proposed project
would continue to help the GOI to support and test the soundness of its
strategies and to firm up the timetable to achieve its targets.
7.        Project Objectives.  The project's overall goal is to develop a
sustainable and replicable approach to soil stabilization and agricultural
development as a basis for improving incomes and living standards in
Yogyakarta's upland villages, specifically, and in Java's similarly endangered
upland areas, generally. The project will address the major needs of upland
areas: effective and affordable soil and moisture conservation measures,
increased farm productivity leading to higher farm incomes, essential social
services and infrastructure, and institutional support for planning and



-3-
implementing site-specific change. It aims at tackling the major threat to
upland productivity over the long term--a fragile and eroding resource base--
through an innovative and low-cost, community directed approach to soil
stabilization by groups of neighboring farmers within microwatersheds. Over
the medium term it would also provide essential experience to support
nationwide watershed programs that would also help to reduce poverty of the
population living in these areas.
8.        Project Description.  Over five years, the project would implement
components on: upland agricultural productivity and watershed stabilization;
credit and grants for productive investment by upland hamlets and villages;
toad and bridge improvements; and institutional strengthening of relevant line
agencies. It would focus on better moisture retention and runoff control and
more productive farming practices in microwatershed areas, with emphasis on
vegetative barriers, perennial crops for ground cover, and higher-yielding,
higher-value food, tree, and estate crops. A project-supported research
station that concentrates on upland agriculture would be established.
Concurrently, throughout Yogyakarta's upland villages, a menu of on-farm
technology options would be demonstrated, more credit facilities would be
provided, essential social services expanded, and in remote areas, village
roads and bridges upgraded. The improved village road network is expected to
respond to increasing demand by facilitating access to services, inputs,
markets and off-farm employment in upland areas. Using existing line agencies
and staff, the project would provide extensive skills-based and managerial
training support to all implementing agencies in order to bolster delivery of
upland services, strengthen planning, execution, monitoring and continuity of
project activities, and improve coordination across ministries at all levels,
with special emphasis on the local arena--village, district and province.
9.        The proposed loan of $15.5 million would finance 62 percent of
project costs, (70 percent excluding reserved procurement of $0.99 million and
duties and taxes of $1.94 million). The GOI would provide the equivalent of
$9.57 million. Retroactive financing of $1 million is included for eligible
expenditure after February 1, 1990. The Bank loan would finance civil works,
equipment, technical assistance, staff training, research, and funds for
subdistrict, village and hamlet projects and for onlending to farmers. A
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are presented in Schedule A,
and the amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement in Schedu'e B.  A
timetable for key processing events is in Schedule C, and the status of Bank
Group operations in Indonesia is given in Schedule D. A map is attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 9113-IND dated February 22, 1991, will be
distributed separately.
10.       Actions Agreed.  The Government has agreed on the following:
(a) research facilities in Yogyakarta would be upgraded to a full research
station; (b) hamlet revolving funds would charge no less than commercial
interest rates; (c) village projects would be selected in accordance with
agreed criteria, and would be subject to the physical and financial
supervision by district agencies; (d) roads and bridges would be selected and
built to agreed standards; physical progress of road construction and costs
would be monitored; road maintenance master plans based on monitoring of
conditions of roads and bridges would be established; and road realignment
would be preceded by environmental assessment. Satisfactory maintenance of
the roads built under the previous project, as well as those to be built under
the proposed project, would be a condition for continuation of disbursements
for road construction.



11.       Benefits.  Most project benefits involve stabilizing the soil in
Yogyakarta upland areas by methods that ensure the productivity base and
increase yields and incomes for farmers under rainfed conditions. Focus and
research concentration or. microwatersheds as the organizing unit for
stabilization and production should yield benefits beyond the 2,500 ha where
project activities would be most intense. On-farm technology displays that
demonstrate improved agronomy, planting materials, and the benefits of
shifting to perennial crops in order to retain soil and moisture should have a
wide-ranging effect on production and incomes in all upland villages. A full
research station with an upland focus would validate technical and socio-
economic recommendations for application in upland areas throughout Java.
Supported by improved extension services, credit facilities, and social and
physical infrastructure, living standards in upland villages should likewise
benefit. The project's benefits by component are likely to affect:
microwatershed stabilization, 4,200 households; on-farm technology displays,
12,000 households: roads and bridges to 49 villages, 49,000 households;
village projects, 40,000 households; overall, some 60,000 households with
300,000 upland residents wlil benefit (often by more than one component).
12.       Incomes for farmers under microwatershed improvements would increase
64 percent, corresponding to an increase of the incomes net present value
(di-:counted at 10 percent over 10 years) of 41 percent. On farms outside the
microwatershed development areas, but exposed to the project's on-farm
technology displays, income would rise 28 percent and net present value
22 percent. The project's economic benefits are based mainly on incremental
production of cassava, maize, upland rice, groundnuts, bananas and avocados.
The economic rate of return for the project's upland ptoductivity and
stabilization components is 12 percent over 30 years and for the village roads
commnent 15 percent.
13.       Risks.  The project's risks are technical and institutional.  Low-
cost soil conservation and runoff measures and farming systems that put a
larger portion of cultivated area under shrubs or tree crops to ensure
adequate ground cover may be slowly adopted by farmers within microwatersheds.
Line agencies might also be slow in responding to the project's coordination
mechanisms. Research, training, technical assistance and detailed
institutional planning are directed at these concerns, which would be annually
reviewed jointly by GOI and the Bank. The risks are, therefore, considered
reasonable.
14.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
