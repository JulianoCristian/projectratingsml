Lessons\n            suggest what follows. Substantial increases in yields and\n            livestock productivity can be achieved with an effective\n            extension management system, if linked with adaptive\n            agricultural research, and modified to the conditions in a\n            particular country. However, whatever system is used to\n            support producers, adequate mobility for the extension and\n            research staff is a precondition for obtaining results that\n            are broadly based on the rural population. Adding a\n            provision of funds for productive equipment, and\n            infrastructure can improve the motivation to produce more,\n            achieve more marketable produce, and strengthen the spirit\n            of collaboration and willingness of establishing\n            associations. By adding a subcomponent for such investments\n            at midterm, was an important project improvement, yet, not\n            totally enough. Successful rural development is a complex\n            task that requires support to \"upstream and downstream\n            activities\" linked to agricultural production. To\n            overcome this constraint, the supervision missions were\n            jointly organized with all donors concerned, for proper\n            coordination of project implementation. Other lessons\n            address limited resources and a gradual approach to\n            development; capacity building for nongovernmental\n            organizations (NGOs) and private sector operators;\n            understanding the preparatory needs for implementing\n            innovations; and, the appropriate Government coordination of\n            donor assistance in the sector."}, "docdt": "2004-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
