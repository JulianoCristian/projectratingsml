The Agricultural Extension\n            & Research Program Support Project was created to\n            increase the agricultural production of small-scale farmers,\n            to initiate agricultural extension services that would be\n            respective of specific provincial environments, and to\n            finance education in order to produce more agricultural\n            extension specialists. The project was also designed to\n            strengthen the links between research and agricultural\n            extension services. This environmental assessment lists\n            these environmental risks: (i) increased toxins through the\n            improper use of chemical products, namely non-organic\n            pesticides and fertilizers; (ii) water pollution caused by\n            the improper use of such chemical products; (iii)\n            atmospheric pollution caused by fires on land set aside for\n            agricultural use; (iv) nutritional negligence caused by\n            farmers selling all of their produce and not reserving\n            sufficient amounts to address nutritional needs; (v)\n            deforestation caused by expansion of farm lands into forest\n            areas; and (vi) threats to biodiversity through the use of\n            pesticides. It is hope that these risks will be mitigated\n            through education on the use of pesticides and fertilizers,\n            the engendering of respect for the environment, and the need\n            to create food reserve for small-scale farmers."}, "docdt": "1997-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
