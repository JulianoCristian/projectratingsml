AMENDMENT TO RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN (RAP) FOR 
WAYLEAVE VILLAGE ELECTRIFICATION SCHEME (WVES) PROJECT  
 
1. Introduction 
 
The Government of Tanzania acting through Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited 
(TANESCO) is implementing the 
“Songo Songo Gas Development and Power 
Generation Project.” The project involves village land up taking for way leave for both 
the pipe line and village electrification scheme. Village Electrification is one of the 
environmental mitigation measures for the Songo Songo Gas Project.   
 
2. Reasons for Realignment  
 
During Way Leave Village Electrification Scheme (WVES) implementation, TANROAD 
in year 2008 realigned its road segment so as to avoid huge compensation, which caused 
an overlap of new road and proposed new high tension line way leave. Due to this 
problem, TANESCO was required to reroute the proposed transmission line and acquire 
new way leave, which in one way or another caused social impacts to new project 
affected people including land take, crops and few buildings that will have to be cleared. 
World Bank and TANESCO agreed to send a Sociologist from TANESCO to undertake 
field work with the main objective of undertaking RAP amendment. The whole rerouting 
stretch will span six villages covering a distance of 40 km. However, out of 40km span 
only 14km will be re-routed. The villages to be impacted include Somanga, Marendego, 
Kiwanga, Chumbi, Muhoro and Nyamwage.  
 
3. Compensation Framework 
 
Compensation Framework is well covered in the previous RAP. This RAP amendment 
follows the previous framework whereby consultations and meetings with PAPs are 
insisted. During the meetings held in all six villages, it involved district and village local 
government leaders, villagers and a TANESCO sociologist. At the time of compiling this 
report, field work on valuation of their properties was completed and the valuer was 
undertaking computation and report preparation. Upon completion of this exercise, the 
report shall be submitted to the Chief Government Valuer for approval and subsequently 
effecting payments.  
 
4. General Description of the Affected Asserts/Properties 
 
There is a small variation of type, quality and size of properties affected by the project on 
rerouted corridors for the WVES project. More over, some of the previous affected 
people who were already compensated will not be affected anymore (spared), meaning 
that due to reroute their properties will no longer be impacted and they can keep the 
compensation amount received on the previous way leave corridor. In addition, for those 
who got compensation but some of their properties are still affected by this new routing  
will also be compensated again for newly affected properties.

The impacts can be grouped into four groups as follows: 
·
Crops: 
Crops vary from seasonal crops like cassava, maize etc. to permanent 
crops like coconut, timber trees, cashew nut trees, etc. These crops were counted 
for compensation and they are outlined in the valuation report.
 
·
Buildings:
 Most of the building are of simple materials like simple huts of grass 
thatched and mud/wattle construction; few covered by iron sheets. In total there 
are  16 buildings.  
·
Farmland: 
Little amount of land from individuals and village land will be taken 
for WVES along rerouted stretches. The total land to be taken is 174,671 square 
meters.  
·
Human beings: 
About One hundred (100) individual people will be impacted. 
Some of these people will lose only land, some land and houses, some houses, 
some crops only and some land, crops and houses. 
 
5. Valuation:  
 
The valuation for the newly affected people started in April and was finalized in May 
2010.  The valuation took place in the presence of and consultation with the affected 
people who have signed an agreement with regards to compensation amount. Based on 
the valuation procedures in Tanzania, it then was sent to the National valuer for his 
review then back to district valuers for their final approval for the payment. 
 
6. Budget for the RAP 
 
The budget for the rerouted area for compensation and resettlement is 
117,245,065/= 
(
One Hundred Seventeen Million Two Hundred Forty Five Thousand and Sixty Five 
Tanzanian
 Shillings Only). The said amount is available at Rural Energy Agency (REA) 
for TANESCO to collect it and undertake payments as soon as possible after receiving 
the approved valuation report and endorsed compensation schedules from the valuer.  
 
Currently, the valuation report is with the Chief Government Valuer for approval. It is 
hoped that by the end of August the payments will be made.

Stake
holder’s Participation 
 
The objective of this study and previous ones was to make sure that all stake holders are 
well involved, and they are aware of the reasons of rerouting the line.  Also, addressing 
all possible social impacts and to establish the existence of grievance resolution 
mechanisms i.e. resolution committee in the project area. The public meetings with the 
respective villages had already been conducted by the District Local Governments i.e. 
Districts 
Commissioner’s Offices together with the respective Wards and Village 
Governments. In those meetings people were informed the reasons of rerouting, the 
potential impacts, their rights in terms of compensation of their properties, the presence 
of the grievance committee and its roles. In additions people were told how to undergo 
lodging the complaints to grievance committee and how the committee will deal with 
grievances. More detailed information is obtained in the existing RAP.
 
8. Conclusion  
 
This report provides the Amendment of Resettlement Action Plan for the WVES Project 
affected population by the rerouting of the 33kV power line. The RAP adopts the cash 
compensation as the only mode of compensation as outlined in the existing RAP. All 
compensation payments will be made according to compensation schedules and control 
lists which will be provided by the Government Valuer after endorsement by all relevant 
authorities.  
 
This RAP recommends fair and prompt compensation to all project affected people. In 
addition, cash compensation must meet national and international standards applicable in 
such case.
