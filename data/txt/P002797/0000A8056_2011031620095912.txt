                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main development objective of the project is to develop Tanzania's natural gas reserves to produce least-cost power generation for domestic and industrial
                         use in an environmentally sustainable and efficient manner. The project will promote private sector ownership and management of generation in the gas and
                         power sectors. In addition, it will encourage increased access of the poor by developing financially sustainable rural energy schemes to presently unserved
                         areas along the pipeline corridor.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR assesses the situation of the Project as per December 16th, 2010, when a Level II Restructuring Paper was approved. This ISR is based on a "desk supervision" of the
                         Project, since no official mission was carried out since the last ISR. However since the Task Team, including the Task Team Leader, is based in Dar es Salaam, this ISR benefited

                         The update of the Outcome Indicators shows that by December 16, 2010 close to all indicator target values have been achieved or even exceeded. The Task Team is confident that
                         the outstanding activities will be completed by Project closing and close to all target values will have been reached except for some indicators relating to the Wayleaves which may
                         not be entirely achieved due to the important implementation delays of this sub-component. It has also to be noted that this ISR has taken into account certain Indicator "drops" as
                         approved by the RP.
