7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The main development objective of the project is to develop Tanzania's natural gas reserves to produce
least-cost power generation for domestic and industrial use in an environmentally sustainable and efficient
manner. The project will promote private sector ownership and management of generation in the gas and
power sectors. In addition, it will encourage increased access of the poor by developing financially
sustainable rural energy schemes to presently unserved areas along the pipeline corridor.

                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER



SUMMARY
1.      The proposed changes relate to the reallocation of an accumulated amount of SDR
1,258,192.97 across various expenditure categories and subsequently the cancellation of
an amount of SDR 17,174,966.68 under the total outstanding credit amount. The
cancellation amount primarily relates to proceeds under the credit currently allocated to
an entire component of the Project, which, to date, has not started implementation.

2.      The main reason for this request submitted by the Government of the United
Republic of Tanzania (GoT) is the fact that the underlying Project closes on December
31, 2010 and the expectation that a substantial amount of the credit will remain
undisbursed by the closing date. The GoT further proposes to use the cancelled amount
to re-commit it to another ongoing IDA energy project in Tanzania, the Tanzania Energy
Development and Access Project (P101645), Component A, which is likely to face cost
overruns in the near term.

3.      The proposed cancellation of an entire project component, which has not yet
started implementation, will not affect the Project Development Objectives (PDO). This
component was introduced to the Project in 2004 through the first Board-approved
restructuring of this Project. When the component was added, the PDO had not been
revised and no new PDO indicator had been created based on the rationale that this new
component already contributed to the then unchanged PDO. Further explanations are
given in Section C below.

4.     Based on the information currently available to the Task Team, we confirm that
the Legal Covenants of this credit are currently met.


PROJECT STATUS
5.      The subject Credit received approval on October 9, 2001 in the amount of SDR
145.7 million (equivalent to US$ 183 million at the time of approval), of which 85.4%
have been disbursed to date, and became effective on November 27, 2001. Since then,
the Project has been restructured twice and the project closing dates extended accordingly
to ensure timely implementation. These restructurings were primarily approved to utilize
savings of US$78 million that were achieved through competitive procurement under the
main component of the project (Part A) ­ the development of the gas infrastructure for
power generation, which is owned and operated by Songas Ltd., a private sector entity.
The first restructuring in May 2004 added a new component (Part D- Component
herewith proposed to be cancelled) to scale up the gas-fueled power generation capacity,
and extended the project's closing date from March 31, 2006 to October 31, 2007. The
closing date was again extended on October 24, 2007 to February 29, 2008, to allow for
preparation of the second restructuring of the credit.
6.      The second restructuring was approved by the Regional Vice President on
December 26, 2007. Through this second restructuring an additional Part E was added to
the Project, which now has been fully implemented, and the closing date was extended to
December 31, 2009. A last extension of the Closing date was approved in December
2009, extending the Project by one year to December 31, 2010.

7.      The project's Implementation Status and Results report (ISR) currently rates both
the Development Objective (DO) and Implementation Progress (IP) ratings as
Satisfactory. The following table summarizes the status of all components and the
outstanding implementation measures:

   (10% of Total Credit Amount)

Reduction
   (19% of Total Credit Amount)
Note: The remaining 4% of the Credit Amount refer to Unallocated funds, Training and Project Preparation funds.

8.      The main component of the project (Part A) is complete: a gas processing plant,
gas pipeline and power plant have been constructed and gas-fired thermal power is being
produced. A private sector special purpose company (Songas Ltd.) implemented Part A.
Related sector performance and the PDO outcome/impact indicators have exceeded the
objectives set at the original Board approval in 2001.

9.      All but one sub-components of the Project's Part B, comprising the Resettlement
Infrastructure Development Scheme (RIDS) and the repair of Wellhead #6 in the Songo
Songo gas fields are complete. The grid extension scheme (Wayleaves) is expected to be
completed by the closing date. The remaining works of Component B currently under
implementation relate to about 3% of the component's activities comprising the civil
works (mainly line stringing) for the project's supported rural electrification scheme.


                                                         7
10.     One outstanding activity under this component relates to the rectification of
certain technical shortcomings of the community jetty on Songo Songo Island, which
Songas had previously built under Part A as a safeguard mitigation measure. While good
progress has been made, the physical works necessary for this correction are now only
expected to be implemented after the Project's closing date. It has therefore been agreed
with the GOT that this activity will be completed within the IDA's Second Central
Transport Corridor Project (CTCP-2). The Ministry of Energy and Minerals and the
Ministry of Infrastructure Development are currently discussing the modalities for the
transfer of the implementation responsibilities, which are expected to be concluded
shortly.

11.      Part C of the project is nearly completed and only some technical studies for the
Tanzania Electricity Supply Company (TANESCO) remain to be completed. Underlying
contracts of this component terminate by the closing date and studies will be done before
then.

12.    Part D of the Project has not begun implementation (see below Section C.2).

13.   Part E of the Project, relating to a US$ 43 million capacity charge buy-down by
TANESCO to reduce the cost of power from the Songas Plant, has been fully
implemented and disbursed.

14.     One of the main objectives of the project was to support TANESCO's financial
health by providing least cost generation assets to the utility. The benefits of the project
in terms of the developed gas infrastructure and related natural gas based power
generation have materialized over recent years. The utility's financial situation has
started to improve gradually in recent years and since the Project's supported gas
infrastructure has been completed in 2007. TANESCO's 2008 financial statements show
an increase of operating revenue by 27 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. With
the increased revenue, the utility has been able to improve from the net loss of TSh
67,234 million in 2007 to a net loss of TSh 47,658 million in 2009.


PROPOSED CHANGES
15.      The GoT, in their letter dated November 24, 2010, requested the IDA to reallocate
a total credit amount of SDR 1,258,192.97 across various categories and to cancel an
amount of SDR 17,174,966.68 from the total credit amount of SDR 145.7 million
(representing 12% of the total credit amount). While the proposed cancellation involves
dropping an entire Project component (Component D), the drop of this component does
not affect the PDO for the following reason.

16.    When the Component D was added through the 2004 restructuring, there was no
need to neither modify the PDO nor add another PDO indicator, since this Component D
was fully consistent with the existing PDO that was being measured by the existing PDO


                                             8
indicators1. Therefore this component did not affect the original PDO and the original
PDO Outcome Indicators have been fully achieved by now.

C.1      Results/indicators

17.    While the PDO is not affected by the drop of Component D, an Intermediate
Outcome Indicator related to Part D will have to be dropped as shown in the revised
Results Framework in the Annex hereto.

18.    Furthermore the proposed cancellation amount also includes credit proceeds that
were allocated for two activities under Component C. Consequently two additional
Intermediate Indicators will have to be dropped.

19.     The first activity relates to a Technical Assistance to TPDC and MEM for the
preparation of the Gas Act. The MEM informed the IDA previously that this activity is
now funded by the Government's own budget and therefore funding for this activity was
no longer requested. The second activity under Component C relates to financing of
several advisories supporting the MEM for preparation of public/private generation and
regional transmission projects. Due to the limited remaining time of this Project and
taking into account that those advisories will be implemented over a timeframe of 3 years
the MEM requested the IDA to finance those contracts by TEDAP, where they have now
been allocated and are under implementation.

C.2      Components

20.     As mentioned earlier, the proposed cancellation would involve a drop of
Component D, which was introduced to the Project in 2004 through Board level
restructuring. The component was to finance the conversion from heavy fuel oil (HFO)
to gas firing of a 100MW HFO power plant owned by a private company, Independent
Power Tanzania Limited (IPTL). This Component has not started implementation to
date, although detailed engineering design has been completed and successfully tested for
the conversion. The conversion was planned to begin in January 2009 and to be
completed for all units by the end of 2009. This conversion would have allowed for
reduction of energy charges for the IPTL plant.

21.     The main reason for the outstanding conversion is the lack of resolution of two
legal disputes between TANESCO and the shareholders of the IPTL plant. The IPTL
plant is currently under ICSID arbitration and has been under receivership in Tanzania
for more than a year. The legal disputes relate to the IPTL project's contractual

 Note that in the Project Paper of May 2004, it is stated (p.13 para 51) that the introduction of Component
D " is consistent with the original objectives of the project which are to: develop the Borrower's natural
gas reserves to produce least-cost power generation for domestic and industrial use in an environmentally
sustainable and efficient manner ".



                                                     9
framework2 to which the IDA is not a party. While the GoT had hoped for a resolution of
those two disputes in the last two years, it has not materialized to date and in the IDA
project team's opinion a clear resolution is no longer expected in the near term.

22.   Based on the above, and because the component's implementation does not affect
the PDO, the cancellation of Component D is warranted.

C.3     Financing

23.    Project Costs: The proposed SDR amount cancellation is the equivalent of US$
26,802,675, calculated at the SDR/US$ exchange rate applied by the GoT in its financial
analysis. The Table 2 below shows the currently allocated project costs by component
and the proposed revised amounts, after cancellation and by applying the SDR/US$
exchange the GoT has applied:

24.     The small cost increase under Component A, which was completed several years
ago, derives from the completion of an outstanding reconciliation of amounts when the
underlying Designated Account was closed. Component B has realized some substantial
savings, mainly due to efficient procurement processes and favorable SDR/US$ exchange
rate fluctuations. Similar reasons apply to the savings under Component C, and in
addition procurement of some originally planned small goods for the Tanzania Petroleum
Development Corporation (TPDC) was financed by alternative funds. Component D
represents the biggest savings amount, representing about US$ 22 million at the applied
exchange rate. Finally the small savings amount under Component E represents a small
residual SDR amount that materialized after the component was fully disbursed and
hence the small residual amount benefited from a positive SDR/US$ exchange rate
development.

27.     Cancellations: After the proposed reallocation of funds and taking into account
the remaining disbursements projected by TANESCO and the GoT, it is anticipated that
an amount of SDR 17,174,966.68 would remain unused by the Project's closing date and
at the end of the disbursement period. The GoT has requested the IDA to cancel this
amount before the Project closing and make use of those funds for an additional financing
of the IDA financed TEDAP.

28.     The proposed cancellation amount has been established by a thorough financial
analysis conducted by the GoT and reviewed by the IDA Project team. The calculations
include a sufficient contingency amount for any cost increases which may be incurred up
to the project closing including SDR/US$ exchange rate fluctuations.

29.     The final amounts remaining under each category before and after the proposed
re-allocation and cancellation is shown in the following Table 4:

   Please note that the original and revised (2007) Results Framework for this Project was based on a
different format. The values from the current RF of 2007 were therefore transferred into this new
mandatory template of the new standard for Restructuring Papers. "Progress To Date" values have been
taken from the last available ISR
ii
    This Project and its results framework were developed and updated in the last restructuring of 2007 when
the Bank's Core indicators did not exist. Furthermore the Core Indicators on Energy have not yet been
formalized. Some Intermediate Outcome Indicators (IOI) relate to sectors other than energy (Water, ICT
and Transport) that have already approved Core Indicators. However the IOIs relating to those non-energy
sectors were already achieved by the time Core indicators were introduced. Consequently the original
energy and non-energy related indicators as approved by the last restructuring in 2007 remain unchanged.
iii
    Please note that this KPI has had two target values. The original target value from the 2001 Board
approval was reached in 2007. The second target value was introduced in the 2007 restructuring and
currently reads as follows: "IPTL Plant converted to natural gas firing; and UEP capacity charges
significantly reduced ". Since the IPTL related Project component is hereby proposed to be dropped, the
IPTL related part of this target will be dropped in the next ISR. However as explained in the main text of
the Restructuring Paper, the Capacity charges payable by Tanesco to private generators has overall already
been lowered significantly and therefore this PDO Indicator is already achieved, even without the IPTL
conversion.
