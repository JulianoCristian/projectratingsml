Nonetheless,\n            preparation of the project conduced to the resettlement\n            plan, implemented between May 1998 and May 2000, when both\n            urban, and rural resettlement occurred along the pipeline\n            route. Volume I specifies the resettlement plan, noting that\n            in the absence of clear legal, and regulatory standards in\n            Tanzania, the Bank's Operational Directive 4.30 should\n            guide the process to minimize disruption, either through the\n            way-of-leave program (WOLP) (cash compensations), or\n            resettlement. The WOLP determined land values (including\n            housing, structures, and crops) according to market value,\n            with the provision of alternative plots of land, if\n            allocation is less than half an acre, and, a Dispute\n            Resolution Group was established to settle potential\n            conflicts. The Resettlement process provided land-for-land\n            compensation at replacement costs, including crop losses, to\n            restore living standards of displaced populations. Volume II\n            presents a resettlement impact assessment, followed by a\n            socioeconomic assessment program, that reviews the process,\n            and, includes the provision to restore infrastructure\n            services in urban areas, to at least equivalent to the\n            levels of services prior to resettlement, in light of lesser\n            service levels experienced.  Volumes III, IV and V address\n            resettlement issues concerning the subcomponent Wayleave\n            Village electrification scheme."}, "docdt": "2010-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
