existing legal and judicial framework by\n            making it more efficient, transparent, and responsive to the\n            needs of the public at large and of the private sector in\n            particular. The project has three main components. The first\n            component 1) addresses the weaknesses in the legal and\n            regulatory framework that impacts private sector activity\n            adversely and helps obtain expert input to identify and\n            formulate a comprehensive reform policy; 2) strengthens the\n            capacity of the institutions responsible for law reform and\n            legal education in the area of commercial law by providing\n            short-term training and materials, upgrading and introducing\n            courses in the law school, and launching campaigns and\n            disseminating materials to develop public awareness; 3)\n            provides local and international training for lawyers in the\n            Attorney General's office and judges; and 4) develops\n            an automated and on line Legal Information Network (LAWNET),\n            which includes statutes, government regulations, case\n            information/court decisions, and textbook excerpts; and\n            organizes and modernizes the storage and retrieval of\n            related publications. The second component helps the Office\n            of the Registrar of Companies (ORC) improve its\n            administration, management, and regulatory capacities. The\n            third component finances judicial training and faculty\n            development, reorganizes the Judicial Services Commission,\n            introduces model courts, and develops a formal mediation system."}, "docdt": "2000-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
