Lanka were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: one important\n            lesson is that in rushing to fulfill conditions agreed with\n            International Financial Institutions (IFI), the authorities\n            can be prone to overcommit themselves. Government often\n            agrees to move on to many areas without realizing the\n            technical and managerial capacity as well as the political\n            capital that is required to deliver on these requests. One\n            mitigating factor is the creation of a steering committee\n            representing the major stakeholders, that is empowered to\n            take hard decisions to move the reform process forward.\n            Ownership of the project by the Ministry of Finance also\n            provides it with strong and empowered leadership. Project\n            design needs to be realistic and simple to ensure effective\n            implementation. In particular, adequate attention should be\n            given to institutional and implementation arrangements,\n            including developing measurable indicators to track progress\n            towards the Project Development Objectives (PDOs).\n            Especially, in a Legal Reform Project, monitoring\n            arrangements pose particular challenges. However, without\n            indicators, an objective assessment of the project is not\n            possible. Increase in judges' knowledge of commercial\n            law, and changes in attitudes rest on interpretations of\n            qualitative factors and are matters on which observers can\n            reasonably differ. In order to avoid such disagreement,\n            projects require monitorable indicators."}, "docdt": "2007-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
