               Procurement and Consultants' Services
Section I.  Procurement of Goods and Works
Part A:     International Competitive Bidding
1.    Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods and works shall be
procured under contracts awarded in accordance with procedures
consistent with those set forth in Sections I and II of the
"Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits"
published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines). For fixed-price
contracts, the invitation to bid referred to in paragraph 2.13 of
the Guidelines shall provide that, when contract award is delayed
beyond the original bid validity period, the successful bidder's bid
price will be increased for each week of delay by two predisclosed
correction factors acceptable to the Bank, one to be applied to all
foreign currency components and the other to the local currency
component of the bid price. Such an increase shall not be taken into
account in bid evaluation.
2.    Bidders for the works included under Part A of this Schedule
estimated to cost the equivalent of $1,000,000 or more shall be
prequalified as described in paragraph 2.10 of the Guidelines.
3.    To the extent practicable, contracts for goods and civil works
shall be grouped in bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent
of, respectively $100,000 and $500,000 or more each.
Part B:     Preference for Domestic Manufacturers
      In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures
described in Part A.1 hereof, a margin of preference may be granted
to bids offering goods described in the corresponding specification
which are manufactured in Guatemala in accordance with, and subject
to, the provisions of paragraph 2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines and
paragraphs 1 through 4 of Appendix thereto.
Part C:     Other Procurement Procedures
1.    Local Competitive Bidding
      Contracts for civil works or, subject to paragraph 2 below,
goods estimated to cost less than the equivalent of $500,000 and
$100,000, respectively per contract, or bid package, as the case may
be, may be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding, advertised
locally, in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
2.    Limited International Bidding
      Subject to paragraph 3 (below) ancillary equipment such as
personal computers, software, office or training equipment, and
vehicles, estimated to cost the equivalent of $25,000 or more but
less than the equivalent of $100,000, may be procured under
contracts awarded through limited international bidding procedures
on the basis of evaluation and comparison of bids invited from a
list of qualified suppliers eligible under the Guidelines the number
of which shall be sufficient, in the Bank's opinion, to ensure
competition, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Sections I and II of the Guidelines (excluding paragraphs 2.8, 2.9,
2.55 and 2.56 thereof).
3.    Shopping
      Items described in 2 above or groups of such items estimated
to cost less than the equivalent of $25,000 per contract, up to an
Page  13
aggregate amount not to exceed the equivalent of $350,000, may be
procured under contracts awarded on the basis of comparison of price
quotations solicited from a list of at least three suppliers which,
in the case of international shopping, shall be from at least two
different countries eligible under the Guidelines, all in accordance
with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Part D:     Additional Procurement Provisions
1.    Without limitation upon the provisions of the Guidelines or
the Consultant Guidelines in respect of procurement of goods, works
or services, and pursuant to the provisions in respect of interna-
tional agreements of the Guatemalan Law concerning public sector
procurement currently in effect:
      (a)   In respect of bidding procedures under Part A of this
Schedule, no registration procedure shall be required, or understood
to be required, as pre-conditions to bidding, except where a
prequalification procedure for intended bidders has been agreed with
the Bank and only to the extent that the criteria to enable
registration are not stricter than those for prequalification.  In
respect of competitive bidding governed by the provisions of Part
C.1 of this Schedule, pre-registration may be used to the extent
that it shall not prevent foreign bidders to participate in any
bidding process and that it shall be achieved through ad-hoc
procedures agreed from time to time between the Borrower and the
Bank.
      (b)   No prior registration shall be required for consultant
services, and foreign consultants shall be allowed to participate
freely in the selection process even when local consultants shall be
available for the concerned services; and any public notice required
by legal provisions in effect in Guatemala and related to the
acquisition of services to be provided by consultants or experts,
shall be deemed applicable only to the extent that the public notice
in question is made as a way of soliciting expressions of interest
but not as an invitation to participate in the process.
      (c)   The bidding documents shall make clear that bids shall
be submitted during a period the length of which shall require prior
acceptance by the Bank, and it shall not be required that bids be
submitted personally to any individual or group of individuals; the
end of the period in question shall coincide, unless otherwise
agreed with the Bank, with the moment stipulated for bid opening in
the bidding documents.  No bidder shall be disqualified if the price
of the corresponding bid falls above or below a pre-determined given
value, or out of a post-bid-presentation-determined price band.
      (d)   Bid and performance securities shall, at the bidders'
option, be denominated in the currency of the bid or any other
currency commonly used in international transactions, and shall be
issued by any bank or insurance company located in Guatemala or
abroad, acceptable to the Borrower and the Bank.
2.    Unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and the Bank, the
Borrower shall invite bids in regard of the procurement of goods,
civil works and services for the Project exclusively on the basis of
standard documents agreed with the Bank from time to time and shall
inform the Bank on any proposed departure from said documents before
any such tender is made public.
Part E:     Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions
1.    Review of Prequalification
      With respect to the prequalification of bidders as provided in
Part A.2 hereof, the procedures set forth in paragraph 1 of Appendix
1 to the Guidelines shall apply.
2.    Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and final
contracts:
Page  14
      (a)   With respect to each contract (or bid package) for goods
estimated to cost the equivalent of $100,000 or more, each contract
(or bid package) for civil works estimated to cost the equivalent of
$500,000 or more, and the three first contracts (or bid packages)
proposed to be awarded under Part C.1 above (or such larger number
of contracts or packages as the Bank shall require if the Bank would
have raised objections in respect of the award of one or more of
said three first contracts or bid packages) the procedures set forth
in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply.
      (b)   With respect to each contract or bid packages not
governed by the preceding paragraph, the procedures set forth in
paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply.
      (c)   The provisions of the preceding subparagraph (b) shall
not apply to contracts on account of which the Bank has authorized
withdrawals from the Loan Account on the basis of statements of
expenditure. Such contracts shall be retained in accordance with
Section 4.01 (c)(ii) of this Agreement.
3.    The figure of 15% is hereby specified for purposes of
paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines.
Section II. Employment of Consultants
      In order to assist the Borrower in carrying out Parts A, B, E
and F of the Project, the Borrower shall employ transport planning,
highway management, engineering design and supervision consultants
whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of
employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank. Such consultants shall
be selected in accordance with principles and procedures satisfacto-
ry to the Bank on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as
Executing Agency" published by the Bank in August 1981 (the
Consultant Guidelines).
