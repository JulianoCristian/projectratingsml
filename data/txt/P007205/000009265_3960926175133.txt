private sector in the execution of public works; and (d) to assist in
enhancing MCTOP's transport planning and policy making capabilities.
5.       Project Descrigtion.  In support of projoct objectives, the
proposed project consists of an investment component to be financed under
the loan, and of an Action Plan which Includes institutional measures and
investment targets for DGC's program as * whole. Investments under the
project would comprise (2 of total project cost in parenthesis): (a) civil
works for the rehabilitation and Improvoment of about-390 km of secondary
earth roads nationwide (292) and of about 180 km of paved roads in the
Altipleno region (372), and consultant services for the ssociated
construction supervision (52), and for engineering design of 590 km of
secondary earth roads (22) and of 200 km of paved roads in the Altiplano
(22); (b) construction of about 500 m of labor-intensive small bridges for
the secondary and tertiary road networks (1); (c) provision of road
maintenance, training and miscellaneous equipment (151); (d) training
program for road staff (22); and (e) technical assistance and studies In
support of the Implementation of the Action Plan (42).   Mesures under the
Action Plan would improve efficiency in the road subsector and include the
preparation of the National Transport Plan (NTP), with the assistance of
consultants to be financed under the loan, and provision for adequate
levels of cost recovery from road users.
6.       Execution of the project would be the responsibility of DGC,
except for the preparation of the NTP, for which MCTOP's Sectoral Unit
would be responsible. DGC would delegate specific project components to
its line units, and the responsibility for the technical assistance program
would be shared between the unit concerned and the Planning Unit. For the
administration of consultant services to be provided on an individual
basis, or in small groups, under the technical assistance component, the
Government would make use of an institution, satisfactory to the Bank, to
select, contract and pay consultants on its behalf. Overall responsibility
for the control, monitoring and evaluation of project activities would be
supported by a Program Coordination Unit, under the direct authority of
DGC's Director.
7.       Agreed Actions.  At negotiations, the Government submitted to the
Bank a road development letter setting out the objectives and principles
underlying the Action Plan, and a policy statement on training providing
the framework for the training program. Both the letter and the statement
are satisfactory to the Bank.
8.       Agreement was reached with the Government during negotiations on
measures relating to transport sector mangement, at the level of MCTOP,
comprising a comitment to continue recovering routine and periodic
maintenance costs of road infrastructure use in accordance with criteria
satisfactory to the Bank, and to prepare the NTP by June 30, 1992 and
Implement its conclusions thereof (1992-1994) in accordance with a program
satisfactory to the Bank. Further agreements reached with the Government
cover specific institutional development actions to improve DMC's
capabilities to manage its investment program and increase the
effectiveness of road maintenance operations. They comprise:
(a) incorporating into the permanent administrative structure of DCC by
June 30, 1991 DGC's Program Coordination Unit, as created prior to
negotiations, and by June 30, 1990 the Training Unit; (b) improving
pluriannual road planning capabilities, and developing and implementing a
system for the monitoring of the subproject portfolio under DGC (June 30,
1991), in accordance with agreed policies, economic criteria and targets;
(c) contracting out with the private sector all primary and secondary road
construction and rehabilitation works, and progressively contracting out



-3-
periodic maintenance works (602 in 1994); (d) fully implementing road and
equipment management systems in all road districts (June 30, 1992), use
adequate vehicle weight control systems, and acquire mobile equipment for
weight control (January 1, 1991); (e) gradually reducing expenditures in
unqualified maintenance personnel to a maximum of 402 of the total
maintenance budget by 1994; (f) adopting a cost-accounting framework at the
project level within DGC and computerizing accounting systems by June 30,
1991; (g) implementing the recommendations of studies on strengthening of
works supervision (January 1, 1991) and on pavement evaluation techn.Lues
(June 30, 1991), in accordance with agreed terms of reference; (h) carrying
out the training program under the project, in accordance with the agreed
scope and targets; and (i) project implementation arrangements, including
subproject preparation, procurement and auditing.
9.       During negotiations, the Government also agreed to undertake the
following actions, prior to effectiveness of the proposed loan: (a) MCTOP
to enter into an agreement with the Guatemalan Institute for Anthropology
and History for the Institute's systematic involvement in the assessment of
cultural property matters in the road subsector; (b) MCTOP to enter into an
agreement with the Guatemalan National Commission of Environment, for the
Commission's involvement in the monitoring of environmental effects of
investments in the road subsector; and (c) signing an agreement with an
institution satisfactory to the Bank for the administration of the
technical assistance component of the proposed project.
10.      Benefits.  The proposed project would have an economic rate of
return on physical road investments (78? of total project costs) estimated
at about 28?, mostly reflecting direct benefits in vehicle operating and
road infrastructure costs. The proposed investments, by improving road
infrastructure connecting key agricultural areas, would support efforts to
diversify exports, increase production and increase the incomes of the
rural poor. In addition, institutional improvements would lead to increased
productivity of maintenance operations and lower construction costs through
better organization and control. Direct employment impact associated with
road investments under the project is estimated at an yearly average of
1,800 non-skilled jobs, during the project execution period.
11..     Risks.  There are no major technical risks or environmental impact
associated with the civil works envisaged. One uncertainty relates,
however, to the continued Government commitment to improved transport
sector policy making and to the implementation of the measures that this
would require. Progress on this matter would be closely followed during
project implementation both through supervision and through the technical
assistance component, which will help to increase Government awareness of
important matters affecting sector management.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
