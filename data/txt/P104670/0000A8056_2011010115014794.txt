                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is to contribute to improving ecosystem management and sustainable forestry in the project areas of Kazakhstan and the
                         Kyrgyz Republic. The Global Environmental Objectives are: (a) improving biodiversity conservation; and (b) contributing to climate mitigation by sequestering
                         carbon dioxide in forests in the Kyrgyz Republic.

                          The above objectives will contribute to poverty reduction by increasing local peoples' access to forest benefits such as fruits, nuts, fuel and construction wood,
                         forage, employment generation, and revenues from carbon trading and tourism. The project will contribute to national environmental and social benefits for the
                         two countries' newly forested areas will not only improve soil conservation and biodiversity protection by providing habitats for threatened species, but also
                         generate revenues that will increase the financial sustainability of protected areas. Finally, the carbon trading scheme will contribute to increasing revenues,
                         expanding knowledge, and developing a replicable carbon trading model for the region. The large majority of these benefits, however, will materialize after
                         project closing, creating a monitoring challenge.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                            Yes           No
