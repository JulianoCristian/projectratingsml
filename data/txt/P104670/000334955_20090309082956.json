Plant 13,950 ha of new forests to\n            reduce erosion of soil, prevent avalanches and mudflows and\n            decrease water logging caused by deteriorated drainage\n            systems; and e) increase financial sustainability of the\n            State Agency for Environment Protection and Forestry (SAEPF)\n            under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and local\n            Self-Government Administration (AO) thanks to revenue\n            generated by carbon trading. The involuntary resettlement\n            policy (OP 4.12) is triggered because forestation activities\n            may restrict access to resources such as pasture resources\n            for livestock producers. Project activities will not require\n            or entail any land acquisition and/or physical relocation of\n            people. In addition, the strengthening biodiversity\n            conservation component does not have the objective of\n            enlarging protected areas, but only to improve the\n            management of existing ones. To address the risk that access\n            to pasture resources will be curtailed, an access\n            restriction process framework has been prepared. This\n            participatory process is primarily focused on the\n            identification of afforestation and reforestation sites that\n            do not conflict with either formal or informal pasture use.\n            Measures to assist in improvement or restoration of\n            livelihoods will only apply in exceptional circumstances\n            where no alternative sites can be identified."}, "docdt": "2009-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
