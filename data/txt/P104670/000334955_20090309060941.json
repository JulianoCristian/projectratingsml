objective of the Tien Shan Ecosystem\n            Development Project (TSEDP) in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz\n            Republic (KR) are to: a) reduce anthropogenic pressure on\n            natural ecosystems and natural resources through development\n            of sustainable tourism and increase of income of local\n            population; b) earn incomes from selling certified carbon\n            received as a result of afforestation in the Kyrgyz Republic\n            and to share this practice in the region; c) increase income\n            of rural population by means of wood and non-wood forest\n            products and incomes from selling certified discharges\n            received as a result of afforestation and foresting; d)\n            reduce water and wind erosion of soil by creation of\n            erosion-preventive and wind-protective forest strip by means\n            of ecosystem approach. Plant 13,950 ha of new forests to\n            reduce erosion of soil, prevent avalanches and mudflows and\n            decrease water logging caused by deteriorated drainage\n            systems; and e) increase financial sustainability of the\n            State Agency for Environment Protection and Forestry (SAEPF)\n            under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and Aiyl Okmotus\n            (AO) thanks to revenue generated by carbon trading. Negative\n            impacts include: i) effect from small-scale construction\n            works at specially protected natural areas (improvement of\n            roads, reconstruction of buildings, irrigation\n            infrastructure, and etc.); ii) long-term demand for\n            irrigation in areas with scarce water resources; iii)\n            increase of fire hazard; iv) non-regulated usage of\n            pesticides and herbicides; v) access to pasture areas,\n            reduction of existing pastures; and vi) allergic risks.\n            Mitigation measures of the project are: 1) all contracts for\n            construction works should meet standards on environment\n            protection, health and safety required by legislation of the\n            KR and World Bank (WB) procedures; 2) TSEDP project will\n            ensure corresponding trainings for forestry personnel and\n            participants of the project on creation of plantations of\n            fast-growing wood species and on training of integrated pest\n            management, usage, storage and transportation of pests and\n            other progressive forestry practices; 3) TSEDP project will\n            prepare Strategy of Social Responsibility that will include:\n            training programs for information, activity on plan\n            development for making decisions on usage of resources,\n            development of compensation measures, principals of joint\n            participation in monitoring and evaluation; and 4) it will\n            be realized selection of quick growing wood species\n            excluding allergic risks from poplars. Selection of cuttings\n            for seedling will be from males that do not cause allergic reactions."}, "docdt": "2009-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
