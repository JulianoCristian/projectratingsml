Executive summary  
 
An environmental and social assessment (ESA) was conducted as part of the appraisal of the 
proposed 
Tien Shan Ecosystem Development Project
 
(TSEDP)
 of the Kyrgyz Republic (KR) 
and the Republic of Kazakhstan (RK) with co-financing of the International Fund for 
Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). The TSEDP 
comprise the following three components: 
A.  Strengthening Biodiversity Conservation in Protected Areas and Productive Landscapes 
B.  Forestry and Carbon Trading in the Kyrgyz Republic 
C. Project Management 
 
Because the proposed project deals to a large extent with environmental management and 
improvement of environmental and socio-economic conditions in the Tien Shan and beyond, the 
overall environmental and social impacts are expected to be positive and to outweigh any 
negative impacts.  
 
The proposed project will trigger the World Bank safeguard policies on Environmental 
Assessment (OP/BP 4.01), Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12; Access Restriction to Natural 
Resources), International Waterways  (OP/BP 7.50), Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04), Forests 
(OP/BP 4.36) and Pest Management (OP/BP 4.09). According to these policies, this ESA 
provides Environmental Management Plan (EMP), Access Restriction Process Framework 
(ARPF) / Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and Social Accountability Strategy (SAS). The 
proposed environmental and social management describe measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate 
or offset negative and enhance positive environmental and social impacts. Potential negative 
risks/impacts, as well as appropriate preventive actions, mitigation measures were identified in 
order to prevent, eliminate or minimize any anticipated adverse impacts.  
 
The ESA confirms that in accordance with the project objectives, the implementation of the 
TSEDP would contribute globally to improved biodiversity conservation and ecosystem 
restoration, reduced pressure on natural resources, climate change mitigation, and increased 
sustainability of the Tien Shan mountain ecosystem. Locally, the project would improve 
environmental and socio-economic conditions by developing sustainable tourism, establishing 
carbon payment schemes for forestry, improving rural economy and access for rural population 
to forest products, promoting protective forest functions and increasing financial sustainability 
of the Forestry and Environmental Administrations.  
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Tien Shan is one of the largest mountain systems in the world with the altitude reaching 7439m 
above sea level (Victory peak). It is located in the heart of the Eurasian continent between 
latitude 39°30
and 44° 30
North and longitude 71° 30
and 95° East, stretches 2275km from 
west to east and 585km from south to north. Its larger part is located in Kyrgyzstan (more than 
3500km²), in Kazakhstan (about 1900km²), in China (1340km²), in Uzbekistan (about 600km²) 
and in Tajikistan (100km²). The Tien Shan is characterized by a high degree of biodiversity 
concentration. Various ecosystems, ranging from glaciers to deserts, in a relatively small area of 
Central Asia with a sharply continental climate requires special attention to the conservation of 
natural balance of ecosystems, including biodiversity conservation.  
 
Page  6
T
he
area is also extremely important in terms of global agro-biodiversity. In the Kazakh regons 
of Zailiskiy and Djungarskiy Alatau as well as in the on Fergana and Chatkal mountain ranges 
of Kyrgyzstan the mountain wild-fruit forests present a natural habitat for agro-biodiversity of 
unique value. About 100 species of wild congeners/progenitors of 24 cultures are growing here. 
The global value of mountain agro-biodiversity is found in that wild-fruit plantations are source 
of the unique gene pool. Currently the areas of wild-fruit forests are reduced, they are under 
degradation and subject to numerous threats caused by destruction of natural habitat of mountain 
agro-biodiversity as a consequence of overgrazing, fires, dense site coverages and operations 
within the territory of mountain wild-fruit forest belt, inadequate management of wild-fruit 
ecosystems, genetic erosion and introduction of aggressive and alien species, poor social & 
economic life conditions of population.  
 
Tien Shan forest ecosystems play an important role for biodiversity by providing habitat for 
flora and fauna species, erosion control and carbon sequestration. Tien-Shan covered by more 
then 1 million ha of forests. Before the Second World War, it had around twice this amount of 
forested area. The main reasons for the reduction have been intensive timber felling for 
economic needs during and after the war, overgrazing of collective farms’ livestock, more 
recently increasing forest degradation due to encroachment for grazing and fuelwood collection, 
as well as lack of forest regeneration and reforestation activities. Forest resources are very 
important for rural livelihoods and economy and for the sustainability of mountain ecosystems. 
Therefore, biodiversity conservation, forest restoration, improved forest management and the 
promotion of small-scale fast-growing plantations and orchards on the community level are 
important socio-economic and environmental objectives for the Government of the Kyrgyz 
Republic and Republic of Kazakhstan. Similar picture is observed in adjacent part of Tien Shan 
in Kazakhstan. 
 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
Project Objectives 
 
The proposed TSED project will be implemented in two countries - Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz 
Republic – with the potential for replication in other countries in the region. The proposed 
project has both global and local development objectives.  
The main 
global objectives
 are to: 
·
Increase sustainability of the Tien Shan Mountain Ecosystem of Kazakhstan and the 
Kyrgyz Republic  
·
Improve biodiversity preservation through strengthening conservation and protection of 
specially protected areas and extension of forest habitat to sustain biodiversity of Tien 
Shan region in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan;  
·
Reduce pressure on natural resources by increasing the environmental benefits generated 
by improved forest management and eco-tourism; 
·
Mitigate climate change through reforestation to reduce emission of greenhouse gases 
(CO2) in the Kyrgyz Republic; 
The main 
local objectives
 are to: 
·
Reduce anthropogenic pressure on natural ecosystems and natural resources through 
development of sustainable tourism and increase of income of local population;  
·
Earn incomes from selling certified carbon received as a result of afforestation in the 
Kyrgyz Republic and to share this practice in the region; 
·
Increase income of rural population by means of wood and non-wood forest products 
and incomes from selling certified discharges received as a result of afforestation and 
foresting; 
Page  7
·
Reduce water and wind erosion of soil by creation of erosion-preventive and wind-
protective forest strip by means of ecosystem approach. Plant 13,950 ha of new forests to 
reduce erosion of soil, prevent avalanches and mudflows and decrease water logging 
caused by deteriorated drainage systems; 
·
Increase financial sustainability of the SAEPF of the KR and AO thanks to revenue 
generated by carbon (certified discharges) trading.   
 
Project Components 
 
The proposed project will comprise the following three components:  
 
A. Strengthening Biodiversity Conservation in Protected Areas and Productive 
Landscapes  
A.1. Protected Area Management 
A.2. Conservation in the Broader Landscape through Small Grants 
A.3. Sustainable Tourism Promotion 
B. Forestry and Carbon Trading in the Kyrgyz Republic 
B.1. Afforestation and Reforestation 
B.2. Validation and Monitoring of Carbon Sequestration  
B.3. Improved Sustainable Forest Management 
C. Project Management 
 
A. Strengthening Biodiversity Conservation in Protected Areas and Productive Landscapes 
(approx. cost US$ 6.9 million, GEF Grant: US$2.35 million for Kazakhstan and US$1.0 million 
for the Kyrgyz Republic) 
This component will have mostly global objectives of biodiversity protection. It will contribute 
to improve in-situ biodiversity protection by (i) increasing the capacity and coverage of 
protected areas (PA) and (ii) promoting environmentally friendly practices and improving the 
management of the productive landscapes, including forests, natural parks, and hunting reserves. 
To increase the coverage, the component will support the creation
 of the “Western Tien Shan 
Biosphere”, which was started under the Central Asia Transboundary Biodiversity Project. It 
will also provide technical assistance and goods for the management of different categories of 
protected areas in the region (such as natural reserves, parks, game reserves), so that they 
increase their effectiveness in protecting biodiversity. The component would also promote 
integration of protected areas into broader landscapes and sectors so as to maintain ecological 
structure and functions in order to reduce the threat to biodiversity. 
 
The activities of this component will contribute to development of the Tien Shan ecological 
network, including protected areas of different categories (such as natural reserves, parks, game 
reserves) and buffer zones. This will be done based on development of closer cooperation 
between protected areas and (i) neighboring local communities, (ii) local authorities; and (iii) 
educational and scientific institutes, both at national and international levels. The component 
will support productive landscapes by improving the management of exiting forests and 
supporting sustainable tourism both to increase the local benefits generated by protected areas 
and to generate income for local communities and for parks and protected areas. Productive 
landscape activities will support improved forest management, including fire prevention, and 
increase the demand for and supply of eco-tourism services by mainstreaming biodiversity 
concerns in tourism development. 
 
B. Reforestation and Carbon Trading in the Kyrgyz Republic
 (approx. cost US$12.2 million; 
IFAD Grant: US$8.0 million).
 This component will contribute to forestation activities on 13,950 
ha of marginal land to (a) mitigate climate change by sequestering greenhouse gases in forests; 
(b) develop a carbon trading mechanism to raise revenues from carbon sequestration; (c) 
recreate habitat for biodiversity; and (d) generate local benefits such as fuel and construction 
Page  8
w
ood,
fruits, nuts, forage, and other non-timber forest products, and environmental benefits such 
as wind breaks and retention of snow charges for neighboring agricultural lands to reduce water 
and wind erosion, and reclaim agricultural land compromised by waterlogging, salinity, and 
erosion.  
 
The following table summarizes areas planned to be forested, disaggregated by fast-growing or 
rapid-production species including elm, poplar, willow, and fruit trees such as almond, apple, 
apricot, cherry, peaches, pistachio, plum, seabuckthorn, and walnut, etc.; and slow-growing 
species such as juniper, pine, spruce, saxaul, and others. To avoid the risks associated with 
monoculture, multiple species will be used in reforestation activities.

Reforestation will be implemented through three arrangements: 
·
Community Development and Investment Agency (ARIS)
:
reforestation and 
afforestation by communities and private investors in Aiyl Okmotus (villages) and 
private lands in collaboration with ARIS/VIP, which has developed a methodology for 
local planning and management of resources. 
·
Lezkhozes (LH)
:
forestation by State Owned Forest Enterprises or LH in State Forest 
Fund land; and  
·
Public Private Partnerships (PPP)
:
forestation by private investors in State Forest 
Fund land  
 
Soil preparation will be manual for most slow-growing species, only for poplar and elm the sites 
will be ploughed while taking into account standards to minimize soil disturbance. In 
combination with manual weeding, in some cases two herbicides, glyphosate (Roundup) for 
initial weed knockdown and Simazine for residual control will be use, and this would control 
weeds for a whole growing season. Apart from this no pesticides will be applied. 
 
Initial estimates show that reforesting an area of around 13,950 ha should sequester around 
500,000 tons of CO2 by 2017. The BioCarbon Fund could be available to purchase around 
500,000 tCO2. This however will be revised on the basis of more detailed carbon sequestration 
estimates and particularly the potential level of emission reduction which could be achieved by 
2012. 
 
In addition, this component contributes to improving the management of existing forests and 
established plantations by: (a) continuing and expanding «Collaborative Forest Management»  
(CFM) activities in the Walnut Fruit Forest in the Southern Kyrgyz Republic to improve the 
protection of this unique livelihood system, and (b) providing technical assisance and capacity 
building to LHs and private sector.  
 
C. Project Management 
(approximate cost US$1.5 million, GEF grant: US$0.33 million for 
Kazakhstan, IFAD:  0.7 million for the Kyrgyz Republic).
 
Overall coordination of project 
activities and the fiduciary aspects of project management will be handled by the State Agency 
for Environmental Protection and Forestry (SAEPF) of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Forestry 
and Hunting Committee (FHC) of Kazakhstan. The FHC of Kazakhstan is implementing a new 
Forest Protection and Reforestation Project with IBRD financing, and fiduciary responsibilities 
Page  9
w
ill be initially handled by the existing project unit. In addition the project will collaborate with 
the Community Development and Investment Agency/Village Investment Project (ARIS/VIP) in 
the Kyrgyz Republic for reforestation by communities in Aiyl Okmotu (village administration) 
land.

ENVIRONMENTAL & SOCIAL ASSESSMENT (ESA) 
 
Primary objective
 of the assessment process is the delivery of environmental and social 
management documents (e.g. EMP, RPF) in which the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate or 
offset negative environmental and social impacts, and enhance positive ones, will be 
documented. These management plans will be specific enough and contain enough detail to 
allow (i) mainstreaming into project design and (ii) the integration of implementation-ready 
provisions into tender documents for project implementation. 
 
Secondary objectives
 of the EA will be to (i) establish a preliminary baseline of environmental 
conditions in the Tien Shan, (ii) identify any significant environmental or social risks/impacts of 
the proposed project (both positive and negative), and (iii) specify appropriate preventive 
actions and mitigation measures (including screening and approval of sub-projects and 
appropriate monitoring) to prevent, eliminate or minimise any anticipated adverse impacts.  
 
A
third objective
 is to integrate and accomplish all necessary activities and steps to comply 
with the Kyrgyz and Kazakh national legislation / regulations on environmental and social 
assessments, usually known as OBOC (OVOS). The Consultant shall thus prepare the ESA in a 
form and with contents acceptable both to the World Bank and the authorities of the two Client 
countries. 
 
The ESA presents an 
environmental management plan
 (
EMP
)
and adequate social 
instruments, such as an 
access restriction process framework (ARPF) / resettlement policy 
framework (RPF
). 
7
assigned tasks
 were performed to achieve the ESA objectives: 
 
1. TASK
Relevant national environmental policies, laws and regulations, as well as relevant international 
environmental agreements and conventions to which either Kyrgyzstan or Kazakhstan is party 
were reviewed. Moreover, the World Bank safeguard policies triggered by the proposed project 
were reviewed and put into practical context. Relevant national policies, laws, and regulations 
relevant to land access, informal land use, and restricting access to protected areas were 
reviewed and described in the framework of a comparative analysis with the provisions of the 
World Bank’s Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP4.12).  
 
Policy, legal and institutional frameworks of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Republic of 
Kazakhstan  
 
The key national legal & regulatory acts (laws, regulations, resolutions of the Government and 
public authorities) of the KR and the RK as well as international agreements relevant to the 
TSED Project are shown in 
Annex B
.
In accordance with national legislations of the KR and the 
RK in the case of discrepancy between national legislation provisions and international 
regulatory acts where either Kyrgyzstan or Kazakhstan is a party and which came into effect 
within their territory, the latter would prevail. The KR and the RK ratified and are the parties of 
such Conventions as Convention on Biological Diversity, Convention Concerning the Protection 
of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, Convention to Combat Desertification, Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of 
Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a 
Page  11
T
ransboundary, Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance and others. The 
KR ratified the Kyoto Protocol to the Convention on Climate Change. 
 
Environmental Policies, Plans and Programs  
 
The national environmental policy of the KR and RK is based on a number of national strategies 
and action plans, which define the main objectives for environmental protection and sustainable 
use of natural resources. Key policies, as listed in 
Annex A
,
demonstrate the Governments’ 
engagement in environmental protection. 
 
The RK adopted, implemented and launched the following policies and programmes: Strategic 
Development Plan of the RK until 2010, Environmental Conservation Programme for 2008 – 
2010, Environmental Safety Concept of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2004-2015, Programme 
for conservation and efficient management of water resources, fauna and development of 
network of specially protected territories until 2010. 
 
The KR adopted, implemented and launched the following policies and programmes: Country 
Development Strategy (CDS) for 2006–2010, Environmental Safety Concept of the Kyrgyz 
Republic, National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), National Strategy and Action Plan on 
Sustainable Development of Mountainous Territories of the Kyrgyz Republic, Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs), Forestry Development Concept of the Kyrgyz Republic till 2025, 
National Forestry Programme of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2005-2015, National Forestry 
Development Action Plan of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2006-2010 in order to conserve and 
reproduce forest ecosystems, National Forest Inventory of the Kyrgyz Republic, and National 
Framework Programme for Sustainable Land Management until 2016. 
 
Legal & Institutional Framework for Environmental Assessment/Management  
 
Legal & regulatory acts of the KR and the RK related to environmental protection, nature 
management and biodiversity conservation encourage the conservation of flora, fauna and their 
habitats, identify the obligation of all legal and natural persons to use natural resources 
sparingly. Specific use of natural resources related to removal of flora & fauna species from 
their habitats is permitted only if they are prescribed areas and if there is a special license.  
 
KR & RK legislations on ecological expertise (EE) and environmental impact assessment (EIA) 
bind all nature users planning environmental impact operations to be subject to EE & EIA 
procedures at planning phase. Control of implementation of sectoral legislations in force, state 
ecological or other specific expertise and nature management is imposed on KR & RK state 
agencies listed in 
Annex C
.
Responsibilities of state agencies, interaction procedures are 
regulated by laws, by-laws and relevant Regulations to be approved by the KR & RK 
Governments. The assessment concludes that the project objectives are in line with the goals and 
supported by the KR & RK state environmental agencies.  
 
Safeguard Policies Triggered 
 
The TSEDP was classified under 
Category «
»
under the WB’s Operational Policy (OP) 
4.01, the main environmental safeguards policy. 
The proposed project will trigger the WB 
Safeguard Policies indicated in Table 2. A partial 
Environmental assessment
 is required, as 
under category «
»
ther
e
are no indications that the project impacts would be “considerable, 
irreversible, growing or long-term adverse”. The 
environmental assessment 
revealed a 
significant potential for positive impacts while potential negative impacts are limited, they can 
be efficiently prevented or reduced through the implementation of appropriate preventative 
actions and mitigation measures.

Involuntary Resettlement: Access Restriction to Natural Resources (relevant for component 
B) 
 
The involuntary resettlement safeguard policy is triggered solely due to the possibility of 
reforestation activities leading to a restriction of access to natural resources where lands have 
been used for other purposes.
1
The project will not involve any forced withdrawal of land 
causing resettlement, loss of house, loss of property, loss of income sources as specified in the 
item 3 
)
/
4.12 “Involuntary resettlement”.
 
Project design minimizes the risk of access restriction to natural resources by excluding lands 
that are currently classified as pasture or arable lands, or under any leasing/renting agreement. 
Project activities will be focused on marginal, low-productive lands of AOs and SFF lands that 
are clearly unsuitable for pasture or crops. While the ecological assessment conducted for site 
selection by the project field teams will identify the sites with least potential for this risk, it is 
possible for both land types that the lands to be reforested are currently used by local people as 
informal and mostly seasonal pastures. The project activities may in particular during early years 
restrict access to pastures, and therefore affect the livelihood of local livestock holders. While 
this risk applies similarly to both land types, it is lower on State Forest Fund lands designated 
for forestry purposes. 
 
An Access Restriction Process Framework (ARPF, 
Annex D
)
was designed in order to minimize 
the risk of conflict between pasture use and forestry, and to ensure that no individual or 
collective livelihood is negatively affected by the project. The ARPF is currently explored and 
further adapted based on the experience in the pilot micro-projects.  
 
Component A for biodiversity conservation will focus on the improvement of management in 
existing protected areas and does not seek to increase protected area. It is therefore unlikely to 
trigger the safeguard policy and to cause any restriction of access, while for the exceptional case 
it would, the same framework process can be applied.

Access to land & natural resources under the Kyrgyz Legislation 
 
In KR the issues related to access to land resources are regulated by Civil Code, Land Code, 
Forestry Code, Administrative Code, Criminal Code, Water Code, the Law on agricultural land 
management, a number of Governmental Resolutions and other relevant by-laws, amendments 
and addenda. Governmental decisions are subject to compulsory implementation on the territory 
of the Republic.  
 
According to the legislation, the property right for agricultural land belongs to (1) the State, (2) 
solely to citizens of the KR who have been resident in the rural area for not less than two years, 
or (3) to agricultural cooperative societies of citizens of the KR who have been resident in the 
rural area for not less than two years. As a result of the land reform since 1999, 665,800ha or 
77,6% of 858,400ha of irrigated agricultural lands are privatized , while 145,600ha or 20% are 
allocated to the state-owned Land Redistribution Fund (LRF) lands under the administration of 
the AOs and AKs.  
 
LRF lands can be transferred for short-term (5-7 years), medium-term (7-10 years) or long-term 
(up to 50 years) leases, under conditions of efficient land management and complied agro-
technical standards. Plot size differs for different land users:  (1) to natural persons, within 
irrigated land up to 25 ha, and within arid land up to 50 ha; (2) to legal entities, within irrigated 
lands up to 50 ha and within arid lands up to 100 ha. Formal land use permits can be obtained by 
applying to the Land Committee under the AO, and the selection of users is in most cases based 
on tender and competition. The land use permit is based on an agreement between the user and 
the AO, according to the decision of the Land Committee.  
 
The SFF comprises forest and non-forest land. It exclusively owned by the state, while the user 
right may be given for use to organizations and citizens of the KR, and certain other groups, 
with various types of uses ranging from pasture, collection of NTFPs, sanitary felling, fuelwood 
collection etc. According to the relevant Governmental Resolutions (
inter alia
,
No. 377 of July 
27 2001 on collaborative forest management, No. 482 of October 19, 2007 on the procedures of 
forest plots leasing and use) formal user arrangements vary in timeframe, eligibility of tenants, 
allocation process, payments and other conditions.   
 
Any informal use on both SFF and LRF lands is illegal under the Land Code, Forestry Code, 
Administrative Code, and in some cases can be considered illegal under the Criminal Code. This 
legislation is to be enforced by local AOs and Gosregister for LRF lands, and by LH for SFF 
lands. 
 
KR legislation about specially protected natural areas (state reserves, national parks, preserves) 
regulates the issues related to SPNA creation, operation, regime and access restriction. While 
creation of state reserves and national parks the preliminary sociological researches are carried 
out, outcomes of these researches are the base for the Government’s decrees identifying their 
boundaries, zones and regimes.  
 
During implementation of this project in the KR, in the course of selection of lands for forest-
planting within the lands of LHs and AOs there should be an envisaged elaboration of legal 
issues securing property rights for grown production and obligations (responsibility) of 
executors as well a foreseen package raising public awareness.

2.TASK
Based on a review of available information and data on social and environmental conditions in 
the Tien Shan area, a preliminary baseline of environmental and socio-economic conditions for 
the project area was established. This baseline will be further adapted and completed during the 
first year of implementation. 
 
BASELINE DESCRIPTION 
 
General Evaluation of Current Situation (Development Trends for 2006-2008) 
 
Physical and geographical features of the Tien Shan high mountain ecosystems that the territory 
of the KR and target territory of Kazakhstan refereed to predetermine their special natural 
instability and increased vulnerability to anthropogenic impacts. Tien-Shan has relatively small 
area (about 20%) with biosphere conditions suitable for settlements and agricultural production. 
However, pressures on this small portion of economically usable land are high, aggravated by 
fast population growth with the result of constant reduction of per capita availability of water 
and land resources and limited potential capacity of the ecosystems for expansion of 
productivity or buffering of natural fluctuations. This fact, along with poorly managed economic 
activity caused by resource intensive sectors continues to worsen environmental condition of the 
republic, which in some regions are threatening to turn into irreversible crises involving 
processes such as desertification, deforestation, soil erosion, mudflows, land slides and etc.
 
Issues related to climate change are starting to become a reality having serious impacts on 
human life and economic activity. This is new and serious challenge for Kazakhstan and 
Kyrgyzstan dictates the necessity to take urgent measures to prevent possible catastrophe, both 
in terms of natural resources, and in terms of social and economic activity. In Tien-Shan, the 
main regress factors related to climate change have already started emerging: reduced 
agricultural productivity, increased danger of extreme meteorological phenomena, alteration and 
even devastation of ecosystems and increasing threat for the health of the population. 
 
According to official statistics in Kyrgyz part of target territory of the Project, 65% from total 
population of the country are accounted to rural area. Poverty rate remains high, while poverty is 
mainly concentrated in rural area, where three fourth of total poor population (1.8 million in 
Kyrgyzstan), and the population below poverty level live. Agriculture is the main livelihood for 
these people, including livestock breeding and crop cultivation. Major share of rural population 
migrates to large cities because of the lack of adequately paid jobs. Progressive urbanization of 
the territories (the lands of settlements as of the end of 2006 compared to 1995 increased by 
84%) accompanies reduction of access of new constructions to centralized drinking water supply 
systems and adequate sewage systems. Despite the fact that in general in the country the share of 
the population having access to safe drinking water tends to increase annually and in 2006 made 
up 89.8%, however, more that half million people do not have access to safe sources of drinking 
water supply as before, which negatively impacts health condition of the population. The share 
of the population having access to adequate sanitary conditions from 2000 to 2006 reduced from 
32.8% to 23.9%. This is caused by the deterioration of sanitation systems and appearance 
around the capital city Bishkek of a circle of newly erected buildings that are not provided with 
water supply and sewage systems. This factor is the reason of periodical outbreaks of mass 
infectious diseases. 
 
Page  15
O
ut
of
10.6 million ha of agricultural land (arable land and pastures), 60% are threatened or 
already impacted by water and wind erosion. Out of 280,000 small farms in Kyrgyzstan, more 
than 84% have arable land of less than 1 ha. With such small land plots it is very hard to provide 
crop rotation, to arrange anti-erosion and forest plantation works. The absence of crop rotation 
on arable lands, violation of agrarian techniques of land processing, deterioration of the 
irrigation and drainage infrastructure and transformation of agricultural lands into other 
categories of land increase potential erosion danger and increase the risks of land degradation. 
Each farm needs to collect annual harvest to provide food supply, while the specific of the 
duration of production cycle (from planting to collecting harvest and obtaining income) of wood 
species cultivation, including fruit trees, does not allow farmers to use their land plots for forest 
plantations. The TSED project activity is rather attractive in this sense being aimed at growing 
wood species on the lands of LHs and AOs that are not used for agricultural production by 
farmers. 
 
Biodiversity Conservation
 
5
special protected territories (SPT) are located at the area of proposed project with the area of 
7.004 km2 in Kazakhstan and 16 SPTs with total area of 19.205 km2 in Kyrgyzstan. The area of 
special protected natural territories in KR increased from 4.37% in 2002 to 5.03% by 2007, 
which is conductive to enhancing mitigation factors for the consequences of climate change. In 
2000, “Issyk-Kul” biosphere territory with the area of 4,314 thousand ha, which has a status of 
protected natural territory was established. On the Kazakh part of the Tien Shan a new Ugam-
Sairam National park was organized, includes west Tien Shan reservation area including Kara 
Taus national park that has been established in the year of 2005. In Tien Shan (on Kyrgyzstan 
and Kazakhstan territories) there are 9 species of mammals, 27 species of birds, 1 specie of 
reptile and 1 fish specie that are included into the Red book of IUCN (Annex E). 
 
It should be noted that with increasing of the area and the number of SPTs in the KR the amount 
of funding from the state budget does not increase. Their material, technical and research base 
becomes obsolete and gets deteriorated, however, not all reserves and natural parks are able to 
strengthen their capacity adequately, while social and economic condition of SPT staff forces 
them to deal with other income generating activities, including illegal hunting, cutting of trees, 
collection of fruit and berries in protected areas. The activity of TSED project aimed at capacity 
building and widening coverage of special protected areas along with facilitating promotion of 
environmentally friendly methods and enhancing effectiveness of productive landscape 
management will have positive impact on biodiversity conservation in general on the project 
area. 
 
Forest Ecosystems and reforestation (relevant for the KR)
 
The forests of the KR are the property of state and form a unified State Forestry Fund (SFF), 
which includes forested areas and areas that are not covered with forest but designated for 
forestry purposes. Total area of SFF lands constitute 3,321.5 thousand hectares as of 1st of 
January 2003. Forested land constitutes an area of 864.9 thousand hectares, percentage of 
forestland constitute 4.32% from the territory of the republic. The objective of forest policy of 
Kyrgyzstan is to achieve increasing of the area covered with the forest to the level of 6% from 
total area of the country, which will make up about 1,200 thousand ha of the area covered with 
forest at the lands of SFF. 
 
The forests of the KR are composed of 4 varieties: walnut-fruit, coniferous – firry, archa 
(
Juniperus spec
.) and flood plain forests. Total resources of timber of all kinds in the KR 
constitute 28.87 million cubic meters, including: Tien Shan spruce (
Picea shrenkiana
)
–
15.35 
million cubic meters; Turkestan, Zeravshan and Hemisphere juniper (
Juniperus spec
.) – 3.78 
Page  16
m
illion cubic meters; walnut-fruit, walnut (
Juglans regia
)
–
3.76 million cubic meters; hard-leaf 
(oak, ash-tree, maple) – 1.55 million cubic meters; soft-leaf (birch, poplar, willow) – 1.19 
million cubic meters; bushes – 2,2 million cubic meters
2
.
Distribution of the areas broken down 
by species is given in Annex F, where it may be seen that shrubbery occupy the largest area 
(43.8%), conifers (35.6%), and other wood species: walnut, pistachio, apple (13.9%). Fast 
growing species such as poplar, aspen, and willow occupy the area of 12.9 thousand ha, or 1.5%. 
 
Since 1998, the KR implements the reform of forest sector aimed at the introduction of the new 
forms of forest management to achieve sustainable use of forest resources. The following forms 
were introduced in the republic: community-based forest management3, various forms of 
woodlot lease, and the procedures of transfer of some production activities to private sector. The 
National action plan for forestry development of Kyrgyzstan (NAP), approved by the 
Government of KR envisages annual planting of wood species on 2 thousand hectares of the 
territory of SFF and on 1 thousand hectares beyond SFF (on the land of AO). TSED Project 
provides forestation works at the area that is not covered with forest during 5 years, including at 
7
thousand hectares of the lands of SFF and on 7 thousand hectares beyond SFF (on the land of 
AO). This is a considerable contribution to the implementation of NAP of Kyrgyzstan, since 
during TSED project implementation period the area of forestation will be increased almost 
twice. Due to insufficient supply of firewood and timber, local population has certain knowledge 
and is rather actively engaged in cultivating fast growing (poplar, willow), draught-resistant 
(elm) and fruit wood species (apple, pear, apricot, plum) at their gardens. This fact will 
considerably facilitate the implementation of TSEDP. 
 
The lands of the state forest fund located all over the republic where there is natural forest. The 
lands adjacent to the forest and not covered with the forest are also included into the forest fund. 
The LHs are state structures located at the land of state forest fund and mainly performing 
activities on protection of the forest from illegal deforestation, fires and forest pests (forest 
diseases), on reforestation and small-scale sanitary deforestation (felling of old trees, trees 
damaged by the wind, avalanches and harmful insects). Due to the fact that various types of 
forest (spruce forest, walnut and fruit forest, pistachio, almond, juniper, flood-plain forest) 
depending on climate conditions of mountain country grow in small quantity all over the country 
(along the flood-lands and mountain slopes), accordingly, the LHs are located all over the 
country too. There are 42 LHs, 9 forest areas with independent balance, 1 forestry hunting area 
in the country at the moment (for convenience, hereinafter all of these entities referred to as 
LHs). In spring 2008 forestry enterprises (LHs, forest areas, parks) in KR planted and seeded 
forest on the area of 3,021 ha. However, it should be noted that limited financial resources of 
LHs do not allow achieving adequate level of plantation survival (more than 70%). A brief 
analysis of the main obstacles to successful reforestation activities by LHs are presented in 
Annex G
.
Altitude zoning is the main pattern that defines the distribution of soils, plants, wildlife and 
landscapes in Kyrgyzstan; detailed description is given in 
Annex H
.
The entire republic is 
potential project territory, i.e. selected for reforestation land areas are located practically in all 
regions that have different local climate conditions. In this view, and with the purpose to 
improve planning and accounting of forest plantation works it was reasonable to group the 
territories by partners participating in the implementation of TSEDP (ARIS, LHs) and by project 
wood species (fast-growing, slow-growing).

Community-based forestry is based on participatory work on forest use, forestation, revegetation by economic associations and societies, by 
families and individuals, organizationally founded based on kindred and family relations, compactly living on the territories of state forest fund 
or nearby. Community-based forestry is implemented by means of transferring of plots of forestry fund to be used on long-term basis.

The TSEDP seeks to establish fast-growing plantations, such as poplar, orchards, elm and 
willow on the area of 7920ha, of which currently and area of 6,150 ha lands that are unused and 
unsuitable for agricultural production (low-productive, marginal land) of RFL lands. Selected 
composition of species is optimal for natural and climate conditions of Kyrgyzstan, while the 
legal, institutional and social and economic conditions provide the grounds to assume that 
comprehensive support will be provided from the part of public agencies, local self-governance 
bodies and the population to forestation activity. The distribution of planned plantations broken 
down by years is given in 
Annex J
.
According to consultations with LH specialists, weeding is essential for plantation establishment 
and high survival rates of plantations. Forestry specialists reported that ideally, the practice is 
that it is required to clean the area from weeds 5 times during a season for up to 4 years. This is 
made manually. However, in practice this is made not more than 2 or 3 times due to the lack of 
funding. If there is a necessity to treat the area 5 times during a season, TESD project has to find 
the way to provide enough means for this important work.  
 
Heterogeneity of forests within the structure of species, ecological and economic meaning 
defines specificity of Kyrgyz forests and requires a special approach in realization of economic 
and protective actions in each particular forest growing zone. Effective forest protection is 
possible only under usage against pests a complex of methods, i.e. system of forest protective

ctions including different methods and tools mutually complementing and successively 
replacing each other. By principal of action and technology of application of actions this is 
forestry, physical and mechanical, biological and chemical methods.  
 
Water Resources and Water Use (relevant for component B) 
 
The KR possesses considerable water resources: about 44 km

.
Water resources are
 concentrated in the country’s mountain regions and generate 
numerous rivers flowing towards Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and 
Sindzyan-Uigur province of China.  
 
There are five main river basins in the country; they cover about 75% of the country’s territory 
and their combined volume of annual average runoff is approximately 97 percent of 
Kyrgyzstan’s total. Water from melted snow and seasonal and eternal glaciers are the main 
sources that feed the rivers. Seasonal and annual runoff fluctuations are observed in the basins 
depending on weather and climate controlling precipitation and snowmelt. The KR has 
developed a national hydrographical report under UNEP (implemention assistance of 
Johannesburg plan of implementation of 2006 – “Plans (2005) on integrated water resources 
management and water safety” (
http://www.cawater-info.net/library/reports.htm

Kyrgyzstan uses only 23% of its available water resources, of which 90% are used for irrigation. The 
area of the irrigated lands in Kyrgyzstan is estimated as 1.04 million ha, at that, 0.85-0.91 million ha/year 
are actually irrigated. Water intake from water sources of the KR makes up
 7,888 
million
 m3, including 
4,135 
million
 m3 for irrigation and agricultural use.  
 
TESDP – Analysis and Recommendations
It is envisaged in the process of TSED project implementation that forest plantations of fast growing 
wood species will be established on irrigated lands (mainly low-productive and marginal agricultural 
land redistribution fund).

For calculations the average indicator of 8,000 m3/ha per year for the timeframe of 15 years, 
was used for the southern part of the republic and average indicator of 5,000 m3/ha per year for 
the timeframe of 15 years was used for northern part of the republic taking into account of water 
losses while transportation. Annual average water intake for irrigation of plantations of fast-
growing species is expected to make up about 50 million m3 per year. About 0,09 % of water 
from total the annual river flow will be used for irrigation purposes.  
 
The WB safeguard OP7.50 requires notification of affected riparian countries if a project 
potentially affects the hydrographical properties of a transboundary river, such as Syr Darya, 
Chu and Talas. Moreover, Kyrgyzstan is required under regional water sharing treaties to 
coordinate amount of annual water intake for the plantations created under the project, with 
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan.

The c
urrent condition of irrigation and drainage systems must be characterized as unsatisfactory on 
majority of indicators. Major share of the irrigation assets is at the breaking point of deterioration, due to 
the fact that during the last 10 years irrigation infrastructure was operated practically without capital 
investments for repair and / or modernization. Thus, in project areas where fast growing wood species 
plantations are planned, which require irrigation, there likely will be the necessity to execute small 
construction works for rehabilitation, or on making small sections of irrigation network to irrigate 
plantations.
 It should be t
aken into consideration that the KR it is implementing a WB project on 
rehabilitation of irrigation networks, which aims to bring the efficiency coefficient of irrigation networks 
up to 0,7-0,8. This will significantly decrease water loss and will create added water capacities, which 
may be used for TSED project. 
 
Pasture 
 
Pastures make up 86 % of all agricultural lands in the KR and cover total area of 9.2 million ha, 
including winter pastures (2.1 million ha), summer pastures (4.1 million ha) and spring/autumn 
pastures (3.0 million ha). The rural population is heavily dependent on these pastures. 
Traditionally, pastures were used in the system of free roaming stockbreeding. During summer 
livestock grazed high in the mountains, where productivity of pastures was high. Then, during 
autumn period they moved to the pastures located lower and back to valleys for winter time. 
Currently, free roaming stockbreeding is not used as it was before due to remoteness, 
deteriorated pasture infrastructure and high transportation cost; the animals graze all year round 
at close winter pastures thus contributing to severe overuse and degradation, while the more 
remote summer pastures are underutilized. New Law of the KR “On pastures” will allow 
recommencing pasture turnover and use pasture resources more rationally. 
 
SOCIAL SURVEY 
General information
 
The objectives of the social survey conducted in selected villages in the KR and RK were the 
following: 
·
assess the relationship between natural resource use and local communities 
·
determine the importance of forest resources for livelihoods 
·
evaluate current social and economic conditions, including a baseline for poverty and 
other social and economic indicators 
·
identify environmental and social risks of project impacts 
Page  21
·
arrange consultations with all the stakeholders and communities in order to evaluate the 
opinions and recommendations of local communities on the TSEDP 
·
develop recommendations for project implementation, preventive and minimizing 
measures for potentially negative impacts. 
·
identify possible alternative types of activities for  the population to reduce poverty level. 
 
Detailed information of the social survey is described in 
Annex K
.
Methodological instruments 
of the survey included in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, expert interviews and desk 
reviews. The participants represented equally all groups of the population and the society, 
including equal gender representation, rural intelligentsia, farmers, lessees, unemployed, public 
servants, NGOs, businessmen and housewives took part in the survey. Thus, expert analysis was 
supported by the opinions expressed by the respondents during focus-group discussions and 
interviews with the representatives of local administration, researchers, LHs and national parks’ 
specialists, NGO and business representatives. 
 
The social survey results were obtained based on analysis of opinions expressed by the 
respondents during focus groups and individual interviews with the representatives of local 
administration, experts, LHs, national parks’ and reserves’ specialists, the representatives of 
NGOs and business, during the discussions at the meetings with community members.  
 
Survey’s Conclusions and Recommendations  
 
Conclusions 
 
The social survey results show understanding and concern of the local population about 
environmental problems, forest exploitation, pasture degradation, salinization and water-logging 
processes, and an increasing areas of degraded and non-arable lands. According to the study, 
each AO and Akimat possesses degraded, non-arable land unsuitable for reclamation. Further, 
the analysis indicates that poverty reduction and the provision of alternative livelihood sources 
can directly address environmental problems and promote sustainable development. Poverty is 
one of the main problems causing deforestation and forest degradation. High price for traditional 
energy sources such as coal and gas which considerably increased the demand for cheaper or 
free source, such as firewood. Lack of protection on forest plantations and orchards on former 
Kolkhozes and Sovkhozes land has lead to increased fuelwood exploitation and led to extensive 
forest degradation of forest resources.  
 
Specific outcomes and relevance for TESDP: 
·
48% of respondents from Batken, and 9-12% of respondents from Southern Kazakhstan, 
Jalalabad and Chui identified soil salinization as the most acute problem. 
·
Forest dwellers in the Walnut-Fruit Forest consider logging of the forest as the main 
problem.  
·
Resident of those settlements that are located at the territory referred to anthropogenic 
ecosystem mention salinization and water logging processes that cause full unsuitability 
of agricultural land that, however, could be successfully used within the frame of TSED 
project to create plantations of fast growing tree species. 
·
0-70% of respondents buy firewood currently. 
·
Rural people cultivating trees to satisfy their own needs for firewood and timber do not 
encroach forest resources; the more threes are grown by the villagers, the less damage 
people cause for the environment. 
·
Conflicts over natural resource use 
between rural residents mainly emerge in relation 
to pastures, water and forest. At the same time it should be noted that upon the 
implementation of proposed project the risk of aggravation of these conflicts appears. 
Page  22
T
hus, the conflicts may emerge due to expansion of the area of forest plantation, since it 
may cause certain reduction of pastures area, which will directly impact the interests of 
pasture users. There is a risk of conflict between the two main groups. This is the group 
of pasture users who are striving to increase pastures area due to the fact that from year 
to year the number of animals increases. On the other hand, there are interests of 
villagers wishing to deal with forest plantations creation. The livestock will be the main 
threatening factor for the plantations, which means that the interests of forest growers 
will be impacted too. Partially, this may also be relevant to haying. At that, as the survey 
results have shown, these are the lands in the vicinity of the settlements of common use. 
So, 
selection of land plots for forest plantations requires special grounding.
 It should 
exclude the risk of damaging anyone’s interests and conflict emergence. The search of 
compromise settlement of potential conflicts is seen in conducting wide awareness and 
education campaign, involvement of rural residents into the discussion and development 
of preventive measures, forest plantation management with the participation of not only 
groups of pasture users, but also the stakeholders interested in creation of forest 
plantations. It is also necessary to develop additional measures for pasture users – 
allocation of alternative land, arrangement of grazing on outrun pastures, installation of 
fences, provision of funding and etc. 
·
There is also a risk of conflicts due to shortage of the irrigation water, especially at those 
places where conflict level is high currently. To eliminate conflict situations under the 
implementation of proposed project it is feasible to establish public “water committees” 
composed of farmers, public associations’ representatives, NGOs and etc. apart from 
local administration representatives. 
·
The overwhelming majority of respondents sees the solution in attracting local 
communities to natural resources use management, establishment of special structures to 
coordinate activities and to develop practices of rational use of all types of resources. 
Both methods of natural resources use, and the implementation of protective measures 
for natural objects from negative man-caused impact depend on local communities. 
Involvement of local communities to nature resources management, establishment of 
the committees, which together with local administration participate in the management 
and jointly find the ways for rational use of all resources, may improve the situation. It 
is feasible to disseminate this experience for project area.  
·
To increase the number of people dealing with cultivating trees for commercial purposes. 
This business is considered profitable and very profitable by about 70-80% of the 
surveyed in Kyrgyzstan and very profitable by 87-100 % - in Kazakhstan. 
·
About 20-25% of respondents did not wish to cultivate trees due to the lack of fences. 
There are land plots, but those are not enclosed and that is why people do not want using 
them to plant trees. 
 
Recommendations 
 
According to the outcomes of the social survey it is recommended to involve local communities 
in natural resources management, to reduce potential negative project impacts; to identify 
possible alternative types of activities of the population to reduce poverty level. The following 
activities are proposed: 
 
Measures aimed at increasing the area of the new plantations 
Degraded land unsuitable for reclamation, including degraded pastures could be successfully 
used within the frame of TSED project to establish fast-growing plantations and orchards. 
 
Page  23
Actions aimed at capacity building of the LHs, rural people and natural parks 
1.  To enhance the capacity of active nursery forests of the LHs to produce bigger volume of 
the young plants.  Capacity building and training of the personnel of nursery forests and 
national parks on marketing and advertising of products are required for successful 
competitive operation of nursery forests of the LHs. 
2. 
For rural residents interested in cultivating orchards and fast-growing wood species 
plantations trainings needs to be arranged during the first year of young plants 
cultivation. This would allow to increase the number of survived young plants and to 
reduce the costs.
 
3.  To support establishment of private nursery forests of fruit and fast-growing wood 
species. Currently
 
existing nursery stock is insufficient. According to the respondents, it 
is not enough planting stock of guaranteed quality to satisfy the demand both in 
Kyrgyzstan, and in Kazakhstan.
 
The number of private nursery forests is small; currently 
there is great potential for their development. 
4.  To support planting of fruit trees and fast-growing wood species by interested rural 
population at their land plots. The data given above is evidence that upon favorable 
conditions volume of wood species cultivated in the land plots may be increased. 
5.  To reduce losses of young plants when planting (these losses make up about 50%) due to 
the lack of knowledge of planting rules for both fruit and fast-growing wood species by 
conducting special training for interested rural population. To consider features of the 
area when developing measures (salinization, closeness to the forests, level of conflicts 
and etc.). To introduce limitations for grazing in the area adjacent to the settlements for 
the owners of large number of livestock (and goats in particular). 
6. To envisage use of fencing for the new plantations. This is also an obstacle for 
afforestation and reforestation. 
 
Measures aimed at enhancing the legislation 
1. To combat illegal commercial logging through enforcement of the legislative acts 
providing for responsibility for illegal deforestation.  
2.  To involve organizations (LHs, nurseries) and law enforcement agencies to toughen 
control over deforestation and sanitary felling with the objective of further sale. 
 
Measures aimed at public involvement into the management 
1.  To involve interested rural population groups to plantation management (local jaamats, 
NGOs and etc.) 
2.   To involve the stakeholders into the measures on environmental monitoring. 
3.  To draw public attention through mass media to the problem of illegal deforestation 
(denouncing illegal deforestation in the forests and in the forest belts), to encourage 
cultivation of the young plants, plantation and etc. 
4.  To inform rural population at village meetings on the results of spontaneous felling 
monitoring and on project activity aimed at the restoration of the forests and forest belts 
and fruit trees plantations. 
5.  To develop education programs (trainings, workshops, round tables). 
 
Measures aimed at the development of new activities 
1.  To develop new activities aimed at increasing income and poverty reduction. Poor 
population is the greatest potential threat due to the fact that they use illegal deforestation 
as the livelihood  
2.  To provide young plants for planting, to advice and to facilitate sales of grown plants and 
etc. for poor rural citizens.

3. TASK and 4. TASK
Potential social and environmental impacts (positive and negative) of proposed project activities, 
including potential restrictions of access to natural resources were identified. Among other 
potential negative environmental and social impacts a possibility of negative impact from 
planting poplar is noted; in particular, almost all species of poplar are divided by sexual 
character; male poplar pollen is falsely considered as a common reason of seasonal allergy 
however according to scientists of National Academy of Science this consideration is wrong. It 
appears that seed hairs produced by female poplar make people feel uncomfortable due to the 
presence of allergenic pollen trapped in the hairs. Thus, female poplars cause allergies. 
 
Mitigation measures have been identified and developed to address negative environmental and 
social impacts, revealed for project activity that include recommendations on possible and 
economic effective measures on prevention or reducing of any important unfavorable impacts on 
environment as much as possible.  
 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS 
 
ANTICIPATED POSITIVE IMPACTS 
Improvement of SPT management and raising awareness of local population 
Dissemination of the information on the necessity and ways of biodiversity conservation will 
update knowledge of all layers of the population on importance of natural ecosystems in terms 
of enabling environmental sustainability as necessary basis of environmental and social and 
economic development. Environmental awareness will be raised, along with the knowledge on 
the ways and opportunities of various layers of the population to participate in biodiversity 
conservation. In addition, raising environmental awareness through the dissemination of 
environmental information among the population will enhance responsibility and provide 
opportunities for the staff dealing with environment protection to work with the population. 
 
Positive environmental impact will be related to improvement of protective measures and social 
impact due to creation of better working conditions. Provision of SPT with equipment and 
transport will meet the most urgent requirements of SPT and will allow improving environment 
protection in SPT and in adjacent territories. Positive impact is anticipated on the condition of 
protected natural ecosystems and its components, and in particular in terms of prevention of 
illegal grazing, po
acher’s cutting and shooting (catching) of some protected species. 
 
Improvement of SPT operation from training on management plans 
Training on preparation of management plans will allow using available SPT resources more 
rationally to effectively organize protection, identify priority objects, conduct monitoring, and 
improve SPT management. In addition, trainings will allow training SPT staff on methods of 
cooperation with local population and attracting additional investments to improve SPT 
operation. This will also have positive impact on the condition of natural objects in SPT and 
adjacent territories. 
 
Creation of habitat for biodiversity 
Restoration of natural forests will have great positive environmental impact on biodiversity 
conservation, and on stabilizing environmental situation as a whole. Newly created plantations 
will contribute to the creation of habitat for the development of biodiversity, and in particular of 
some birds’ species. Location of fast growing wood species plantations along the banks of 
watercourses (canals, small rivers and etc.) will contribute to enhancing local biodiversity. 
Page  25
Combating erosion and water use 
Restoration of forest plantations will facilitate reduction of the degree of water and wind 
erosion. Creation of anti-erosion and wind protection forest belts using ecosystem approach will 
also facilitate reduction of the rate of water and wind soil erosion, as well as water logging that 
is caused by the deterioration of drainage systems. Restoration of natural forests will improve 
general environmental situation, will facilitate strengthening of slopes, regulating and increasing 
of water content and sustainability of water bodies. Placement of fast growing wood species 
plantations along the banks of watercourses (canals, small rivers and etc.) will contribute to 
strengthening of the banks. Partial rehabilitation of the irrigation infrastructure will allow 
reducing water losses when the water is supplied for the irrigation. 
 
Stabilizing of areas with geotechnical hazards 
Forests restored on the mountain slopes will facilitate stabilizing of areas with geotechnical 
hazards, especially unstable and erosion prone slopes. Root systems of trees and shrubbery 
planted as a result of reforestation activity along with the restored grass cover will contribute to 
strengthening of the slopes, reduction of water seepage and pore water pressures, thus reducing 
erosion processes, development of ravines and formation of mud flows and landslides. This will 
significantly reduce the risk of unfavorable impacts on the productivity of adjacent lands. 
 
Climate change mitigation and carbon trading 
Reforestation and creation of fast growing wood species plantations will contribute to the 
mitigation of climate change by increased carbon sequestration through the forested areas 
created under the project. The development of carbon trading scheme will allow the generation 
additional income for sequestered carbon for the KR, specific land owners and communities. 
Income generated from sale of certified carbon in the KR will facilitate enhancing of the 
capacity of the SAEPF, AO, direct participants of the project and will be conducive to the 
dissemination of this experience in the region. 
 
Creation of alternative utilization concepts for natural resources 
The development of eco-tourism in SPT will have positive environmental impact in a view of 
regulated access, “soft”, low impact tourism and being able to use revenues to support 
environment protection activities. Additional financial means will have positive social impact by 
strengthening the SPT’s financial standing, increasing staff payments and benefits and creating 
revenues for local residents who work within the tourist service sector. 
 
Apart from financial benefits positive impact is also anticipated on the formation of 
environmental awareness of tourists and local population, on improvement of mutual 
understanding and enhancing support from the part of local residents, and improving of SPT 
infrastructure. Eventually, this should have positive impact on the condition of nature in SPT 
and adjacent territories, including a friendlier attitude of tourists and residents alike to the 
natural environment, by understanding its value as a resource / asset. 
 
The forestry project components will increase the incomes for the local rural population by 
revenues from wood and non-wood forest products to be obtained as a result of reforestation. 
The biggest social and economic benefit for local rural population is anticipated from fast 
growing wood species plantations and orchards. As a social assessment has shown, about 70% 
to 80% of rural population depend on firewood for heating and cooking. For the poorer 
segments of the rural population firewood is the main type of fuel. Average requirement for 
firewood for the households during heating period makes up about 2 cubic meters for the season. 
 
Fast-growing tree species plantations will facilitate growth of timber for the local market. This 
will determine more stable pricing for firewood, the price of which may, without the project, 
Page  26
i
ncrease disproportionally due to growing demand for this type of fuel. Local population will be 
able to buy firewood at competitive price and reduced transportation cost. In addition, the 
community may decide to sell firewood at accessible low prices for those who are in need and to 
vulnerable groups of the population, for instance, for pensioners, single mothers and mothers 
with many children and etc. 
 
With the creation of fast growing wood species plantations local timber demand on community 
level will also be met by increased supply. As social assessment results have shown, annual 
requirement in timber is more than 4 cubic meters for 40-60% of the rural residents. Much of 
this demand today is fulfilled by illegal logging in natural forests. Furthermore, skills acquired 
by locals for plantation and forestation management will increase the chance for generating 
sustainable income from wooden products for part of the population. In general, this approach 
should have favorable impact on the condition of natural forests. Positive social impact will be 
expressed in obtaining additional sources of non-wooden forest products for local population 
(wild fruit, berries, mushrooms, herbs). 
 
Creation of additional jobs 
Project implementation will cause creation of temporary jobs. During the process of 
consultations with local population many rural residents expressed their hope for creation of 
additional jobs in a view of implementation of reforestation works. Having big volumes of 
seasonal works the forestry usually hired local people as temporary workers and paid them 
either in cash, or in kind (especially with firewood). Job opportunities may emerge to enable the 
preparation of soil, perform planting works, weeding, thinning, protection and irrigation. 
 
There will likely be some gender specificity, however opportunities for women and men alike in 
work distribution: for hard labor mainly men will be involved, including works such as 
excavation, planting, planting stock preparation, minor construction works. Women may be 
attracted to the work in nursery forests, weeding, collection of non-wooden products, branches 
in the case of sanitary felling and improvement felling. Appearing of the opportunity to provide 
wooden products and an opportunity to sell this deficit good and production will create new jobs 
in rural area and will reduce the degree of forced migration. Sharp reduction of income and the 
number of jobs in rural area caused mass forced migration to the cities during the last two 
decades. 
 
Soil quality improvement 
In the long-term perspective, forest plantation will facilitate accumulation of organic 
component, improvement of soil structure and fertility. Restoration of forest vegetation 
facilitates mitigation of reduced productivity of adjacent arable lands, moistening of soil and 
creation of more favorable hydrological regime of the soil. Among potential project areas there 
are some, where high water table causes problems of water logging and soil salinization (Chui, 
Talas, Batken oblasts). Creation of fast growing wood species plantations at the areas with high 
water table and secondary salinization will lower the groundwater table, support the reduction of 
salinization, the opportunity to seed perennials in row-spacing, on adjacent areas of the most 
crops sensitive to salts, which also will prevent soil erosion and will raise agricultural 
productivity of soil. 
 
CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT ON FOREST ECOSYSTEMS 
 
Another important set of positive impacts is related to climate change. The project will facilitate 
both climate change mitigation (through sequestering carbon in the trees in the form of 
cellulose), and climate change adaptation (reduction of temperature rise impact and water 
shortage impact due to increasing of the capacity of snow and water accumulation). According 
Page  27
t
o
climate change scenarios, the following changes may be anticipated for various types of 
forests. 
 
Spruce forests  
Upper and lower limits of spruce prevalence will not change significantly. By 2100, fullness of 
the forests will increase up to 0.5-0.6. This change will not be the same everywhere, which is 
related to different moisture content and different degree of heating of mountain slopes. At the 
altitude 2,000-2,200 m with moisture deficit and considerable amount of heat, spruce will 
occupy only northern slopes, at that, the area of spruce forest will make up just 5.2% from total 
plantation area. At the altitude 2,200-2,600 m spruce forests will occupy not only northern 
slopes, but also western and eastern slopes. Here, 37.2% from total forest area will be 
concentrated. At the altitude 2,600 m and higher the density of the forests will sharply increase 
in a view of considerable increasing of the amount of heat received at these altitudes. High 
moisture content and increased amount of heat will facilitate further expansion of forest area and 
appearance of spruce at southwest slopes. At the altitude from 2,600 m and higher up to the limit 
of forest vegetation the forests will occupy 57.7% from total area. Within these altitude limits 
spruce prevalence will coincide with sub-belt of sufficient moisture. In the upper part of the belt, 
at the altitudes from 2,800 to 3,000 m, with significant forest area (27.2%) it may grow at 
shaded northern and northeast mountain slopes. Rather poor natural restoration of spruce forests 
is related to its age structure, biological features and forest vegetative conditions.  
 
Juniper forests 
As a result of rising of the sum of positive temperatures by year 2100, in the belt of juniper 
forest a shift of ecological belts of juniper forests limits may occur for each specimen of juniper 
(Zaravshan, semi-spherical and Turkestan juniper), each of which occupies its altitude zone. 
Thus, with increasing the sum of positive temperatures from 210°C at the altitude 2600 m above 
sea level to 462°C at the altitude 1600 m above sea level and with the duration of vegetation 
period from 33 to 40 days, the prevalence of all species of juniper will rise by 150-200 m 
altitude. Nevertheless, presumably the area of juniper forests by 2100 may slightly reduce in a 
view of high prevalence of diseases and low yield of seeds (non-climatic factors). 
 
Walnut-fruit forests  
At the altitudes 1,400-2,300 m in southwest region with sufficient moisture content rising of 
bioclimatic productivity may occur. In dry steppe and semi desert regions at the altitudes 800 - 
1,400 m above sea level (pistachio savanna forest and almond forest) bioclimatic productivity 
will not practically change, while under the impact of anthropogenic factor it may even reduce. 
In general, walnut could go up by 100-150 m due to the rise of a sum of active temperatures by 
4-
8°
,
increasing of moisture content and duration of vegetation period by 30 days, if to exclude 
impact of age structure (ripen and overaged forest area reaches 60%) and anthropogenic impact. 
 
Adaptation measures 
Forest ecosystems of Kyrgyzstan under the condition of anthropogenic impact and the rate of 
recreation may be preserved first of all due to establishing and expansion of special protected 
territories. By 2100, forests should be restored at the area of 340 thousand ha, which will allow 
bringing the area covered with the forest up to 6% from total area of the republic. To do so, it is 
necessary to annually plant forest specimen at the area of at least 3.4 thousand ha. With the 
objective of sustainable preservation of forest ecosystems it is necessary to arrange inventory of 
specific and intraspecific diversity based on single methodological approach and developed 
method of assessment of forest genetic resources. Poverty reduction of the population is one of 
the main ways to provide preservation of forest ecosystems, as well as improvement of natural 
resources management. Participation of local communities in the decision-making in terms of 
access to forest resources based on community forest use is required. Additionally to the 
measures on preservation and expansion of natural forest ecosystems it is reasonable to develop 
Page  28
p
ractices of cultivated plantations, for instance, industrial plantations of poplar (more than 1 
thousand ha annually).  
 
POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON PREVENTIVE 
OR MITIGATION MEASURES 
 
Potential negative impacts  
Mainly for Component 
:
1.  Impacts from small-scale construction works at specially protected natural areas 
(improvement of roads, reconstruction of buildings, irrigation constructions etc.).  
2.  Management of solid waste and wastewater  
Mainly for Component B: 
3.  Increased competition for irrigation and increased competition for obtaining access to 
irrigation infrastructure 
4.  Long-term demand for irrigation in areas with scarce water resources 
5.  Negative impact for soil quality under preparation of areas 
6.  Increase of fire hazard. 
7.  Non-regulated usage of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides 
8.  Access to pasture areas, reduction of existing pastures  
9.  Allocation of project benefits between the stakeholders 
10.Allergic risks  
11.Effects on cultural objects (nature relicts, sacred places) 
 
1. Impacts from small-scale construction works at specially protected natural areas 
(SPNA)  
 
Potential Negative Impact 
Construction works planned under the project include e.g. strengthening of irrigation 
infrastructure for the rehabilitation of on-farm (tertiary) canals and drainage systems. All 
construction works will be designed and performed according to engineering practices and 
should be guided by the relevant standards on environment protection existing in the Kyrgyz 
Republic. To perform these works heavy machinery will be required (i.e. excavator, bulldozer), 
but the works to be done at the area used for agricultural purposes will be small. The main 
effects of construction works may be the following: generation ad disposal of dredged material 
and construction debris and (i) temporary obstacles for access and traffic; (ii) obstacle to 
agricultural activities as a result of access limitations, earthworks; (iii) generation of waste, 
noise, emissions, mud and dust at the sites and roads; (iv) damage caused to trees or other 
vegetation planted along canals and (v) damage caused to nature at the sites located closely to 
environmentally sensitive zones.  
 
Due to long run effect there may be possible destruction of irrigation canals, roads and other 
engineering constructions with the roots of growing trees (this should be considered at the stage 
of designing) and intensification of transpiration from the ground waters under mass plantation 
of trees in the zone of high water table. There are possible negative environmental effects caused 
by intensification of concern factors in SPNA and neighboring zones due to tourism 
development, additional road construction, and the infrastructure (improved paths, parking lots 
and etc.).  
 
The number of tourists visiting SPNA in 2007 amounted to about 15,500 people in RK and 
20,000 people in the KR. These numbers show a clearly growing trend. Strengthening SPNA 
capacity and implementation of Small Grants Program under TSED Project may increase the 
number of tourists what may result in construction of extra roads, infrastructure, parking places, 
well-equipped paths, stopping sites, bill boards etc.  
Page  29
Recommendation on preventive or mitigation measures 
In environment assessment it is given a recommendation on adoption of combined preventive 
actions and monitoring to minimize potential effects caused with realization of construction 
works described above. First of all it is necessary that all contractors prepare plan 
–
guideline on 
environment protection especial for each object where it would be described in detail suggested 
measures for prevention or softening of construction effects on environment protection. 
Instruction on preparation of such plan – guidelines on environment protection is submitted in 
Annex L
.
Inter alia, in the plan – guideline on environment protection especial for each object, it 
is necessary to state if irrigation scheme covers area of small irrigation dam or reservoir that 
World Bank policy on safety measures is not applied. Those irrigation systems that are in the 
risk zone must follow special instructions developed for such purposes (see Annex C. OP / BP 4 
/01). These plans – guidelines on environment protection especial for each object will be studied 
by the SAEPF for meeting requirements of state ecology expertise, before financing or 
construction of this irrigation system.  
 
Secondly, all contracts for performance of construction works must meet standards on 
environment protection, health and safety required by the legislation of the KR and World Bank 
procedures. These two preventive measures will prevent any potential unfavorable effects of 
rehabilitation works. Within the framework of TSED Project implementation it is important to 
develop a tourism concept and tourism strategy in specially protected areas and to apply them 
within the framework of implementation of Small Grants Program. 
 
2. Management of solid waste and wastewater  
 
Potential Negative Impact
 
There is a possibility of increasing pollution of water resources (ground and underground), as 
treatment facilities of discharge water and sewage systems exist only in big cities (Bishkek, Osh, 
Karakol, Naryn etc). The increase in tourist numbers and the absence of sewage collection and 
treatment systems and facilities may cause pollution. Existing practice of septic tanks and 
sewage pits cannot be considered proper decontamination and processing of wastewater 
(approximately 20% of fresh water) and sewage discharges.  
 
Recommendation on preventive or mitigation measures 
In view of unavailable information related to existing and possibly increased volumes of flows 
caused by increased number of tourists in SPNA it is of need to develop a simple monitoring 
program to produce accurate estimates of waste and sewage generation and the current 
management situation. For reducing the risk of increasing pollution of water resources (ground 
and underground), concerned with increasing flow of organized tourists and absence in rural 
areas of canalization systems and treatment facilities of discharged water, it is required 
observance of existing ecological and sanitary norms and rules under commissioning of tourist 
sector infrastructures. SAEPF jointly with local AOs are realizing control and responsible for 
environment condition at corresponding area. TSED project in realization of the Component 
MGP stresses on observance of ecological and sanitary norms and rules by all potential 
beneficiaries that obligatory reflects in granting applications for realization of tourist activity.  
 
3. Increased competition for irrigation and increased competition for obtaining access to 
irrigation infrastructure. 
 
Potential Negative Impact
 
While creating plantations of fast-growing tree species in areas with existing shortages of 
irrigation water there is potential for increased competition for the irrigation and possible growth 
of competition for access to irrigation resources. The results of social survey show high level of 
Page  30
c
onflict caused by irrigation water use. There is also a risk of conflict caused by lack of 
irrigation water especially in the areas where the level of conflict is high at the moment (Talas, 
Chui, Batken regions).  
 
Recommendation on preventive or mitgation measures 
For elimination of conflict situations under realization of proposed project it is reasonable a 
collaboration with public Association of Water Users (AWU), into which in addition to 
representatives of local administration, famers, public organization participants of TSED 
project, NGOs etc should enter. After consultations with local AOs, communities and AWU, 
irrigational quotas should be identified and a sequence established for watering of quick 
growing species plantations. There will be obligatory trainings on agrotechnological skills 
relating to the selection of species within specific climate conditions and selection of 
corresponding methods under site preparation, planting, watering and taking care of them. 
Measures on mitigating the additional water demand and for ensuring sustainability will be 
jointly specified by all stakeholders in the process of identifying potential project areas.  
 
4. Long-term demand for irrigation in areas with scarce water resources. 
 
Potential Negative Impact
 
Similarly, the long-term demand for irrigation may cause or aggravate problems in areas with 
scarce water resources, in particular during periods of droughts. This in turn also presents a risk 
for the sustainability of the established plantations. 
 
Recommendation on preventive or mitigation measures 
Irrigation methods and management will be adjusted to specific climatic, hydro(geo)logical and 
soil characteristics of the site, as well as to discrete phases, such as preparation of the site and 
planting period. The selection of plant species and forest types appropriate within natural and 
climate conditions and selection of corresponding methods in preparation of the site and during 
planting will exclude long run demand for water in order to maintain plantings. TESDP Project 
will ensure with necessary training programs on agro-technologies of planting for personnel of 
forestry.  
 
5. Negative impact for soil quality under preparation of areas. 
 
Potential Negative Impact
 
Soil preparation (e.g., ploughing and furrowing) for establishment of fast growing plantations in 
the irrigated areas can lead to an increase in soil erosion. However, such effects will be short-
term and insignificant as the project envisages seeding or natural regeneration of grasses 
between rows. As in most cases project activities foresee the forestation of fast-growing species 
on already degraded and in many cases eroded land, the new ecosystem of trees and grasses will 
in fact contribute significantly to erosion control and soil reclamation in the long term. For slow-
growing species, soil preparation will be manual (e.g., digging holes) and only 4-10% of the 
total area of will be processed mechanically, while the surrounding area and existing vegetation 
will not be removed. Once during plantation establishment, the renovation of irrigation 
networks, transportation and machineries may have negative impacts on soils such as through 
compaction, however this impact is short-term and considered insignificant. 
 
Recommendation on preventive or mitigation measures 
The main measures on reducing ecological risks for negative impacts on soil are the 
minimization of soil disturbance during site preparation, by applying techniques for 
conservation tillage, the seeding of forage and permanent grass vegetation or their natural 
regeneration. Potential risks during plantation establishment should be minimized by monitoring 
and coordinating the relevant work, including the work of contractors. 
Page  31
6. Increase of fire hazard 
 
Potential Negative Impact
 
The risk of fire hazard is relevant for the of their occurrence in southern regions during hot and 
dry seasons, due to several factors, such as uncontrolled fuel-loads, careless handling of 
inflammable substances, ecological conditions etc. 
 
Recommendation on preventive or mitigation measures 
This risk can be effectively minimized by introducing and promoting fire management standards 
for plantation management and protection in the relevant areas. Moreover, the introduction of 
proper handling of wastes (e.g. kerosin) can reduce the fire risks. Based on the risk assessment 
by field groups, fire breaks and appropriate monitoring responsibilities by project participants 
will be established. In addition, training programs and awareness raising for local population can 
present an effective mitigation measure. 
 
7. Non-regulated usage of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides 
 
Potential Negative Impact
 
In order to ensure effective weed control, the TESDP allows the use of Glyphosate (Roundup) 
and Simazine in combination with manual weeding for coniferous species. Fertilizer and 
pesticide application will be limited to nursery purposes and will be strictly controlled by the 
PIU. There are risks of negative impacts on soils, water (including surface, ground, underground 
and fresh water sources) and health of rural population and staff due to improper handling and 
use of chemical substances.  
 
Recommendation on Preventive or Mitigation Measures 
The ESA recommends a combination of preventive measures, such as trainings, and monitoring 
to reduce potential negative impacts of herbicide or fertilizer use. 
 
The KR applies FAO Guidelines on usage and application of pesticides and stimulation of 
integrated control under plant pests. Department on plant protection (under the MAWCRI) 
distributed regulations on safety usage and storage of permitted for usage pesticides and 
provides services on training, licensing and regulation of pesticides usage within Stockholm 
Convention and FAO Guidelines. Due to the absence of specific national regulations, FAO 
guidelines will be applied to any project investments, within which procurement, distribution or 
application of pesticides or herbicides is envisaged.  
 
Competent and efficient application of herbicides requires training seminars for forestry 
specialists dealing with transportation, storage and application of herbicides. Training on proper 
handling, storage and application of herbicides should be provided by specialists of 
Chemicalization & Plants Protection Department under Ministry of Agriculture, Water Industry 
and Processing Industry. See training programme in 
Annex M
.
TESDP will ensure conducting of corresponding trainings for forestry personnel and project 
participants on creation of plantations of quick growing wood species, on training of integrated 
fight with pests and other progressive forestry practices. In nurseries for growing planting 
material it will be using technologies and methods excluding or minimizing potential damage 
effects on environment. For decreasing of man-hours at maintaining (weed control) of different 
types of forest plantations it is recommended by international consultants to apply herbicides 
tested in laboratories and field conditions. Such description of recommended herbicides and 
training program are given in 
Annex M
.
Page  32
P
ursuant to OP. 4.09 of World Bank upon evaluation of the project dealing with pest control the 
team carried out the assessment of legal & regulatory base of the country and ability of system 
of regulating authorities to organize and sustain a reliable, effective and environmentally 
rational pest control. Legal & regulatory framework regulating application of herbicides is given 
in 
Annex B
.
It should be noted that herbicides to be applied within the framework of the project 
belong to the Class 4 and access to their application is not restricted in the country. 
 
8. Access to pasture areas, reduction of existing pastures 
 
Potential Negative Impact
 
Although minimized by project design as well as certain provisions for social mobilization, 
selection of sites and participants, for all reforestation activities envisaged by component B and 
implementation schemes, there is a risk for negative socio-economic impacts.  
 
The TESDP will establish plantations of fast-growing species and orchards on 6,150 ha of 
irrigated lands of agricultural LRF. Land formally designated for pasture use is excluded from 
the project, and it is assumed that the irrigated lands of the LRF are currently either barren, 
degraded or used for marginal grazing, if any, by local people. Still, assuming that the LRF land 
was used for pasture and without assuming any distinction for pasture productivities (e.g., 
marginal versus high-productive pasture), the LRF area to be afforested would be equivalent to 
0.07% of the total area of pastures in the KR. Therefore the reforestation would have a 
negligible impact on the livestock sector, though it may concern the interests of local livestock 
holders.  
 
The area to be reforested during the first year of project implementation is small, and will 
therefore in combination with the experience from currently implemented pilot activities allow 
local AOs and ARIS to test and evaluate mobilization, awareness raising and other procedures 
relevant for rational land use. 
 
For activities on SFF lands, restricted access and related conflicts could present a risk for 
reforestation of informal pastures located near the forests. This in particular applies to areas that 
were deforested during World War II or constantly degraded since then, and are still officially 
designated as forests, but are now grazed informally. 
 
The results of the social survey showed pastures as the most important source for conflicts 
between rural people on natural resources. In addition during consultations within the process of 
preparation of social assessment some rural inhabitants, livestock farmers and shepherds stated a 
fear of possible access limitations to pastures. Therefore the project could cause an aggravation 
of and increased number of conflicts. 
 
Recommendation on preventive or mitigation measures 
This risk is addressed by the ARPF (see also description, and 
Annex D
). 
 
9. Allocation of project benefits between the stakeholders 
 
Potential Negative Impact
 
Social assessment and consultation with rural inhabitants show that local population not always 
trust official bodies for the allocation of rights and opportunities in natural resource use. 
Therefore the fair allocation of benefits and revenues from the project activities between project 
participants, rural inhabitants, natural resource users whose interests may be infringed by project 
and all interested parts must be regulated by a Strategy of Social Responsibility. From the 
moment of planning up to the moment of receiving finished product all the rights and 
Page  33
r
esponsibilities must be clearly negotiated between participants of the project (FH, AO, local 
communities, micro-project groups etc.). Local communities must have equal access along with 
other project participants to project funds and received benefits. For AOs, the social 
mobilization process will play an important role in minimizing any potential negative impact. 
 
Recommendation on preventive or mitigation measures 
PIU consultants should prepare Strategy of Social Responsibility explaining mechanisms 
assisting members of rural communities and in particular users of forest resources participating 
in resource management:  
·
information and training campaigns for information of rural inhabitants and users of 
forest resources that interests may be infringed by project activity on their rights in 
access to project resources and new forest plantings; this can be part of the social 
mobilization and relevant training processes; 
·
joint activity on development of plan for decision-making on issues of project resources 
usage at the local level (for example, by establishment of committees on planning of 
activities with participation of a number of interested parties);  
·
development of compensation measures on specific natural, ecological and social 
conditions of the project realization sites; 
·
approaches of joint monitoring and evaluation.
 
10. Allergic risks
 
Female poplar can store allergenic pollen in seed hairs, and therefore in some cases present a 
source of allergies. Especially in the vicinity of villages this can have a significant impact on the 
health of the local population. Taking into account the recommendations of the scientists of the 
National Academy of Science of the KR, poplar will be propagated from clones of male trees in 
order to prevent any allergies.  
 
11. Effects on cultural objects (nature relicts, sacred places)
 
Project activity is not envisaged at the locations of physical cultural heritage, natural monuments 
or sacred sites, so negative impacts are not expected. This will be confirmed by the field 
assessment, and by the social mobilization process in AOs. 
 
The Mitigation Plan is described in 
Annex N
.
ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS  
 
“No project” alternative.
 From economic, ecologic and social points the no-project alternative 
and subsequent refraining from development and re-forestation of Tien-Shan Ecosystems is not 
desirable. The high concentration of different nature ecosystems from glaciers to deserts in 
comparatively small area of Central Asia requires special attention to saving biodiversity of Tien 
Shan, which is very important from the point of agro biodiversity. Forest ecosystems play 
extremely important role in protection of biodiversity by providing habitats, reducing water and 
wind erosion, and carbon sequestration. Forest resources are very important for the economy of 
the KR and for assurance of sustainability of mountain ecosystems, thus the project is expected 
to play an important role with clear positive impacts and should be prepared and implemented. 
 
Page  34
5. TASK
Under this task ecological and social plans are developed for environmental management for 
project realization concerning monitoring of all key ecological and social indicators and 
including institutional roles, responsibilities, opportunities of participated interested parties, and 
requirements to professional experience. Ecological and social plan of management include 
guideline principals for selection and approval of sub projects with participation of construction 
works or physical interference in order to ensure ecologically safe planning, placement and 
practice of construction for project activities.  
 
Environmental Management Plan (EMP)  
 
The EMP of this chapter presents the procedure ensuring environmental prevention and 
mitigation measures identified within feasibility study what is to be duly applied during 
implementation period of the proposed project. Also EMP includes the guidelines for 
environmental selection of project investments, monitoring plan and institutional strengthening 
actions contributing to positive effects of this project. And finally EMP describes the 
institutional base for implementation of preventative & mitigation measures and proposes the 
schedule for implementation of these actions with relevant costs specified in the budget of the 
proposed project. 
 
Guidelines for Environmental Selection of Investments  
 
The objective of this Environmental Selection Guidelines is to review small infrastructure 
investments financed under TSEDP in order to reveal and settle (prevent, reduce or eliminate) 
potential negative environmental impacts. If potential insignificant risks are the case, they will 
be settled through preventative actions and simple mitigation measures identified within EMP; 
settlement of more significant impacts is likely to require review of Kyrgyz & Kazakh 
legislation frameworks and decrees and implementation of specifically identified mitigation 
measures. 
 
Types of Investments subject to environmental selection: Environmental selection involves the 
investments supporting the activities connected with immediate environmental effect, impact on 
biological communities or specific natural valuable objects (specific species etc.), or those with 
potential environmental risk. Within TSEDP such activities can be investments connected with 
the impact of small-scaled construction operations, tourism development, reforestation, 
plantations of fast-growing trees, in particular with increased competition in irrigation, increased 
fire hazard, non-regulated use of pesticides and herbicides, reduced number of existing pasture 
lands. Meanwhile, the assessment should deal with methods, technologies and location. Special 
attention is to be paid to reasonable selection of plantation plots. In order to avoid and minimize 
infringement of local public interests the selection of plots is to be based on results of 
consultation meetings with specialists (forestry experts, environmentalists), AO representatives 
as well as direct users of selected plots. 
 
Application of environmental selection criteria against investments.  
 
The criteria for environmental investments selection aim at minimization or complete 
elimination of negative environmental impacts of subprojects. They should take account of level 
of:  
·
damaged soil & vegetable cover, 
Page  35
·
impact on biodiversity (reduced factor of concern, conservation of breeding places and 
migration ways etc.),  
·
damaged surface & underground flows (conservation of river basins against pollution, 
exhaustion etc.),  
·
water supply for irrigation purposes, 
·
fire hazard, 
·
applied chemical fertilizers and pest & malady controlling chemicals, 
·
reduced pasture lands, 
·
as well as maximization for use of natural reducing capacities of environment.  
 
PIU (Project implementation Unit) review & approach.
 
The PIU will ensure an adequate review of all investments on the base of applied selection 
criteria before approval of investment implementation in the framework of TSEDP. In those 
cases where application of appropriate best practices, preventative & mitigation measures 
relating to location, design, construction or management is proposed under implementation of 
selection procedures, TSEDP will ensure presentation of adequate best practices, actions, 
measures or training as well as further implementation of those practices or measures during 
investments implementation. In those cases where pursuant to selection criteria there is a need in 
further environmental review in the framework of Kyrgyz & Kazakh legislations, the PIU
 
will 
ensure completion and submission of due forms for SAEFP consideration as well as investments 
implementation after available approval of relevant bodies. The PIU will provide a complete 
background information required to facilitate review in SAEPF.  
 
Review & approval in SAEFP. 
 
Pursuant to environmental law the projects with potential negative environmental impact should 
be subjected to SAEFP-based SEE before their implementation. The overwhelming majority of 
TSEDP investments are expected to be considered at SAEFP oblast level due to their 
insignificant volume and minimal environmental impact. In order to settle potential 
environmental impact there is a need in application of the best practices, preventative actions 
and mitigation measures identified within this paper regarding location, design, construction and 
project management. 
 
Field supervision & monitoring.
 
The PIU technical staff will conduct monitoring of all 
TSEDP
 investments to ensure 
introduction of all environmental provisions, i.e. application of the best practices, preventative & 
mitigation measures. Upon investments completion the
 
PIU
 
technical staff is to verify that 
adequate practices, actions or measures were applied or all mitigations measures required were 
implemented. The PIU
 
will conduct monitoring for compliance with environmental standards 
and include monitoring outputs in regular project reports. 
 
Page  36
MONITORING PROGRAMME 
 
In the part of overall responsibility for the PIU of TSEDP to ensure implementation of regular 
environmental monitoring & assessment of the project activities. They will include control of 
the adequacy and effectiveness of preventive actions, mitigation measures and regular 
monitoring of environmental indicators. Monitoring outputs will be recorded, analyzed and 
reported throughout project lifetime. The PIU
 
will account for results of its monitoring program 
in current project progress reports to be submitted to WB. WB supervision missions will review 
the monitoring program and its results on regular basis. Principally, the monitoring program is 
aimed to confirm overall success of project activities and will be directly focused on the areas 
and locations of the project activities. The content of monitoring will be defined by 
characteristics of the subject of monitoring. Monitoring will be included in project management 
system as feedback element with the view of adjustment of activity and identification of its 
success with regards to the project objectives. 
 
Component A.
 Strengthening of biodiversity preservation in specially protected natural 
areas and productive landscapes 
will provide control of implementation of operations specified 
within the framework of each subcomponent as well as control of environmental effects caused 
by such operations.

Component 
.
Project Management & Monitoring 
will provide control of time & 
volume terms for planned activities, compliance of expected actions with the project objectives, 
conformance to preventative & mitigation measures specified within the framework of each 
component as well as control of social & environmental effects caused by such operations. 
 
Control of conformance to preventative & mitigation measures.
 Also PIU (Project 
Implementation Unit) will be responsible for control of due implementation of various 
preventative & mitigation measures required in compliance with foregoing feasibility study in 
the framework of identified EMP (
Annex O
). It will entail organization of regular working 
missions with the view of verifying application of adequate preventative measures and/or 
mitigation measures. Annual social & economic reviews should be performed in order to control 
social outcomes and project progress. 
 
Monitoring of environmental indicators.  
 
During the whole period of TSED Project the PIU conjointly with SAEFP will perform regular 
monitoring and analysis of soil & water, vegetative resources of pasture lands in locations where 
project investment took place as well as in locations where herbicides were applied. Pursuant to 
the monitoring plan presented in 
Annex O
this monitoring will include regular analysis of: 
·
quality of water resources such as streams and rivers, surface runoff, ponds or wells in 
project locations where herbicides are applied; 
·
quality of soils especially with regard to concentration of herbicides in project areas 
where herbicides are applied, 
·
baseline and comparative measurements in areas near project locations to measure 
existing background concentrations in environmentally relevant substances. 
 
The PIU environmentalists conjointly with SAEFP and Kyrgyzgyprozem will deal with 
water/soil/vegetation sample intake in project’s target areas through exploiting field equipment 
provided by this project, they will keep records of the results and regularly report on the results 
achieved. The samples taken for chemical analysis will be sent to national laboratory. The PIU 
will analyze all data sets and issue an annual summary report on results achieved within water & 
soil quality monitoring program through providing recommendations on adequate preventative 
measures or mitigation measures in those cases when implementation of such actions is 
required. 
 
Monitoring of forest plantations 
 
Effective monitoring implemented by 
SAEFP
 and other agencies carrying out supervisory 
functions of different aspects of environmental safety (i.e. Ministry of Health, Ministry of 
Agriculture, Water Industry & Processing Industry and Kyryzgyprozem), may be a guarantee of 
minimization and liquidation of prospective negative impact caused by afforestation. These 
agencies have a limited capacity in the monitoring sphere, particularly in rural area where the 
Page  38
m
ost part of Project activity will be implemented. In this connection, monitoring of Forestry and 
Aiyl Okmotu lands allotted for plantations, that is aimed at erosion prevention is to be included 
into the monitoring of project investments providing for more productive and sustainable 
methods of plantation management. High-quality monitoring may show to what extent the 
management applied was appropriate, successful or unsuccessful.  
 
The goal of monitoring of forest plantations and fast-growing wood species is to document 
changes in soil, water and other environmental aspects. 
 
This methodology is applicable at community level. Leased forest plantations and monitoring of 
leased land plots may help to improve communities’ attitude to forest and forest plantations and 
to increase their responsibility for rational use and improvement of forest plantations. 
Communities’ inclusion into the process of reforestation and increase of forest plantations 
contributes to prevention of further deforestation and improvement of forest management in the 
Kyrgyz Republic.  
 
This Project is aimed at monitoring of plantations and proposes introduction of the checklist (list 
of check issues) with a view to simplify monitoring procedures. Additional items may be 
included into this checklist at communities’ discretion.

This Project will be directed at stimulation of potentiality of local self-government development 
in the sphere of environmental monitoring and total environmental management. In this 
connection, the Project is to ensure introduction of efficient monitoring programs in project 
investments that are financed by the Project, as well as to reimburse expenses caused by 
implementation of such monitoring. Project investments that have a capacity for significant 
environmental impact are to develop monitoring plan, as it is a constituent element of set of 
documents required for getting approval to project investments implementation. Monitoring 
results will be taken into account at considering applications for financing. Moreover, the WB is 
to conduct monitoring of project investments selection within the framework of regulating 
supervisory missions in order to identify conformity of the project investments with mitigation 
plans.  
 
6. TASK
Support in coordinating the environmental assessment within and between all relevant 
Government agencies, and in obtaining and incorporating the views of affected/beneficiary 
groups and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) through public consultations. Preparation 
of reports (EMP and ARPF) in compliance with WB standards as well as Kyrgyz & Kazakh 
ESA procedures. 
 
INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING PROGRAMME 
 
In order to ensure proper implementation of different environmental activities (preventive 
measures, monitoring) recommended in this EMP, TSEDP will assure necessary institutional 
strengthening of the PIU under SAEFP, as well as support of social coverage for environmental 
management provided to community-based institutions dealing with tree-planting and to their 
members. This institutional strengthening will include rendering technical assistance and 
training, and support to social coverage/activities on public awareness as well. Description of 
every kind of activity is provided below.  
 
Technical assistance and training
.
In order to ensure proper implementation of environmental 
activities identified by EMP, TSEDP will employ national environmentalist/ expert on 
environmental monitoring for work with EMP during the whole period of Project 
implementation. The Expert will provide technical assistance in the whole of environmental 
supervision and monitoring activities identified by feasibility study and EMP. Particularly, the 
Expert will be engaged in organization of appropriate training sessions on environmental issues 
for PIU experts of the Project working with the Project communities both in the sphere of 
increase of environmental awareness and in the sphere of strengthening environmental 
management capacity of Project staff in general. These training sessions will be directed at 
development of special technical skills necessary for implementation of environmental 
supervision and required monitoring functions. Moreover, Environmental Expert will render 
assistance in conducting activities on environmental coverage to community-based institutions 
established within framework of the Project through increase of awareness on sustainable 
plantation management practices and environmental requirements applicable to investments.  
Page  40
SAEFP capacity building. 
TSEDP will render technical assistance in order to strengthen 
institutional capacity of Forestry Department on environmental control and activities on 
monitoring of plantation management. In this regard environmental expert will provide on-the-
spot training for technic
al staff of Forestry Department‘s central & regional divisions in order to 
enable them to perform such supervision and monitoring responsibilities. If it is needed the 
supplementary technical training on implementation of monitoring and analysis will be provided 
for relevant staff.
 
Public outreach
 
and awareness.
 Also TSEDP will contribute to coverage and public awareness 
actions within target communities and will assist their institutions dealing with afforestation 
management. This support will cover performance of information campaigns: workshops with 
community-based organizations involved at the level of AO, dissemination of publications on 
afforestation management & monitoring or another social coverage and similar information 
actions. Campaign will involve all community members and include information relating to 
forest plantation activities, possible benefits and privileges for community, procedures of 
compensation in the case of their infringed interests.  
 
Work Schedule  
 
Implementation of the activities described in the EMP will begin simultaneously with project 
implementation, with an immediate review and refinement of the details of the mitigation plan, 
monitoring plan and institutional strengthening program proposed above. The PIU, with the 
support of the environmental specialist, will then ensure implementation of the mitigation and 
monitoring plans and institutional strengthening program, as appropriate given the schedule of 
forest management-related and other infrastructure investments under the project.  
 
The institutional strengthening activities, for example, will take place over the life of the project, 
on the basis of identified needs, with scheduled training for PIU environmental management 
specialists occurring early in project implementation, followed by the outreach and public 
awareness activities. The environmental specialist will be hired by the PIU on an on-demand, 
part-time basis for the lifetime of the project.  
 
The monitoring plan will be implemented throughout the lifetime of the project based on the 
schedule of project interventions with community-based forest management organizations and 
with the small-scale infrastructure investments. Periodic monitoring will be used to evaluate the 
impacts of mitigation measures and track baseline environmental conditions in the areas of 
project intervention. 
 
The proposed schedule for implementing EMP activities is shown in Table 9.

Institutional framework 
 
Responsibility for EMP implementation will be shared by the PIU and the SAEFP. The SAEFP, 
working conjointly with the PIU, will have overall responsibility for implementation of 
TSEDP 
and will ensure that the EMP is fully integrated into implementation of the project, including the 
monitoring and reporting. More specifically:  
·
The PIU will assume responsibility for (a) the design and assessment of the physical works 
in accordance with Kyrgyz environmental norms, regulations and requirements and (b) the 
physical implementation of the activities under the project. Contractors will be responsible 
for implementation of the construction works in accordance with environmental 
requirements specified in the site-specific EMPs and bidding documents.  
·
The PIU’s environmental specialist will work to ensure that all preventive actions and 
mitigation measures identified by the site-specific EMPs are undertaken in a proper and 
timely manner and will take the necessary actions to monitor their effectiveness. To the 
extent feasible, the local SAEPF staff in the project oblasts will assist the environmental 
specialist in monitoring implementation of the mitigation plan. Where it becomes apparent 
that different or additional measures are required to minimize potential negative impacts, the 
environmental specialist, with the advice of the SAEPF staff, will recommend such measures 
to the PIU.  
·
The environmental specialist will supervise all construction activities in the field for planned 
civil works and infrastructure, explain environmental management plans to contractors and 
other relevant stakeholders (e.g. local residents), illustrate environmental protection and 
mitigation measures and report cases of non-compliance to the PIU. The environmental 
specialist will also work and liaise with the responsible authorities for environment and 
construction and coordinate joint supervision efforts.  
·
The environmental specialist will also oversee implementation of the environmental 
monitoring plan specified in the EMP, ensuring that monitoring is performed effectively and 
that information is shared promptly with appropriate project and SAEPF officials. The 
specialist will package the results of the ecological and social monitoring in annual reports to 
the PIU Project Coordinator, national and local GOKR officials. 
·
The environmental specialist will directly manage the institutional strengthening activities 
recommended by the EMP, including scheduling training, overseeing the purchase of 
equipment and managing efforts to raise public awareness.  
 
SAEPF will work closely with the PIU in implementing the EMP. SAEPF, through its state 
ecological expertise functions, will be the primary monitoring agencies for TSEDP activities and 
will support the environmental specialist in the assessing the environmental impacts of project 
activities, evaluating the effectiveness of the preventive actions and mitigation measures taken 
and performing the ecological monitoring assigned. Committees will collaborate with the 
environmental specialist to ensure that environmental considerations are incorporated into their 
activities, not only in the construction/rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of forest 
infrastructure but in improved practices for forest, pasture, water and soil resources management 
among their members.

CONSULTATIONS WITH BENEFICIARIES 
 
In October-November 2008 a team of Consultants initiated consultation meetings with relevant 
stakeholders and project beneficiaries under implementation of environmental & social 
assessment: there were meetings with PIU staff, SAEFP officials and scientific associates held 
in Bishkek. During working missions within rayons of the project’s target area the project team 
had meetings with local authorities, village councils, “aksakals” councils (councils of the 
elders), staff of specially protected natural areas, reservations, national parks, local forestry 
agencies as well as with a big number of farmers and other beneficiaries. Public consultation 
meetings pursuant to EIA of the KR, EIA of the RK and WB were held in February in Bishkek 
and in Almaty. 
 
The outcome of the consultations did not indicate any resistance, negative attitude, 
dissatisfaction or other issues warranting a change in project design or implementation planning 
from the affected stakeholders and population.  
 
PROPOSED BUDGET 
 
The estimated costs of implementing the various activities specified in the EMP are displayed in 
Table 13. The costs are broken down in terms of personnel expenses (i.e. the part-time 
environmental specialist), institutional strengthening expenses (i.e. training, public awareness), 
monitoring program expenses (laboratory analyses) and equipment costs.  
 
The project should make every effort, however, to ensure that the GOKR shares some of 
the costs that support government functions (e.g. monitoring by the SAEPF). The costs of the 
EMP will be included in the total costs. No additional costs are envisaged in implementation of 
the EMP.

Annex D Tien Shan Access Restriction Process Framework 
 
The project component which is the subject of this framework is primarily the reforestation and 
carbon trading component. The reforestation and carbon trading component will afforest and 
reforest 13,950 ha of marginal land 
-
55% by communities and private investors in Aiyl Okmotus (AO) land. Reforestation 
and afforestation activities on this land will be conducted according to the principles of 
Social Mobilization which have been developed by ARIS (the Community Development 
Agency responsible for implementing this component on AO land) 
-
8%
by
private investors in State Forest Fund (SFF) land 
-
37% by State Owned Forest Enterprises or Lezkhozes in State Forest Fund land 
This framework describes how the World Bank’s resettlement policy is triggered by this 
activity, the overall objective of the framework, the justification for the framework, the process 
pursued during preparation, the process to be pursued during implementation, grievance and 
conflict resolution mechanisms, and monitoring and evaluation. The access restriction 
implications of the biodiversity component will be minimal but should a case arise where access 
is restricted as a result of these components, then the same procedures described in this 
framework would apply. 
 
Policy Trigger 
 
During the preparation phase of the project it was decided that no land currently classified as 
pasture or as arable land would qualify for afforestation or reforestation. Instead the focus is 
exclusively on marginal Lezkhoz or Aiyl Okmotus land which is neither forested, designated for 
pasture, considered arable, or under a leasing arrangement.  
 
However, it is possible that on both types of land there is informal seasonal (mostly during 
winter) grazing of livestock. As such, the reforestation and afforestation of this land may restrict 
access to pasture resources which may form a component of the livelihoods of livestock 
producers. Thus, even though there is no land acquisition, or displacement of households, 
because informal access to a natural resource (pasture) may be restricted the World Bank’s 
Involuntary Resettlement Policy (OP 4.12) is triggered.  
 
Framework Objective 
 
The objective of this framework is to minimize the risk of conflict between pasture use and 
forestry and to ensure that no individual or collective livelihood is negatively affected by the 
project. 
As such, the primary purpose of this framework will be to describe a participatory 
process for validating and identifying sites for forestation where there is no possibility of 
conflict between pasture use and forestry use.
 
The Justification for a Process Framework  
 
The Involuntary Resettlement Policy (OP 4.12) is triggered because forestation activities may 
restrict access to resources such as pasture resources for livestock producers. Project activities 
will not require or entail any land acquisition and/or physical relocation of people. In addition, 
the Strengthening Biodiversity Conservation Component does not have the objective of 
enlarging protected areas, but only to improve the management of existing ones. To address the 
risk that access to pasture resources will be curtailed, an Access Restriction Process Framework 
has been prepared. 
Page  53
Good practice has demonstrated that in the case of natural resource access restriction, the 
objectives of the policy can be better achieved through a participatory process such as the one 
outlined in this framework. This participatory process is primarily focused on the identification 
of afforestation and reforestation sites that do not conflict with either formal or informal pasture 
use. Assistance measures will only apply in exceptional circumstances where no alternative sites 
can be identified.  
 
Process during preparation 
 
During preparation a social assessment was carried in order to  
o
Identify the main social, environmental and economic benefits of the project 
identify possible social and environmental risks for the project 
o
Recommend measures to mitigate such risks.  
 
The social assessment was based on a desk study of existing documents and statistics, focus 
groups and in-depth interviews in nine villages selected for their differing social, ecological, and 
economic conditions. Among these villages a survey of 275 residents was carried out. This 
assessment demonstrates that on the whole the project’s impact will be positive, contributing to 
employment, poverty alleviation, environmental improvement, and improved access to fuel 
sources.  
 
Nevertheless, some afforestation and reforestation activities on marginal land may have a 
negative impact on livestock users through restricting their access to seasonal pastures. This was 
seen as justification for the preparation of a resource access restriction process framework. 
Another activity to be conducted during preparation is a field study exercise. This exercise will 
investigate the technical feasibility of the planting on the sites proposed. Part of the exercise was 
to determine whether or not the land is currently used for pasture.  
 
Process to be followed during Implementation  
This process framework describes the criteria and procedures to be followed under the project in 
order to minimize the risk of project induced restriction of access to seasonal pasture on 
marginal AO and SFF land. It describes a step-by-step process starting with an information 
campaign, followed the establishment of Access-Restriction Management Groups, then the 
participatory validation of sites, followed by the participatory identification of alternative sites 
and in exceptional circumstances the creation and implementation of measures to assist 
in 
improvement or restoration of livelihoods
 assistance mechanisms. The Project will explore the 
application of the ARP Framework provisionally with two pilot AOs, which have been selected 
by ARIS.  
 
Information Campaign on the likely impact of the Project 
 
This is a comprehensive campaign for all community members describing the main components 
of the project, the land it is likely to affect, and the potential positive and negative impacts. On 
AO land, village level information campaigns are already part of the Social Mobilization 
approach used by ARIS, the agency responsible for implementing this component. On SFF land, 
a
special information campaign will need to be organized either by the State-Owned Enterprise 
or Lezkhoz responsible for that land throughout the Rayon (using mass media) and in adjoining 
communities (through consultation meetings).  
 
Page  54
Establish Access-Restriction Management Groups (ARMGs) 
 
For AO land, the Local Investment Union Executive Committee (LIC) responsible for reviewing 
and processing project investments should also take responsibility for establishing these groups. 
Such groups should ideally include AO Officials, LIC Officials, Ayil Kinesh Representatives, 
pasture management committee representatives (when established), Lezkhoz representatives, 
pasture user union representatives, NGO’s and other civic organizations and vulnerable groups 
(women / young people). Similar structures should also be established for SFF land. The 
Leskhoz or State Owned Enterprise should convene these groups jointly with the AO.  
 
Participatory Validation of Sites Selected 
 
For both AO and SFF land, techniques such as participatory resource mapping should be used to 
validate that the sites selected do not conflict with formal or informal grazing. The outputs of 
this process needs to be formally documented in a written report (which would include visual 
aids such as maps) which would be transmitted to the relevant PCU and PIUs. On AO land such 
techniques will be applied in the early stages of a specially tailored Social Mobilization Process. 
However, Lezkhoz staff will also benefit from training in these techniques so they can conduct 
similar exercises on SFF land. 
 
Participatory Identification of alternative sites 
 
If it transpires that there is a conflict between pasture use and plans for afforestation and 
reforestation the ARMGs for both AO and SFF land should determine whether or not this use 
occurred before or after the field study exercise conducted during the preparation phase. The 
field study exercise will represent the cut-off date for identifying project affected persons 
(PAPs).  
 
If pasture use pre-dates the field study exercise, then every effort should be made to identify 
alternative plots for afforestation and reforestation where there is no conflict between pasture 
and forest use. This needs to be a joint exercise between the ARMGs (responsible for 
participatory resource mapping) and a field study team (to determine the technical feasibility of 
planting in these new sites). Again, this process needs to be documented in a report format that 
can be transmitted to the relevant PCU and PIU.  
 
Agree and Implement Measures to 
assist in improvement or restoration of livelihoods
 
As a last resort, if there is no alternative sites that can be identified, the ARMGs will have to 
determine whether or not 
 measures to assist  in improvement or restoration of livelihoods 
will 
be provided to informal users affected, and what form this assistance should take. This 
determination of whether or not assistance should be provided and the form it should take 
should be done in consultation with the relevant Project Coordination Unit and Project 
Implementation Unit. 
Measures to assist in improvement or restoration of livelihoods
 that might 
be considered as a last resort include the following: 
(a)  the provision of livestock forage for the duration of the project,  
(b)  priority status for receiving benefits from the forest e.g. temporary employment, 
fuelwood, grazing, non-timber forest products.  
(c)  the provision of forage seeds and fertilizer to improve communal pasture land in 
proximity to settlements.  
(d)  the option of leasing alternative pasture sites along in combination with other forms of 
assistance e.g. the provision of livestock forage, provision of seeds and fertilizer to 
improve the pasture, as well as priority status in receiving benefits from the newly 
forested land. 
Page  55
Grievance and Conflict Resolution Mechanism 
A
pro-active approach should be taken to avoid conflicts before they begin. This might involve 
(a) widespread disclosure of project information and on the role and responsibilities of the 
ARMGs (b) clear eligibility criteria for 
measures to assist in improvement or restoration of 
livelihoods 
under the process framework (c) clear terms of reference for the stakeholders 
involved in the ARMG (d) continued information campaigns on the benefit of the project and 
the importance of afforestation and reforestation efforts.  
 
If conflicts do arise, the ARMG needs to organize a meeting with the affected party to try and 
work out a satisfactory solution. If the solution is not satisfactory to the party involved, then the 
relevant PIU will be responsible for convening and moderating a meeting between the affected 
party and the members of the ARMG. Both the ARMG and the PIU are obliged to keep records 
of all decisions made regarding compensation claims and complaints relating to compensation 
procedures.  
 
Monitoring and Evaluation  
Monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of this process framework will be the 
responsibility of the relevant regional project coordination unit. If necessary, some monitoring 
and evaluation functions could be contracted out to a third party such as a specialized private 
firm or non-governmental organization with expertise in this topic (land use, pasture 
management, sustainable livelihoods).  
 
PIU representatives should conduct visits to a sample of sites selected for afforestation and 
reforestation in order to determine the level and nature of informal grazing that is taking place 
prior to project implementation. PIU representatives should also conduct annual consultation 
meetings in a sample of communities to determine the level of satisfaction at the village level 
with the implementation of the process framework.  
 
Relevant quantitative data on the process framework (number of persons affected, level of 
impact, type and amount of compensation provided, duration of compensation) should be 
communicated to the PIU on a biannual basis. As part of the social mobilization process, 
village-based participatory monitoring and evaluation is also envisaged, and will play a role in 
monitoring the implementation of the process framework.

Annex G Analysis of drawbacks when creating forest plantations 
 
When planting on the lands of SFF monocultures are being created, while mixed cultures are 
created rarely. Consumption of planting stock depends on conditions of each region, and in 
average in plain zone makes up about 3 thousand pcs. per 1 ha and from 4 thousand pcs. to 6 
thousand pcs. per 1 ha - 6 min psc. This amount is overestimated. Forestry specialists plant 
bigger amount of planting stock to enable high degree of plantation preservation. For example, 
in plain zone, according to current global practice, it is enough to plant 1000-15000 psc. per ha 
of poplar, while in mountain zone - about 1000-2000 of seedlings of, for instance, spruce, pine 
and other conifers.  
Maintenance should be provided in created forest during 5 years, which includes manual and 
mechanized care as well as irrigations in plain zone. Often due to the lack of funds maintenance 
is not provided, which significantly impacts establishment of forest species. All costs related to 
the creation of forest specimen are not funded from the state budget at the moment, but rather 
are provided from the own funds of the LHs. Average cost of 1 ha of forest specimen makes up 
from 800 
–
to 2,500 soms depending on the region and method of creation. This amount 
includes preparation of the soil and seeding or planting of forest specimen, i.e. the cost of 
planting stock and seeds is not included. Due to financial constrains during recent years 
inadequate attention was paid to reforestation activity, including cultivation of standard planting 
stock in the LHs of the republic. After the disintegration of the USSR the LHs of the KR used 
fertilizers on a very limited basis, this are mainly organic fertilizers used in nursery forests. For 
quality creation of forest specimen and cultivation of standard planting stock the LHs of the 
republic should apply nitrogenous, potash and other fertilizers. Irrigation water is supplied on 
paid basis. Irrigation is made using small canals (aryk), the condition of the irrigation network is 
poor. 
Coming from agro technical requirements for creating sylvula, the LHs of the KR 
annually need about 50 mln. soms. Forest resources are very important for Kyrgyz economy and 
for the sustainability of mountain ecosystems. So, reforestation and improvement of forest 
management are important economic and socials tasks for the government of the Kyrgyz 
Republic. However, efforts of the government in terms of forest development are not sufficient. 
Intensive use of forest resources of Kyrgyzstan caused acute misbalance of forest ecosystems, 
and as a consequence, loss of biological sustainability of plantations. This became the reason for wide 
spread pathological occurrence in the forest, including mass damage of plantations by insects and 
worsening of its sanitary condition. The same situation is observed in the south of the republic in walnut-
fruit forests and in spruce and flood plain forests in the north.  
Especially valuable species of walnut-fruit forests - walnut (
Juglans regia L.
)
and pistachio (
Pistacia 
vera L.
)
are considerably damaged by pest insects that reduce harvest of nuts up to 20-60%, while during 
low-yield years 
–
up to 90%. In addition, there are moving centers of mass reproductions of gypsy moth 
(
Limantria dispar L.
)
here that exist for more than 50 years already. Pistachio, wild apple (Malus 
kirgisorum Al. et An Theob.), species of Crataegus (hawthorn), Sogd plum – cherry-plum (Prunus 
sogdiana Wass.) suffer from this insect significantly. The latter in addition, has been considerably 
damaged by plum scale (
Sphaerolecanium prunastri Fonsc
.) for the last two decades, while plantations 
of hawthorn suffer from periodical outbreaks of mass reproductions of cherry saw-fly (
Caliroa cerasi L.
). 
Semenov’s mapple (
Acer semenovii Rgl.
)
and Turkestan mapple (
A.turkestanicum Pax.
)
are significantly 
damaged by geometer (
Erannis defoliaria Ch.
). Periodically, during 3-4 years those completely shed 
leaves. 
There is unfavorable situation in flood-plain forests, where various species of poplar and 
willow are mainly growing. During the last 10-15 years catastrophic drying of willow is 
observed in Kochkor and Rybachinsky LHs located in Chu River flood plain. Forest pathology 
surveys conducted during 1994-2008 revealed centers of willow cicada (
Aphrophora salicina 
Goeze
). In addition, high prevalence of suctorial insects - louses (
Aphidinea
)
and coccidis 
(
Coccinea
)
is reported. Due to mass reproduction of these pests willow in the flood plain dried 
at the area of more than 100 ha. There are the same upset flood-plain plantations in Tyup 
forestry. At the territory of Jergalan forestry (Karakol forestry) and in Kochkor forestry there are 
Page  61
c
enters of mass reproductions of several species of geometer (
Geometridae
)
gnawing away 
leaves of Chinese elm
–
Ulmus pinnato-ramosa Dieck. (karagach). In Chui forestry and in the 
National park “Kemin” in 50-year old introduced Siberian lurch (Larix sibirica Ldb.) the centers 
of mass reproduction of lurch moth (Coleophora sibirica Falk.) is reported. The outbreak lasts 
for 7 years already. Drying of trees is observed.

Annex H. Vertical zoning and landscape types. 
 
Vertical zonation is a main regularity identifying distribution of soil, flora, fauna and 
landscapes in Kyrgyzstan. There are four main types of vertical zonation: 
northern-Tien-Shan 
type
,
that is peculiar to northern KR rayons with lower cold-temperate vertical zonation; 
southwestern-Tien-Shan type
,
that is peculiar to Talas and Fergana ranges with transitional 
subtropical environment; 
internal-Tien-Shan type,
 that has specific territory surrounded by the 
ranges of mountains and located at high altitudes under dry climate conditions; and 
Turkestan 
type
,
that is peculiar to the southern ranges of Kyrgyzstan with peculiarities of subtropical 
landscapes.  
 
Northern Tien-Shan  
 
Lower zone 
of
northern-Tien-Shan type of vertical zonation is presented by piedmont 
semideserts located at the height up to 900-1200 m. Sloping plains with deep detrital cones 
prevail within the landscape. Soil is sierozomic. Natural land cover is usually negligible and 
consists of wormwood, mat-grass and ephemers. In early spring ephemers create a low green 
herb layer and in early summer they fade. There are small forests consisting of poplar and 
willow, brushwoods called as “tokoi” within overflow lands. There are some places of 
groundwater discharge forming swamp lands.  
Next zone – 
mountain & steppe zone
 – occupies foothills and low-hill terrains with a 
height up to 1500-1800 m. Dry steppes with mat-grass, fescue grass and wormwood at mountain 
light-chestnut soil prevail within lower belt. Upper belt is occupied by fescue- & mat-grass 
steppes at mountain liver-coloured and chernozem soils. Cropping capacity of the steppe 
herbage is 10-12 centners/ha of dry mass what contributes to their wide use under late-spring 
and summer pastures.  
There is a 
forest-meadow-steppe zone
 at the height from 1400-1500m to 2500-2800 m. It 
occupies medium mountains with steep lands and gorges. Meadow steppes with mountain 
chernozem soil, brier & barberry shrubs and leaf forests of apple trees, dried apricots and aspen 
trees are peculiar to lower belts of this zone. Coniferous forests consisting of Tien-Shan fir and 
Semenov’s silver fir prevail in the upper belts of the zone. Forests are mainly confined to valley 
sides and northern slopes of the ranges. Altogether fir forests occupy 12% of KR forest area.  
Plenty feedstuff, conditions for taking shelter, moderate climate are favourable base for a 
big number of gnawing animals, hoofed mammals, predators and birds. Brown bear, lynx and 
wild boar are found here. The upper belt of forest zone is combined with sub-alpine meadow 
vegetation. Trailing shrubbery is found here as well. At large forest-meadow-steppe zone 
combining various vegetation species is of high aesthetic value. 
Zone of Alpine meadows & meadow steppes
 is at the height from 2600-2800 m. It 
occupies the upper belts of the ranges, head rivers with ancient-glacial relief forms. Rocks are 
usually found there. There are three belts within this zone – sub-alpine, alpine and subnival 
belts. Sub-Alpine meadows are tallgrass and rich in species composition. Alpine meadows are 
characterized with sort grass. Fragmental development of land cover is usual for subnival belt. 
Large areas are occupied by rock outcrops, tumble of lichen-covered rocks. Clumps of alpine 
vegetation are seldom found there. Soil is lithogenic and usually it has a high concentration of 
crushed stone. 
The upper belts of the ranges at the height from 3600-3800 m are occupied by 
nival-
glacial zone
 – zone of permanent snows, eternal ice and rocks. There are only lithophilous 
lichen and algae on stones.  
 
South-western Tien-Shan  
 
Page  63
S
outh-western Tien-Shan belt of vertical zonation is confined to the boundary with sub-
tropical belt and therefore is different from the northern-Tien-Shan one especially in the lower 
layers. At the foothills of Western Tien-Shan there are widely distributed semideserts with 
prevailed ephemers and ephemeroids within common sierozems at the height where they are 
transferred into ephemeroid quack- & blue-grass communities with tall-grasses on dark 
sierozems. In spring semidesert vegetation blossoms out but then fades very soon and semidesert 
obtains a yellow-grey coloration. Pistachio, common almond and dense clumps of bushes can be 
found in some places.  
Leafed forests prevail in 
medium-mountain & forest-meadow-steppe zone,
 fir forests and 
silver fir forests occupy a small area within the upper belt of this zone. The peculiarity of this 
zone is a compound combination of varieties of meadow steppes, archa thin forests, walnut and 
fir forests, clumps of bushes. Just at that spot, there are basal areas of unique old-growth walnut 
forests located at the height of 1500-2800 m of western and southern slopes of Fergana and 
Chatkal ranges. Up to 130 species of trees and shrubs including European walnut, pistachio, 
almond, pear, apple and other species are found in theses forests. Forests are notable for 
multilayer state and various undergrowth shrub layers. Black & brown soil is formed under 
walnut forests.  
Either 
dark coniferous forests 
or
juniper stands 
are usually take place above the belt of 
walnut forests. It is important to note that juniper is widely distributed throughout the Kyrgyz 
Republic. Juniper forests of tree-like types 
–
Turkestan juniper, hemispherical juniper, 
Zeravshan juniper, and more rarely Talas juniper – are found at wide altitudinal belts at a height 
of 1200 - 3000 m and occupy more than 40% of all forests in Kyrgyzstan. Mostly they are dry, 
lighted, relatively stunted forests that often pass to the open woodland. Juniper elfin woods 
scattered among steppe and meadow vegetation are formed at forest line.  
 
Internal Tien-Shan 
Desert and steppe zones 
prevail in spectrum of vertical zonation of Internal Tien-Shan. 
Here, at the height of 1500 m peculiar stone deserts with open vegetation are spread. Higher, 
large areas are occupied with dry and true steppes in which fescue, feather grass and sagebrush 
prevail. Mostly they occupy middle-mountain areas. Soils of these steppes are light-chestnut thin 
soil and dark-chestnut soil.  
Mountain meadows and meadow steppes occupy large areas in this spectrum of vertical 
zonation. Fescue, feather grass and different sedges prevail. Saz-meadows transferring into bogs 
in some areas are typical for overflow lands river valleys. Meadows, meadow steppes and 
steppes serve as good summer pastures – djailoo. Many of these pastures are considered one of 
the best pastures in Central Asia.  
High-mountain meadows and meadow steppes are often substituted by peculiar 
landscapes of cold high-mountain desert. Short vegetation period, constant frosts, strong winds 
of this area impede development of vegetation cover.  
Cold desert is characterized with high-mountain takyr-like soils. Deserts are located at 
the most severe areas of szyrt plain – peaks and windward slopes of coteaus. Lower and wind-
protected areas are covered by sedge and meadows. Stony tundras with open vegetation are 
located above the high-mountain deserts. Nival and glacial landscapes occupy large areas in the 
spectrum of Internal Tien-Shan. 
 
Turkestan zone  
Mountains of Turkestan zone of Kyrgyzstan have much in common with South-western 
Tien Shan. In this area lower belt is occupied with subtropical semideserts of piedmont plains 
and adyrs with ephemeral and sagebrush-ephemeral vegetation on grey desert soils. At higher 
areas they are replaced by subtropical tallgrass steppes in which pistachio, bushes, particularly 
pearlbush and brier are often found. As opposed to Western Tien Shan forest-meadow-steppe 
zone does not have dark coniferous forests, and juniper forests are widely spread.  
Page  64
D
egradation of mountain landscapes is noted due to their wide use as pastures. This is 
evinced in impoverishment of vegetation species composition, appearance and prevalence of 
weed and venomous species, reduction of yields, appearance of denuded soils, erosion scours 
and hollows. Activation of exogenic processes, that often have a disastrous character 
–
mudflows, avalanches, landslides, is also noted.

Annex K. Social component 
 
Social assessment based on social survey results  
 
1
Tasks and objectives of the survey 
The objective of this study is to perform environmental and social assessment of current 
environmental situation, problems of nature management by local communities, to determine 
importance of forest resources for the households and to analyze forest resources users in each 
target settlement, along with the identification of possible alterative types of activities of the 
population intended to reduce the level of poverty. 
Tasks: to identify environmental and social risks of proposed project impacts and to establish a 
baseline for poverty along with the relevant social and economic indicators, to determine the 
measures for prevention, liquidation or minimization of any assumed negative impacts.
 
2. Methodological instruments of the survey 
 
1.  In-depth interview with community members. 275 respondents living in rural settlements 
of proposed project area of Tien Shan Ecosystem Development Project were surveyed. 
2. Focus groups. Focus group discussions with the representatives of stakeholders, 
including the presumably project impacted representatives of farms (men and women), 
the representatives of local administration, non-governmental organizations, science, as 
well as business entities were conducted. 8 focus groups were conducted with the 
villagers of Chui, Talas, Issyk-Kul, Jalalabad, Batken, Almaty and South-Kazakhstan 
oblasts. 
3.  Expert interviews. 35 interviews were conducted with the representatives of ministries, 
agencies, international organizations, local administration, scientists, forestry, national 
parks and reserve area specialists, NGO and business representatives. 
4.  Analysis of the documents. Study of statistical data obtained from ayil okmotu in KR, 
akimats in the Republic of Kazakhstan, ARIS study results and the results of 
implementation of transboundary project of WB on biodiversity conservation in Western 
Tein Shan. 
5.  Desk study. It was conducted to study social and cultural and institutional problems in 
the field of forestry of the Kyrgyz Republic. 
 
Data collection  
Collection of baseline data for the study was performed from October 23 to November 20 2008. 
 
3. Topics of the questions  
 
Familiarization meetings preceded the survey of the villages. Those were aimed at the 
familiarization of local public administration (aiyl okmotu), rural leaders and the population 
with study tasks and objectives and at the discussion of local problems along with the 
identification of possible ways of addressing those. The range of concrete issues to be discussed 
during focus groups was defined. Assessment of willingness and ability of the population to 
perform certain activity on the transformation of the economic or environmental situation was 
made. The attitude of local population to the proposed TSED project, potential risks and 
mitigation measures were determined.  
 
4. Qualitative and quantitative composition of the participants 
 
Page  67
A
pproximately equal representation of men and women was observed in almost all groups. The 
respondents represented all groups of the population and the society. The representatives of rural 
intelligentsia, farmers, lessees, unemployed, public servants, NGOs, businessmen and 
housewives took part in the survey. Thus, expert analysis was supported by the opinions 
expressed by the respondents during focus-group discussions and interviews with the 
representatives of local administration, researchers, LHs’ and national parks’ specialists, NGO 
and business representatives. 
 
Territorial distribution of the respondents was the following: the largest number of respondents 
was observed in Batken oblast – 20.4%, while the least number – in Almaty oblast (Kazakhstan) 
–
5.8%. 
Diagram K1 
 
5. Territorial features of settlement sampling 
 
The project area is characterized by the diversity of natural and anthropogenic conditions, so for 
in-depth study of the range of possible conditions of project implementation village sampling 
was made based on natural and territorial features. 
 
The settlements that represented the following were covered with the survey: 
 
1.   Different environmental conditions,  
2.   Areas representing various rates of precipitation (from 200 to > 1000mm per year), 
3.   Areas that are of great interest from the perspective of environmental safety,  
4.  Areas with different degree of economic development,  
5. 
Settlements located near protected areas, 
6. Settlements located in the areas with different degree of degradation of the 
environment. 
 
The villages selected for the survey are located within project area and in accordance with 
administrative division belong to Batken, Issyk-Kul, Jalal-Abad, Talas and Chui oblasts of the 
Kyrgyz Republic, as well as to South-Kazakhstan and Almaty oblasts of Kazakhstan (Table 1).

Contacts with local authorities were established in each settlement, and meetings with local 
residents, NGOs and rural communities were conducted. Tasks and objectives of the project in 
general and social and environmental survey in particular were explained during these meetings.  
In each surveyed settlement the information was collected that included some aspects of nature 
management and related environmental problems. 
The process of discussions revealed understanding and high interest of the population in TSED 
project implementation. As the results of social survey have shown, rural population supports 
TSED project with enthusiasm, and would like to have an opportunity to cultivate fast growing 
wood species and fruit trees at their land plots and at the land adjacent to their farms within the 
frame of the project. This support, and especially the one provided from the part of poor 
population, will facilitate employment, poverty and migration reduction, and, undoubtedly will 
allow reducing the volume of illegal cutting.
 
Assessment of forest plantation condition  
 
To evaluate the condition of forest protection plantations: forest belts along the roads, shelter 
belts and garden-protection belts, as well as forest plantations on the banks of the rivers and 
water bodies, the respondents were asked to answer the relevant questions. Thus, overwhelming 
majority of the respondents in the villages of Chui oblast (61 - 74,2%) reported about worsening 
of the situation; In Talas oblast 
–
80.8%, in Issyk-Kul oblast – 74.3%. Only in Jalal-Abad oblast, 
Kyzyl-Tuu village, where with the support of Small Grants Program of the project on 
conservation of biodiversity of Western Tien Shan plantations of fast-growing wood species 
provided improvement, worsening of the situation was reported only by 41.8% of the 
respondents. Reduction of forest plantation areas was reported by 40 to 50% of respondents in 
Kazakhstan. In Kyrgyzstan, excepting Batken oblast, where the respondents reported about 
increase of forest plantations area (62.5% of surveyed), worsening of the situation with forest 
plantations was reported by the respondents of all regions (72 – 93.5% of respondents). 
 
Page  69
Assessment of pastures condition  
 
58.9% of surveyed respondents from Min-Chinar village, Batken oblast, reported about 
improvement of the situation with the pastures. Positive opinion was expressed by the 
respondents from Kozychak village, Talas oblast - 65.4% of respondents; Grigorievka village, 
Issyk-Kul oblast 
–
68.6%, Kyzyl-Tuu village, Jalal-Abad oblast - 69% and in South-Kazakhstan 
oblast. Overwhelming majority of the respondents in Chui oblast, in the villages Baitik – 81.3%, 
Ken-Bulun – 78.6% and Predtechenko – 59.3%, reported about worsening of the situation.  
Sharply reduced number of livestock in the republic occurred recently did not resolve 
environmental problems related to grazing of animals on pastures. Only remote outruns were 
released from excessive load, where small farmers did not migrate. Livestock owners do not 
have an opportunity to take their animals to remote outruns in a view of the lack of 
transportation means and funding. All animals are kept at spring-autumn pastures located near 
the settlements, which at the moment experience much heavier overgrazing than before. This 
disproportion of pastures operation causes further degradation of those pastures that are located 
near the settlements. As the experience of the implementation of Small Grants Program (SGP) 
of the project on biodiversity conservation in Western Tein Shan shows, involvement of local 
communities to pasture management along with establishment of rural pasture committees that 
would participate in the management together with local administration to join their efforts to 
find the ways of rational use of all pasture resources may improve the situation. It is feasible to 
disseminate this experience to the project area. Land of degraded pastures could be used for 
reforestation and for creation of fast growing wood species plantations.
 
Use of energy sources 
 
Energy sources for heating and cooking 
 
Practice of various energy sources use for heating and cooking depends on the region. From 
55.6% to 65.6% of the respondents in three villages of Chui oblast use power more often, while 
from 58.1% to 66.7% of respondents use firewood. In Talas oblast firewood is used more often 
by 84.6% of respondents, while pressed dung – by 50% and other sources – by less than 50%. In 
Issyk-Kul oblast coal is used more often by 88.7% of respondents, while firewood – by 71.4%. 
The highest level of firewood use is reported in Jalal-Abad oblast – 100%, where poverty level 
is the highest. High level of firewood consumption was reported in Batken oblast – 76.8%, gas – 
53.6% and other sources made up less than 10%. In South-Kazakhstan oblast firewood is used 
by 93.8% of respondents, while pressed dung – 87.5%, coal – 50% and gas - 18.3%. In Almaty 
oblast coal is used by 90.9% of respondents, power, pressed dung and firewood – by 36.4% and 
gas – by 9.1%.  
Thus, the results of social survey have shown that in all oblasts firewood is preferable type of 
fuel, excepting Issyk-Kul and Almaty oblasts, where coal is used most of all.  
 
Firewood stocking by the households 
Survey results have shown two leading trends in the practice of firewood stocking by Kyrgyz 
citizens. The first group of respondents stocks firewood on the land adjacent to the farms and 
other possible places and thus has free source of heating. The second group has to buy firewood 
at the markets. 
In Chui oblast, overwhelming majority of the respondents buy firewood (59.3% to 83.9%). 
In Talas oblast firewood stocking is made from two sources. 61.5% of the population cut trees, 
while the same number of people (61.5%) purchase firewood. The situation is about the same in 
Issyk-Kul oblast. People stock up firewood in the gardens – 45.7% and buy – 77.1%. There is 
different situation in Jalal-Abad oblast, where people stock up firewood in the forest – 70%, and 
buy – 53.3%. Less firewood is stocked up in Batken; 21.4% of respondents in Batken oblast buy 
Page  70
f
irewood, 23.2% stock up firewood in the forests, 21.4% stock up firewood in forest belts and 
35.7% - in the gardens. In Almaty oblast -12%, and in South-Kazakhstan 
–
10%, respectively. 
 
Firewood stock up with the purpose of further sale remains beyond the field of vision being 
about 60 -70% of all firewood used by the respondents for heating and cooking. Sale of 
firewood became a livelihood for certain category of rural population. Arrangement of trees 
planting for this category of rural citizens would allow reducing spontaneous deforestation and 
providing livelihood for these people. 
 
Diagram K2.
 
Distribution of the respondents with different income buying firewood 
 
Volumes of firewood and timber use 
 
To evaluate annual consumption of firewood, the respondents were offered a scale that measures 
firewood consumption in cubic meters. In Chui oblast, from 21.9% to 45.2% of the respondents 
stock up in average 2-4 cubic meters of firewood. In Talas oblast – 34.6%, in Issyk-Kul oblast – 
37.1%, in Jalal-Abad oblast 46.7% and in Batken oblast – 37.5% of respondents stock up 0-2 
cubic meters. In Kazakhstan, 100% of surveyed respondents stock up from 0 to 2 cubic meters 
of firewood. 
To evaluate annual consumption of construction timber, the respondents were offered a scale in 
cubic meters. The volume of construction timber is higher than the volume of firewood used, 
according to the survey results. In Chui oblast from 11.9% to 19.4% of surveyed respondents in 
average stock up more than 4 cubic meters of timber. In Talas oblast – 53.8%, in Issyk-Kul 
oblast 17.1% of respondents stock up 0-2 cubic meters, in Jalal-Abad oblast 46.7% of 
respondents stock up 0-2 cubic meters. While in Batken oblast – 14.3%. In Kazakhstan, to 
satisfy the demand for timber, 14% of the respondents stock up 0-2 cubic meters, while 40% 
need 2-4 cubic meters, and 40-60% of surveyed respondents need 4 cubic meters. 
Thus, the survey results have shown that high prices for coal and gas make these energy sources 
unaffordable for many rural residents, so there is growing demand for firewood for heating and 
cooking. 
Social survey and individual interview results have also shown that the demand for construction 
timber grew up. 
 
The main problems hindering increasing of forest plantations area 
 
Page  71
T
he
results of social survey have shown that expensiveness of traditional fuels (coal, gas and 
power) caused the use of more accessible fuel, such as firewood. Not protected forest shelter 
belts, gardens of former kolkhozes and sovkhozes have become a place of illegal firewood 
stocking during recent years, in this view, their condition got deteriorated almost everywhere. 
The demand for firewood used for heating and cooking grows. The demand for timber for 
construction also grows. 
The main reasons that do not allow to widely expand forest plantation area on the lands that are 
not used for agricultural crops cultivation are the following: lack of spare lands, lack of funding 
for long-term investments, problems with purchasing young plants, lack of knowledge, lack of 
irrigation water, lack of fencing for plantations, growth of the number of livestock. 
 
To identify the most important problems hampering expansion of forest plantations area, the 
respondents ranged the problems from proposed list for importance. 
To identify the problems, respondents were offered 7 main problems hindering expansion of 
forest plantation area. 
1.   Lack of spare lands 
2.   Poverty of the population 
3.   Problems with purchasing young plants 
4.   Lack of knowledge 
5.   Lack of irrigation water 
6.   Lack of fencing for plantations 
7.   Growth of the number of livestock 
 
Based on survey results, several main problems hindering expansion of forest plantations area 
may be identified.  
 
Lack of spare lands 
 
According to survey results in Chui oblast, 40.6% of the respondents of Baitik village reported 
about the problems related to purchasing of the young plants as the main problem; and 48.1% in 
Predtechenko village reported about the problems with purchasing of the young plants. 51.6% of 
respondents in Ken-Bulun village reported about the lack of spare land. The lack of spare land 
was reported as the main problem by 53.8% of respondents in Talas oblast, by 48.6% of 
respondents in Issyk-Kul oblast, 46.7% - in Jalal-Abad and 48.2% - in Batken oblast. In South-
Kazakhstan oblast 
–
50%, in Almaty oblast – 87.5% from total number of respondents.  
However, effective and proper use of the land adjacent to the farm, the land unfavorable in land-
reclamation sense and rational selection of wood species would allow increasing plantations 
area. According to survey results, from 31.3% to 63% of surveyed respondents in Chui oblast 
stock up firewood and timber in the gardens, 61.5% - in Talas oblast, and 45.7% - in Issyk-Kul 
oblast, 35.7% - in Batken oblast, while 13.3% – in Jalal-Abad oblast and in South-Kazakhstan 
oblast – 87.5%, in Almaty oblast – 54.5% respectively. The given data is evidence that under 
favorable conditions the volume of wood species grown at the land plots could increase. 
The lack of spare lands could be compensated due to unused lands. It is required to conduct 
analysis of land resources available with AO that were not transferred to private property after 
the privatization (land shares). Rural residents have two options of obtaining AO lands for 
growing trees. 
The first option is to obtain the land from ALRF fund having a status of permanent plantations. 
However, not all AO have such a fund. These lands could have been transferred to the villagers 
on competitive basis. The form of land transfer should be arranged both on individual, and on 
group basis. This would considerably increase land resources intended for trees cultivation. 
Another option is to develop non-productive lands. In this case rural residents will obtain 
additional land plots. In both cases it is necessary to conduct analysis of deserted, unused lands, 
its condition for suitability for growing trees. This is supply of irrigation water, ability to install 
Page  72
f
encing and etc. This is also an additional resource to increase the area transferred for trees 
cultivation. 
Thus, searching of additional land resources for plantations of fast growing wood species should 
be made in two directions. The first one is to effectively use available land resources intended 
for growing permanent wood species. There is a need to develop simple and understandable for 
rural residents evaluation criteria for the lands to be used for gardens and permanent plantations. 
Another direction is to develop new low-productive lands.  
 
Knowledge on fruit trees cultivation  
 
Another important reason is lack of knowledge on fruit trees cultivation in several regions. Thus, 
according to survey results, from 14.8% to 55.2% of surveyed respondents reported that they did 
not know how to grow fruit trees in Chui oblast. In Talas oblast only 7.7% of surveyed 
respondents did not know how to grow, 14.3% - in Issyk-Kul oblast, 46,7% and 12.5% of 
surveyed respondents in Jalalabad and Batken oblasts respectively. In South-Kazakhstan oblast 
and in Almaty oblast 
–from 70 % to 86.7% of the respondents were lacking knowledge on this 
matter. This situation provides the ground for making a conclusion that it is necessary to arrange 
the trainings, or to distribute special literature there.  
 
Upgrading of the knowledge on fast-growing trees cultivation  
 
According to survey results, there is greater knowledge on growing fruit trees in surveyed 
respondents than the one on fast growing wood species. In Baitik village, Chui oblast – 71% of 
the respondents, in Ken-Bulun village – 65.5%, in Predtechenko village – 40.7%, in Talas oblast 
–
23.1%, in Issyk-Kul oblast – 47.1%, in Jalal-Abad – 53.3% and Batken oblasts – 14.3% of the 
respondents honestly reported that they did not know how to take care of fast growing wood 
species. There were 35% of those in South-Kazakhstan oblast, while in Almaty oblast of 
Kazakhstan – only 12.5% from total number of respondents. 
Lack of knowledge causes big losses when planting trees. According to survey results, 46.7% of 
respondents from Baitik village, Chui oblast, reported that only 25% of planted trees survived, 
31.5% of respondents in Ken-Bulun village reported that only half planted trees survived, while 
in Predtechenko village – only 61.5% said so. 73.1% of surveyed respondents in Talas oblast 
reported that 50% of planted trees survived. 80% of respondents in Issyk-Kul oblast reported 
that only 25% of planted trees survived. 43.5% of surveyed respondents reported that 50% of 
planted trees survived in Jalal-Abad oblast, and 73.5 % of respondents in Batken oblast reported 
that 100% of planted trees survived. In South-Kazakhstan oblast 95% of respondents answered 
that half of planted trees survived, while the same percentage was reported in Almaty oblast by 
76.9% of surveyed respondents.  
Arrangement of the consultations for interested rural residents, sharing of successful experience 
on planting forest protection plantations between villagers from different regions involved in   
will facilitate increase of plantations and further supply of wood volume for economic activity.  
 
Quality of planting stock  
 
The fact that many surveyed respondents buy planting stock not in specialized organizations 
(nursery forests, LHs), but at the markets may also be indicated as one of the obstacles. This 
causes bigger losses when planting trees due to poor quality of planting stock. Thus, according 
to survey results, 74% of respondents in Chui oblast buy planting stock at the markets, 84.6% do 
so in Talas oblast, and 76.8% - in Batken oblast. Completely different situation is observed in 
Issyk-Kul oblast, where 82.9% of respondents buy planting stock in the LHs, and 53.3% do so in 
Jalal-Abad oblast. If in Kyrgyzstan planting stock is mainly purchased at the market, in South-
Kazakhstan oblast, 15.9% of respondents buy from neighbors and acquaintances, and 27.5% of 
respondents do so in Almaty oblast. 
Page  73
The respondents growing young plants as a source of income, stock up firewood in the forest 2-
3
times less. This is 13.9% of residents, according to survey results. Those respondents, who 
reported that they had livestock as the main source of income stocked up firewood in the forest 
in 53% of cases. Unambiguous conclusion can be made that the more trees people grow, the less 
harm they make for the environment. To a greater extent the demand of households for firewood 
and timber is satisfied due to own sources, the fewer trees are cut in the forests and forest belts. 
Nursery forests located within the LHs and in natural parks are the main sources of planting 
stock. However, according to the results of the meetings with local community representatives, 
individual interviews and consultations with local administration, specialists and NGOs, it is 
evident that those nursery forests that are currently available are not sufficient to satisfy growing 
demand. It is not enough planting stock of guaranteed quality from the nursery forests both in 
Kyrgyzstan, and in Kazakhstan, according to the respondents. 
At the same time, the staff of LHs during the meetings and individual interviews reported that 
nursery forests due to the lack of funding, fertilizers and machinery produce planting stock with 
lower quality than the one of private nursery forests, that is why it is difficult to sell and it stays 
in the nursery forests forming thicken overgrown plantations of planting stock. Sometimes 
nursery forests cannot sell young plants due to the lack of advertising. So, capacity building and 
training of the personnel of nursery forests and national parks on marketing and advertising of 
products are required for successful competitive operation of nursery forests of the LHs and 
national parks. 
For rural residents interested in cultivating gardens and fast-growing wood species plantations 
consulting support needs to be arranged during the first year of young plants cultivation. This 
would allow increasing the number of survived young plants and to reduce the costs. 
 
Fencing of the plantations  
 
The problem related to fencing of young plantations from the damage caused by cattle is one of 
the reasons constraining and hampering increase of plantations area, according to rural residents. 
The problem is, according to them, that fencing should be made of metal wire mesh, or from 
barbed wire, and not of wooden material. This is expensive for the majority of the respondents 
due to their low income and poverty. At the same time, the residents of some regions 
successfully use plantations of thorny shrubbery for fencing (such as sea buckthorn, dog-rose, 
raspberry), which with informing and sharing of experience and training could be successfully 
used when planting new forest plantations. 
 
Growth of the number of livestock 
 
Another factor hindering growth of the number of planted trees is the growth of livestock. Thus, 
according to survey results, 70% of respondents in Chui oblast believe that the number of 
livestock increased, while 69.2% - in Talas oblast, 75.9% - in Issyk-Kul oblast, 64.3% and 58% 
in Jalal-Abad and Batken oblast respectively were of the same opinion. 
This is the opinion of half of the respondents in Chui oblast, 76.9% - in Talas oblast, 79.4% - in 
Issyk-Kul oblast, 58% and 55% - in Jalal-Abad and Batken oblasts respectively. In South-
Kazakhstan oblast 
–
53%, in Almaty oblast – 48%, respectively. 
Livestock breeding became one of the main sources of income during recent years. According to 
survey results, from 32.3% to 65.6% of respondents reported livestock breeding as the main 
source of income in Chui oblast. In Talas oblast – 69.2%, in Issyk-Kul oblast – 60%, in Jalal-
Abad oblast – 73.3% and in Batken oblast – 73.2%. In South-Kazakhstan oblast and in Almaty 
oblast - from 77.3% to 81,3% of surveyed respondents. 
Exchange visits between the villagers from neighboring settlements and sharing of experience 
on stocking pressed dung would allow reducing illegal deforestation and increasing the share of 
Page  74
t
his fuel source for cooking. Annual growth of the number of animals would facilitate successful 
introduction of the installations on biogas production. 
Involvement of jaamats, farmers and other rural activists to society norms regulation (for 
instance, aksakal court) would facilitate access to forest resources and their participation in 
forest management and protection. 
 
Poverty as the reason for
 
deforestation 
 
Poverty is also one of the problems causing deforestation. High price for such traditional fuel as 
coal caused the use of more affordable source, such as firewood. It is stocked up at the gardens, 
and as a result of illegal deforestation and felling of trees in forest belts. 
 
According to survey results, about 20% of respondents had average income up to 200 soms per 
one family member, excepting Kozychak village, Talas oblast, where this indicator made up 
60% 
As it can be seen from the graph, the share of poor who stock up firewood in the forests makes 
up 33%, or 57% of illegal deforestation. In addition, analysis of survey results shows that less 
than 20% of households with less than 200 soms per one family member buy firewood. This 
group of rural population with the level of income of less than 200 soms is a potential threat of 
illegal deforestation. More than 20% of respondents with the income 400 and 600 soms buy 
firewood.

Consulting support, training programs, allocation of land and effective use of land plots adjacent 
to farms would allow to increase the area under plantation of fruit trees and fast growing wood 
species and to satisfy the demand of poor for firewood and timber.  
TSED project support of particularly poor population will facilitate employment, poverty and 
migration reduction and undoubtedly will allow reducing illegal deforestation.

Conflicts caused by natural resources use 
 
To assess the level of conflicts emerging between rural residents using natural resources, the 
respondents were offered to answer the question, which measure the subject, potential and 
possible ways of conflict resolution. 
Different regions have their specific features due to geographic, economic and social conditions, 
which determine various conflicts in terms of topics and intensiveness. Restricted natural 
resources cause conflict situations, which determine emerging conflict situations since there is 
different access to natural resources with different groups.
 
According to survey results, the conflict caused by natural resources use is reported in relation 
to pastures, water shortage and forest  
 (Diagram 5).

According to survey results, the highest level of conflict is reported in relation to pastures in 
Min-Chinar village, Batken oblast, - 76.8% from total number of respondents, while the 
information from the bar graph shows its presence in all rayons of the KR and Kazakhstan 
excepting Shapak-Baba village, where only 10% of respondents reported about the conflict. 
As it was mentioned above, the level of conflict due to the access to pasture resources may be 
reduced by more rational use of pastures (introduction of pastures turnover), involvement of the 
communities in pasture management, allocation of alternative land plots, cultivation of 
perennials on degraded plots and etc.  
Water shortage is second common cause in terms of conflict level 
–
from 28% in Batken oblast 
to 70% in Chui oblast. Low level of conflict in relation to water is reported in South-Kazakhstan 
oblast – 12.5%, and in Almaty oblast – 9.1%. 
The highest level of conflict is reported in Ken-Bulun village due to under flooding. Excessive 
water causes under flooding of the houses, which causes damage not only to economic activity, 
but also to human health. However, this is favorable condition for cultivating fast-growing wood 
species. 
In the rest cases conflicts emerge due to water shortage. As a rule, conflicts are being resolved 
with the participation of local administration, which establishes irrigation schedule for the land 
plots of the households and observes its implementation. To resolve the conflicts, so-called 
Page  76
w
ater committees are being created in some villages with the participation of community 
representatives. 
As it was mentioned above, restricted access to such resources as firewood to heat dwellings and 
to have timber as construction material causes conflict situations. 
The forest is second common cause of conflict. The level of conflict here is lower, excepting 
Jalal-Abad oblast, Kyzyl-Tuu village. This village is located on the territory close to walnut-fruit 
forest. The highest conflict level (80%) is reported in this village. 
 
Activities for the development 
 
According to survey results, the respondents indicated three types of activities as priority ones. 
These are traditional activities 
–
livestock breeding, agriculture and plant cultivation. However, 
existent distinctions defined by geography of the settlement should be considered when selecting 
priority activities. In flat country agriculture and plant cultivation are prevailing activities. 
Livestock breeding prevails in mountain zones. These are the most important sources of income 
for the households.

and domestic services and etc.). There is a correlation between the activity and its level of income and 
geographical conditions of the respondents.  
 
Cultivation of young plants for commercial and economic purposes is also a type of activity for 
the development. However, the lack or shortage of knowledge does not allow developing this 
type of activity. According to survey results, about 70-80% of the respondents in Kyrgyzstan 
consider this activity profitable; while 87.5 - 100% of surveyed respondents in Kazakhstan 
consider this activity very profitable.

Those respondents who buy firewood for heating and cooking are of the same opinion. So, in 
addition to reforestation and creation of fast-growing wood species plantations on the land of 
aiyl okmotu, it is feasible to include the support of fruit tress and fast-growing wood species 
plantations by local population on the lands belonging to local population into the project 
activity. 
 
Conclusions 
 
Social survey results obtained based on analysis of opinions expressed by the respondents in 
focus group discussions and individual interviews with the representatives of local 
administration, researchers, specialists of the LHs and nursery forests, national parks and 
reserves, representatives of NGO and business, discussions with community members during the 
meetings. 
These results are evidence of understanding and concern about environmental problems and 
related felling of trees and shrubbery, pastures degradation, salinization and waterlogging 
processes, increase of the area of unfavorable and degraded land. As field study results show, 
land unfavorable in land-reclamation sense is available practically on the territory of each aiyl 
okmotu and akimat. 
Data analysis clearly shows that environmental problems and sustainable development may 
automatically be solved through growth of income, poverty and appearance of alternative 
livelihoods. 
Poverty is one of the main problems causing deforestation. High price for such traditional fuel as 
coal and gas caused the use of more affordable source, such as firewood. Non-guarded forest 
protection plantations, gardens of former kolkhozes and sovkhozes recently became a place of 
illegal firewood stocking; in this view, its condition worsened almost everywhere. The demand 
for firewood for heating and cooking grew up. The demand for timber is also grew up. 
Survey results have shown that rural residents that cultivate trees to satisfy their own needs for 
firewood and timber stock firewood and timber in the forest less; the more threes are grown by 
the villagers, the less damage people cause for the environment.
 
As survey results show, conflicts caused by the use of natural resources between rural residents 
mainly emerge in relation to pastures, water and forest. At the same time it should be noted that 
upon the implementation of proposed project the risk of aggravation of these conflicts appears. 
Thus, the conflicts may emerge due to expansion of the area of forest plantation, since it may 
cause certain reduction of pastures area, which will directly impact the interests of pasture users. 
There is a risk of conflict between the two main groups. This is the group of pasture users who 
are striving to increase pastures area due to the fact that from year to year the number of animals 
increases. On the other hand, there are interests of villagers wishing to deal with forest 
Page  78
p
lantations creation. The livestock will be the main threatening factor for the plantations, which 
means that the interests of forest growers will be impacted too. Partially, this may also be 
relevant to haying. At that, as the survey results have shown, these are the lands in the vicinity 
of the settlements of common use. So, 
selection of land plots for forest plantations requires 
special grounding.
 It should exclude the risk of damaging anyone’s interests and conflict 
emergence. The search of compromise settlement of potential conflicts is seen in conducting 
wide awareness and education campaign, involvement of rural residents into the discussion and 
development of preventive measures, forest plantation management with the participation of not 
only groups of pasture users, but also the stakeholders interested in creation of forest plantations. 
It is also necessary to develop additional measures for pasture users – allocation of alternative 
land, arrangement of grazing on outrun pastures, installation of fences, provision of funding and 
etc. 
There is also a risk of conflicts emerging due to shortage of the irrigation water, especially at 
those places where conflict level is high currently. 
To eliminate conflict situations under the implementation of proposed project it is feasible to 
establish public “water committees” composed of farmers, public associations’ representatives, 
NGOs and etc. apart from local administration representatives. 
Overwhelming majority of respondents sees the solution in attracting of local communities to 
natural resources use management, establishment of special structures to coordinate activity and 
to develop practices of rational use of all types of resources. 
Both methods of natural resources use, and the implementation of protective measures for natural objects 
from negative man-caused impact depend on local communities.  
Involvement of local communities to nature resources management, establishment of the 
committees, which together with local administration participate in the management and jointly 
find the ways for rational use of all resources, may improve the situation. It is feasible to 
disseminate this experience for project area. 
 
Measures aimed at increasing the area of the new plantations 
 
The use of unfavorable in land-reclamation sense lands and degraded pastures, which however 
could be successfully used within the frame of TSED project to create plantations of fast 
growing wood species could be recommended as the potential to expand plantation area. 
To successfully expand plantations area of fast growing wood species and fruit species the 
following possible measures could be considered: 
 
Actions aimed at capacity building of the leskhozes and natural parks 
 
1.  To enhance the capacity of existing nurseries of the leskhozes and national parks to 
produce bigger volume of the seedlings. Capacity building and training of the 
personnel of nursery of the leskhozes and national parks on marketing and 
advertising of products are required for successful competitive operation of nurseries 
of the leskhozes. 
2. 
For rural residents interested in cultivating gardens and fast-growing wood species 
plantations consulting support needs to be arranged during the first year of young 
plants cultivation. This would allow to increase the number of survived young plants 
and to reduce the costs.
 
3.  To support establishment of private nursery forests of fruit and fast-growing wood 
species.
 
Currently
 
existing nursery forests are insufficient. According to the 
respondents, it is not enough planting stock of guaranteed quality to satisfy the 
demand both in Kyrgyzstan, and in Kazakhstan.
 
The number of private nursery 
forests is small; currently there is great potential for their development. 
Page  79

.
To support planting of fruit trees and fast-growing wood species by interested rural 
population at their land plots. The data given above is evidence that upon favorable 
conditions volume of wood species cultivated in the land plots may be increased. 
5.  To increase the number of people dealing with cultivating trees for commercial 
purposes. This business is considered profitable and very profitable by about 70-80% 
of the surveyed in Kyrgyzstan and very profitable by 87-100 % - in Kazakhstan. 
6.  To reduce losses of young plants when planting (these losses make up about 50%) 
due to the lack of knowledge of planting rules for both fruit and fast-growing wood 
species by conducting special training for interested rural population. To consider 
features of the area when developing measures (salinization, closeness to the forests, 
level of conflicts and etc.). To introduce limitations for grazing in the area adjacent to 
the settlements for the owners of large number of livestock (and goats in particular). 
7. 
To envisage use of fencing for the new plantations. About 20-25% of respondents did 
not wish to cultivate trees due to the lack of fences. There are land plots, but those 
are not enclosed and that is why people do not want using them to plant trees. This is 
also a reserve to increase the area of plantations. 
 
Measures aimed at enhancing the legislation 
 
1.  To reduce volumes of illegal deforestation with the purpose of further sale by means of 
enforcement of the legislative acts providing for responsibility for illegal deforestation. 
60-70% of respondents buy firewood currently. 
2. To involve organizations (LHs, nursery forests) and law enforcement agencies to 
toughen control over deforestation and sanitary felling with the objective of further sale. 
 
Measures aimed at public involvement into the management 
 
1.  To involve interested rural population groups to plantation management (local jaamats, 
NGOs and etc.) 
2.  To involve the stakeholders into the measures on environmental monitoring. 
3.  To draw public attention through mass media to the problem of illegal deforestation 
(denouncing illegal deforestation in the forests and in the forest belts), to encourage 
cultivation of the young plants, plantation and etc. 
4.  To inform rural population at village meetings on the results of spontaneous felling 
monitoring and on project activity aimed at the restoration of the forests and forest belts 
and fruit trees plantations. 
5.  To develop education programs (trainings, workshops, round tables). 
 
Measures aimed at the development of new activities 
 
1.  To develop new activities aimed at increasing income and poverty reduction. Poor 
population is the greatest potential threat due to the fact that they use illegal deforestation 
as the livelihood  
2. 
To provide young plants for planting, to advice and to facilitate sales of grown plants and 
etc. for poor rural citizens.

5. EIA Procedure Stages 
 
Stage 2. Environmental impact assessment. 
 
This stage includes: 
-
collection and analysis of information on existing environmental condition; 
-
preparation of information on types of impact, its qualitative and quantitative parameters; 
-
detection of sources and objects of impact (their sizes, location relative to other sources, 
environmental objects); 
-
forecast of environmental changes and environmental components (water, soil, 
atmospheric air, flora and fauna, entrails etc.); 
-
technological decisions analysis including alternative options; 
-
assumed impact zone fixing; 
-
socio-environmental-economic analysis of intended project aspects (including 
alternatives). 
 
The determination of project’s impact and its alternatives on environment includes the following 
types of information and research: 
-
project implementation scale expediency and necessity justification; 
-
comparative technological and environmental-economic analysis of alternative decisions, 
their conclusions sufficiency justification; 
-
project implementation location and time justification 
-
availability of resources for main object (raw materials supply, power, natural resources, 
labour resources); 
-
technical analysis of design solutions with possible emergency risk analysis at all the 
stages of object construction, maintenance and liquidation. A technical characteristics 
sheet (
technological passport
)
has to be drawn up on technical analysis findings; 
-
present condition of a planned object location environment. 
 
The degree of completeness and sufficiency of information on the nature of environmental 
conditions in a specific territory must be considered from the standpoint of how well it has been 
scrutinized and its sensitivity to impacts. The sufficiency of survey must be determined at the 
site selection stage and implies the availability of information on the types and nature of 
intended impact. 
 
The information must include the following components: 
a) land resources;  
b) climatic factors; 
c) soil factors; 
d) geological, hydro-geological factors; 
e) geo-morphological factors; 
f) hydrological 
factors; 
g)  biological factors (fauna and flora); 
h)  background value of contaminating substances in environmental components; 
-
socio-economic and business aspects of reviewed territory, which include the information on:  
a) demography; 
b) economy; 
c) employment; 
Page  81
d
)
historical and archaeological objects; 
e) infrastructure; 
f) transportation; 
g) public organizations; 
-
cost and benefits analysis; 
-
basic impact characteristics: 
a) sources of impact; 
b) spatial arrangement; 
c) types of impact: 
 direct; 
 indirect; 
-
by
type description of impact on humans, flora, fauna, soil, air, climate, landscape, tangible 
values and cultural heritage, and impact on interrelation of these factors; 
-
qualitative and quantitative impact indicators: 
a) impact intensity (ingress of contaminants per one unit of time); 
b) impact power density (ingress of contaminants per one unit of square); 
c) impact frequency (discrete, uninterrupted, nonrecurring); 
d) duration (year, month); 
e) spatial dimensions of impact (depth, size, form, impact zones). 
Significant types of impact: out of the initial list must be selected the impacts of the highest 
intensity, longest duration, significant area of impact and those affecting particularly sensitive 
areas (extraordinarily protected territories); 
-
impact mitigation measures; 
-
environmental monitoring program for the entire “life cycle” of the object. 
This stages must be completed with the preparation and drawing up of the Environmental 
Impact Statement (EIS), which must be presented to all the interested parties – authorities, 
management and supervision bodies and the public. 
 
The environmental and economic assessment. 
 
EIA economic estimates must be done in the following way: 
-
do complete public cost estimates for proposed options accomplishment considering all 
the detected effects; 
-
conduct additional assessment depending on calculation objectives and detected 
positions, for instance, financial benefits, compensation payments, specific negative 
effects mitigation or elimination costs etc.; 
-
do a comprehensive environmental and economic calculation to summarize all PROs and 
CONTRAs in terms of cost; 
-
comment on assessment findings according to the public interests scale and with the use 
of indicators unavailable in value terms; 
-
do approximate estimates of object’s cost-efficiency with regard for the price 
development of raw materials, inputs and final products as well as for variable sources of 
original crude and complete sets of equipment etc.; 
-
object’s cost-efficiency must be estimated within financial self-sufficiency according to 
the existing tariffs and prices. 
The estimates should include production and sale costs, manufacturing and social infrastructure 
operations and maintenance costs. The consumption of natural resources and utilization of waste 
processing and burial services of outside organizations are estimated according to the fixed 
tariffs under the existing payment procedure. 
-
cost efficiency is estimated in relation to the project implementation with regard for all 
the consequences including project cancellation. 
 
Stage 3 
–
Environmental effects detection 
Page  82
-
EIS public hearings organization. 
-
Public hearings’ results registration. 
The goal of this stage is to detect environmental, social, economic and other relevant effects of 
intended activity in this territory at certain time. The detection of effects has to be done with the 
assistance of EIS public hearings. The participation of the public is to form different groups’ 
opinions as to the project implementation based on research findings and project information 
submitted to them. These public hearings must result in a document (protocol) to be the basis of 
making changes to the project with additional surveys conducted. The general criteria of social 
effects detection may be population’s health and security, possible move to other districts, 
changes in usual living conditions and traditional forms of employment, proximity to recreation 
zones, natural reservations, archeological, ethnic and historic monuments. The degree of public 
concern must be identified based on this information. This information is subject to being a part 
of EIA materials. 
 
Stage 4 
–
Project adjustment 
 
The goal of this stage is to forecast environmental condition changes which will follow project 
implementation. The forecast has to be done for those natural components, which, if impacted, 
will cause apparent and undesirable effects detected at the EIS preparation stage. These changes 
may occur to the quality of atmosphere, land resources, surface and underground water, hydro-
geological, hydrological, engineering-and-geological, seismic and other conditions. This stage 
envisages the development of project monitoring required for control over hardly forecasted 
environmental changes. The project monitoring is required by the projects, which are not clear 
about environmental impact and its mitigation measures, when its project proposals 
implementation is experimental or they may change due to certain circumstances or have the 
possibility of irreversible changes or the project decision making may change in such a way to 
end up with quite serious impact.

Annex M. Use of Herbicides 
 
Herbicides with active material of Glyphosate registered to apply in the Kyrgyz Republic: 
dominator 36%, VR, GliTERR 36%, VR, Glyph-art 36%, VR, Heracles 36%, VR, Glyphogan 
36%, VR, Glyphosate 41% VR, Uragan 48%, VR, Uragan Forte 50%, VR, Vortex 36%, VR, 
Ercampo 36%, VR, Glyphgore 48% VR. 
 
They are applied for treatment of vegetating weeds in plantations of perennial crops at the rate 
of consumption of 2-4 l/ha to control annual cereal and bilobular weeds and 4-8 l/ha to control 
perennial cereal and bilobular weeds at many agricultures, forest plantations, meadow lands, to 
control water vegetation and also at lands of non-agricultural value. Preparations including 
glyphosate are to be applied once a year for the purpose of devastation prevention at the same 
rate of consumption. Average cost of the herbicides with active material of glyphosate is 
400 
som/l (10$). 
Application and storage of pesticides are to be in line with «Guidelines for safe 
application, storage and warehousing of pesticides in agricultural industry
»
Decree of KR 
MAWI & PI as of 26.11.2001. 
 
Training on the use of pesticides (herbicides) 
In many cases, farmers' primary sources of information and advice on pest management and pesticide use 
are pesticide distributors or sales staff who represent a special interest and are not likely to advice on 
non-chemical alternatives or cultural techniques to prevent the pest problem in the first place. Extension 
workers should be prepared to advise farmers on alternative pest management approaches, cost aspects of 
various control options, and, where chemical control remains desirable, on the proper selection, handling 
and use of pesticides and their hazards. To avoid conflicts of interest, extension services should not 
receive income from selling pesticides. 
 
Training and information may also be required for retailers and farmer groups or cooperatives involved 
in the sale or distribution of pesticides. Ideally, pesticide retailers should be licensed, with appropriate 
training as a prerequisite. Training of medical staff at rural health clinics in recognition and treatment of 
poisoning symptoms may be required alongside with the provision of antidotes. 
 
Agro-chemical companies, and their associations, have been running safe-use training programs. 
Motivation for providing such training has included: response to pressure for regulatory action against 
products that cause a high incidence of farmer intoxication; product promotion; product stewardship. 
Several reports published in 1999-2000 questioned the effectiveness of such training (Ref.). Proper use is 
not only determined by user knowledge but also by availability and use of affordable protective gear, 
appropriate application equipment and appropriate storage facilities. Training does not solve absence of 
these pre-requisites for proper use. Training should therefore be seen as additional to regulatory use 
restrictions aimed at protecting farmers from intoxication, and not as a replacement of such restrictions. 
 
Protective gear 
Simazine and Roundup are readily absorbed through the skin or through inhalation and therefore 
require consistent use of appropriate protective gear. Requirements for personal protection 
should be indicated on the pesticide label. Other sources should be available if this information 
is missing (e.g. web-site of manufacturer, various other web-sites with product information, 
WHO personal protection recommendations for specific Hazard Classes, FAO guidelines). 
Wearing the proper equipment reduces herbicide exposure is essential. Depending on the level 
of hazard, protective gear may range from long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and enclosed shoes, to 
chemical resistant gloves, footwear, headgear and apron, plus goggles and respiratory protection 
ranging from simple dust masks to fully enclosed gas masks. Coveralls over regular work 
Page  84
c
lothes provide good protection. Coveralls that can be thrown away after spraying may be 
available. Use of protective gear is often hampered by discomfort of its use in hot climates. 
Moreover, protective gear is often not available in rural areas or is not affordable to farmers. 
 
Improper use of protective clothing can increase risks (e.g. contaminated clothing can greatly increase 
pesticide absorption through the skin). Protective gear also needs regular replacement. Particularly 
respiratory protection masks or filter cartridges need to be replaced according to recommended 
replacement schedules (humid and dusty environments may require daily changes). However, timely 
replacements are rarely made. There are many different types of masks that serve different purposes. An 
internationally used coding system indicates the protection it gives for different hazards. The hazard of 
organic vapors requires a different type of filter compared to toxic dust. Multiple hazards (dust and 
vapor) require special combination filters. Such filters are expensive and require regular replacement. 
Not all dust filters protect against toxic dust. Specialist advice is required to determine appropriate 
respiratory protection. Use of half-masks or full-masks in the tropics is very uncomfortable and filters do 
not last long in high humidity. 
 
Particularly in developing countries, the reality is that the majority of farmers use pesticides without 
adequate personal protection. Training usually cannot solve this problem. This is the reason for the 
exclusion of products that fall in WHO Hazard Class I and broad restrictions on Class II products for 
Bank financing. 
 
Application equipment: A common cause of pesticide intoxication is poorly functioning or leaking 
equipment. Farmers often continue to use old equipment because they cannot afford to replace or repair 
it. Also, spare parts and knowledgeable technicians are often hard to find. 
 
Any procurement or distribution of pesticide equipment should therefore take into consideration the 
availability of local repair services and users' knowledge of equipment. A good supply of spare parts and 
training of retailers to provide equipment maintenance and repair services may be necessary when 
selecting equipment. Tenders for procurement of pesticide equipment should set very specific and high 
quality standards, because otherwise suppliers may be tempted to compromise on the quality in order to 
table lower bids. 
 
Packaging and Labeling 
The International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides, and associated technical 
guidelines, provide internationally accepted general standards on packaging and labeling. OP 4.09 refers 
to these guidelines as standard for Bank practice. However, domestic regulations that set more stringent 
standards than the FAO guidelines must be adhered to. 
 
When procuring pesticides, product specifications should include packaging requirements. Packaging 
should be of appropriate type and size. Empty pesticide containers are considered hazardous waste and 
generally cannot be cleaned to make them safe for other purposes. Careful selection of packaging can 
help avoid problems. For instance, containers that are attractive as water jerrycans should be avoided. 
Small package sizes help avoid on-farm storage problems. Designs and materials of packaging should be 
able to withstand anticipated levels of handling, climatic conditions and prolonged storage under sub-
standard conditions. 
 
Procurement documents must also specify that labeling follows the principles provided in Guidelines on 
Good Labeling Practice for Pesticides (Rome: FAO, 1994). Labels should be in the local language. 
 
Intermediaries in developing countries often purchase pesticides in bulk and then repackage them. Often 
the repackaged pesticides go into inadequate containers with little or no labeling. Pesticides procured for 
distribution to small-scale farmers, or individuals for public health vector control purposes, should as 
much as possible be single-dose packages or small containers. The general rule is that repackaging 
should be avoided. If repackaging is to be done, the facilities, materials and procedures should be audited 
by an independent expert as part of project preparation. Repackaging should be permitted only in 
properly licensed and inspected facilities that meet acceptable safety standards. Active ingredients or 
products that fall into WHO Hazard Class II should be handled under the control of the bulk supplier, 
Page  85
who should resume full responsibility for the suitability of the new package, including label and use 
instructions, the quality of the repackaged product, and the safety of the repackaging process. (Class I is 
not relevant because procurement of products in this Class is not permitted under OP 4.09). The FAO 
guidelines on labeling and packaging also apply to repackaged products. 
 
Transportation and storage 
International transport of pesticides is regulated by several international Conventions based on the 
UN 
Recommendations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods
.
The two most relevant are the IMO 
International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code
 for shipment by surface, and the 
IATA Dangerous Goods 
Regulations
 for air transport, which both apply to pesticides. Some countries may have national 
legislation regulating the in-land transport of dangerous goods, but many have not. Inland transport may 
pose several risks that are often increased by the condition of lorries and roads. Specific risks include 
storage in the port and transport through densely populated or protected areas. A hazard assessment may 
be appropriate for transport of large volumes of pesticides that pose risks to human health or the 
environment. 
 
A
significant proportion of pesticide stores in developing countries does not meet minimum requirements 
for such stores: location at safe distance from water and human dwellings; compound fenced and access 
limited to authorized staff; floors of impermeable concrete; ramps to contain leaking liquids; adequate 
ventilation; doors under lock; store keepers trained in handling pesticides; emergency shower facilities; 
adequate quantities of materials and protective gear to deal with emergencies. There have been several 
cases where pesticide stores burnt down as a result of poor management. These accidents caused severe 
environmental contamination. On-farm 
storage practices for pesticides are very often not safe. 
 
Legal Aspects related to import and transportion of herbicides and agro-chemicals 
Department of chemicals and plant protection of the KR issues the following licensing documents: 1) 
Certificate of state registration of pesticides and (or) agrochemicals, and 2). Conformance Certificate of 
pesticides and agrochemicals Both of these licensing documents are regulated by Law of the Kyrgyz 
Republic "On the chemicals and plant protection". 
 
For import of herbicides to the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic they should be registered and 
permitted for application, they should have certificates of origin and conformance. 
Authorization for import and customs clearance upon separate importation requires obtaining a 
licence in the State Department for Plants Chemicalization, Protection & Quarantine under KR 
MAWI & PI (government body to control and ensure safe application with pesticides and other 
agrochemicals) and submission of copies of the Contract, invoice and above mentioned 
certificates.  
 
Persons and legal entities in accordance with their work must ensure the safety for human health of the 
work and services, as well as production of industrial- technical purposes, food products and goods for 
personal and household needs during its production, transportation, storage, realization to population . 
Potentially dangerous to humans chemical, biological substances, and certain types of products are 
allowed to manufacture, transportation, purchase, storage, sale and application (use) only after the state 
registration and if the recommendations on the transportation, use, storage and packing label with a 
warning inscription are available. 
 
The list of chemicals and pesticides whose use is prohibited and subject to prior informed consent 
procedure is approved by Regulation #376 of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic dated  July 27, 
2001. 
 
Transportation of pesticides and agrochemicals is permitted only in specially equipped vehicle, storage is 
permitted in special vaults. Seller must be specially trained and can sell pesticides and agrochemicals that 
have passed state registration and introduced into the State Catalogue. Application process is determined 
by a special authority of executive power. Advertising of failed state registration pesticides and 
agrochemicals is prohibited.  
 
The manufacturer (performer, seller) is obliged to provide consumers with necessary and accurate 
information about goods (works, services), ensure possibility of the right choice. The list of certain types 
Page  86
of goods (works, services) and the ways to inform consumers are established by the Government of the 
Kyrgyz Republic.

Annex P - Minutes of the public hearings to discuss the 
draft social & environmental assessment of the “Tien Shan 
Ecosystems Development” Project  
 
Public hearings were held on February, 10 2009 in Bishkek at the ARIS conference premises 
and on February, 12 2009 in Almaty at the premises of the Regional Environmental Centre.  
 
In Kyrgyzstan 33 people were invited and announcement was published in “Vecherniy 
Bishkek” national newspaper. 23 people attended (the list is attached). The participants were 
SAEPF, Jogorku Kenesh and Government officials, representatives of World Bank, ARIS, 
JICA Project, NGOs of KR and Uzbekistan.  
Participants were informed on TSED components, goals and objectives.  
Following topics were discussed:  
o
Possible impacts of project implementation; 
o
Mitigation measures if negative impacts are the case; 
 
The following conclusions were made as a result of discussion (detailed minutes are 
attached):  
1.  To make maximum efforts to focus planting activities within flood plain forests. 
2.  Water intake for planting purposes in KR will not have impact on water intake in 
Uzbekistan. The volume of water intake that Uzbekistan is currently consuming 
causes salinization and degradation of soil. 
3.  To avoid disputed lands upon selection of lands for forest planting and reforestation 
purposes.  
 
Participants of public hearings, PIU staff, the company conducted ESA agreed that:  
1.  Specified mitigation measures of possible negative impacts are sufficient.  
2.  To focus attention on restoration of flood plain forests during project implementation. 
 
In Kazakhstan 35 people were invited and announcement was published in “Kazakhstanskaya 
Pravda” national newspaper. 33 people attended (the list is attached). The participants were 
representatives of reserves, RK NAS, REC, project organizations, NGOs. The official 
representative of Forestry & Hunting Industry Committee was GIS TERRA Company.   
Participants were informed on TSED components, goals and objectives, outcomes of Western 
Tien Shan Biodiversity Conservation Project and 5 KZ SPNA that will be involved in the 
TSED  project. 
 
Following topics were discussed:  
o
Possible impacts of project implementation; 
o
Mitigation measures if negative impacts are the case; 
 
The following conclusions were made as a result of discussion (minutes are attached):  
1.  Not to include alien tress among those to be planted. 
2.  Environmental tourism existing in Kazakhstan has some image problem; in this 
connection it was suggested to rename the component as sustainable or controlled 
tourism. 
3.  To make use of lessons learnt within the first phase of the project.

Participants of public hearings, PIU staff, the company conducted ESA agreed that:  
1.  Mitigation measures of possible negative impacts as specified in the Social and 
Environmental Assessment are sufficient.  
2.  To focus attention on conclusions during project implementation. 
3.  To establish the group in Kazakhstan to prepare GEF project.

.
Welcome speech. The announcement about public hearings for discussion 
of Environmental & Social Assessment of the Tien Shan Ecosystems Development Project 
was published in “Vecherniy Bishkek” newspaper. 33 people were invited to public hearings, 
23 people are those present. Let me present Tien Shan Ecosystems Development Project and 
Environmental & Social Assessment Report within the framework of Tien Shan Ecosystems 
Development Project prepared by the Institute of Water Resources Ecology & Desertification 
Problems, consultants from the Kyrgyz republic and Republic of Kazakhstan. Tien Shan 
Ecosystems Development Project is a second phase of Transboundary Project for 
Conservation of Western Tien Shan biodiversity implemented within the territories of three 
countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan in 1999-2006. Then he provided 
information about Tien Shan Ecosystems Development Project and its components.

Orolbaeva L
.
Presented report on environmental & social assessment within the framework 
of Tien Shan Ecosystems Development Project.
 
Uzgenov A. 
What is a certified hydrocarbon? 
 
Mambetaliev U.A.
 
Climate change results from surplus of greenhouse gases. Upon 
cultivation of forest plantations we obtain the volume of absorbed greenhouse gases. There is 
a
special methodology for assessment of volumes. F. Haupt is an expert in this field, you can 
ask her.   
 
Ionov R. 
Report uses the terms of species and semideserts that are not applied in Kyrgyzstan.    
 
Shukurov E. 
They are equivalent names. They are based on provisions connected with 
documents on land degradation.  We use them in order to be in line with official terminology.
 
Uzgenov A. 
If access restriction is the case, will material compensation be provided?
 
Orolbaeva L. Pursuant to the policy of World Bank compensation measures on access 
restriction should be developed even in that case if lands of forest inventory are illegally 
used.
 Such compensation measures were developed.  
 
Domashov I.  
Will flood-plain communities be involved in the project?  
 
Mambetaliev U.A.
 
Flood-plain forests locating within the territory of the forest inventory 
will be involved for planting. There a set of criteria for selection of these lands. It should be a 
tract of not more than 10 Ha. It can be one tract or several tracts within the same forestry or 
flood plain.  As concerns lands of ayil districts 
–
selected lands should be those having no tree 
&
shrub vegetation. 
 
Toktogulova K. 
Will you finance planting of a big number of species or some specific 
species? Will existing nurseries be used?  
 
Mambetaliev U.A.
 
The project covers costs for support of both state nurseries and private 
ones. Small technical equipment will be purchased, ayil okmotu will be provided funds for 
purchase of planting stock. Project will contribute to State Forest Fund in tillage.  
 
Toktogulova K.
 Who will compose the group controlling access restriction?  
 
Mambetaliev U.A.
 
Officials of ayil districts, members of local councils (ayil Kenesh), land 
users, NGOs and youth will compose the group of control. The primary criteria for selected 
lands are absence of conflict. Now 36 000 ha are proposed and only 7 000 ha will be selected.  
 
Chekirov A. 
Relevant works will be implemented on the lands where specific micro-project 
groups will be selected to deal with that kind of work. It can be a family, farm etc. Groups 
will be established on the basis of those groups that are operating in the field of rural 
investments. Project design foresees reduction of conflicts to their minimum within these 
lands. Agreements contributing to sustainable forest planting are envisaged. Micro-project 
group will be expected to reorganize so this group can be more sustainable. 
 
Toktogulova, K
.
What is the duration of the project?  
Page  97
Mambetaliev U.A.
 
5
years.  
 
Gabrid N.V. 
Do you plan to set forest belts within agricultural areas? 
 
Mambetaliev U.A.
 
Recently the forest definition was approved. It is possible if the forest 
belt is in line with accepted parameters. Minimal area is 0.3 ha, crown coverage is 30% of 
total area.  
 
Shaimardanov 
.
People planted forest. Will they receive something from biocarbon fund or 
all fund will flow into national budget? Who will control not to cut tree plantations before 
certain phase and how does people benefit from it?  
 
Chekirov A. 
It is planned that funds of biocarbon fund will be divided into 2 parts. One part 
is designed for forestry sector and second one will be allotted to the areas planted by local 
communities. The scheme for biocarbon field will be developed. Also it is possible to transfer 
fund to the committee that will allocate funds. It is important to persuade people not to cut 
down plantations before certain period. Micro-project groups make proposals describing what 
kind of trees they will plant. First part is formal and second part is a calculation of cost-
effectiveness. We have 12 species of plantation that we plan to plant. Thus, micro-project 
group will already know what she can expect after 5 or 10 years. She will be aware of cost-
effectiveness expected to be after certain time passed.  
 
Kupueva 
.
When we are talking about 7 000 ha to be planted we mean those that will be 
known after criteria-based selection. Pursuant to the legislation economic analysis will be 
implemented as well. I have a question 
–
what is the current state of water resources?  
 
Mambetaliev U.A.
 I’d like to add concerning sustainability. The key investments will be 
during first years when there will be a need in purchase of planting stock. The Project will 
assign funds for these purposes. The project doesn’t cover all costs; people also invest their 
own funds. At present we are dealing with one pilot area located in Chui valley. 80% will 
belong to those who will deal with it. It will be a base for motivation of people. There are 
three river basins in our country. During project implementation we will deal with Syrdarya 
and Talas basins. The policy of World Bank stipulates mandatory notification of countries 
located downstream about the project to be implemented. And in the case if these countries 
oppose, World Bank has the right for option either to finance this project or not. Indeed, the 
volumes of water intake required for planting purposes are very low. Syrdarya – 8000 cub m 
per ha per year, 0,06% of water flow will be used for irrigation purposes.  
 
Shaimardanov 
.
And if the conflict of interests is the case, what will you do?  
 
Mambetaliev U.A.
 It is also possible. We make project within those lands that have been 
irrigated before. If the conflicts are the case, we will strive for conflict resolution. 
 
Kupueva 
.
These calculations were verified by water industry officials and in the case if 
the party implementing the projects avoids notifying the countries located downstream, then 
this party bears a full responsibility. If another party rejects, the Bank has the right to establish 
the committee of experts.   
 
Uzgenov 
.
I
have suggestion to use drought-resistant species fro planting purposes.
 
Page  98
Shaimardanov 
.
I
guess that part of water used by Uzbekistan is of benefit and part of this 
water causes the damage. I’d like to make a statement that Uzbekistan needs half of those 
waters actually used for irrigation purposes. The remained water cause soil degradation, 
reduction of water supplies will be of benefit for Uzbekistan, this is my personal opinion. 
Water industry involves a huge number of financial resources; cotton monopoly causes a great 
damage. It is unknown how Uzbekistan can overcome this vicious circle.  
 
Mambetaliev U.A.
 
The point is that the project was Transboundary and Uzbekistan was to 
take part in it but then refused.  
 
Kupueva 
.
Each transboundary state signed the conventions stipulating obligatory 
implementation of water supply commitments. They should fulfill commitments with regard 
to their partner from other countries.   
 
Shaimardanov 
.
A
lot of things depend on measures to improve planting conditions.  
 
Shukurov E.
 
It is needed to distinguish new forest plantations and restoration of previous 
forests. It is highly advisable not to hold plantation farms. The project aims at restoration of 
Tien Shan ecosystems but not creation of new ones.  
 
Domashov I
.
The report specifies that the committee will be composed of ayil okmotu 
officials; it is primarily envisaged to establish field groups. And what will be the further steps 
when the next phase of the project will come?  For instance, local community makes a 
decision that there will be fields though before there were birches. It will lead to displacement 
of ecosystems.  
 
Mambetaliev U.A. 
 The same species will be planted where there were forests. Quickly 
growing species of plantations will be cultivated where there were no forests.   
 
Shukurov E.
 
With the view of making an appropriate decision within the framework of this 
project there is no need to make them have a professional level of developers. The point is 
that they should see the benefit of these plantations. They should be aware of concrete benefit 
of this project. This is a competence. If they consider it insufficient competence, they have the 
right to reject this project. Sellection of micro-projects will be competition-based both within 
ayil okmotu and between ayil okmotu. The competence they have is enough to make a proper 
decision.  
 
Mambetaliev U.A.
 May be representatives of JICA Project for support of integrated forest 
management have the questions?   
 
Machida Reta. 
Thank you a lot. We have a small list of questions that we would like to 
clarify at the meeting tomorrow.  
 
Shaimardanov 
.
The technology of community-based forestry was created in 
Karakalpakiya, the aim of this project was to create forestry communities. Do you plan to 
create a legal organization or some kind of legal body that will be able to deal with 
community-based forestry management? 
 
Mambetaliev U.A. 
 All rational things of community-based forestry management are 
transferred to our project and will be applied. In order to implement micro projects ARIS has 
a
developed and tested methodology to organize people into groups with legal liability.    
Page  99
Kupueva 
.
ARIS is an agency dealing with communities and it has a considerable 
experience in this field. This project will use those technologies that are applied by ARIS.

Introduction speech.
 
As you know the announcement was published in 
“Kazakhstanskaya pravda” RK national newspaper and 35 people were invited to public 
hearings, 33 people are those present. Let me present Tien Shan Ecosystems Development 
Project and Environmental & Social Assessment Report within the framework of Tien Shan 
Ecosystems Development Project prepared by the Institute of Water Resources Ecology & 
Desertification Problems, consultants from the Kyrgyz republic and Republic of Kazakhstan. 
Tien Shan Ecosystems Development Project is a second phase of Transboundary Project for 
Conservation of Western Tien Shan biodiversity implemented within the territories of three 
countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan in 1999-2006. 
 
Orolbaeva L
.
presented report on environmental & social assessment.  
 
Valdshmit L
.
presented information on previous phase of Western Tien Shan Biodiversity
 
Conservation Project implemented within the territory of Kazakhstan.   
 
Ogar N. 
specified specially protected areas of Kazakhstan covered by Tien Shan Ecosystems 
Development Project. 
 
Orolbaeva L. 
Suggested to ask questions concerning presented report. 
 
Danilov M.
 How will the project be implemented: separately within the territories of the 
republics or joint expeditions are foreseen? Will it be possible to visit specially protected 
areas of Kyrgyzstan?  
 
Shukurov E.Dj
.
Since project is combined, exchange of experience is foreseen. Moreover, 
the experience obtained during implementation of Western Tien Shan Transboundary Project 
also will be applied within new project. 
 
Mambetaliev U.A. 
It is envisaged that joint teams of consultants operating throughout the 
whole target territory will be organized within separate project directions
.
Kiktenko L. 
It was several times mentioned that Small Grants Programme (SGP) will be 
implemented. Who will implement it? Please specify if Kazakhstan’s PIU will be established?
 
Ogar N.P. 
The possibility for establishment of PIU in Kazakhstan will be clear at the stage of 
preparation of Feasibility Study and after consultation meetings with all stakeholders.
 
Mambetaliev U.A. 
Small grants programme was a first phase of the project (Western Tein 
Shan Transboundary project). The priorities were identified and a specific methodology was 
developed for its implementation. Capacity of implemented SGP is considered to be 
significant and it will be used at second phase of the project as well. The issue will be under 
consideration. The executive agency will be located in Kyrgyzstan. Project implementation 
team will be in Kazakhstan, however the component has not been completed and the project 
foresees its further elaboration.  
 
Page  100
Rodionov A.M. 
I
have two questions: 1) Does the proposed budget of 2,3 mln. USD cover 
funds for SGP? 2) You are talking about reduction of biodiversity pressure, but there is a 
widespread opinion that ecotourism damages biodiversity, what can you say on this matter?  
 
Shukurov E.Dj
.
I
agree with you that ecotourism is a threat for biodiversity. Though in 
comparison with other impacts on ecosystems the ecotourism is that most sparing. The project 
will undertake efforts to implement nature-friendly ecotourism. At this moment it is 
practically impossible to restrain the ecotourism trend. There is a need to put tourism within 
civilized limits. In this case ecotourism causes much lower damage.  
 
Rodionov A.M.  
Do you know that GEF can deny financing development of ecotourism?
 
Shukurov E.Dj
.
The project already has a prior approval. We should thin over how to 
introduce it in certain framework. We will try to do it through the project, to put it in 
acceptable conditions.  
 
Mambetaliev U.A. 
Yes, SGP funds are covered by indicated budget of 2,3 mln. USD.
 
Nazarchuk M.N. 
I
suggest to replace the “ecotourism” term for “controlled tourism” as 
Kazakhstan has no ecotourism.
 
Ogar N.P. 
Russian people use
 
the “ecotourism” term in SPNA (specially protected natural 
areas). It is not typical for RK. Certainly, there is an understanding of ecotourism but its 
conditions are not implemented.  
 
Ivashenko G.A. 
On the base of Ile-Alatau State National Nature Park I can say that there is 
rather a recreation but not ecotourism. There are a high flow of visitors and a lot of garbage. 
Ecotourism conditions are quite different.
 
Nazarchuk M.N. 
And pursuit of profits in national nature parks is also not in line with the 
“ecotourism” term. 
 
Shukurov E.Dj.
 
If the issue of “Wild” tourism will be beyond of consideration at all, it can 
worse the situation. The situation is clear: there is no understanding and control at all levels. 
We will try to make something change through the project.  
 
Ivashenko G.A. 
There is a need in broad explanatory work.  
 
Kim S
.
I
received a letter from GEF informing that ecotourism is not supported by World 
Bank.  Although there was a reserve that business related to ecotourism is not prohibited, but 
another approach to this activity is required. The main issue is that this realm is closed and 
controlled. This should be considered at planning stage. Question: When it is planned to begin 
implementation of activities? Advice was to start activity in May, relevant document should 
be submitted. General words often sound good, but their implementation is doubtful. GEF 
provides 2 millions, but this amount is not enough at the Kazakhstan market. Will this involve 
World Bank’s credits? Taking into account crisis conditions it is not very suitable time for the 
project. Why did the question about allergic risks raise?   
 
Mambetaliev U.A. 
It is necessary to prepare Feasibility Study by May. In Kyrgyzstan the 
tender for its preparation has been already announced. International consultant monitoring the 
process will be involved as well. The grant for preparation of Feasibility Study was not 
Page  101
accepted in RK and it significantly complicates the process of document preparation. Of 
course, we will do teamwork but extra funds will be required. Financing activity to be 
implemented within the project will be in compliance with Management Plans of RK SPNA. 
Each Management Plan will be analyzed and one general plan will be drawn up on their base. 
Each SPNA has its priorities requiring investments exactly now. Therefore the project will 
finance the key needs. We adhere to an opinion that even small amount of funds can make 
relevant contribution to reserves and parks. The project will be implemented under grant 
funds, no loans are foreseen.   
 
rolbaeva L. 
The assessment was carried out in compliance with the feasibility study that 
put forward the question about possible negative impacts og poplar planting and possible 
associated allergic risks. The assessment procedure of the World Bank envisages review of all 
potential negative impacts and development of mitigation measures. 
 
Rysakova J. 
I’d like to clarify some moments: World Bank does not dictate what to do. The 
Client as represented by the governments exercises a concern of current situation; World 
Bank considers the possibilities to render assistance. Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are quite 
different, therefore funding sources are also different. For last two years only grant funds are 
available for Kyrgyzstan (maximum grant is 15 mln. USD). In Kazakhstan the World Bank 
provides expertise, consultants etc. For instance, there is an on-going project on Irtysh-based 
belt-type pine forests with total budget of 68 mln. USD (including 5 mln. USD for SGP, 38 
mln. USD assigned by RK Government and the rest part is grant of the World Bank). 
 
Kim S. 
Is loan foreseen? 
 
Rysakova J. 
The project that is under today’s discussion doesn’t foresee the loan for RK, 
there will be a GEF grant.
 
Kim S
.
It means that Kazakhstan should count on only 2 mln.? 
 
Rysakova J. 
This is the matter of forestry sector. The Bank is happy to support any initiative, 
however it depends on national budget as well.
 
Sadykova Ch
.
Please tell me if the second phase of the project also envisages purchase of 
technical equipment? Will the experience obtained during implementation of the first phase be 
taken into account? All SPNAs survive at the expense of money that visiting people pay for 
their rest. And SPNA Law has the article concerning ecotourism. And my suggestion: I think 
it is better to use «sustainable» tourism term and identify it as activity aimed at sustainable 
development of economic & social environment.    
 
Nazarchuk 
.N.
 We deal with designing of national parks. Upon designing we set the 
pathways – environmental tourism itself is less than 1%. No need to compare with the 
experience of other countries since RK has its own specific environment. Nevertheless, park 
should survive. The weakness of park is that this tourism is out of control. They don’t control 
how many vehicles enter and how much garbage is removed.   
 
Sadykova Ch. 
I
have a counter-question – Issyk-Kul has a status of bioreserve – there are a 
lot of vehicles and tourists. Shouldn’t we close everything there? We should think over how 
to write the feasibility study. We worked to develop the National Strategy for biodiversity 
conservation.  WE made recommendations for sustainable tourism. And do you think that 
Page  102
somebody uses it?  Nobody uses it now, it is very long process. Urmat knows it well, we are 
in global space, we strive for democratic principles, but it is time consuming process.   
 
Mambetaliev U.A.
 
You know at its final stage the project performs specific assessments of 
project outputs and outcomes. We carried out the analysis when the first phase was finished 
and reviewed all relevant strengths and weaknesses. All this information will be taken into 
account within the framework of our project. We will try to use this knowledge during the 
second phase of the project.   
 
Grachev Y. 
My question as follows: the list of forest-generating species presented in 
Kyrgyzstan is doubtful. The point is that a muddle of things was made. There are species that 
don’t pertain to Kyrgyzstan and there are species that are protected in natural parks. There are 
species that are dangerous for natural parks such as a pine. And more one remark – the species 
and green construction bodies are not specified. There are various types of poplar, marsh elder 
–
more than 10 types. In the process of further work all these things need to be more specific. 
These are all my comments.
 
Shukurov E.Dj. 
Thank you for your remarks. As regards the issue concerning reforestation, 
certainly, alien species will not be planted in natural ecosystems. Ecosystem restoration will 
be applied for such species.
 
Forests can not be restored with the help of alien plantations. New species can be used only in 
completely destroyed forests. Not only certain species but the whole forest system needs to be 
restored. We had a grater concern with regard to destroyed or disappeared forests. Where 
overgrazing is the case. Bank insists on compensation measures to be foreseen. We should 
provide for these measures. In some cases it is even silly if forests will pertain to only 1-2 ha. 
However, we should specify why we have to draw their hectare. It is of high importance no to 
infringe upon poor people within the framework of the project. Therefore, we did not aim to 
distinguish all these species. Therefore, there is some mixing of species. Approaches and 
compensation measures are different. These issues should be clearly specified in feasibility 
study.  
 
Mambetaliev U.A.
 Relevant species will be used upon different kinds of restoration. The 
annex to the report stipulates that restoration programme is based on tested methodology.  
 
Kim S. 
To what extent is this project in line with other projects financed by World Bank?  
 
Rysakova J. 
As regards RES construction, there is such project as transmission facilitiesvare 
outdated. Actually the issue is under consideration, but when project is launched, preparatory 
works are implemented. During further development of the project it should not infringe upon 
previous projects. It is very complicated for World Bank. If there will be doubts that it can 
cause some damage for nature or human being – it will be under repeated consideration again 
and again. RES construction is still under consideration.  
 
Kim S. 
Please take into account that development of Feasibility Study will require 
multilateral consultation meetings. There were precedents: some projects failed to take all 
factors into consideration, consequently the nature had relevant damages. It is of need to 
undertake maximum efforts in order to avoid such situations.
