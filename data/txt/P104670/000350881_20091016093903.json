management and sustainable forestry in the Tien Shan region\n            of the Kyrgyz Republic, and (2) improve ecosystem management\n            in the Tien Shan region of Kazakhstan by improving\n            biodiversity conservation and contributing to climate\n            mitigation by sequestering carbon dioxide in forests in the\n            Kyrgyz Republic. The project has three components. (1)\n            Strengthening biodiversity conservation in protected areas\n            and productive landscapes component. The component will\n            include the following three sub-components: (a) protected\n            area management; (b) conservation in the broader landscape\n            through small grants in Kazakhstan; and (c) sustainable\n            tourism promotion. (2) Forestry and Carbon Trading in the\n            Kyrgyz Republic component includes forestation and\n            reforestation, validation and monitoring of carbon\n            sequestration, and improved forest management. (3) Project\n            management component. Overall coordination of project\n            activities and the fiduciary aspects of project management\n            will be handled by the State Agency for Environmental\n            Protection and Forestry (SAEPF) of the Kyrgyz Republic and\n            the Forestry and Hunting Committee (FHC) of Kazakhstan."}, "docdt": "2009-10-08T00:00:00Z"}
