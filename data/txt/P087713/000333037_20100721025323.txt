F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The broad objectives of the Government's Bolsa Família Program (BFP) are to reduce
poverty and inequality and promote human capital investments among poor families
(including indigenous and quilombola populations) through the provision of direct
monetary transfers to poor families and incentives for investing in human capital. The
main objectives of this first phase APL include strengthening the Bolsa Familia


                                               ii
program's BFPs ability to reduce poverty and inequality by: (a) consolidating conditional
cash transfer programs and reducing gaps and duplications in coverage; (b) strengthening
the system for identifying the target population; (c) developing a monitoring and
evaluation system for the BFP; and (d) strengthening the basic institutional functioning
of the program.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

For several years before appraisal of the Bolsa Família Program (the Program) and the
first phase of the Bank's Adaptable Program Lending (APL) in support of that Program,
the Brazilian Government was committed to realizing the country's large potential for
welfare improvements through simultaneous actions on the economic and social fronts.
Despite impressive progress over the previous decade, challenges remained. Education
indicators still lagged; disparities in health care and in utilization across regions
remained, and poverty had remained fairly constant since the mid-1990s, although the
profile changed--poverty levels in metropolitan areas increased sharply, and incidence
among youth also increased. With a Gini coefficient of 0.59 for incomes, Brazil was still
one of the world's most unequal societies. The richest 1 percent of the population
received 10 percent of total monetary income--the same share as the poorest 50 percent.
Analysis showed that income inequality in Brazil stemmed primarily from unequal access
to education and a high skill premium for labor, along with a highly regressive pension
system. As a result, higher quality and more equitable access to education were seen as
key to reducing poverty and inequality in the long run. Since these reforms were
expected to take time to materialize, reforms to social assistance programs and a more
equitable pension system were seen as offering complementary results that could
substantially reduce inequality and alleviate poverty in the shorter term.

Brazil had several safety net programs that provided cash transfers to roughly the same
target group of families in place, each with a different focus: Bolsa Escola (schooling),
Bolsa Alimentação (health care), Cartão Alimentação (food stamp), and Auxilio Gas
(compensating for adjustments in fuel costs). Each program was managed with separate
administrative structures, beneficiary selection processes, and banking-sector contracts
for payments issuance.

The Administration of President Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva had come into office in early
2003, continuing the previous administration's focus of maintaining macro stability while
achieving more equitable growth and rapid social progress. One of the Government's
first priorities was to introduce sweeping reforms to improve its social safety net. These
reforms aimed to integrate the several existing federal cash transfer programs into a
single, improved conditional cash transfer (CCT) program called the Bolsa Família
Program (BFP). The objectives of this integration included: (a) consolidating and
rationalizing then existing federal condition cash transfer programs; (b) promoting
efficiency in the use of public resources; (c) improving the system for identifying the
target population; (d) leveraging synergies from jointly promoting education, health and
nutrition initiatives; (e) strengthening monitoring and evaluation; and (f) leveraging
opportunities to promote vertical integration in the social safety net between federal and
sub-national programs. The integration was seen as offering the opportunity to go
nationwide with the intervention, and create the conditions for a decentralized scheme for
implementation.


                                            1
The objectives of the Bolsa Família Program were to: (a) reduce poverty and inequality
in the present, through the provision of direct monetary transfers to poor families; and (b)
reduce poverty and inequality in the future, by providing incentives and conditions for
investments in human capital on behalf of beneficiary families, and by linking
beneficiary families to complementary services that could help them invest and grow out
of poverty as a result.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

As a Sector-Wide Approach1 (SWAp) supporting the Bolsa Família Program, the
objectives of the Bank's APL were to broadly support the Program's objectives. The
objectives of the first phase of the APL (the Project) were to support: (a) a consolidation
of conditional cash transfer programs and reductions in gaps and duplications in
coverage; (b) a strengthening of the system for identifying the target population; (c) the
development of a monitoring and evaluation system for the BFP; and (d) a strengthening
of the basic institutional functioning of the Program.

Key performance indicators for tracking the Project's progress towards these objectives
were the following:

    Outcome Indicators

       At least 2/3 of extreme poor families receiving BF income transfers.
       At least 40 percent of total transfers going to families in the bottom quintile.
       At least 80 percent of primary-school aged children in extremely poor beneficiary
       families attending school.
       At least 95 percent of beneficiary children with health cards.
    Intermediate Results Indicators

       Pre-reform programs eliminated (former beneficiaries either converted to BF or
       dropped from other programs).
       Transactions costs for transfer payments reduced.
       New Cadastro Único questionnaires developed and printed.
       Expansion and recertification data collection strategy designed and operational.
       Elimination of all detectable duplications in the Cadastro Único database.
       Periodicity for updating Cadastro Único and recertifying BF beneficiaries formally
       established.

  An operation structured as a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) supports the entirety of a Government
Program (as defined), and relies to the extent possible on Government procurement, financial management,
monitoring and evaluation and other systems, thereby ensuring that the Bank's assistance is provided
within the overall framework of that program. SWAps can be structured to respond to different
requirements, such as the State SWAps in Brazil, or, those, like the Bolsa Família, that support the entirety
of a federal program.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The Project's PDO were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The BFP defined two target groups. The priority target group were "extreme poor"
families with per capita monthly incomes below R$50 (US$17), at the time of appraisal.
The Program also targeted "moderately poor" families with per capita monthly incomes
below R$100 (US$34) but higher than R$50 (US$17). (These figures were adjusted
regularly throughout implementation, as described later in this report.) Payments were
preferably made to the mothers, as required by the law that established the Program. The
Government's goal, at appraisal, was the BFP would reach 11.2 million poor families by
2006.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The Project comprised five components: one component that would reimburse the
Government for expenditures on conditional cash transfers under the BFP; three
mutually-reinforcing technical components to help improve the quality and basic
architecture of the Program; and a small component for project management.
           
Component 1: Conditional Cash Transfers (Grants) (US$6,174 million in program,
costs; US$551.5 million in loan financing)2. This component was to provide support to
the Government in consolidating and rationalizing conditional cash transfers, and in
reducing duplications and gaps in coverage of the BFP, as part of a broader and balanced
strategy for economic and human development. For this component, the World Bank
was to reimburse the Treasury of Brazil a share of expenses on conditional cash transfers
made under the BFP during the project period. Disbursement percentages in respect of
grants were to increase as key technical improvements, or milestones, were achieved.
2
  There was a problem with the project costing in the PAD. The amounts allocated to each individual
component, as presented in the sub-headings in this section and in the Annex, which are taken directly from
the PAD, total US$573.1 and not US$572.2 which was the Bank's loan amount.

                                                    3
The Program provided cash transfers ranging from R$15-95 (US$5-33) to target families.
(These figures were adjusted throughout implementation, as described later in this
report.) The exact transfer amount depended on income levels and household
consumption. These amounts were set with the goal of minimizing the number of people
benefiting from the previous programs that could either be excluded or face reduced
benefits under the integrated program. Monthly transfers were expected to average about
R$71 (US$24) per beneficiary family, significantly higher than average benefits of about
R$24 (US$8) in total for the previous programs. On a per capita basis, this represented
about 19 percent of the poverty line used by the World Bank, 12 percent of the poverty
line used by the Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada (IPEA), and 6 percent of the
minimum wage.

The transfers would be conditional on all relevant family members complying with key
human development conditionalities as part of an important policy shift towards focusing
assistance on the family (rather than on individuals), and on promoting synergies from
the simultaneous promotion of investments in health and education within a family.
Previous programs had provided support and conditionalities only for some individuals
within the family. Conditionalities under the BFP included compliance with: (a)
enrolment and regular school attendance of all children in the household aged 6-15 years
of age; (b) up-to-date vaccines for all children in the household aged 0-6 years of age;
and (c) pre-natal visits for pregnant women in the household.

Component 2: Strengthening the System for Identifying the Target Population
(US$4.4 million in project costs, including contingencies). This component was to
provide assistance to improve the mechanisms used to identify the target population of
the BFP, which constituted a basic element of the Program's architecture. A more
accurate system for identifying the target population was considered necessary for
achieving better redistributive efficiency, allowing a higher share of the Program's
resources going to the poor.

BFP, like its predecessors, selects beneficiaries from a national database of potentially
poor households called the "Cadastro Único". This component was to support activities
to strengthen the system for identifying the BFP's target population and overhaul the
Cadastro Único in several areas: (a) improving the strategic framework for the overall
system including conducting a study to identify other programs that could potentially use
the Cadastro for eligibility determination; (b) revising the eligibility criteria for the BFP
and the Cadastro questionnaire and data collection strategy, taking into account different
local realities reflecting urban vs. rural settings (including population and poverty
density) and diverse cultural, ethnic and racial characteristics of the population; (c)
reducing administrative errors in the Cadastro Único; and (d) strengthening the technical
and technological capacity of the Cadastro Único Unit in MDS to monitor, verify and use
the Cadastro Único, as well as the capacity of municipalities and other potential
cooperating institutions for carrying out data collection and beneficiary selection.




                                             4
Component 3: Developing a Monitoring and Evaluation System (US$7.0 million in
project costs, including contingencies). This component was to support the design and
implementation of a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system that constituted a key
element of the basic architecture of the Program, to which the Government assigned high
priority. The Project was to support: (a) the development of a strategy for the overall
M&E system and support for capacity building in MDS in this area; (b) the strengthening
of Bolsa Família's management information system (MIS) which would provide up-to-
date information on program activities and outputs; (c) the development of instruments to
monitor program processes to provide feedback on the quality of service delivery and
program implementation and to detect problems so that they can be corrected early,
including: (i) inter-governmental processes; (ii) annual Quality Control Reviews to
monitor BFP processes (including verification of health conditionalities, the selection of
beneficiaries, and payments); and (iii) support for mechanisms for citizen oversight
("social control") respecting socio-cultural and ethnic specificities of prospective
beneficiaries; and (d) the development, execution, and analysis of qualitative instruments
and quantitative surveys to monitor and evaluate key outcomes and the impact of the
Program at both the "territorial" (municipal and sub-municipal) and family levels.

Component 4: Institutional Strengthening (US$3.2 million in project costs, including
contingencies). This component was to strengthen the basic institutional functioning of
the BFP in terms of:

       Strengthening the operational institutional framework, including the legal
       architecture of the Program (developing needed regulations, operational
       guidelines, norms, etc. for the BFP and the Cadastro Único).
       Strengthening program management, including: (a) clarifying and strengthening
       institutional roles for the basic functioning of the Program itself, including
       developing a matrix of responsibilities, clarifying information flows for the
       Cadastro Único, and developing and implementing a system for verifying human
       conditionalities; (b) developing a strategy for operating the Program in remote
       areas; (c) defining possible mechanisms for inter-governmental partnerships to
       help in expanding the Program, by increasing the value of benefits, and/or
       expanding coverage, and linking BFP beneficiaries to complementary services;
       and (d) developing an inter-municipal information network to share good
       practices, experiences with implementing conditional cash transfers and the BFP
       across municipalities.
       Developing a solid communications and dissemination strategy with consideration
       of culturally and ethnically diverse publics, including: (a) establishing a "hotline"
       number with trained operators to answer questions on the Program and the
       Cadastro Único (for the general public, beneficiaries, local program operators,
       other officials, etc.); and (b) designing, printing and disseminating information
       booklets for beneficiaries (including information about benefits and
       conditionalities).
       Supporting the identification and evaluation of initiatives to help BFP
       beneficiaries to develop tailored empowerment strategies and to gain access to
       complementary programs and services (bridging services). These initiatives could

                                            5
       involve various approaches, including: (a) social worker support to help
       beneficiaries develop these empowerment strategies and bridging access to
       complementary services; (b) the development of "one-stop-shops" where
       beneficiaries could gain access to information about a variety of social services
       (including the BFP). To learn from similar experiences at the local level in Brazil
       and in other countries, the following was also to be supported: (a) international
       study tours and exchanges to share information on these various empowerment
       and bridging approaches; (b) consultancies and workshops to identify and
       evaluate such approaches; and (c) training and capacity building for beneficiaries,
       trainers and program managers.

Component 5: Project Management (US$0.7 million in project costs, including
contingencies).     The Project was also to support a strengthening of MDS'
implementation capacity, through financing of incremental costs related to management
and supervision of project activities, consultants' services that would support strategic,
technical and operational aspects of the Project, equipment and travel expenses.

1.6 Revised Components

The Project's components were not revised during implementation, although the target
beneficiaries and the value of the cash transfers were adjusted in response to experience
in implementation and external events, as described in Section 2.2 below.

1.7 Other significant changes

The loan's original December 31, 2006 Closing Date was extended two times.
Disbursements under Component 1, Cash Transfers, were concluded by the loan's
original Closing Date. However, although progress towards both sets of milestones
under the Project's Results Framework (see Section 2.1) had been met, less than US$3
million had been disbursed for expenditures under the Project's technical components. In
May 2007, the Bank agreed to a first Closing Date extension until December 31, 2008.
A second extension of the loan's Closing Date to December 31, 2009 was agreed on
December, 17 2008 to allow continued financing of two key technical assistance
contracts for a first follow-up impact evaluation of the BFP and development and
implementation of the Management Information System, the procurement of which had
been delayed (Section 2.4). As part of this second extension, US$1.5 million allocated to
the technical assistance components was cancelled. Then, in a letter dated November 24,
2009, the Bank agreed to a further cancellation of US$4 million in technical assistance
funds, in response to the Government's request since it had become clear that these funds
would not be utilized before the then eminent Closing Date. The small amount of funds
remaining undisbursed in the loan account on April 30, 2010--the date when the four
month grace period for disbursements expires--will be cancelled.

On June 20, 2006 the Bank agreed to a reallocation of loan proceeds among categories to
increase the amount allocated to capacity building activities and activities related to
beneficiaries' emancipation.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

With the Government's strengthened emphasis on poverty and social development, the
Bolsa Família Program rapidly became its flagship social initiative. As a result, the
Project was at the center of one of the core pillars of the Bank's FY04-07 CAS---
Achieving a More Equitable Brazil. It was also closely aligned with the Millennium
Development Goals, contributing directly to the reduction of poverty and inequality, and
the demand-side incentives it provided contributed to reducing malnutrition, achieving
universal education, reducing child mortality and improving maternal health.

Background Analysis. At the Government's request, from March 2003, the Bank
provided significant technical assistance on the conceptualization and design of social
assistance reform under the umbrella of the Brazil Social Assistance Program (BRASA,
EW-P078828-ESW), a programmatic ESW/AAA program. BRASA provided, inter alia,
assistance on the overall design of an integrated program, issues pertaining to the system
for identifying and selecting beneficiaries, and monitoring and evaluation of the Program.
Project preparation counted heavily on and proceeded in parallel to the technical
assistance provided under the BRASA.

Project preparation also built upon and complemented the assistance under: (a) the then
ongoing Human Development Programmatic Sector Reform Loan (HD PSRL) program
which was supporting actions to enhance equity, improve the quality and efficiency of
social programs, and increase accountability in the social sectors; and (b) the then
proposed HD Technical Assistance Loan which aimed to assist the Government in
developing institutional capacity to monitor the progress and impact of its social policies
and support the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) to strengthen their
household survey system for purposes of monitoring and evaluating social policy,
including the generation of data that would be needed for monitoring and evaluating the
performance of the BFP.

Incorporating Lessons Learned. At the time of preparation, the Bank had already
acquired technical expertise in the strengthening of targeting systems, developing
monitoring and evaluation systems for CCTs, and in promoting the types of institutional
innovations that were being considered for the BFP. As a result, lessons from previous
experiences with CCTs, both in Brazil (Bolsa Escola) and in other countries (e.g.,
Colombia, Mexico) were incorporated in the Project's design. These included the need
to: (a) have in place an effective system for identifying and selecting beneficiaries to
improve the impact of transfer programs on poverty and inequality; (b) address possible
concerns about cash subsidies being viewed as "assistentialist" by linking assistance to
desirable behaviors (conditions) and giving the transfers to mothers whose decisions
regarding the intra-household allocation of resources often favor children's nutrition,
health and education, as well as linking beneficiaries to other complementary services
that could help them "grow" out of poverty; and (c) have strong monitoring and
evaluation systems to guide the fine tuning of programs during implementation. These
lessons were incorporated in the Project's design through specific activities to strengthen
                                            7
the system for identifying the target population of the BFP and overhaul the Cadastro
Único in several key areas (Component 2), to develop a monitoring and evaluation
system (Component 3) and to support the identification and evaluation of initiatives to
help BFP beneficiaries develop tailored empowerment strategies and gain access to
complementary programs and services (Component 4).

Assessment of Risks. Project preparation also identified some significant risks that could
affect the BFP, in part based on the lessons of international experience described above.
Of these, the most significant risks, classified as "substantial", were those related to
beneficiary selection that could result in possible high rates of leakages to the non-poor
and possible exclusion of some of the poor from the Program, especially during electoral
periods when the potential risk of political manipulation could increase. Municipal
capacity to implement Cadastro data collection for the selection of beneficiaries and/or
verification of conditionalities was also considered "substantial".            Throughout
preparation and review, concern had been raised as to whether to proceed with large-scale
assistance in the absence of a strong system beneficiary identification and selection, even
though the Project's design included activities to strengthen the Cadastro Único during
implementation. To address these concerns, the Project's design incorporated a
mechanism to pace disbursements against cash transfers (Component 1) to technical
improvements in the Program. As described later in this ICR, this risk did not
materialize, even with the fast scaling up of the BFP, and the Program's targeting
effectiveness is similar to that of other programs such as Mexico's Oportunidades and
Chile's Subsidio Unico Familiar (SUF).

Assessment of Project Design. The Project's design was innovative in several ways, and
responsive to the Government's specific requests regarding the framing of the financing
package. First, the Project was designed as a program-based Sector-Wide Approach
(SWAp) that integrated Bank financing with a high priority program that was
consolidating the main federal conditional cash transfer programs as a comprehensive
sector policy. The Bank's requirements for financial management and monitoring of the
Project relied exclusively upon Government systems that were being strengthened under
the Project and that would strengthen the BFP as a whole. The Indigenous Peoples
Development Plan prepared, consulted and disclosed during preparation, applied to the
entirely of the BFP. As such, Bank financing which was estimated during preparation to
provide funding equivalent to less than 10 percent of the Program's project costs, had an
impact on the content and performance of the entire program.

Second, in order to address concerns about providing significant support to a program
that had then only recently been established, in addition to its longer-term design
perspective as a two-stage Adaptable Program Loan (APL) with triggers to move to the
second stage, project design incorporated an innovative feature to pace disbursements
against cash transfers to progress in technical improvements to the BFP. Loan proceeds
under Component 1 were to be made with disbursement percentages that would increase
as actions against two sets of "milestones"----representing step-by-step technical
improvements to the Cadastro Único---were met. Reimbursement against cash transfers



                                            8
under Component 1 were to start at a rate of 8 percent, increasing to 9 percent and then
11 percent when the second stage and third stage milestones, respectively, were met.

The pacing of disbursements for Component 1 with technical improvements to the
Program supported under Components 2-4 had several objectives. First, it would allow
the Bank to provide large-scale up-front support to the BFP, responding to the request of
an important middle-income client for support to its flagship program, even though the
Program was still seen to require strengthening in key areas. This was seen as all the
more important since the Bank's assistance was being prepared and would be
implemented in a complex environment where four independent CCTs were being
merged, and at the same time a major institutional reform to create the MDS was being
carried out. Second, it promoted synergies between direct support for the Program's
implementation and the consolidation of several safety nets into the BFP and the
technical activities that were designed to strengthen the Program's architecture. Finally, it
created incentives to the executing agency to meet the milestones, which were designed
to be on a critical path for, inter alia, a strong beneficiary targeting system, and to the
central government agencies to ensure support for the technical activities that the
milestones represented.

The framing of the Project's objectives was extremely cautious, and rightly so in view of
the fact that it would support the start-up and scale-up of a new program that was to be
implemented by a newly established federal institution in coordination with other federal-
level institutions and those of lower levels of government on a national scale. While
there had been some experience with CCTs at the time, there was nowhere near the
experience that has been acquired today, given the increased reliance on these programs
as a pillar of social safety nets. Instead of defining overly ambitious objectives with
respect to targets for poverty reduction or improvements in inequality or social outcomes,
the Project's objectives and its associated results indicators were framed to monitor and
measure intermediate outcomes in terms of targeted program coverage, compliance with
sectoral conditionalities and institutional actions that would be necessary to meet broader
Program objectives in the longer term.

2.2 Implementation

The Project's implementation was smooth, albeit suffering slight delays in the contracting
of a few technical assistance activities. As described above, its objectives were clear,
realistic and of high priority for the country, and focused on the outcomes for which it
could reasonably achieve by completion.

By the conclusion of the first phase, the MDS had met all of the progress benchmarks for
all the milestones set in the Project's results framework. The Bank certified completion
and documentation for the first set, which allowed the disbursement percentage for
Component 1 to increase from eight percent to nine percent. By mid-2006, only two
years after approval of the Bank's loan, the Government had met the conditions of the
second set of milestones, which would have further raised the disbursement rate to 11
percent; however, the funds allocated to Component 1 had been fully disbursed by then.


                                             9
In the results framework, these milestones represented cumulative progress for the
triggers for the second phase of the APL.

There were no factors outside of the Government's control that affected implementation,
although the food and oil prices increases, and the international economic and financial
crisis, prompted adjustments to the BFP to ensure that these would not impact adversely
the previous improvements in living standards of the poor. There were, however, several
factors subject to Government control, and these generally impacted the Project's
implementation positively.        First, the Government maintained an unrelenting
commitment to the BFP, and to the achievement of the Program's broad objectives
throughout implementation (and to this day). It prioritized the approval of the Program's
legal framework, including the creation of the MDS and the assignment of required staff.
Sound macroeconomic policies throughout implementation allowed the Government to
assign the planned amount of resources to the Program, and even to update the value of
the benefits, adjusting their structure and modifying the design of incentives and target
beneficiaries to address the changing economic and social context as well as policy
priorities.

The value and structure of benefits provided to beneficiaries as adjusted throughout
implementation is presented in Annex 2. After updating the value of benefits in July
2007, the Government in June 2008, adjusted the structure of the BFP's benefits to
encourage completion of secondary education, in addition to the original basic,
education; the Program expanded age requirements for school attendance from 15 to 17
years of age and introduced an additional payment of R$33 per youth aged 16 and 17.
This adjustment was introduced in response to experience with implementation at the
time that suggested it would be important to increase basic education completion rates
and improve schooling opportunities of secondary school-aged youth. Since 2008, Bolsa
Família has also played a key role as a safety net mitigating the impact of the food and
oil prices, and more recently of the economic downturn. This occurred through two
channels: (a) increasing benefit amounts to avoid their erosion by food price inflation;
and (b) expanding the beneficiary lists to include a vulnerability dimension introducing
income volatility as part of the selection criteria. Second, in 2009, as an ex-ante risk
management tool to cushion the economic slowdown, the BFP revised its estimation of
potential beneficiaries based on the new IBGE poverty maps and vulnerability analysis
by IPEA on the Monthly Labor Force Survey.3 As a result, the target number of
beneficiary families increased by 1.8 million; of these, 1.3 million were to be registered
between May and October 2009.

The implementing agency, MDS, performed very well, especially in view of the fact that
it had only been created when implementation began. It expeditiously reached out to
partners in the BFP's implementation, the Caixa Econômica Federal, the Ministries of
Education and Health, the municipalities, IBGE, and other agencies, public and private,

3
  Under the current methodology, the information collected by the survey captures the family income
during the previous month only. The new methodology intends to capture the volatility of income, which
will affect families near the poverty line in particular.


                                                 10
that had a role in Program, or that could contribute to its solidification as an efficient and
effective one. It routinely sought the Bank's technical assistance, and that financed under
the Project, and used it effectively for the Program's and the institution's strengthening.
MDS from the start incorporated monitoring and evaluation as an integral component in
the functioning of the BFP, relying on its strategic alliance with the Instituto de Pesquisa
Econômica Aplicada---IPEA for rigorous studies and analysis that provided input for
maintaining the relevance of the Program's parameters.

Despite minor delays in contracting staff on occasion, and in procurement of a few
technical assistance activities, including for the consolidation of the MIS, as described in
Section 2.4, MDS performed well, and consolidated its role as a key federal agency
responsible for social assistance programs. These delays were not caused by incomplete
preparation of the Project, unrealistic implementation schedules, or technical difficulties.
To the contrary, they resulted from a lack of experience with Bank procurement
processes---to which the Bank responded by providing support and workshops for key
staff---complicated procedures at the federal level for procuring technical assistance, and
eventually resorting to a procurement agent whose own procedures did little to expedite
the process.

In the end, approximately 50 percent of the funds allocated for technical assistance were
not utilized for the following reasons: (i) lack of qualified procurement staff at the MDS;
(ii) MDS' institutional reform in 2004-05, which delayed implementation of the technical
assistance; (iii) lack of familiarity with Bank procurement procedures; and (iv) delays
caused by the agency contracted to carry out procurement of international biddings.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The MDS has developed under the Project a comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) System. The Government assigned high priority to close monitoring and
evaluation of the BFP since the Program's establishment in 2004, and hence the Project
included a separate component (Component 3) to support the design and implementation
of a comprehensive M&E System. The establishment of Secretariat for Evaluation and
Information Management (SAGI) within MDS constituted a decisive and innovative step
for policymaking, assessment and evaluation of social policies. Until then, no Ministry
or central agency in Brazil had an autonomous body to carry out such activities. Under
the Project, SAGI was institutionally and technically strengthened to increase relevance
in the MDS' decision-making process. M&E activities supported by the Project, which
were developed and used extensively to ensure expected outcomes throughout
implementation, are described in detail in Section 3.2 and in Annex 13.

In MDS, monitoring is a regular on-going process performed on all programs using
administrative (universal) data and sought to adjust and improve programs under
implementation. Given its importance as the Government's flagship social program, the
MDS opted for contracting-out the impact evaluation for BFP to an external specialized
firm, formed by a consortium of an internationally credible research organization and a



                                             11
local research group. This was in addition to a strengthened series of operational audits
by the Tribunal de Contas da União since the beginning of the program.

SAGI has also developed a set of mechanisms to follow the day-to-day information on
key Ministerial strategies, and provide useful information and feedback to program
managers and decision makers, including: (i) the Social Information Matrix, which
provides internal and external information, and is a computer tool that stores data,
information and indicators of social programs; (ii) the Social Atlas, which presents
cartographic and data information on specific programs; (iii) monitoring cards, based on
web-based questionnaires for following up the operation status of the CRAS (Social
Assistance Reference Centers); and (iv) geo-referencing of social programs, among other
tools. SAGI and SENARC run an extensive program of capacity building for municipal
and state managers of the program.

Beyond the evidence generated by the BFP, the MDS has also made significant
contributions to help advance the culture and institutionalization of M&E in Brazil, as
described in Annex 13.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards.  In view of the Project's country scope, and the existence of a large group of
Indigenous and Quilombola (afro-descendents) populations in the country, OP 4.20 (at
the time being revised as OP 4.10) was triggered, and an Indigenous Peoples
Development Plan was prepared and consulted during preparation. The Government
introduced innovative and pragmatic strategies to increase the access and participation of
the most vulnerable groups in Bolsa Família, respecting their beliefs, cultural identity and
traditional values. In 2004, as the program started, it was nearly impossible to identify
Quilombola and Indigenous beneficiaries in the registries since they were not recognized
as such in the registration form.
As described in greater detail in Annex 14, the BFP has made significant progress in
registering indigenous and Quilombola beneficiaries, based on self-identification;
ensuring that operational processes run smoothly even in remote areas; and ensuring
enough flexibility about compliance with conditionalities to take into account specific
health and education modalities for Indigenous and Quilombola communities and the
availability of social services in remote areas. The Program has made steady progress in
registering Indigenous families: from 29,000 in March 2006 to 71,000 in January 2009,
of which 59,000 were program beneficiaries. The Program has also greatly increased its
coverage of Quilombola families: from 6,400 in October 2006 to 26,000 in January
2009, of which 21,000 were program beneficiaries.

To reach out to these groups, in 2005, the MDS created a Working Group on Traditional
Populations and Communities. Then, in 2008, the Cadastro Único created a specific
unit, responding directly to the management of the National Secretariat for Citizens'
Income (SENARC) in MDS that is responsible for all tasks pertaining to the registry of
Indigenous and Quilombola families, as well as other traditional people. MDS has also
set-up partnerships with various governmental and non-governmental agencies (NGOs)

                                            12
that work with Indigenous peoples, such as the Fundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI, in
charge of the Indigenous Policy of the Government), the Fundação Nacional de Saúde
(FUNASA, in charge of Indigenous health services) and national and regional federations
of Indigenous organizations. Similarly, it has set up partnerships with government
agencies and NGOs that work with Quilombolas. All of the materials to promote access
and benefits for the Indigenous and Quilombola communities are published on MDS'
website.
Innovations have been included in the 2008 registration packages to ensure families are
knowledgeable about the benefits, eligibility, conditionalities, and exit strategies. The
processes have been codified in operational rules, regulations and guidelines from the
MDS. The new registration form for Cadastro Único includes specific self-identification
questions in the first section of the questionnaire, as well as additional questions to
register ethnicity (Indigenous) and community (Quilombos) together with specific
guides-- targeted to municipal managers, program staff and other service providers who
operate directly with the communities for the registration of Indigenous and Quilombola
families.
Fiduciary: Financial Management. All financial management aspects of the BFP were
managed by MDS staff in collaboration with staff in the Secretaria do Tesouro Nacional
(the Treasury), using Brazil's systems and existing organizational arrangements. Within
MDS, financial management was managed by the PIU in coordination with other staff of
the Operations Department of the SENARC). For financial management, MDS used the
Government's existing Sistema Integrado de Administração Financeira (SIAFI) for
accounting, financial reporting and budget execution of program expenditures, and
transferred resources to the Caixa Econômica Federal (CEF), a public bank supported by
over 30,000 payment points where families could collect their benefits within 90 days of
payments using electronic debit cards issued to them. Throughout implementation, there
were no issues or concerns with respect to the Project's financial management. Annual
audits submitted in compliance with the terms of Bank financing were routinely delivered
in a timely manner and contained unqualified opinions.
Since 2005, the Government has taken many steps to strengthen oversight and control
mechanisms for the BFP. Numerous decrees and regulations have been passed
establishing responsibilities for oversight and controls at various levels of government.
Oversight and control of Bolsa Família program operates at three levels: the oversight
network (or Rede de Fiscalização) at the Federal level includes agencies from the
executive and legislative branches (Controladoria Geral da União, Tribunal de Contas
da União, respectively) as well as the public independent control agency (Ministerio
Público). Program controls at the MDS include internal and external cross checks of the
Cadastro Único, three hot lines (at the Caixa, the Program and SENARC), monitoring of
municipal performance and the Índice de Gestão Descentralizada, and monitoring the
Caixa Econômica. At the municipal level, all 5,564 municipalities have developed social
control councils that despite scope for improvement in efficiency and effectiveness, are
thought to be an important mechanism for monitoring the BFP by providing citizen
oversight--and local points of contact for complaints and appeals. The names of BFP
beneficiaries are made public and published on MDS' website.

                                           13
Fiduciary: Procurement. The Project required procurement of only goods and services
under the technical and project management components (Components 2-5). The
Project's procurement risk assessment during preparation had identified its procurement
risk as high in view of the fact that MDS had only recently been established and had no
significant experience with procurement under Bank-financed operations. To mitigate
this risk, MDS was to retain two procurement specialists, and also to contract an external
procurement agency to reinforce its capacity. Other activities were identified to minimizr
the risk that procurement would affect implementation. Delays in procurement were the
only identified risk that materialized, resulting in eventual implementation delays (not,
however, related to the compliance with milestones that assured a required basic
architecture of the Program) and the need for extensions to the loan's Closing Date.
From the start, MDS had difficulties in recruiting staff to handle procurement, and early
on it became clear that the hiring of a procurement agent helped very little, if at all, in
expediting the processes specially those of contracting consultants and firms through
international bidding, processes that took up to more than six months to be completed.
Internal changes in the MDS affected the hiring of agreed specialists. In the end, two
important contracts were awarded for: the impact evaluation of the Program and the
consolidation of the existing Management Information System. Work under these
contracts is well advanced, although it is likely that the tasks will only be completed after
the loan's Closing Date. Therefore, the Government will finance the final payments with
its own resources. With the cancellation made on May 7, 2010 in the amount of US$
2,163,330.95, the Loan Account has been closed.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

After only slightly over five years since Bolsa Família has been established, the Program
has been grounded as the Government's main social safety net instrument, and as an
instrument that has been proven to deliver intended results. As described in Section 3.2
below, the Government has shown that the Program can have an extremely positive
impact on the welfare of poor families while investing in the conditions that will lead
them out of poverty in the future. As a result, the Program is well institutionalized at the
core of Brazil's system of social protection. Still, important challenges remain to
consolidate the BFP in two broad areas: (a) further strengthening the program's
architecture, including streamlining processes and operations, especially at the local
level; and (b) developing stronger links to other social interventions and employment and
skills development opportunities, as a potential gateway for beneficiary families to escape
from poverty.

Now that the basic architecture of the BFP is firmly established, and MDS consolidated
as a well-functioning and established institution, future priorities will focus on
strengthening the Program's local implementation and management. While the BFP has
institutionalized a process of continuous self-assessment and has improved its
implementation and institutional arrangements in diverse areas of operation, future
challenges include improving payments logistics, especially in rural areas, and
identifying further obstacles to capture non-traditional beneficiaries. Another challenge


                                             14
is to strengthen local governments' capacities to implement a comprehensive system for
verifying conditionalities through their Secretariats of Health and Education.

The Government assigns high priority to scaling up and consolidating the strategy to link
the BFP's adult beneficiaries with productive inclusion, income generation opportunities
and skills development, to increase employability interventions. The Program with the
help of the new Cadastro Único has made significant progress in linking registered
families with other social programs. At federal level, this process has been facilitated by
MDS' responsibility in managing other key federal social programs. At the same time,
many municipalities and states have already linked their own interventions to families
registered in the Cadastro Único and beneficiaries of the BFP. States and municipalities
that have their own conditional transfers programs are invited to sign an agreement with
MDS called Termo de Cooperação by which they unify benefits under a single automatic
electronic card. By doing this MDS looks to avoid duplications and reduce administrative
costs. On the basis of these efforts, the Government has already started to institutionalize
a formal strategy to connect BFP beneficiaries with interventions that offer an effective
gateway to exit poverty. 
 
While the Government's political and financial commitment to the BFP is virtually
guaranteed, it has requested Bank assistance to address the BFP's future challenges under
the second phase of the APL. The APL Program had contemplated a US$520.2 million
loan (including US$10 million to support technical assistance) in support of its second
phase, but, given Brazil's improved fiscal situation, the Government requested that the
loan be limited to US$200 million, of which US$15 million would finance a stronger
program of technical assistance. In addition, the Government committed additional
US$15 million, extending the implementation period to five years. While the first phase
focused on consolidating the BFP, the second phase APL is focused on fine-tuning some
of the BFP's key innovative elements, strengthening evaluation and making further
progress on the Program's integration with states' interventions. As a result, the
Government requested a stronger program of technical assistance under the second phase
of the APL. The APL had established triggers for moving forward with support for the
Program's second phase, which were complied or surpassed. These are presented
together with the objectives and general description of the second phase APL in Annex
10.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The relevance of the Project's objectives, design and implementation was extremely high.
Its development objectives are unquestionably consistent with Brazil's current
development priorities, with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies, and
with corporate goals, both at the time it was designed and at present. The Project's
objectives are consistent with the Government's continued strategy to reduce poverty and
inequality while fostering economic development, which continues to be the centerpiece
of its economic and social development priorities. In this framework, Bolsa Família

                                            15
continues to be the Government's most important intervention, providing regular cash
and food aid to Brazil's estimated 48 million people living in poverty.

During its first term, President Lula's administration maintained a dual strategy of both
promoting and maintaining economic growth, and also stimulating social progress to
tackle the challenges of inequality. The latter was substantially improved by the
consolidation, expansion, and improvements in the BFP. In its second term, which began
in early 2007, the current administration launched a renewed push for economic
development and faster growth, as well as actions to further strengthen social policy and
ensure that the recent gains in equity are sustainable, especially to weather the current
economic slowdown. The Government has paid special attention to: (a) consolidating
Bolsa Família at the core of its social safety net strategy; (b) complementing it with other
social protection initiatives beyond conditional cash transfer programs; and (c) enhancing
the program's processes to serve as a gateway for other income generation and skills
development interventions at federal and state level, and also to help address some of the
negative impacts of recent shocks.

In this way, the Project's objectives are at the center of one of the core pillars of the
Bank's current CPS, namely, Achieving a More Equitable Brazil. The Bank's strategy
mirrors the Brazilian Government's objective of reducing inequality by combining social
progress with economic stability. The CPS states that the Bank's support focuses on
reaching the poorest and achieving higher levels of quality and efficiency in social
services, which was an important focus of the Project. It addressed directly the three
main goals under this CPS pillar: namely, reducing extreme poverty, vulnerability and
social exclusion. The Project was complemented during implementation, by a strong
program of Analytical and Advisory Services (AAA) including: (a) the programmatic
Brazil Social Assistance AAA program, "BRASA", which focused on providing
technical assistance in the design of the BFP's targeting, and monitoring and evaluation
systems; (b) the Brazil Evaluation AAA "BRAVA", program, which supported both the
Program's impact evaluation as well as capacity strengthening for the Ministry of Social
Development for M&E; and (c) the Labor AAA, which focuses on the labor-supply
impacts of transfers and on active labor market programs aimed at improving the
employability of at-risk groups and promoting graduation from welfare programs.

The Project's objectives were also closely aligned with corporate priorities of achieving
the Millennium Development Goals in particular, MDG1, the reduction of poverty,
hunger and malnutrition, and achieving universal primary education (MDG2) and
reducing child mortality (MDG4) and maternal mortality (MDG5).

The Project's design responded directly to the Government's previous and current
development priorities. The BFP had only recently been established when the Bank's
financing became effective. The Government valued and requested the international
perspective and technical advice that the Bank brought to its effort towards strengthening
the Program, and the Bank's support, which inter alia brought lessons of experience to
the BFP, undoubtedly strengthened its credibility. By designing Bank assistance with
disbursements paced to technical improvements in the Program, and by structuring Bank

                                            16
assistance in the form of a SWAp, the Project's design leveraged Bank assistance and
provided an effective vehicle for responding to the Government's request for assistance
in technical strengthening applied to the entirety of the BFP. As per its design, the
Project did not impact a carved-out project, per se, but the establishment and
strengthening of a major Government program that will undoubtedly continue, regardless
of any future assistance. The framing of the Project's development objectives was
cautious, being careful to frame expected outcomes and associated targets in terms of
what could be reasonably accomplished during the projected implementation period.

Because the design of Bank assistance focused on a program, as opposed to a project, it
was possible during implementation for the BFP and the Bank's implementation support
to be flexible and responsive to the Government's changing priorities and realities,
without the need for formal restructuring of the Project's objectives. For example, in
2008, the Government expanded age requirements for school attendance from 15 to 17
years, and introduced an addition transfer payment of R$304 per youth aged 16-17 years.
This modification was introduced---without the need for a restructuring of the Project---
in order to improve schooling of secondary school-aged youths and increase basic
education completion rates.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The Project was successful in achieving its objectives. The Project's objectives were
carefully framed, yet the Project was able in all cases to meet and in many cases exceed
the expectations that had been established during preparation of the APL Program and the
Project. Progress towards achievement of the Project's Development Objectives is as
follows:

                     Table1: Progress towards Project Development Objectives

Overall Results for the Bolsa Família Program (2004-2009--Reaching Beyond the
Project's Expected Outcomes. Over the last six years, the BFP has demonstrated
impressive progress in terms of its coverage (nationwide, urban and rural, non-
Indigenous, Indigenous and Quilombola populations), which make it the largest
conditional cash transfer program in the world today. Moreover, the Program has
demonstrated significant positive impact in terms of outputs and outcomes, while its
institutional arrangements, coordination mechanisms at horizontal (sector) and vertical
(states and municipalities), as well as mechanisms to improve control, oversight,
transparency and accountability have achieved significant progress in their consolidation.

Furthermore, the BFP has developed an ongoing self-assessment process which not only
has allowed a continuous fine-tuning of the Program's basic processes, but also the
development of innovative features, such as the modernization of the Cadastro Único, the
payment mechanisms through electronic cards, the Index of Decentralized Management
(IGD), the Observatory of Good Practices, and the systems to monitor conditionalities at
the local level. While designed to foster medium-term improvements in human capital,
the Program has proven that it represents also an effective mechanism to channel
resources to the extreme poor to offset the impact of chronic poverty as well as temporary
crises, by providing incentives to dissuade families from cutting their investment in
education and health in the face of unexpected economic difficulties. The Bolsa Família
Program today is a well-consolidated intervention at the core of Brazil's social protection
strategy, and is solidly institutionalized in the MDS, that has become an effective
institution overseeing this and other social programs.

Responding to high expectations of social progress and to poverty estimates, the
Government rapidly expanded coverage of Bolsa Família from 3.6 million families in
2003 to 11.1 million families (about 45 million people and 25 percent of the Brazilian
population) in June 2006.5 Currently, Bolsa Família reaches more than 12 million
families and 48 million beneficiaries in all of Brazil's 5564 municipalities. Following the
2009 modification to the parameters used to select beneficiaries in response to the
economic slowdown, the number of beneficiary families is expected to reach 12.9 million
by the end of 2010.

The BFP has achieved a very good targeting of beneficiaries. About 90 percent of the
Program's benefits go to families in the poorest two quintiles and 68 percent go to those
in the poorest quintile (PNAD, 2008). Despite the Program's rapid expansion between
2003 and 2006 (when it reached 11 million families), it has proven to be very effective in
reaching the poorest. In fact, recent rigorous evaluations have shown that Bolsa Família
is among the best-targeted conditional cash transfer programs in the world, with very
little leakage of benefits to the non-poor.

5
  The original target population of the BFP was 11.2 million poor families, based on a poverty line of
R$120 in per capita family income. However, the latest household survey data point to a significant
reduction in the poverty rate. With the new poverty line of R$137, the new target population for the BFP is
12.9 million families.


                                                    18
Although the Impact Evaluation of the BFP is still being carried out, some important
impacts of the Program are already apparent. Evidence on household-level impacts is
available from: (a) the annual household survey (PNAD, 2006 and 2008); and (b) the
results of the baseline of the multi-year longitudinal impact evaluation. Furthermore, the
BFP has been assessed extensively by external agencies, showing in most cases
significant positive impacts.

Impact on Poverty and Inequality. From 2003, Brazil's poverty rates and inequality
began decreasing steadily, reversing the continuously worsening trends of the previous
decades. Brazil has made significant progress in reducing poverty, lowering inequality,
and improving the development opportunities of its vulnerable populations. Between
2003 and 2008, the absolute poverty rate dropped from 39 to 25 percent, while extreme
poverty6 declined from 17.5 to 8.8 percent of the population. Similar progress was
achieved in reducing inequality: Brazil's Gini coefficient fell by 7.0 percent in only
seven years, from a long-time high of 0.596 percent in 2001 to 0.548 in 2008, stabilizing
at its lowest level in the last three decades--one of the best performances in LAC and,
indeed, globally. As a result, Brazil reached the 2015 target for MDG1, to eradicate
extreme poverty and hunger in 2006.

Combined with the effects of sustained, albeit not spectacular growth, the BFP proved to
be an effective instrument in reducing the gap between the rich and poor. Estimates
indicate that the net impact of the BFP between 2003 and 2008 explains about one sixth
of the reduction of the extreme poverty incidence in Brazil. It is estimated that Bolsa
Família contributed with about 35 percent in the reduction of the extreme poverty gap
(P1) and about 47 percent in the reduction of the severity of poverty (squared poverty
gap-P2). Furthermore, Bolsa Família accounted for about 15 percent of the fall in
inequality between 2003 and 2008. As expected, the Program's impact in reducing
poverty and inequality among the lowest income quintile was much higher, accounting
for about 35 percent in the increase in per capita income and 32 percent in the reduction
in inequality in the same period.

Recent studies also suggest that the BFP may have had a significant economic impact on
the fiscal situation of Brazilian municipalities. A study by the Instituto de Ensino e
Pesquisa (INSER) published in 2009 showed that the monthly transfers made by the
Federal Government to beneficiaries in Brazil's 5564 municipalities have increased the
local GDP. The study calculated that, on average, a 10 percent expansion in the number
of Bolsa Família beneficiaries increased municipalities' revenues in more than one
percent while a 10 percent increase in the amount of the monthly transfer increased local
6
  Brazil does not have an official poverty line and research institutions use different poverty lines that lead
to different poverty numbers. IPEA's extreme poverty line was established at $R$65 or lower, depending
on the region and area of residence (urban, rural), yielding an extreme poverty rate of eight percent. IPEA
calculates the full poverty line as twice the level of the extreme poverty at R$130, resulting in a poverty
rate of 23 percent. This value is close to that being used by the Government in their documents. (IPEA;
Metodologia na determinação das linhas de pobreza e indigência (por insuficiência no consumo de
calorias por dia).


                                                      19
revenue by 1.36 percent. According to the INSER study, the BFP contributed to a
reduction in the fiscal dependency of most municipalities on the Federal Government,
which had been a matter of concern in the previous decades.
The INSER study also estimated the impact of the BFP on Brazil's GDP in 2006, when
the Program's budget was close to US$3.4 billion. That allocation, which was more than
30 percent higher than the Program's allocation in 2005, may have increased Brazil's
GDP by 1.8 percent in 2006.

Impact on Human Capital Development: Consumption, Health, Nutrition and
Education. Results in terms of human capital development are equally positive when
measured on the basis of utilization of education and health service providers. By July
2009 about 17 million 6-17 year old children and adolescents benefited from the
education benefits and close to 10 million pre-school children and their mothers from the
health benefit. The program monitors compliance with the education co-responsibility for
15.2 million children (6-15 year old). Within this age group, 87.4 percent had a rate of
compliance of at least 85 percent with the attendance and enrollment condition. In
addition, 1.9 million 16-18 year old youths were registered for the Beneficio Variavel
Jovem. Compliance with school attendance for these youths reached 76.7 percent (1.45
million youths) in the June/July 2009 period. Although reporting has improved in recent
years, only about 63 percent of the families verified compliance with the health co-
responsibility (6.1 million from a total of 9.7 million families receiving the health
benefit); from those over 98 percent complied with the health co-responsibility in 2008
(5.6 million), while the remaining two percent partially complied with the condition.
Almost 68 percent of children of beneficiary families had their vaccinations monitored by
health authorities. Overall, less than 0.5 percent of registered families' benefits are
cancelled annually for failing to comply with co-responsibilities since the program seeks
to guarantee beneficiaries participation.
One of the most unequivocal positive impacts of the BFP has been the marked reductions
in food insecurity and increases in consumption among poor beneficiary families for
whom consumption increased as a share of total spending, especially in food
consumption, education, and children's clothing. For each real received as a transfer, 62
cents were spent on food, as opposed to 24 for non-beneficiaries. Different studies show
that between 74 and 85 percent of families have not only increased overall food
consumption, but have also enhanced the quality and variety of food consumed, the
number of daily meals, and the quantity of children's food. An evaluation of Bolsa
Família by the Ministry of Health showed that the BFP beneficiary families' diets were
5.1 percent more diverse than that of non-beneficiaries'. These improvements may have
had important effects on reducing malnutrition, and consequently stunting and wasting in
children. The baseline study showed no significant impact of the Program in terms of
malnutrition.
Preliminary results in education show that the impact of the program is more significant
in secondary education, where beneficiaries of Bolsa Familia reached over 80 percent
compared with 72 percent of non-beneficiaries. In primary education, total spending on
educational inputs increased and other educational indicators, such as attendance, showed

                                           20
improvements. For children 7-14 years of age, participation in the BFP increased the
likelihood of school attendance by 3.6 percentage points, while this increase was 7.1
percent in the Northeast region. Another study showed that in the long run, enrollment
rates increased about 13 percent.     Despite these positive results with respect to
attendance, the impact on education outcomes has been less than expected, since this
depends also importantly on parallel efforts to improve the quality of education.
Evaluations and other recent assessments show differing results regarding grade
promotion and repetition.

The Intermediate Results that Supported the BFP's (and the Project's) Outcomes. In
addition to the actual financing of monthly transfers to targeted beneficiaries under
Component 1, these impacts and results were made possible in large part by the important
results achieved in the institutional framework for social sector assistance, which was
supported by the Project through its three technical assistance components (Components
2-4) and project management component (Component 5), each of which had intermediate
outcome indicators to measure progress towards the eventual accomplishment of the
Project's objectives.      The Project's progress towards intermediate results, by
Component, is described in detail in Annex 2.

3.3 Efficiency

The BFP increased dramatically Brazil's spending on social assistance, but undoubtedly
increased the efficiency in public social spending. A more detailed description of the
increased efficiency promoted by the BFP is provided in Annex 3.

Before 2001, a number of social assistance programs that have since, under the Project
been merged into the BFP, specifically targeted the poor. Under the Project, assistance
under these four pre-BFP conditional transfer programs and, later on, the Programa De
Erradicação Do Trabalho Infantil (PETI) has been virtually eliminated, their
beneficiaries have been incorporated under the Cadastro Único and are receiving
assistance under the BFP. Administrative efficiencies resulted by merging these programs
into a single program that was coordinated by a single federal ministry (thereby reducing
the administrative costs of running multiple programs) and by unifying the target
population. The BFP also promoted administrative efficiencies by seeking partnerships
across different levels of government to support the Program's implementation. But
beyond these, the creation of the BFP was not a simple merging of previous initiatives
but a totally new, multidimensional strategy to reduce poverty and inequality, that sought
to promote synergies and complementarities from the simultaneous promotion of
investments in education and health in families, thereby promoting a more
comprehensive investment in human development in return for even a given amount of
expenditure.

The BFP also generated efficiency in overall social spending in Brazil by consolidating
the Cadastro Único so that it could be used by several other social programs administered
by the MDS, effectively coordinating the BFP with other social safety net interventions
and beginning to articulate the Program with other complementary federal, state and
municipal programs that sought to increase social capital formation in poor households.
                                           21
Finally, improvements in targeting over the implementation period have helped to ensure
that the BFP is implemented efficiently in terms of reaching its target population. The
Program sets its target population on the basis of poverty maps prepared by the statistical
institute (IBGE) and analysis prepared by the Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada
(IPEA) and the MDS. This methodology defines the target population at the municipal
level on the basis of which the MDS establishes municipal quotas. Improvements in the
process for updating and in the quality of information in the Cadastro Único ensures that
there are no leakages or duplicity in transfer payments, all of which increase the BFP's
operational efficiency.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

Assigning an overall outcome rating for the Project was not an easy task. On the one
hand, it is hard to imagine a program of Bank assistance, such as that supported by the
Project, that has impacted the entirety--institutional, technical, financial, economic and
social--of a newly-established Government program so positively, that was and
continues to be so highly relevant to both the Government and the Bank both in terms of
objectives, design and implementation, that has met or even exceeded expectations in
terms of results so well, and has resulted in increased efficiency in the allocation and use
of public finances. With these criteria alone, an Overall Outcome Rating of Highly
Satisfactory would be justified. On the other hand, issues related to delays in
procurement of key technical assistance tasks which resulted in a two and a half year
extension of the Closing Date, in part resulting from the lack of experience of a newly-
created institution and in part resulting from a complex system of procurement at the
federal level, resulted in important delays in contracting important activities aimed at
further strengthening of the Program, thereby impacting adversely the efficiency with
which the Project was implemented. While these delays and extensions had no major
impact on the Program's relevance, the accomplishment of its objectives or the efficiency
that it generated in terms of its overhead costs compared with those of the previously-
existing sectoral programs, they are sufficient to justify an Overall Outcome Rating of
Satisfactory.  

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The BFP's focus on impact on poverty and human development was at the core of the
Program and is described in detail in Section 3.2. The Program's impact on gender has
produced interesting results that could possibly have been expected in hindsight. Women
figure prominently among beneficiaries, and where possible, transfer payments are made
directly to the mother in a household. Apart from the direct impact on human capital
development among women beneficiaries, several studies also point to potentially
important impacts on intra-household power relations. Findings from Libardoni and
Suárez (2006) suggest that the BFP improved women's ability to make choices for

                                               22
themselves and for their children. It also helped to reduce women's sense of insecurity
vis-à-vis their husbands and, according to almost 43 percent of beneficiaries interviewed,
helped reduce the incidence of domestic violence. The baseline data for the BFP impact
evaluation (CEDEPLAR and SAGI, 2007) show higher bargaining power of women in
beneficiary households, especially in the Northeast, where monetization is less
developed.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Created in 2004, the Ministerio de Desenvolvimento Social (MDS) that has overall
responsibility for implementation of Bolsa Família has become a solid institution with
considerable expertise that has consolidated and strengthened the systems required for
overall management of the BFP and its monitoring and evaluation. The consolidation of
the BFP was carried out in parallel with the creation and consolidation of the MDS as the
Federal Ministry responsible for social assistance programs.              This "parallel"
implementation, allowed the MDS to consolidate a social safety net for the country, with
the BFP as its core. The institutional structure of the MDS is grounded in a federal law
(issued in 2004), and regulations and operational processes, which define institutional
responsibilities for the BFP. The MDS comprises three executive Secretariats
responsible for the implementation of the social protection programs (the National
Secretariat of Citizen's Income, SENARC--responsible for the BFP; the National
Secretariat for Social Assistance---SNAS, and the National Secretariat for Food and
Nutritional Security---SESAN) and two transversal Secretariats responsible for
supporting the integration among social programs and links between families in the
Cadastro Único with other interventions at Federal, State and local levels (the Secretariat
for Institutional Articulation and Partnership, SAIP), and to carry out a comprehensive
monitoring and evaluation system for social programs (Secretariat for Information
Management and Evaluation, SAGI).

In this regard, the MDS is the key federal institution responsible for planning,
implementing, and articulating social policy not only for the BFP but all social policies in
Brazil--the consolidation of the BFP was implemented in parallel with the creation and
consolidation of the MDS as the federal ministry responsible for social assistance
programs. This allowed the MDS to consolidate a social safety net, with the BFP at its
center. The MDS has internalized monitoring and evaluation as a key process for
achieving results not only for the Program but social policy in general. Since its creation
in 2004, the MDS has unquestionably enhanced its implementation capacity and annual
budgetary allocation very significantly.

The BFP has developed a comprehensive structure supported by sophisticated
mechanisms to operate program processes. The Program is supported by a robust
database, the Cadastro Único, which collects the information of about 17 million
families, virtually 100 percent of the poor population. The BFP has internalized
mechanisms for reaching out to potential and incorporating Indigenous and Quilombola
beneficiaries in its operational processes. More, it has developed partnerships with other
federal institutions working with these groups to maximize the effectiveness of its efforts.
The ongoing assessment, revision and adjustment of the instruments to identify, select
                                            23
and register families in the Cadastro Único has contributed to minimize inclusion and
exclusion errors. Payments are made through the Caixa Econômica Federal, a public
bank, supported by over 30,000 payment points where families can collect their benefits
within 90 days of payments, using an electronic card.

This advanced structure permits the program to define and publish a calendar of
payments early each year, which allows families to improve budget planning. MDS has
established formal mechanisms for collaborating with knowledge agents in Brazil,
including IPEA, IBGE, the Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV), academics, and specialists
to make considerable improvements in the BFP's design, especially in the area of
targeting and registration. At the local level, all of Brazil's municipalities are partners in
the BFP's implementation and measures like the Indice de Gestão Descentralizada have
helped strengthen the capacity of municipal governments to implement the BFP. Finally,
the established system of oversight and accountability, both formal with the Executive
and the Legislative branches of government, and social with the publication of
beneficiary lists and the constitution of social control councils, and a fully functional
web-site for the Program that ensures its consultative processes and transparency has
grounded the Program's institutional framework and ensures its ongoing accountability
and legitimacy.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

As the Government's flagship social program and the largest conditional cash transfer
program in the world, Bolsa Família has generated a large and growing body of literature
on its impact and implementation. This has fed into the strengthening of the
Government's monitoring and evaluation functions, which the Bank has supported in part
through the BRAVA program of programmatic technical assistance--both for program-
level impact evaluation and institutionalization of M&E. In addition, the scale and speed
at which the program has expanded and its sheer size has generated a lot of demand for
knowledge sharing from countries in the process of developing CCT programs. As
Brazil's stature grows in the international arena, it is taking a leadership role in
discussions on social assistance policies and Bolsa Família is a key ingredient of this
knowledge agenda.

Since its expansion, Bolsa Família has stimulated intense South-South learning, through
visits and study tours, direct technical assistance and participations in regional
CCT/Social Assistance forum. The Program has been the object of multiple requests for
participation in seminars and hosting of study tours and visits from over 30 countries
from around the globe. The MDS has organized a series of regional seminars on selected
topics of operational importance for CCTs, including regional seminars on targeting
issues in 2005 (with Chile and Mexico), on graduation and complementary services in
2007 (with Argentina, Chile, Mexico). The MDS also maintains a program of direct
technical cooperation with selected countries.

The Bolsa Família Program is an active member of the CCT community discussion
group in Latin America and the Caribbean. This group, formed after the 3rd International
CCT conference in 2006, is composed of high-level program managers and staff from
                                             24
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, and Mexico, the Inter-American Development
Bank and the Bank working on CCT projects and meets monthly through
videoconferences to discuss transversal operational issues regarding CCTs and yearly
through organized in-person workshops that provide a forum for peer exchanges aimed at
enabling program staff to cross-fertilize experience with implementation issues.

Brazil has also organized international events related to CCTs, including, in 2004, the 
2nd International Conference on Conditional Cash Transfer Programs for
practitioners and policymakers, in a collaborative effort with the U.K.'s Department for
International Development (DFID), the German Technical Agency for Technical
Cooperation (GTZ), the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the
Municipality of São Paulo, Brazil and the Bank.

Finally, MDS/Bolsa Família has stimulated the production of PhD and masters studies in
Brazil and internationally. The MDS has created a process for making public the micro
data generated by evaluations that are managed internally. Four months after the results
of the research are made public, micro-data ­ without any personal identification on
interviewees ­ is made available to the Social Information Consortium (CIS)7 and
researchers can access it. Externally, in partnership with the UNDP-IPEA International
Poverty Centre (IPC), the MDS has created a virtual library8 that houses over 90 national
and international publications on a variety of themes: income and labor generation, food
security and nutrition, education, health, amongst others. This tool serves to disseminate
the growing body of research and literature on Bolsa Família.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Negligible

The Risk to Development Outcome of the Project is negligible. The BFP continues to
be the centerpiece of Brazil's social policy, and has already made a marked contribution
to a reduction in poverty and extreme poverty and improvements in income distribution.
As a result, the BFP counts on political support at all levels. President Lula has
repeatedly reaffirmed his commitment to the Program and recently announced the
intention to legally protect benefit amounts from erosion by inflation.

Brazil's currently strong financial situation should ensure the BFP's fiscal sustainability
and no major constraints are envisaged over the medium-term, despite the international

financial and economic crisis. The potential impacts of the international financial and
economic crisis have only deepened the Government's commitment to the BFP as
decisions were taken to review and increase both benefit amounts and beneficiary
numbers to help prevent an increase in poverty and inequality and a reversal of recent
gains. Proportionately, the size of the BFP is comparable to that of other large-scale CCT
programs in the region. Program costs are equivalent to about 0.38 percent of GDP. The
alignment state and municipal resources also strengthens the BFP's sustainability.
While forthcoming elections might have raised concerns about the future sustainability of
the BFP, there are several factors that make these unlikely. Media coverage of the BFP
has been mostly positive. Overall, the Program enjoys strong support from the Brazilian
public. The Government has taken a proactive role, together with the press, in reporting
and following up on allegations of fraud, intentional and unintentional errors.
Perceptions of possible dependency, or views of the Program as "assistencialista" exist,
but their reality has not been substantiated, and efforts to link the BFP to job training and
other employment opportunities will dissuade these views as will hopefully the results of
the impact assessment currently being finalized. Also, the support for conditional cash
transfer programs spans the political spectrum: the first transfer programs in Brazil,
including Bolsa Escola, Bolsa Alimentação and different municipal programs, were
launched by federal and municipal administrations from different political parties in the
mid-1990s. Furthermore, the Government is preparing several laws that would shield the
program, making it difficult to shut it down. Finally, its results have demonstrated to be
sustainable in terms of its impact on reducing poverty and inequality. The PNADs (2004,
2006 and 2008) have consistently shown the BFP's sustained contribution to reducing the
incidence of extreme poverty, the poverty gap and inequality. The BFP's sheer scale--
benefitting about 12 million families, the Program is the largest conditional cash transfer
program in existence--becomes a major factor supporting its sustainability.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The Bank's performance at ensuring quality at entry is considered highly satisfactory.
The Bank responded immediately to the Government's request for assistance in designing
the BFP, initially through just-in-time technical assistance and then through assistance in
project preparation. The Bank's approach was not only timely, but also strategic in that it
envisioned support to the Program within in overall program of support for social
assistance, not only through a specific project, but through an APL program to support
the BFP over the medium-term coupled with an innovative mechanism of two
programmatic analytical and advisory services that allowed flexibility in the definition of
specific tasks to respond to emerging needs. The design of the APL program, and the
technical advice and support the Bank provided to the client were top-notch and
incorporated state-of-the-art technical design on the basis of lessons of experience with

                                             26
conditional cash transfer programs that were not as widely recognized at the time as they
are today. The Project's design responded directly to the Borrower's priority in tackling
poverty and inequality, while at the same time creating and strengthening the
institutional, financial, monitoring and evaluation, social and fiduciary aspects of the BFP
that were seen as needed not only to ensure the Program's accomplishment of its
objectives, but also to provide it with the accountability, legitimacy and institutional
grounding and recognition that would ensure is sustainability as an instrument of social
policy over the longer term.

The design of the Bank's lending instrument--an APL in the form of a SWAp in support
of the entirety of the BFP--was responsive to the Borrower's needs and requests, yet also
addressed internal concerns at the time regarding the provision of large-scale financial
assistance to support an ambitious but not-yet-fully established Government program.
The Project, and the APL program, by supporting the establishment and strengthening of
a government program in its entirety, as opposed to a specific project, thus scaled-up the
impact of Bank assistance. In addition, monitoring and evaluation, as well as good
fiduciary practices, were seen as sine-qua-non for the basic functioning of the BFP, and
were rightly identified as priorities within the Project's design.

The Bank's financial assistance was tailored to rely, to the extent possible, on the
Government's own financial management systems and procedures and monitoring and
evaluation systems, while improving them in the process to comply with both the
Program's and the Bank's fiduciary requirements. Risks were correctly identified during
appraisal, and the Project's design incorporated mitigation measures with the result that
apart from minor delays in procurement, those risks never materialized. During project
preparation, a comprehensive IPDP was prepared to tailor policies, assistance and
operational practices to address the needs of Indigenous and Quilombolas, which were
highly represented among the targeted beneficiary groups. The technical skill mix and
the continuity of the Bank's preparation team, together with the support they received
from Bank management at all levels, were exceptional.        In order to be available to
provide hands-on, just-in-time support to the Government in the important preparation
phase (and later early supervision), the Bank's Task Manager was decentralized to the
Brazil Country Office.
(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance during supervision was satisfactory. The Bank's supervision
effort was key to supporting the Government in getting the technical assistance activities,
including especially the monitoring systems, off to an early start to ensure they would
support the planned rapid expansion of the BFP. The Bank ensured that its technical
advice and support maintained relevance through the implementation of three
complementary programmatic AAA tasks mentioned above. The design of these AAA
tasks as programmatic instruments, allowed the Bank, through its program of AAA, to
respond to emerging issues and priorities for the BFP with timely and high-quality
technical advice. Because the Project was the focal point of an integrated program of

                                            27
support for social assistance, the staff and other inputs that the Bank assigned to the BFP
and the Project's supervision were satisfactory and appropriate, both from HQ and in the
Country Office. The Bank identified issues with procurement, initially with staffing for
procurement, and later the other issues that led to delays in contracting, and responded
proactively with increased support from procurement specialists and increased follow-up
from the Task Manager.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance 

Rating: Satisfactory
 
For the reasons described in sections (a) and (b) above, the Bank's overall performance is
considered satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The Government's performance is considered highly satisfactory. The BFP was
unquestionably the Government's program. The Government was unequivocal about the
priority it assigned to poverty reduction and social equity, and throughout, support came
from the highest level. It wanted to pursue those objectives within a framework of
market-friendly economic policies, but with social results that were direct, transparent
and fiscally and socially sustainable. This was a sophisticated middle income client that
knew what it wanted, and sought, listened to and internalized the Bank's assistance,
especially technical, to pursue those results, both during the design, preparation and
appraisal of the Program, the APL program and the Project, as well as throughout
implementation. Actions needed to create the institutional framework for the BFP,
including the legal establishment of the MDS and the policy framework and operational
rules for the Program, were expedited, reflecting the priority that the Government
assigned to it. Throughout the short five-year history of the BFP, the Government has
consistently provided the budgetary resources to not only maintain but also expand the
Program according to established targets, and support the required institutional tasks
needed to ensure its transparency, accountability and legitimacy.        Throughout, the
Government has never lost sight of the "next step" needed to maintain the Program's
relevance in response to emerging threats to the achievement of its objective of reducing
poverty and to the improving poverty trends that have resulted from its existence.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory


The Implementing Agency's performance is considered satisfactory. From the start, the
MDS sought a strong partnership with the Bank to support its efforts to establish and
implement the BFP, and to strengthen its own internal capacity to do so in the process.

                                            28
MDS also sought and achieved important partnerships with other agencies that had a
central role in the Program's functioning, and which also contributed positively to the
Project's results: Caixa Economic Federal, the Ministries of Education and Health,
IBGE, Brazil's municipalities and other public and private institutions. The MDS was
able to overcome initial delays and problems in staffing, although its capabilities in the
area of procurement, and the federal systems upon which it relied, lead to delays in
project completion. Yet, throughout, it worked closely with the Bank to strengthen its
capabilities, and to develop and follow an action plan to accelerate, albeit with delay, the
contracting of technical activities that were underway by the loan's closing date. MDS'
support to the development of a culture of strong monitoring and evaluation was very
strong, and invaluable for strengthening the BFP's transparency and impact.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
For the reasons described in sections (a) and (b) above, the Bank's overall performance is
considered satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

The BFP's implementation, together with the Bank's support under the Project offer a
wealth of lessons with respect to its experience as the largest conditional cash transfer
program in the world, and to the Bank's involvement in support of it. These are
described separately as lessons with respect to the BFP as a CCT and lessons with respect
to Bank involvement below.

Lessons with respect to Conditional Cash Transfer Programs:

    Well-defined, targeted, managed and monitored CCT programs represent an
    important instrument of social policy for reducing poverty and extreme poverty,
    and improving income distribution.
    Political leadership combined with strong technical implementation capacity and
    rigorous evaluation is key to the setting-up and sustainability of conditional cash
    transfer programs.
    Clear definition of institutional responsibilities in turn ensures adequate
    coordination and improves institutionalization and sustainability.
    Families who fail to comply with conditionalities may need additional support to
    take full advantage of CCT programs.
    Strengthening human capital, especially among the poor, requires tight
    coordination between demand and supply side interventions.
    Transparent targeting mechanisms ensure that a CCT program reaches its
    intended beneficiaries and maximizes its impact.
    Clear and transparent rules to provide support and apply sanctions ensure CCT
    programs' credibility.


                                            29
    Linking beneficiaries to skills and income generating activities ensures the
    medium-term sustainability of poverty alleviation impacts.
    CCT programs, while designed to foster medium-term improvements in human
    capital, have a role to play in responding to crises and protecting poor households'
    investments in human capital.
    Communication throughout program implementation sustains CCT programs in
    their daily operations and also promotes wide-spread "buy-in" for the program.
    While CCTs have traditionally focused on school-aged children, reaping the
    highest yields for this investment may require enhancing school.

Lessons with respect to the Bank's Assistance:

    The Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) to investment lending, in which Government
       systems are utilized and strengthened, and apply not only to the entirety of the
       program supported but for the Bank's fiduciary purposes as well leverage Bank
       assistance to impact the entirety of the program.  
       By financing a program through a SWAp, flexibility for responding to emerging
       priorities is brought into the instrument.
       Complementary programs of Bank analytical and advisory services, such as the
       programmatic BRASA and BRAVA AAA tasks that supported the design of
       social assistance in Brazil offer an effective vehicle for leveraging the Bank's
       technical assistance to parallel that financed under investment lending operations.
       When Bank assistance supports the start-up of a new program the risks may be
       high, but if and as technical support to and strengthening of the program progress.
       When an Implementing Agency requires the support of an external agency to
       procure goods and services, clear strategies should be defined to transfer
       knowledge to that Agency's fiduciary units.

     PROGRESS TOWARDS INTERMEDIATE RESULTS BY COMPONENT

Component 1: Conditional Cash Transfers (Grants)

     At least 2/3 of extreme poor families receiving BFP transfers
     Pre-reform programs eliminated (former beneficiaries either converted to BFP or
     dropped from programs
     Transactions costs for transfer payments reduced

Since its creation in 2003, the BFP has expanded rapidly to the point that it is now the
largest cash transfer program in the world. In parallel with technical improvement to the
Program under Components 2 through 4, Component 1 financed the payment of cash
transfers to eligible BFP beneficiaries. When the loan for the first phase of the BFP was
under preparation in 2003, the Program's benefits were already reaching an estimated 3.6
million families. In October 2003, the four pre-reform programs, Bolsa Escola, Bolsa
Alimentação, Cartao Alimentação and Auxilio Gas covered together a total of 17.7
million families, yet there was overlap among the target groups of these programs so the
number of beneficiary families was much less. The Government's multi-year plan aimed
to target 11.2 million families by 2006, while migrating the beneficiaries of the pre-
reform programs into the BFP through a validation process and then eliminating those
pre-reform programs. The Program increased rapidly without compromise to efforts to
strengthen its targeting and monitoring of conditionalities, to reach about 12 million
families (about 48 million people and 25 percent of the Brazilian population) by August
2009.9 In 2009, the parameters used to select beneficiaries were modified in response to
the economic slowdown and as a result, the number of families in the BFP is expected to
reach 12.9 million by the end of 2010.

  The BFP's original target population was 11.2 million poor families. The latest household survey data
points to a significant reduction in the poverty rate. According to the MDS, using the previous poverty line
of R$120 in per capita family income, the target population for the Program would be 11.1 million families,
reflecting thus a reduction in poverty. With a new poverty line of R$137, the new target population for the
BFP is 12.9 million families.


                                                    34
Since its launching in 2003, the Government has updated the value of the benefits,
adjusting their structure and modifying the design of incentives to address specific
economic and social contexts as well as policy priorities. The BFP has played a key role
as a safety net mitigating the impact of food and oil prices, and more recently the
economic downturn. The Program's benefits were adjusted to respond to these
challenges in two ways: (i) increasing benefit amount to avoid their erosion by food
price inflation; and (ii) expanding the beneficiary lists to include a vulnerability
dimension introducing income volatility as part of the selection criteria. First, in 2008
and 2009 the Government readjusted the amount of all benefits, which helped beneficiary
families absorb the impact of the increases in food and oil prices. Then, in 2009, as an
ex-ante risk management tool to cushion the economic slowdown, the Government
revised its estimation of potential beneficiaries based on the new IBGE poverty maps and
vulnerability analysis by IPEA on the Monthly Labor Force Survey. 10 As a result, the
target number of beneficiaries increased by 1.8 million families, and 1.3 million new
families were to be registered between May and October 2009. In 2007, the Government
also adjusted the structure of benefits to encourage participation in secondary education
by expanding the age requirements for school attendance from 15 to 17 years of age and
introducing an additional variable monthly payment of R$33 per youth aged 16 to 17
years. The benefit is paid per youth. In this context, the extension of the BFP to this
segment of the population, with a cash benefit of R$30.00 for at maximum two benefits
per family, is likely to represent an investment in the social inclusion of these young.
Currently, it is estimated that 1.8 million youths receive these resources.

A table presenting the evolution of the BFP's benefits and their structure since the
Program's launching is presented in Table 2 below.

  Under the current methodology, the information collected by the survey captures the family income
during the previous month only. The new methodology intends to capture the volatility of income, which
will affect families near the poverty line in particular.

Bolsa Família has achieved a very good targeting of beneficiaries and small leakages to
the non-poor. About 80 percent of the Program's benefits go to families in the poorest
two quintiles and 48 percent are received by those in the poorest quintile. Despite the
Program's rapid expansion between 2003 and 2006 when it reached the target of 11
million families, the program has proved to be very effective in reaching the poorest.
Financing of transfers flow directly from the Brazilian Treasury to the Caixa Economic
Federal after the MDS (through its National Secretariat for Citizen Income-SENARC)
approves the benefit payment roster, or Folha de Pagamento. Caixa then transfers the
money to a pooled account, which beneficiaries access with a debit card.

Management of Bolsa Família's benefits involves three set of processes and activities:
(i) authorization of payments--information on families' composition, updated
information on the registry, analysis of compliance with co-responsibilities by the
families; (ii) management of benefits at the local level--processes and regulations to
block, unblock, cancel, reinstate and suspend benefits, according to program rules; and
(iii) payment-logistics, mechanisms to reach families in remote areas, and strategies for
beneficiaries to better manage their payments (financial education).
By mid-2009, Bolsa Família was making about 11 million payments per month.
Beneficiaries collect their transfers using their electronic card in more than 15,000
locations. Families can collect their benefits within 90 days. The Program estimates that
currently about 95 percent of benefits are collected. Nevertheless, the remaining five
percent represents about 500,000 benefits not withdrawn after 90 days.

Since 2008, the Program launched a strategy to open bank accounts for about 4 million
beneficiary families of Bolsa Família by 2010. The accounts, opened in the Caixa, are
intended not only to deposit the benefits for families, but also to facilitate households'
access to other banking services. By mid-2009, the Program has helped about two
million beneficiaries to open their bank accounts.
                                            36
The BFP has also helped to rationalize and boost social assistance spending. Before
2001, a number of social assistance programs specifically targeted the poor, and
accounted for seven percent of total federal social spending. Among them were the four
pre-reform conditional cash transfer programs including, Bolsa Escola, a primary and
secondary education program; Bolsa Alimentação, which targeted nutritional needs of
women and children; Cartao Alimentação, supporting families' food security and Auxilio
Gas, which extended subsidies for cooking gas. By 2003, these four combined
represented close to one fourth of the federal spending on social assistance. By the end
of 2009, these four programs had all but been eliminated, and pre-reform programs
beneficiaries were included in the Cadastro Único in December 2008.

By merging the four pre-existing programs, the transaction costs of the transfer payments
were also reduced. The central government's administrative costs for the pre-reform
programs amounted to 5.3 percent of the total outlays for those programs. The central
government's administrative costs for the BFP amount to only five percent of the
Programs total outlays. With total outlays of R$2.6 billion in 2003, administrative costs
of the pre-reform programs totaled R$84 million. With total outlays of R$12.2 billion in
2009, administrative costs of the BFP totaled R$465 million.

    Cadastro Único users (MDS and at least 50 percent of municipalities) with access
    to data

While rapidly expanding the BFP to target beneficiaries, the Government worked solidly
to strengthen the system for identifying the Program's target population, and putting in
place formal procedures to ensure that this information was continuously updated. MDS
and the Caixa have designed a set of mechanisms to improve management of benefits and
transparency in the payment process, especially through improvements to and
strengthening of the process for managing the Cadastro Único. The primary objective of
the Cadastro Único is to serve as a registry of all Brazilian families living in poverty. It
is a national database which collect the socioeconomic data of families with monthly
income below R$190 (half a minimum wage, approximately US$100). The Cadastro
Único is the main targeting instrument used by the Brazilian Government to select
beneficiaries of social programs. It was originally developed in 2001 as an effort to
constitute a single registry database of the lowest income families in Brazil. Until that
time, each social program operated its own targeting system. The Cadastro is in effect a
census for almost the entire poor population with rich information about families---not
only name and address, but also many variables on living conditions. The Cadastro
Único has also been critical for reducing exclusion and inclusion errors in Government

                                            37
programs, especially the BFP. The new database improves efficiency and increases
coordination between different social initiatives at the national and municipal level. Even
though the Cadastro Único served mainly Bolsa Família in its early years, it is now
increasingly used by other programs at the Federal, state and municipal levels.

The Government has made significant efforts to improve the Cadastro Único. Since
2004, many official guidelines have been issued to clarify the roles of the different actors
involved in the registration and management of the database. In addition, the first
massive recertification of beneficiaries took place between September 2005 and March
2006 resulting in an overhaul of the quality of the Cadastro. Some 2.7 million new
eligible families were incorporated into the registry and 1.4 million households were
excluded for a number of reasons. The Government is currently carrying out a new
recertification of the Cadastro across the country. Regular recertification processes are
complemented by an ongoing activity of updating individual registries of families carried
out by municipal authorities. Beneficiaries of the BFP whose record has not been
updated for two years will see their benefits suspended. Another important recent
improvement of the database took place after the MDS and Caixa, the operative agency
of the Cadastro, negotiated a performance-based contract in January 2006 that
incorporates 17 indicators to measure the quality of services. These include an index of
duplication of registry entries, and hours of system availability, among others.

With empirical evidence of strong targeting outcomes, the MDS decided to maintain
income for eligibility criteria, but to enhance it with strong cross-checks and validations.
In fact, rigorous evaluations show that the BFP is among the best-targeted CCT programs
in the region, with very little leakage. Over 90 percent of the benefits go to poor families
and about two thirds to extremely poor families.
To address issues related to weaknesses in the Cadastro Único questionnaires, IBGE
worked closely with MDS to prepare, validate, test, develop and print new questionnaires
that were launched in 2009. The procedures to clarify and strengthen the implementation
of the Cadastro Único were officially published in a Portaria No. 376 dated October 16,
2008, and are available on MDS' website. Procedures for management of the Cadastro
Único and for collaboration between MDS and IBGE for data collection were
established.    Decree 148 established the Decentralized Management Index and
recertification policy that provides for a two year periodicity of recertification. As
mentioned above, the first recertification process was carried out and is complete; a
second one is planned to be completed in 2010. MDS, working with IBGE, has
developed systematic internal and external cross-checks of the Cadastro Único to
eliminate duplications and an ongoing purging process is in place.

The MDS also maintains and ongoing process of assessing, developing, testing and
implementing improvements to the operation of Cadastro Único. Recently the MDS
completed the process to implement a new questionnaire to collect the information on
families and new software to manage the information (Version 7.0). The objective is to
improve the quality of information on families, thus improving the targeting tool for
Bolsa Família and the other programs using the Cadastro Único to select beneficiaries.
The full implementation of Version 7.0 is gradual and the MDS is providing support to

                                            38
municipalities to carry out the process. To promote the use of the Cadastro Único in
other social programs and interventions, the MDS is in the process of enhancing access to
its information.

Over the last few years, MDS/SENARC and the Caixa Economic Federal have designed
a set of mechanisms to improve management of benefits and transparency in the payment
process. Apart from those measures to improve the management of benefits and to
ensure that only families that comply with their co-responsibilities are entitled to receive
their benefit, the process has been systematized to minimize errors in the payroll list
(automatization of routines to modify registries as necessary; e.g., blocking, suspensions,
cancellation, etc). As part of these actions, the list of authorized beneficiaries to receive
payment is cross-checked using several instruments: (i) updating of registries every two
years or less and recertification of the whole Cadastro; and (ii) cross-check with other
data bases such as BPC and other social security (to verify if beneficiaries are receiving
social security), as well as RAIS (annual list of social information, to verify if a
beneficiary moved to the formal labor market).

MDS and all municipalities in Brazil now have real-time, on-line access to the Cadastro
Único database. The Cadastro Único is being used increasingly to target beneficiaries of
other social programs at the federal level, as well as municipal and state levels.

Component 3: Developing a Monitoring and Evaluation System

    Adequate MIS for BFP developed and operating.
    Quality Control Reviews of BF processes implemented.
    Baseline beneficiary survey conducted.

Since its establishment in 2004, the MDS, mainly through the Secretariat for Evaluation
and Information Management (SAGI) has developed a comprehensive monitoring and
evaluation system. The establishment of SAGI constituted a decisive and innovative step
for policy-making, assessment and evaluation of social policies, and a concerted decision
by the Government that the BFP required strong in-house capacity for monitoring and
evaluation. Until then, no ministry or central agency in Brazil had an autonomous body
to carry out such activities. SAGI was institutionally and technically strengthened to
increase relevance in the decision making process of the Ministry. Since it was
established, SAGI has developed: (i) an evaluation system to conduct research and
impact evaluations based on rigorous methodologies, applied to selected social programs,
initially within the MDS, to measure the outcomes of social programs at the federal level;
and (ii) a monitoring system to track program's progress and provide information based
on indicators and administrative data.

Monitoring and evaluation functions in the MD constitute a critical element of the policy
making and decision taking process on social policies at three levels: (i) internally, to
provide feedback and improve effectiveness of and optimize resources invested in social
programs under the responsibility of MDS; evaluations and assessments are carried out
by SAGI in close coordination with implementing agencies and program managers; (ii) at

                                             39
the policy making level, to inform decisions taken in relation to social programs; and (iii)
externally, to improve transparency, control and accountability of social policies, through
the dissemination and discussion of evaluations and assessments. SAGE disseminates the
generated knowledge to the general public through several channels, including through
academia as well as government officers, workshops, technical publications, and the
availability of information on the web.

The BFP's results monitoring is carried out in coordination with other federal
government agencies involved in program implementation such as the Ministry of
Education, the Ministry of Health, the Caixa and the Federal Comptroller's Office, the
Supreme Audit Court and the Public Ministry (which are involved in control and
oversight) and IBGE and IPEA and other research agencies which are involved in data
production and analysis. In addition, social control and data collection for program
monitoring is the responsibility of municipal and state government agencies, both for the
Cadastro Único, the monitoring of conditionalities, the management of benefits and the
implementation of complementary activities. Many reports necessary for monitoring
progress have to be compiled with information from more than one agency. As a result,
MDS has made important progress in the establishment of an MIS to assist in the
Program's implementation and monitoring.

Under the Project, MDS designed and developed a comprehensive MIS. The individual
modules of the MIS are all under full implementation (cadastro in real time, payments,
conditionality monitoring). A core element of the management information system is the
comprehensive Cadastro Único Registry of Beneficiaries. The MIS collects information
and generates reports regarding program's progress, provides support to operational
improvements and adjustments, and serves as a tool to verify that the program is being
implemented following all required procedures. Through the new MIS, SENARC in the
MDS gather data in real time from state and municipal management structures, the Caixa
and sector ministries involved in monitoring conditionalities and complementary
activities. MDS has now contracted a data warehouse solution to integrate those modules
and the work is ongoing and expected to be completed in 2010.

Since 2005, the Government has taken many steps to strengthen oversight and control
mechanisms of the Bolsa Família Program. Numerous decrees and regulations have been
passed establishing responsibilities for oversight and controls at various levels of
government. Oversight and control of the BFP operates at three levels: external at the
federal level, internal to the MDS and at municipal and local levels. Bolsa Família is
subject to a close scrutiny by the Federal Oversight and Control System (Rede de
Fiscalização). The three Federal agencies in this System monitor the BFP, including the
payment system. The Federal Comptroller's Office (Contralodoria Geral da União,
CGU) in the executive branch carries out annually quality control reviews for random
samples, annual financial audits, investigates specific cases and make public beneficiary
lists. The Supreme Auditing Court at the legislative level (Tribunal de Contas da União,
TCU) performs implementation evaluation, on a sample basis, for the Cadastro Único
and the BFP. The TCU conducted a comprehensive implementation evaluation in 2006
prior to elections. The Public Ministry (Ministério Publico), a public independent control

                                            40
agency, investigates specific cases or allegations. Program controls in the MDS include
internal and external cross checks of the Cadastro Único, three hot lines (at the Caixa,
the Program and SENARC), monitoring of municipal performance and the IDG, and
monitoring of Caixa. At the municipal level, all 5,564 municipalities have developed
social control councils and local points of contact for complaints and appeals.

The impact evaluation of Bolsa Família is a long-term process which accompanies
program implementation and supports the monitoring of program measurable outcomes at
two levels: territorial and household levels. The baseline survey was collected in 2005
and the first follow up survey is under implementation. The survey consists in a
longitudinal study of a representative sample of about 15,500 households, aggregated in
three big regions: urban north and center-west; northeast; and south-southeast. The
sample consisted of three categories: beneficiary families, families registered in the
Cadastro Único but not beneficiary of Bolsa Família, and families outside the Cadastro
Único and Bolsa Família.

The second round of data collection is currently under implementation. The firm hired to
carry out this evaluation utilizes a longitudinal design drawing on data collected in 2005
and new data collected in 2009, taking advantage of the fact that, at baseline, many
surveyed households had not yet started receiving benefits under Bolsa Família. A first
follow-up process for the impact evaluation is under implementation and the final report
is expected in by mid-2010.

Component 4: Institutional Strengthening

       Matrix of key responsibilities for BFP published.
       Strategy for operating the Program in remote areas developed.
       Beneficiary information booklets (cadernetas) designed, published and distributed.
       System for monitoring human capital conditionalities operating.
       Implementation training provided to at least one half of municipalities.

Since its creation in 2004, the MDS has enhanced its implementation capacity and annual
budgetary allocation very significantly. The annual budget grew from about R$11 billion
in 2003 to more than R$32 billion in 2009 (from US$3.5 billion to US$16 billion)
reaching more than 1.1 percent of GDP. Currently, the MDS comprises the most
important social programs at the federal level in Brazil. The creation of the MDS was a
key step in the process of consolidating the BFP at the core of the social protection
system, in improving the supervision of the decentralized program; and in enhancing the
capacity of the Government to effectively manage and monitor progress nationally. The
unification of the beneficiary registry has strengthened the Program's basic architecture,
and has created a platform for improved targeting for future social programs in general,
which will strengthen linkages between programs, enhance synergies and reduce
inefficiencies.

Under the first phase of the APL Program, the Government established the main
conceptual, legal and institutional foundations of the BFP through: (i) clearly defining

                                            41
institutional roles and responsibilities for each level of government involved in the
program; (ii) establishing a framework of contracts and performance incentives for sub-
national governments; (iii) improving the verification of conditions and payment
mechanisms; and (iv) solidifying the monitoring and evaluation system.               The
Government's Portaria No. 220 dated June 25, 2008 amending a previous Portaria,
established the norms, criteria and procedures to support the BFP and the Cadastro Único
within Brazil's federal structure (with municipalities through Termos de Adesao with
municipalities), and creates the Indice de Gestao Descentralizada do Programa (IGD)11.
Portaria No. 76 dated March 7, 2008 established norms, criteria and procedures for states
to adhere to the BFP and the Cadastro Único and for support to the states for these
programs.

During its initial phase, the BFP set up an extensive system to establish and clarify the
Program's rules through legal instruments and operational instruction as well as through
beneficiary booklets designed, printed and distributed to all beneficiaries, with special
efforts have been made to provide support to families that are not complying with
conditionalities. electronic weekly bulletins for local managers, a detailed program
website--with public beneficiary lists by municipality--and two dedicated hotlines (for
beneficiaries and local managers). In addition, the BFP launched a thorough training
program--both face-to-face and distance learning--for local managers.

The BFP has also achieved important impacts consolidating the institutional framework
of social sector assistance. This included the integration of the pre-existing national
government cash transfer programs into a single structure, with consequent gains in
efficiency, reductions in administrative costs, and the enhancement of synergies. The
program developed a unique decentralized management approach in which municipalities
play a central role in the identification of beneficiaries and monitoring of conditionalities.
Bolsa Família has also worked with the states and municipalities to reach legally binding
cooperation agreements that integrate their pre-existing cash transfer programs into the
main BFP structure to reduce duplications and administrative costs. Such mergers have
taken place in 14 states and 15 municipalities. These agreements have also helped to
better define the role of each level, and to enhance the capacity of municipalities and
states to implement social assistance programs.

The Program has in place a system for municipal monitoring of conditionalities and
reporting. Management of the Program's conditionalities involves a set of processes
aimed at: (i) monitoring compliance with co-responsibilities in education and health as
pre-requisite to authorize payments; (ii) registering information about compliance; (iii)
ensuring that families comply with co-responsibilities; and (iv) supporting families that
do not comply. Processes involved in the management of the Program's conditionalities
are carried out the by the MDS, health and education ministries at the federal level, by

11
  The IGD measures municipal performance in implementing the Program through a synthetic index that
comprises variables of coverage and quality of information of the Cadastro Único and of monitoring
compliance with education and health conditionalities. Municipalities receive additional transfers from the
Federal Government depending on the IGD score they achieve.

local MDS representatives and decentralized municipal health and education secretaries
at the local level.

Since its launch in 2003, the Program has shown a steady improvement in monitoring
families' compliance with their co-responsibilities (school attendance and regular health
checkups: 89.6 percent of 15.5 million children showed as reporting education
conditionality in 2009 with 97.3 percent of those shown as complying against as base of
62.8 percent of 12.3 million children that showed as reporting education conditionality
information in 2006. For health conditionalities 64.5 percent were reported as showing
information, with 99 percent complying in June 2009 against a base of only 38.3 percent
in 2006 and six percent of families with health information in June 2005. Bolsa Família
has demonstrated that the set of incentives for families to invest in the human capital of
their children have been generally effective. From the information reported about
families' compliance with education and health activities, more than 97 percent of
children 5-16 and youths aged 16-18 registered in the program were enrolled and
attended school regularly, and a similar proportion of families complied with their regular
check-ups at health facilities.

The social control of the Program is carried out through councils or committees created at
the municipal level, which constitute requisites for the municipalities to join the BFP.
Social control bodies involve civil society and authorities, including, at least,
representatives of the social assistance, health, education and food security areas. The
overall activities of social control agencies are related to the registry of poor families in
the Cadastro Único and in the BFP, verification of availability of social services and
promotion of public supply coordination, and support to the oversight and control carried
out by the MDS and the Rede de Fiscalização at the federal level (Comptroller Office,
Brazilian Court of Audit, and Public Pros--utor--Ministério Publico.

The MDS provides direct support to municipal authorities in their specific responsibilities
by defining and carrying out strategies and activities to improve the process of collecting,
registering and updating the data in the Cadastro Únito and increasing the average
proportion of families and children and youth with information about compliance with
conditions. Although the social control mechanisms implemented to monitor the Program
at the local level have been an innovative feature of the program, a recent evaluation
highlighted their limited impact, in part because social control members know little about
their functions.

SAGI and SENARC run an extensive program of capacity building for municipal and
state managers of the Program, both on operational and analytical issues that is
contributing to strengthening their technical capacity.

The Observatory, created in 2007 and managed by SENARC, identifies, collects and
disseminates good practices in the management of Bolsa Família developed by states and
municipalities to provide a tool for horizontal dissemination and cooperation. As states
and municipalities autonomously develop specific methods and management practices to
carry out their responsibilities within the Program, the Observatory has proven to be a

                                             43
valuable instrument to improve the quality of operations of the Program at these levels.
As part of the Observatory, states and municipalities register their practices and
participate in a contest. Registered practices are assessed against defined criteria and a
small set of those are selected and disseminated through the Observatory and participate
in the Good Practices Contest.

During the first phase of the APL, the Government went beyond the expected results of
the Bolsa Família Program on its own, and sought to capitalize on the positive results by
placing the Program and its infrastructure in the center of the country's social policy. In
early 2008, the Government launched the Compromisso Nacional pelo Desenvolvimento
Social (National Commitment for Social Development, CNDS), with the dual objectives
of: (i) improving the impact of social policies; and (b) enhancing their effectiveness
through greater integration between the Federal Government and the states. The National
Secretariat for Institutional Articulation and Partnerships (SAIP) in MDS is the entity
responsible for the promotion and oversight of this initiative. This initiative is a further
step towards the consolidation of a social safety net in Brazil, one of the main objectives
of the current administration. It seeks to find strategies for the socio-economic insertion
of poor individuals registered in the Cadastro Único through operational and financial
support to the states. The CNDS is based on agreements between states and the MDS in
which the former commit to implement a program based on income generation, labor
opportunities and socio-productive inclusion of vulnerable families. As part of the
agreement, states receive additional funds from the Federal Government.

In March 2008, the MDS invited all states to join CNDS through bilateral agreements.
All states expressed interest in joining. Four states (Acre, Alagoas, Bahia and Ceara)
have already signed agreements and started implementing plans while another ten states
are expected to launch their own strategies by the end of 2009. When states join the
CNDS they have to designate a local agency that will be co-responsible with SAIP for the
productive insertion strategy. The Centers of Reference for Social Assistance (Centros
de Referencia de Assistencia Social, or CRAS) at the municipalities are responsible for
the selection of vulnerable low-income individuals eligible for CNDS. In addition to
launching the strategy and signing the first set of agreements with state governments,
SAIP has been developing tools to facilitate the implementation of the CNDS.
Particularly important is determining the basic criteria for the selection of individuals in
the Cadastro Único that will be targeted for the socio-economic inclusion plans at the
state level.




                                            44
The CNDS is also part of the Government's strategies to link Bolsa Família to other
social programs and income generation activities that can help beneficiaries improve their
human capital and access labor markets. This strategy also complements government
efforts to link the program with other social and income generation initiatives at the
Federal level.

Component 5: Project Management

This component of the first phase APL financed incremental operational costs of MDS,
through consultants to assist in monitoring and supervising the activities, especially those
related to interaction with the Bank, and extensive travel for work with states and
municipalities.




                                            45
                      Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis
                        (including assumptions in the analysis)

The BFP increased dramatically Brazil's spending on social assistance, but undoubtedly
increased the efficiency in public social spending. Between 2004, when the BFP was
introduced, and 2008, Brazil's social spending rose from 12.28 percent to 13.1 percent of
GDP. Social assistance spending grew from 5.81 percent to 7.66 percent of social
expenditures during this period and the BFP accounted for a large share of this increase.
The BFP's budget grew from R$5.8 billion (or 1.60 percent of social spending and 0.3
percent of GDP) in 2002 to R$11.06 billion (or 2.96 percent of social spending and 0.39
percent of GDP) in 2008. In 2009, the federal budget allocated R$11.4 billion to the
BFP, and the 2010 budget includes appropriations for R$13.1 billion.

Before 2001, a number of social assistance programs that have since, under the Project
been merged into the BFP, specifically targeted the poor. These included: Bolsa Escola,
a primary and secondary education support program; Bolsa Alimentação, which targeted
nutritional needs of women and children; Cartao Alimentação, supporting families' food
security; and Auxilio Gas, which extended subsidies for cooking gas. These individual
programs had proven to be individually successful in alleviating the burden of poverty
and promoting socially desirable goals to their beneficiaries. However, due to the
similarities in the structures of the programs and their almost identical target population
groups, the multiple-structured nature of their administration, among three different
federal ministries, created numerous inefficiencies in their administration as well as
considerable gaps and duplications in the coverage of their target populations. Under the
Project, assistance under these four pre-BFP conditional transfer programs and, later on,
the Programa De Erradicação Do Trabalho Infantil (PETI) has been virtually eliminated
(Figure 1), their beneficiaries have been incorporated under the Cadastro Único and are
receiving assistance under the BFP.

Administrative efficiencies resulted by merging these programs into a single program that
was coordinated by a single federal ministry (thereby reducing the administrative costs of
running multiple programs) and by unifying the target population. The BFP also
promoted administrative efficiencies by seeking partnerships across different levels of
government to support the Program's implementation; it fostered the expansion of
municipalities' role by transforming it from one of merely data providers to one of real
partners in the Program's management and administration. In merging the four pre-BFP
CCTs the Government created the conditions for a very active participation by
municipalities in key elements of the Program's cycle----registering potential
beneficiaries in the Cadastro Único, updating data and collecting information to verify
compliance with conditionalities. This feature makes the BFP unique among CCTs. But
beyond these, the creation of the BFP was not a simple merging of previous initiatives
but a totally new, multidimensional strategy to reduce poverty and inequality, that sought
to promote synergies and complementarities from the simultaneous promotion of
investments in education and health in families, thereby promoting a more

                                            46
comprehensive investment in human development in return for even a given amount of
expenditure.

                           Cartão Alimentação       Bolsa Alimentação



The BFP also generated efficiency in overall social spending in Brazil by consolidating
the Cadastro Único so that it could be used by several other social programs administered
by the MDS, effectively coordinating the BFP with other social safety net interventions
and beginning to articulate the Program with other complementary federal, state and
municipal programs that sought to increase social capital formation in poor households.
These complementary programs were developed by different government agencies to
address specific needs of vulnerable groups, such as illiteracy, lack of job experience or
housing deficit. Between 2006 and 2007, MDS and other federal ministries agreed to
articulate nine already existing programs with the BFP. These agreements gave the BFP
beneficiaries preferential access to all the benefits provided by the other programs. Local
managers (Gestores Municipales) of the BFP along with state coordinators and social
workers visit beneficiaries and help them to link or "bridge" into complementary
services. A list of complementary programs for BFP beneficiaries is presented in Annex
2. There has been a lot of interaction between BFP and state and local programs
(especially since these use the Cadastro Único to select beneficiaries for their programs
and to complement support under BFP with other interventions. The second phase of the
APL in support of the BFP will work with states and municipalities to further improve
the links between the Program's beneficiaries and social skills development, income
generation programs and labor market opportunities.




                                                       47
Finally, improvements in targeting over the implementation period have helped to ensure
that the BFP is implemented efficiently in terms of reaching its target population. The
Program sets its target population on the basis of poverty maps prepared by the statistical
institute (IBGE) and analysis prepared by the Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada
(IPEA) and the MDS. This methodology defines the target population at the municipal
level on the basis of which the MDS establishes municipal quotas. Improvements in the
process for updating and in the quality of information in the Cadastro Único ensures that
there are no leakages or duplicity in transfer payments, all of which increase the BFP's
operational efficiency.

Contexto Econômico e Político do Brasil12

O Governo do Brasil estava, à época do Contrato de Empréstimo APL I, empenhado em
realizar ações simultâneas nas áreas econômica e social, a fim de promover melhorias no
bem-estar da população e, ainda, garantir o progresso social, essencial para melhorar a
qualidade de vida dos grupos menos favorecidos.
Assim, como parte do duplo foco na manutenção da estabilidade macroeconômica e no
crescimento equânime e acelerado progresso social, as reformas no sistema de proteção
social no Brasil buscaram integrar vários programas de transferência de renda,
operacionalizados, até então, de forma desagregada, mesmo tendo o mesmo público.
Tratava-se do Bolsa Escola, implementado no âmbito do Ministério da Educação (MEC),
voltado às famílias de baixa renda que tivessem filhos em idade escolar; do Bolsa
Alimentação, implementado no âmbito do Ministério da Saúde (MS), que tinha como
alvo as mulheres gestantes e lactantes e crianças; do Cartão Alimentação, implementado
pelo Ministério da Segurança Alimentar e Combate à Fome da Presidência da República,
que constituía parte do programa Fome Zero e fornecia uma transferência mensal para
famílias pobres, destinada à aquisição de gêneros alimentícios; e do Auxilio Gás,
implementado no âmbito do Ministério das Minas e Energia (MME), que proporcionava
uma transferência mensal às famílias pobres, de forma a compensar a eliminação de um
subsídio indireto no gás de cozinha.
Embora cada um desses Programas mantivesse sua própria ênfase, (promovendo
escolarização, atenção à saúde ou nutrição), todos proporcionavam transferências de
renda para um público semelhante, formado por famílias pobres. Ademais, cada
programa era gerido em distintas estruturas administrativas, com distintos processos de
seleção de beneficiários. Essa separação gerava ineficiência, resultando em lacunas e
duplicações de cobertura, além da perda de importantes sinergias nas áreas de saúde e
educação. A partir deste quadro, as reformas buscaram integrar estes programas numa
única transferência de renda com condicionalidades denominado "Programa Bolsa
Família" (PBF), no âmbito do Ministério do Desenvolvimento Social e Combate à Fome
(MDS).
O Programa Bolsa Família foi criado pela Medida Provisória n° 132, de 20 de outubro de
2003, convertida na Lei nº. 10.836, de 9 de janeiro de 2004, e trouxe como elemento
central a determinação de unificar os programas não constitucionais de transferência de
renda então existentes, garantindo o direito das famílias que já vinham sendo por eles
atendidas. Destaque-se, no entanto, que mais do que a unificação dos programas
anteriores ou a busca de um maior grau de racionalidade administrativa pelo governo, o
PBF apresentou um novo padrão de política para redução da pobreza, constituindo-se em
mecanismo capaz de promover a ampliação e a articulação da rede de proteção social no
País. Caracteriza-se por três linhas diretoras: (i) atendimento de toda a família, e não de
seus membros isoladamente; (ii) superação de divergências de critérios de elegibilidade e

de sobreposição de público-alvo, e (iii) ampliação de cobertura e de montante dos
recursos financeiros alocados ao cumprimento da agenda pública relativa às questões do
combate à fome, à pobreza e à desigualdade social.
Em sua concepção considerou-se que políticas para redução da pobreza e da desigualdade
pressupõem uma opção do Poder Público em privilegiar os mais pobres. Para esses, é
preciso um tratamento diferenciado, de forma a reduzir desigualdades prévias e, no
futuro, promover a igualdade. Encontra-se aqui uma tradução do princípio da eqüidade,
que demanda, para sua efetivação, a utilização de parâmetros de justiça distributiva.
Embora não avessa a políticas universais, entende que, mesmo essas, que são direitos de
todos, devem ter um olhar diferenciado para os mais pobres, com priorização e garantia
de atendimento. Para privilegiar os mais pobres, esta concepção também enfatiza critérios
de acesso e, assim, trabalha com mecanismos de focalização, mas não numa concepção
residual, de selecionar apenas os extremamente pobres. Focalização, aqui, é a aplicação
de critérios de priorização, em especial para enfatizar a garantia de direitos e a inclusão
daqueles que historicamente estiveram à margem das políticas públicas.
Operacionalmente, a unificação foi bem sucedida graças ao trabalho de gestão do
Cadastro Único para Programas Sociais do Governo Federal ­ CadÚnico. O Cadastro é o
principal instrumento para identificação das famílias em situação de pobreza em todos os
municípios brasileiros (cf. texto relativo ao Componente 2).
Por outro lado, o Programa também implicou um considerável desafio do ponto de vista
da articulação federativa: a União, os Estados e os municípios tiveram suas
responsabilidades definidas para que o Bolsa Família pudesse ser implantado e
expandido.
O PBF rapidamente se tornou uma das principais iniciativas do Governo Federal,
superando a meta de 3,6 milhões de famílias em seus três primeiros meses de operação,
ainda em 2003.

Alcance dos Objetivos

A equipe do Ministério do Desenvolvimento Social e Combate à Fome (MDS) fez, para
compor o presente Relatório, uma análise detalhada sobre a execução do Projeto, objeto
da operação de crédito em questão, observando sua operacionalização e os resultados
alcançados.
Na perspectiva do alcance dos objetivos gerais e de desembolso, salienta-se que, mesmo
tendo havido a necessidade de expansão do prazo original, de 30.06.2007, para
30.12.2009, e uma pequena redução do valor original, de US$ 572.200.000,00, para US$
563.839.000,00, os resultados da implementação foram muito satisfatórios. Observou-se
que não houve perda de foco, confirmando que os objetivos estavam estabelecidos de
forma correta e clara, e que a estrutura estabelecida no âmbito do MDS deu conta de
superar todas as eventuais dificuldades encontradas.
Na perspectiva dos resultados da operação, em comparação com os objetivos propostos
no Projeto de Apoio ao Programa Bolsa Família (PBF), há de se considerar que os
principais objetivos do Projeto são os mesmos do próprio PBF, ou seja, reduzir a pobreza


                                            54
e a desigualdade, além de promover o desenvolvimento de capital humano, por meio de
apoio:
a) à consolidação de programas de transferência condicionada de renda e redução de
   exclusões e de casos de multiplicidade de cobertura;
b) ao fortalecimento do sistema de identificação do público alvo;
c) ao desenvolvimento de um sistema de monitoramento e avaliação para o PBF; e
d) ao fortalecimento do funcionamento institucional básico do PBF.
Assim, em relação ao PBF (Componente 1 do Projeto), apesar do curto período de
existência, seus resultados têm sido notáveis, o que não significa dá-lo por concluído,
sendo certo que o Programa merece aperfeiçoamentos com vistas à sua consolidação.
Contudo, mesmo em poucos anos, os resultados alcançados e as mudanças
proporcionadas pelo PBF, desde sua implementação, o que inclui o período do Projeto
em questão, são constantemente demonstrados por estudos de especialistas, instituições
de pesquisas e organismos de cooperação multilateral que têm analisado os impactos do
Programa, mostrando que:
a)      os benefícios entregues pelo PBF chegam às famílias mais pobres, àquelas que
tradicionalmente estiveram à margem das políticas públicas no Brasil, e vários dos seus
bons resultados vêm justamente do acerto na seleção dos mais pobres;
b)     o País está reduzindo a pobreza, em especial em seu grau mais extremo, bem
como a desigualdade, tendo a extrema pobreza sido reduzida em mais de 60% desde que
assumiu compromissos com os Objetivos de Desenvolvimento do Milênio, antecipando
assim, em dez anos, o cumprimento da primeira das metas neles estabelecidas;
c)      entre 2003 e 2008, a taxa de pobreza caiu de 39% para 25%, enquanto a pobreza
extrema diminuiu de 18% para 9%. O coeficiente de Gini caiu 8,1% em apenas 7 anos,
saindo de 0,596 em 2001, para 0,548 em 2008, o nível mais baixo nas últimas três
décadas. O aumento real do salário mínimo e o PBF estão, segundo alguns estudos, entre
os principais responsáveis pela redução da pobreza e da desigualdade observada no país;
d)     o PBF teve importante impacto na melhoria da situação alimentar e nutricional
dos seus beneficiários, especialmente das crianças, reduzindo déficits de crescimento, que
nessa faixa etária são irreversíveis, mediante o aumento da quantidade de alimentos que
já eram consumidos, aumento da variedade de alimentos e aumento da compra de
alimentos que as crianças gostam;
e)      Pelo fato de o benefício do Programa ser pago à mulher, há melhoria da auto-
estima da população feminina e redução da dependência com relação ao parceiro, sem
registros de ocorrência de conflitos domésticos derivados deste fato;
f)      o abandono escolar na educação fundamental é menor entre os beneficiários do
Programa que no total dos alunos de escolas públicas. O mesmo ocorre no caso do ensino
médio. As taxas de aprovação na educação fundamental dos beneficiários e do total de
alunos do ensino público são bastante semelhantes (80,5% contra 82,3%,
respectivamente), e são maiores para os beneficiários no caso do ensino médio (81,1%
contra 72,6%);

implementação, de forma a garantir que os benefícios efetivamente cheguem às famílias
que dele necessitam e que atendam aos critérios legais. De 2003 a 2006 essa meta de
expansão ocorreu em ritmo acelerado, conforme gráfico a seguir.
Em 2006 e 2007, o PBF tinha a meta de atender 11,1 milhões de famílias, número
estabelecido com base na estimativa de famílias pobres do Brasil, segundo estudos do
Instituto de Pesquisas Econômicas Aplicadas (Ipea) e da na Pesquisa Nacional por
Amostra de Domicílios (Pnad) 2004. Esta meta foi alcançada em junho de 2006.

Em dezembro de 2007 (Medida Provisória n° 411, de 28 de dezembro), foi ampliada a
faixa etária de atendimento do PBF para adolescentes de até 17 anos. A partir do mês de
março, as famílias beneficiárias do PBF com adolescentes de 16 ou 17 anos passaram a
receber adicionalmente o Benefício Variável Vinculado ao Adolescente (BVJ), no valor
de R$ 30,00 (hoje R$ 33) por adolescente, até o limite de dois benefícios por família.

O valor total do benefício pago à família varia entre R$ 22,00 e R$ 200, dependendo da
condição de pobreza da família e do número de filhos. Famílias com renda de até R$ 70
per capita são consideradas extremamente pobres e famílias com renda entre R$ 70,01 e
R$ 140 são consideradas pobres. O repasse médio por família foi ampliado de R$ 73, em
dezembro de 2003, para R$ 95, no mesmo período de 2009. O valor dos benefícios segue
o estabelecido no quadro abaixo:




                                                                                                      56

Em 2005 e 2006, tiveram prioridade as ações destinadas à redução das falhas
administrativas no Sistema do Cadastro Único, melhoria da tecnologia de informação e
da eficiência técnica do sistema devido à migração de beneficiários de outros programas
assistenciais do Governo para o Cadastro Único. Para isso, foram alocados US$ 234 mil
em 2005 e US$ 333 mil em 2006.

Desde 2005, foram estabelecidos procedimentos periódicos visando à qualificação dos
dados.Cadastro Único, por meio de seu cruzamento com outros registros administrativos,
tais como a Relação Anual de Informações Sociais ­ RAIS, a base do Benefício de
Prestação Continuada ­ BPC e demais benefícios previdenciários, entre outros. O
resultado desses cruzamentos tem permitido, desde então, identificar indícios de
inconsistências no Cadastro Único que requerem averiguação por parte do município por
meio da atualização cadastral das famílias.

Também em 2005, foram publicadas as Portarias nº 360, nº 454 e nº 672, definindo
critérios e procedimentos para o apoio financeiro do MDS às ações de atualização
cadastral conduzidas pelos municípios. A definição de critério de validade estabelecida
na Portaria GM/MDS nº 360/05 e suas alterações foi bastante importante para a validação

                                             57
do CadÚnico, na medida em que contribui para o rastreamento e erradicação das
multiplicidades existentes. A Portaria GM/MDS n° 360/05 também instituiu o Termo de
Adesão para Estados, para apoio aos municípios no processo de atualização dos seus
cadastros.

Em 2006, o Programa adotou um incentivo para a melhoria da gestão local do Programa.
O Índice de Gestão Descentralizada ­ IGD mensura o desempenho dos municípios e
Estados na gestão do Programa e do Cadastro Único e esses recebem mensalmente
recursos para investir em atividades de gestão do Programa.

Em 2007 o processo de atualização cadastral foi permanentemente implantado através do
Decreto n° 6.135, de 26 de junho de 2007, que regulamentou o CadÚnico.

No segundo semestre de 2008 foi dado início ao processo de contratação do Sistema de
Gestão do Programa Bolsa Família, com a intenção de integrar informações e processos
do Programa suportados por sistemas isolados. O escopo do Projeto prevê que diversos
módulos (como o de gestão do Cadastro Único, de gestão de benefícios, de relação com
Estados e municípios, de controle e fiscalização, de gestão financeira, entre outros)
estejam integrados em um único sistema. Os órgãos gestores de programas sociais
usuários do Cadastro Único também poderão acessar este Sistema, o que ampliará a
consolidação do Cadastro Único como ferramenta de integração de programas sociais,
voltados à população de baixa renda.

Ademais, foi finalizada, após longo debate com órgãos governamentais e especialistas, a
revisão dos novos formulários do Cadastro Único. Para implantar essa versão, a Senarc
elaborou um plano de capacitação e uma série de materiais instrucionais, cujo objetivo é
fazer com que os entrevistadores de todo o Brasil compreendam as mudanças nos novos
formulários e saibam como coletar as informações por meio destes instrumentos. Entre
outubro de 2009 e fevereiro de 2010, foram formados 561 instrutores, certificados pelo
MDS e pela Escola Nacional de Administração Pública (Enap), que estão atuando como
multiplicadores em seus estados, isto é, capacitando diretamente os entrevistadores do
Cadastro Único nos 5.565 municípios brasileiros. A expectativa é de que sejam
capacitados mais de 18 mil entrevistadores para a utilização dos novos formulários do
Cadastro Único em todo o país. A implantação deste formulário ocorrerá em 2010,
contando com um Sistema de cadastro Único completamente reformulado. Com
funcionamento on line, o novo sistema (Sistema de Cadastro Único ­ versão 7) corrige
inúmeras insuficiências verificadas no aplicativo de entrada e manutenção de dados que
esteve em funcionamento até então.

Em 2009, ocorreram modificações nos critérios de elegibilidade do PBF: a linha de
extrema pobreza passa a corresponder a uma renda familiar per capita de até R$ 70,00 e
a linha de pobreza a uma renda familiar per capita de até R$ 140,00. Por outro lado,
foram atualizadas as estimativas de pobreza utilizadas pelo Programa, por meio da
incorporação de um coeficiente de vulnerabilidade de renda que considera a instabilidade
dos ganhos das famílias mais pobres. Finalmente, as estimativas da população-alvo do
Programa nos municípios foram redefinidas com base na metodologia dos Mapas de

                                          58
Pobreza. Com isto, o público potencialmente beneficiário do Bolsa Família passou de
11,1 milhões para 12,7 milhões de famílias. A expansão ocorrida em 2009 levou o
número dos beneficiários a 12,4 milhões de famílias em dezembro.

Em 2005, foram aplicados US$ 9,5 mil para a elaboração de termos de referência para
estudos e pesquisas a serem contratados. Em 2006, US$ 4,1 milhões foram alocados para
contratação de estudos referentes ao monitoramento de resultados e avaliação de impacto
além de monitoramento de processos e controle de qualidade. No primeiro semestre de
2008, o processo de contratação da empresa que está realizando a segunda rodada da
pesquisa sobre o impacto do programa Bolsa Família foi finalizado. No segundo semestre
de 2009, foi realizada a entrega de três produtos do total do contrato, gerando uma
execução de 70% do valor do contrato, conforme previsto em contrato. A previsão é de
que até o final do primeiro semestre de 2010 o relatório final da avaliação tenha sido
entregue.

Com ênfase no desenvolvimento de uma estratégia de comunicação e disseminação, que
incluiu a impressão e distribuição de material impresso para beneficiários do Programa
Bolsa Família e agenda de compromissos das famílias participantes, foram aplicados US$
2,2 milhões em 2005. Em 2006, foram aplicados US$ 629 mil em ações voltadas para o
monitoramento e cumprimento de condicionalidades. Em 2007 foram aplicados US$ 384
mil dando seguimento às atividades de fortalecimento institucional.

A evolução na cobertura do acompanhamento das condicionalidades demonstra o
fortalecimento dos processos e da articulação inter e intragovernamental para sua
implementação. Entre 2006 e 2009, o percentual de beneficiários com idade entre 06 e 15
anos acompanhados quanto à condicionalidade de educação, ou seja, com informação
sobre a freqüência escolar, subiu de 62,8% a 89,6%, enquanto o acompanhamento
integral das condicionalidades de saúde cresceu de 38,3% para 64,5% das famílias com
perfil para acompanhamento.

                                           59
Em 2005, foram aplicados US$ 485 mil quase que totalmente em aquisição de passagens
aéreas para todas as atividades mencionadas dos demais componentes. Em 2006, US$
531 mil foram comprometidos para o mesmo objetivo além de outras despesas de
escritório, as quais são consideradas custos incrementais decorrentes da implantação do
Projeto. Em 2007 foi finalizado o processo de licitação para compra de passagens com a
contratação da empresa Money Turismo no valor de US$ 360 mil. No ano de 2008 o
gerenciamento do projeto continuou sua execução, emitindo passagens para o apoio da
execução dos outros componentes, bem como a contratação de alguns consultores para
coordenação de projetos.
Execução orçamentária. Em relação à execução orçamentária e financeira do Projeto,
saliente-se que em janeiro de 2007, no que se refere à execução financeira do
Componente 1: Transferências condicionadas de renda no âmbito do PBF, obteve-se um
desembolso de 100% do total orçado, ou seja, US$ 551.478.000,00 (quinhentos e
cinqüenta e um milhões, quatrocentos e setenta e oito mil dólares), demonstrando um alto
nível de comprometimento do Governo Federal com o Projeto e a eficácia da
implementação.
O valor final dos recursos alocados à parte institucional do Ministério (Componentes 2, 3,
4 e 5) totalizou US$ 9,5 milhões, tendo sido pagos US$ 7,3 milhões.
Desse modo, o Acordo de Empréstimo (APL I) teve, ao final, uma execução de 98% do
total orçado originalmente e 99,6% do total de orçamento final (US$ 561.663 milhões
dos US$ 563.839 milhões), representando um altíssimo nível de execução. Estes valores
correspondem a 100% da parte de transferências de renda do PBF e 77% da parte
institucional (US$ 7,3 milhões de US$ 9,5 milhões), que também pode ser considerada
uma ótima execução orçamentária no que diz respeito à parte de assistência técnica.
Para melhor visualizar os resultados do APL I, segue, no Anexo 1, uma descrição
detalhada da execução de suas metas e no Anexo 2, o detalhamento da execução
orçamentária e financeira do Projeto.

Principais Fatores que Afetaram q Implementação do Projeto e o Resultados

O arranjo institucional do Projeto (APL 1) contou com a Coordenação Geral do
Ministério do Desenvolvimento Social e Combate à Fome (MDS), por meio de sua
Secretaria Executiva.
Especificamente no que se trata do desenho proposto para a execução do Projeto, pode-se
afirmar que o mesmo foi adequado, necessitando apenas pequenos ajustes, ao longo da
implementação, uma vez que o reforço de recursos humanos esperado não ocorreu em
tempo hábil, já que a aprovação de cargos para compor a estrutura do Ministério somente
aconteceu já no segundo semestre de 2009, com a Lei Nº 12.083/2009, publicada no
DOU 30/10/09, que "Dispõe sobre a criação de cargos em comissão do Grupo-Direção e
Assessoramento Superiores ­ DAS, destinados ao Ministério do Desenvolvimento Social
e Combate à Fome e à Fundação Nacional do Índio ­ FUNAI".
Neste sentido, a cooperação técnica com o Programa das Nações Unidas para o
Desenvolvimento (PNUD) foi de extrema importância, mas indicou, também, não ser a
solução ideal para algumas contratações de serviços, como as pesquisas e estudos da
Secretaria de Avaliação e Gestão da Informação (SAGI), por exemplo, por envolverem
grandes volumes de recursos.
A execução do Componente 1, relativo ao reembolso de despesas do Governo Federal, de
parte das transferências condicionadas de renda do Programa Bolsa Família (PBF),
mesmo com o volume maior de recursos do empréstimo, foi facilitada, uma vez que se
manteve o arranjo institucional pré-existente, cabendo ao MDS a coordenação, a gestão e
a operacionalização, conforme o Decreto nº 5.209, de 17 de setembro de 2004.

Desempenho do Banco e Do Mutuário
A assistência do Banco para o Projeto foi preparada rapidamente, com a plena
colaboração do Governo Federal, principalmente dos dois Ministérios envolvidos mais
diretamente, o Ministério do Desenvolvimento Social e de Combate à Fome (MDS) e o
Ministério da Fazenda (MF).
Com uma abordagem setorial, a assistência do Banco Mundial apóia amplamente os
mesmos objetivos do PBF. A contribuição financeira do Banco Mundial para
transferências de renda foi relativamente pequena, representando apenas cerca de 8% do

                                            61
total das transferências condicionadas no âmbito do PBF, no período de junho de 2005 a
janeiro de 2007, de maneira que seu impacto direto sobre a redução global da pobreza e
da desigualdade também foi relativamente pequeno. O apoio ao fortalecimento da
capacidade de gestão do PBF, entretanto, contribui para que o Governo Federal do Brasil
possa alcançar estes objetivos mais amplos de redução da pobreza e da desigualdade e
promover o desenvolvimento do capital humano.
O Banco Mundial teve como foco o apoio ao desenvolvimento de um Brasil mais justo,
acreditando ser o PBF, um instrumento capaz de contribuir diretamente ao alcance dos
Objetivos do Milênio, propostos pelas Nações Unidas, no curto e no longo prazo, desde
que desenvolvido de forma coordenada com outros programas governamentais, muitos
dos quais o Banco também apoiou, visando, por exemplo, a redução da desnutrição, a
educação universal, a redução da mortalidade infantil e a melhoria da saúde materna.
Quanto ao desempenho do MDS como a agência responsável de preparação e
implementação, verificou-se que todas as condições do empréstimo foram atendidas, com
desembolso total de 98%, desde sua efetividade, em junho de 2005. O APL I forneceu os
incentivos corretos para garantir tanto a continuidade da política de distribuição de renda,
quanto à consolidação e o aperfeiçoamento do PBF.
No que diz respeito ao desempenho do MDS, é preciso registrar, também, que foram
empreendidos todos os esforços para a execução das ações previstas no Acordo, e o
Governo Federal esteve o tempo todo comprometido com as políticas e metas do PBF,
contando, para isso, com o apoio do Ministério da Fazenda (MF) e da Caixa Econômica
Federal, como agente para efetuar os pagamentos aos beneficiários.

Conclusões e Implicações Para as Etapas Subseqüentes do APL

A insuficiência de recursos humanos foi determinante para a defesa, no Congresso
Nacional, da aprovação da Lei Nº 12.083/2009, publicada no DOU 30/10/09, que
"Dispõe sobre a criação de cargos em comissão do Grupo-Direção e Assessoramento
Superiores ­ DAS, destinados ao Ministério do Desenvolvimento Social e Combate à
Fome e à Fundação Nacional do Índio ­ FUNAI".
Da mesma forma, a inadequação verificada da cooperação técnica com organismos
internacionais, em relação a alguns processos de aquisições e contratações, também foi de
extrema importância, pois indicou a necessidade de um acerto do MDS com o Banco,
para inserir no escopo do APL II a modalidade de licitação de pregão eletrônico, o que
agilizará muitas das atividades essenciais do Projeto.
Outra decisão, em decorrência destas observações, foi a de criar, no âmbito da Unidade
de Implementação de Projetos (UIP), uma Comissão Especial de Licitação (CEL), a ser
preparada para qualquer processo e todas as necessidades de aquisição do novo Projeto,
incluindo a aquisição de bens e serviços e seleção de consultores para os montantes
envolvidos. A CEL será composta por funcionários do MDS que já tenham conhecimento
nas orientações das aquisições do Banco e por novos integrantes, que serão devidamente
treinados. Com isso, o novo Acordo terá os processos de aquisição e contratação
realizados preferencialmente por meio da CEL.



                                            62
Assim, considerando o objetivo de fortalecimento institucional do MDS na
operacionalização de projetos dessa natureza, houve, pelas dificuldades operacionais do
APL I, comprovadamente ganhos com as lições aprendidas na sua execução. O MDS
decidiu estabelecer, para o APL II, uma adequada capacidade para execução direta de
aquisições e de gerenciamento financeiro, mudando significativamente o organograma de
gestão do Projeto.

The second phase of the APL for the Bolsa Família Program has recently been

phase would continue to support the overall objectives of reducing poverty and inequality
and promoting human capital development by improving schooling and health status of
children and reducing incidence of malnutrition among the poor population. It would
pursue these objectives through the continued financing of cash transfers to eligible
beneficiaries and the provision of technical assistance in support of the priorities
identified by the Government as described earlier in this section. These include: (a)
continued efforts to strengthen the BFP's overall governance by: (i) unifying and
increasing the use of the Cadastro Único as an instrument for targeting; (ii) improving
the management of monitoring of and compliance with conditionalities; (iii) improving
payment mechanisms in remote areas; (iv) further strengthening monitoring and
evaluation of the program; (v) strengthening oversight and control (both formal and
social controls) of social program activities; (vi) enhancing local implementation and
management capacity; (vii) improving the coordination between federal and local
government and further refining the responsibilities of each of the levels of health,
education and social assistance service providers in setting up social services networks;
and (viii) advancing social participation of beneficiaries in the articulation of local policy,
and (b) improved integration and linkages between the BFP and other social and labor
market programs and interventions to create exit strategies for the BFP beneficiaries
(especially second generation strategies) and to facilitate their entry into the labor market
and/or access to income-generation activities. Complementary actions and services
would focus on linking beneficiaries to: (a) social worker accompaniment and other
social assistance programs; (b) micro-credit and financial services; and (c) income-
generating and productive inclusion activities.

                               Annex 12: Lessons Learned


The BFP's implementation, together with the Bank's support to the Program under this
initial phase under the Project offer a wealth of lessons with respect to its experience as
the largest conditional cash transfer program in the world, and to the Bank's involvement
in supporting the Government with this ambitious program. These are described
separately as lessons with respect to the BFP as a CCT and lessons with respect to Bank
involvement below.

Lessons with respect to Conditional Cash Transfer Programs:

Well-defined, targeted, managed and monitored CCT programs represent an important
instrument of social policy for reducing poverty and extreme poverty, and improving
income distribution. The BFP has shown that in a short period of time, with strong
political support, good targeting, strong financial management and monitoring, especially
of conditionalities, CCTs, represent an important component of overall social policy, and
can contribute to improved outcomes.

Political leadership combined with strong technical implementation capacity and
rigorous evaluation is key to the setting-up and sustainability of conditional cash
transfer programs. International experience has shown that successful implementation
and institutionalization of CCT programs requires both strong support from the highest
level of Government, and clear institutional responsibilities for program design,
coordination and implementation. SENARC built a robust monitoring system, based on
the overhaul of the beneficiary registry, and also invested in strengthening its technical
cadre. SAGI focused on institutionalizing M&E inside the MDS and on providing quality
terms of reference and supervision to external evaluations. The Program's impact
evaluation and major implementation evaluations are contracted out to external
evaluators, including a Brazilian research institution and international academic
institution.

Clear definition of institutional responsibilities in turn ensures adequate coordination
and improves institutionalization and sustainability. CCT programs foster innovative
cross-sector interventions, which hardly fit within the mission of typical line ministries.
In Brazil, the BFP faced challenges related to the coordination of: (a) the monitoring of
conditionalities across Ministries of Health and Education; (b) the sharing of information
with the database manager, Caixa Ecônomica Federal; and (c) ensuring coordination
with the state and municipal governments. During the first phase, MDS underwent a
process of institutional reform where the roles of its different secretariats and partners in
the implementation of Bolsa Familía, were clarified. While the Ministry of Health
centralizes the information on compliance with the health conditionalities, the
information on school attendance is entered directly by Municipal Secretaries of
Education using software run by Caixa Econômica Federal. The software incorporates
an innovative system of incentives, based on a Decentralized Management Index (Indice

                                             69
de Gestão Decentralizada), which rewards good local implementation of the program.
This process generated strong buy-in across government levels and sectors.
 
Families who fail to comply with conditionalities may need additional support to take
full advantage of CCT programs. Bolsa Família has triggered behavior change among
the poor, especially among those who did not traditionally access services, and among
local service providers. However, recent experiences have shown that dealing with the
complex challenges that very poor families face when participating in CCT programs
constitutes a key element for sustainable program success. Several programs in LAC
have implemented complementary activities to help beneficiary families obtain the
maximum benefits to which they are entitled under the program and take measures to
address their structural poverty. In Brazil, social services centers (Centros de Referência
da Assistencia --cial--CRAS), run by the National Secretary for Social Assistance in
MDS, are reaching out to Bolsa Família beneficiaries who do not comply with program
conditionalities to help them to do so and also to link them to local social services.
CRAS staff can thus play an important role in identifying and removing barriers faced by
beneficiary families.

Strengthening human capital, especially among the poor, requires tight coordination
between demand and supply side interventions. On the demand side, CCT programs
seek to address income-related barriers impeding poor and vulnerable groups from
accessing basic social services (education, health, and nutrition) and thus to improve the
utilization of these and other social services. In turn, unless the supply and quality of such
services is adequate, CCT programs will not succeed in improving educational, health
and nutritional status of the targeted population. Supply side problems can limit a CCT's
effectiveness in terms of improving educational outcomes; for example, children may
attend school but if the school quality is poor their learning outcomes may not improve,
as recent international and Brazilian evidence has shown. Improving quality and fostering
learning in the schools mostly attended by Bolsa Família beneficiaries is a major
challenge in Brazil. As a result, CCTs can be an important instrument in social policy,
but need to be complemented by sectoral actions on the supply side.

Transparent targeting mechanisms ensure that a CCT program reaches its intended
beneficiaries and maximizes its impact. One of the crucial elements for the success of a
CCT program is the targeting scheme used to define areas of intervention and select
beneficiary families. CCT programs are set to provide very poor families with an
individual benefit which should be high enough to stimulate investments in human
capital, but low enough to avoid introducing distortions regarding adult labor force
participation. Therefore, the targeting mechanism is at the core of a CCT program, as the
benefit is designed to have the desired behavior change in extremely poor families.
Targeting also requires some calibration to minimize exclusion and inclusion errors so as
to include as many extremely poor families as possible without including many non-
extreme poor. In unequal middle-income countries such as Brazil, household-level
targeting is also usually necessary.
 
Clear and transparent rules to provide support and apply sanctions ensure program
credibility. Successful CCT programs have built broad credibility and accountability
                                             70
among beneficiaries and other stakeholders. This requires clear, transparent and strictly
applied rules, with defined oversight institutions. This also requires extensive
communication about: (a) the definition of co-responsibility of households and individual
members; (b) transparent criteria for selecting families, determining benefit amounts and
checking compliance with conditionalities; (c) sanctions to non-compliant beneficiaries,
including temporary and definitive suspension from the program, and conditions for
reinstatement; (d) sanctions for fraud and mismanagement by program staff and local
officials; and (e) clear guidelines about the duration of program benefits. An efficient,
accurate and timely system to verify beneficiary families' compliance with their co-
responsibility and the compliance of program staff with their functions are paramount to
its credibility. Finally, the program's credibility rests on its ability to receive feedback
from participating households and from the public.
 
Linking beneficiaries to skills and income generating activities ensures the medium-
term sustainability of poverty alleviation impacts. The experience of CCT programs in
Latin America has shown that in the short term, transfers foster increased access to
services and raise consumption. However, the challenge is to guarantee the medium- and
long-term sustainability of these improvements through complementary programs that
allow beneficiaries to "graduate" from the CCT program, or through limiting the duration
of benefits. In Brazil, complementary programs include: group support through the
CRAS, youth life skills and integrated attention to youth issues through ProJovem,
literacy programs for youth and adults (Brasil Alfabetizado), access to financial services
(accounts and financial literacy) and income-generating programs such as professional
training (PlanSeq); job search and placement services (SINE); micro-credit (Banco do
Nordeste and Banco do Povo), technical assistance for micro-enterprises; and rural
development programs. While most programs are federally administered, the states and
municipalities run a whole array of complementary programs. And coordination of these
local programs is important to promote integrated poverty-reducing local development.
 
CCT programs, while designed to foster medium-term improvements in human capital,
have a role to play in responding to crises and protecting poor households' investments
in human capital. CCT programs' principal focus is on improving the synergies between
health, nutrition and education and breaking the inter-generational transmission of
poverty. They also provide a good mechanism to channel additional resources to the
extreme poor to offset temporary crises (such as last year's rapid food price inflation)
while providing incentives to dissuade families from cutting their investment in education
and health in the face of economic difficulties.

Communication throughout program implementation sustains CCT programs in their
daily operations and also promotes wide-spread "buy-in" for the program. This
communication moves in two directions. It entails much more than media-related
activities, since it provides a pedagogic approach to beneficiary families and local
managers, especially in remote areas. It also educates the general public and policy-
makers about the innovations embedded in a CCT program while ensuring oversight,
transparency and accountability. In the other direction, good communications programs
include bottom-up feedback from beneficiaries and other local stakeholders for program
management, social audit and control.
                                            71
While CCTs have traditionally focused on school-aged children, reaping the highest
yields for this investment may require enhancing school preparedness of pre-school
children and school-to-work transition skills for youths. Recent evidence in neuro-
sciences shows that the 0-2 year-age period provides an important window to lay the
foundations for children's strong socio-cognitive development. This requires the
provision of good nutrition, care and access to early education during this period. Brazil
has launched several initiatives to improve children's access to early education, extended
eligibility to 15-17 year-old youth and is seeking to reach at-risk youth through
coordination with the ProJovem umbrella of programs.

Lessons with respect to the Bank's Assistance:

The Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) to investment lending, in which Government
systems are utilized and strengthened, and apply not only to the entirety of the program
supported but for the Bank's fiduciary purposes as well leverage Bank assistance to
impact the entirety of the program. While there may be concerns about the systems that
are to be used, especially in the start-up phase, it is possible to "stage" the Bank's
financial assistance through the use of incentives, such as the increasing disbursement
percentages that resulted upon compliance with milestones under the Project, or through
disbursement conditions that limit disbursements until certain actions are carried out.

By financing a program through a SWAp, flexibility for responding to emerging
priorities is brought into the instrument. The progressive approach to modifying the
beneficiaries (youth aged 16 and 17), and later adjusting the value and structure of
benefits to respond to first the food and oil price hikes and later the international
economic and financial crisis, was achieved by modifying the BFP's policies as a whole,
in accordance with applicable local legislation. The Bank was in full agreement with
these adjustments, but as the Bank was supporting the BFP as a whole, a restructuring of
the Project's objectives was not required.

Complementary programs of Bank analytical and advisory services, such as the
programmatic BRASA and BRAVA AAA tasks that supported the design of social
assistance in Brazil offer an effective vehicle for leveraging the Bank's technical
assistance to parallel that financed under investment lending operations. The
programmatic establishes an overall framework for a program of multi-year technical and
advisory services, each year providing a description of specific activities to be carried out
and reviewing and consolidating those that were finalized in the previous year. In this
manner, programmatic AAA offers a flexible, responsive vehicle for providing just-in-
time support to clients in support of the design and fine-tuning of their programs.

When Bank assistance supports the start-up of a new program the risks may be high,
but if and as technical support to and strengthening of the program progress according
to a well-defined agenda of technical assistance, most of those risks diminish. A
review of conditional cash transfers in the Latin America Region carried out by the Bank
in June 2009, "Control and Accountability Mechanisms in Conditional Cash Transfer

                                             72
Programs", stated with respect to the BFP: "In retrospect, despite implementation delays
of the technical assistance and strengthening of the MIS, most of the risks identified in
the first phase PAD did not materialize, and we expect that individual risk ratings for the
second phase APL to be lower than originally envisaged for the program.

When an Implementing Agency requires the support of an external agency to procure
goods and services, clear strategies should be defined to transfer knowledge to that
Agency's fiduciary units. Alternatively, it would be preferable to invest in ensuring that
the Agency's fiduciary unit has the capacity to, assume responsibility for project
procurement and financial management on its own.

                         Annex 13: Monitoring and Evaluation

The MDS has developed under the Project a comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) System. The Government assigned high priority to close monitoring and
evaluation of the BFP since the Program's establishment in 2004, and hence the Project
included a separate component (Component 3) to support the design and implementation
of a comprehensive M&E System. The establishment of Secretariat for Evaluation and
Information Management (SAGI) within MDS constituted a decisive and innovative step
for policymaking, assessment and evaluation of social policies. Until then, no Ministry
or central agency in Brazil had an autonomous body to carry out such activities. Under
the Project, SAGI was institutionally and technically strengthened to increase relevance
in the MDS' decision-making process. M&E activities supported by the Project, which
were developed and used extensively to ensure expected outcomes throughout
implementation, are described in detail in Section 3.2.

From the institutional perspective, SAGI is a transversal Secretariat supported by a
committee comprising key officials from the other Secretariats. Technically, SAGI is
conformed by high-level specialists and is responsible for: (a) a Monitoring System to
track the Program's progress and provide information based on indicators and
administrative data; and (b) an Evaluation System to conduct research and impact
evaluations based on rigorous methodologies, applied to selected social programs,
initially within MDS, to measure the outcomes of social programs, including the BFP, at
the federal level. The overall objective of the M&E System in MDS is to: (a) provide
feedback to program management in terms of results, outcomes, implementation and
outputs; (b) disseminate results and improve transparency of social programs through
publications, workshops and micro-data; (c) provide and make available strategic
information for decision-making and program design through reports, technical notes,
etc.; and (d) enhance the capacity of the Ministry to manage social policies, monitoring
and evaluation and social control. As in other countries, evaluation activities are periodic,
performed on selected programs only, based on sample data and intended to inform major
program decisions. Monitoring is a regular on-going process performed on all programs
using administrative (universal) data and sought to adjust and improve programs under
implementation. Given its importance as the Government's flagship social program, the
MDS opted for contracting-out the impact evaluation to an external specialized firm,
formed by a consortium of an internationally credible research organization and a local
research group. This was in addition to a strengthened series of operational audits by the
Tribunal de Contas da União since the beginning of the program.

Gradually, the Secretariat has developed instruments and tools to produce knowledge,
information and feedback in a timely fashion. In addition to the impact evaluations and
research carried out usually through contracting out internationally recognized firms
specialized in these area, SAGI has developed a set of mechanisms to follow the day-to-
day information on key Ministerial strategies, and provide useful information and
feedback to program managers and decision makers. Some of such instruments include:
(i) the Social Information Matrix, which provides internal and external information, and

                                             74
is a computer tool that stores data, information and indicators of social programs; (ii) the
Social Atlas, which presents cartographic and data information on specific programs; (iii)
monitoring cards, based on web-based questionnaires for following up the operation
status of the CRAS (Social Assistance Reference Centers); and (iv) geo-referencing of
social programs, among other tools. SAGI and SENARC run an extensive program of
capacity building for municipal and state managers of the program, both on operational
and analytical issues that is contributing to strengthening the technical capacity of these
actors.
Beyond the evidence generated by the BFP, the MDS has also made significant
contributions to help advance the culture and institutionalization of M&E in Brazil.
Monitoring and Evaluation functions in the MDS constitute a critical element of the
policy making and decision making process on social policies in three levels: (i)
internally, to provide feedback and improve effectiveness of and optimize resources
invested in social programs under the responsibility of the Ministry; evaluations and
assessments are carried out by SAGI in close coordination with implementing agencies
and programs' managers; (ii) at policy making level, to inform decisions taken in relation
to social programs; and (iii) externally, to improve transparency, control and
accountability of social policies, through the dissemination and discussion of evaluations
and assessments. SAGI disseminates the generated knowledge to the general public
through several channels, including through the academia as well as government officers,
workshops, technical publications, and availability of information in the web.

                                 Annex 14: Safeguards

In view of the Project's country scope, and the existence of a large group of Indigenous
and Quilombola (afro-descendents) populations in the country, OP 4.20 (at the time being
revised as OP 4.10) was triggered, and an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan was
prepared and consulted during preparation. Brazil currently has an estimated 530,000
Indigenous People of 225 different ethnic groups spread over 34 Special Indigenous
Sanitary Districts, and speaking 180 different languages. Between 100,000 and 190,000
live outside of Indigenous lands. The number of Quilombola communities varies
according to the source of information; it is estimated that there are approximately
560,000 people living in 3,225 communities. The rate of extreme poverty among these
ethnic minorities is estimated to reach 38 percent. In 2006, the nutritional census for
Quilombolas estimated that 57 percent of interviewed families were in what is considered
Class E, a group that includes the 4 percent poorest Brazilians. 
 
The Government introduced innovative and pragmatic strategies to increase the access
and participation of the most vulnerable groups in Bolsa Família, respecting their beliefs,
cultural identity and traditional values. This has relied mainly on specific processes to
facilitate the registry of families and to comply with/monitor conditionality. In 2004, as
the program started, it was nearly impossible to identify Quilombola and Indigenous
beneficiaries in the registries since they were not recognized as such in the registration
form.
The BFP has made significant progress in registering indigenous and Quilombola
beneficiaries, based on self-identification; ensuring that operational processes run
smoothly even in remote areas; and ensuring enough flexibility about compliance with
conditionalities to take into account specific health and education modalities for
Indigenous and Quilombola communities and the availability of social services in remote
areas. Consultations with families and communities participating in Bolsa Família are
carried out during registration. Until now, the program has registered Indigenous families
on demand by community leadership. Individual families have the right to refuse the
program or to accept it with informed consent. The program has made steady progress in
registering Indigenous families: from 29,000 in March 2006 to 71,000 in January 2009,
of which 59,000 were program beneficiaries. The program has also greatly increased its
coverage of Quilombola families: from 6,400 in October 2006 to 26,000 in January
2009, of which 21,000 were program beneficiaries.

To reach out to these groups, in 2005, the MDS created a Working Group on Traditional
Populations and Communities, with 10 anthropologists. Then, in 2008, the Cadastro
Único created a specific unit for this theme, responding directly to the management of the
National Secretariat for Citizens' Income (SENARC) in MDS. This unit is responsible
for all tasks pertaining to the registry of Indigenous and Quilombola families, as well as
other traditional people. It includes five staff, two of which are sociologists. MDS has
also set-up partnerships with various governmental and non-governmental agencies
(NGOs) that work with Indigenous peoples, such as the Fundação Nacional do Índio
(FUNAI, in charge of the Indigenous Policy of the Government), the Fundação Nacional

                                            76
de Saúde (FUNASA, in charge of Indigenous health services) and national and regional
federations of Indigenous organizations. Similarly, it has set up partnerships with
government agencies and NGOs that work with Quilombolas. These partnerships seek to
improve the inclusion of Indigenous and Quilombola populations and to improve the
supply of basic services for them. In addition, the Ministry of Social Development
commissioned specific studies respectively taking stock of federal government initiatives
related to Indigenous peoples and assessing nutritional issues facing Quilombola families,
and carried out consultations with several Indigenous and Quilombola communities in
2008. All of the materials to promote access and benefits for the Indigenous and
Quilombola communities are published on MDS' website.
Innovations have been included in the 2008 registration packages to ensure families are
knowledgeable about the benefits, eligibility, conditionalities for transfers, and exit
strategies. The processes have been codified in operational rules, regulations and
guidelines from the MDS. The new registration form for Cadastro Único includes
specific self-identification questions in the first section of the questionnaire, as well as
additional questions to register ethnicity (Indigenous) and community (Quilombos). The
new Cadastro Único form will be rolled-out before the end of 2009, together with
specific guides--Guía de Cadastramento das Famílias Indigenas and Guía de
Cadastramento das Familias Quilombolas (SENARC/MDS 2009)--targeted to municipal
managers, program staff and other service providers who operate directly with the
communities for the registration of Indigenous and Quilombola families. In addition, the
Government is in the process of re-defining its assistance to traditional peoples under the
coordination of Special Secretary for Policies to Promote Racial Equality (SEPPIR) in the
Presidency. The MDS is signing a new Technical Cooperation Agreement with FUNAI
to define the partnerships between the two institutions to deal with issues such as how to
deal with potential beneficiaries that lack any form of identification, how to identify the
most vulnerable groups. In May 2009, the MDS organized workshops in Brasília with
municipal stakeholders to discuss specific aspects of the program operations in areas with
a high proportion of Indigenous and Quilombola families.
