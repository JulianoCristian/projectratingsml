In September\n            2010, at least 12.7 million families (or nearly 50 million\n            people) were benefited by the program, according to\n            Brazil's Ministry of Social Development and Hunger\n            Alleviation. Bolsa Familia is a CCT program which provides\n            direct cash transfers to poor families who keep their\n            children in school and under regular medical supervision. By\n            this, it seeks to reduce both immediate and future poverty.\n            The Bolsa Familia Program was launched in October 2003,\n            during Brazilian President Luiz Inascio Lula da Silva's\n            first term, as the Government's flagship social program\n            in support of his \u0091zero hunger\u0092 initiative. In fact,\n            Brazilian efforts to address the structural causes of\n            poverty started in 1995, with municipal CCT programs, which\n            led to the creation of several national CCT programs in the\n            early 2000s. In 2003, four existing federal CCT programs\n            were merged into Bolsa Familia. Since the program\u0092s\n            inception in 2003, the World Bank played an important role\n            in the consolidation of first phase of Bolsa Familia, when\n            the program was supported by a US$572 million loan approved\n            in 2004, to help develop, strengthen and expand Brazil\u0092s\n            flagship social protection program. In September 2010, the\n            World Bank approved a US$200 million loan for the second\n            phase of support to Brazil\u0092s Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, which aims to\n            further strengthen Bolsa Familia\u0092s ability to achieve its\n            objectives of reducing poverty and inequality and promoting\n            the use of education and health services of the poor\n            population. Between 2003 and 2009, poverty (PPP $2 per day)\n            has fallen from 22 percent of the population to 7 percent."}, "docdt": "2005-12-13T00:00:00Z"}
