terms of the lending instrument: (a) a\n            programmatic approach; (b) a Program-Based Sector-wide\n            Approach (SWAp); and (c) mechanisms to pace disbursements\n            against conditional cash transfers under the Bolsa Familia\n            Program (BFP) in line with technical improvements. These\n            three features will help foster an effective link between\n            the implementation of the BFP while helping strengthen the\n            program through crucial technical assistance. The project\n            has the following five components: Component 1) will provide\n            support to the Government in consolidating and rationalizing\n            conditional cash transfers, and in reducing duplications and\n            gaps in coverage of the BFP, as part of a broader and\n            balanced strategy for economic and human capital\n            development. Component 2) will provide assistance to improve\n            the mechanisms used to identify the target population of the\n            BFP, which constitute a key element of the basic\n            architecture of the program. Component 3) will support the\n            design and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) system. Such a system would constitute a key\n            element of the basic architecture of the program, and one\n            that the Government has made a top priority since the\n            launching of the (BFP). Component 4) will support the\n            strengthening of the basic institutional functioning of the\n            BFP in terms of strengthening of the operational\n            institutional framework; strengthening program management;\n            developing a solid communications and dissemination strategy\n            with consideration of culturally, and ethnically diverse\n            publics; identifying and evaluating social welfare\n            innovations in \"empowerment\" and\n            \"bridging\" approaches. Component 5) will support a\n            strengthening of the implementation capacity of Ministerio\n            do Desenvolvimento Social e Combate a Fome (MDS). To provide\n            such support, the proposed project will finance incremental\n            costs related to management and supervision of Project activities."}, "docdt": "2004-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
