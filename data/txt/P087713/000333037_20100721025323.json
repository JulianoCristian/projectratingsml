negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            well-defined, targeted, managed and monitored Conditional\n            Cash Transfer (CCT) programs represent an important\n            instrument of social policy for reducing poverty and extreme\n            poverty, and improving income distribution. Political\n            leadership combined with strong technical implementation\n            capacity and rigorous evaluation is a key to the setting-up\n            and sustainability of CCT programs. Clear definition of\n            institutional responsibilities in turn ensures adequate\n            coordination and improves institutionalization and\n            sustainability. Families who fail to comply with\n            conditionality's may need additional support to take\n            full advantage of CCT programs. Strengthening human capital,\n            especially among the poor, requires tight coordination\n            between demand and supply side interventions. Transparent\n            targeting mechanisms ensure that a CCT program reaches its\n            intended beneficiaries and maximizes its impact. Clear and\n            transparent rules to provide support and apply sanctions\n            ensure CCT programs' credibility."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
