Some lessons learned included:\n            appraisal of such a large and relatively complex project\n            requires more careful and costly engineering preparation\n            studies to avoid the major changes in project components,\n            quantities and costs. The basic change in drainage design\n            criteria is a typical example of what should have been\n            determined during the preparation stage. A detailed, more\n            formalized approach is required including pre-lending\n            approval by the Bank of detailed project implementation,\n            design, operation, and maintenance plans and mechanisms\n            appropriate for any future project at hand, including\n            time-bound scheduling of performance activities and\n            management warning systems. Beneficiary involvement at\n            planning and design stages was inadequate and led many\n            farmers to oppose project implementation.
