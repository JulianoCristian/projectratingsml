The\n            project will provide an opportunity for the Bank to\n            follow-up on the level of individual banks with its\n            assistance, initiated under the Financial and Enterprise\n            Sector Credit, to transformation and strengthening of the\n            banking sector. It consists of two main components: 1) a\n            private sector finance component which will provide\n            investment and permanent working capital loans to private\n            enterprises, including agricultural enterprises in order to\n            improve profitability by increasing output or improving\n            efficiency; and 2) a private farmer finance component which\n            will help viable private farmers expand their agricultural output."}, "docdt": "1996-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
