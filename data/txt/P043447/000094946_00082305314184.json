Lessons drawn from the project\n            suggest that lending through intermediaries should intensify\n            technical assistance at the early stages of project\n            implementation, particularly in transition economies, where\n            it is difficult to introduce policy changes, and build\n            ownership. Technical assistance should be coordinated, and\n            integrated into a long-term strategic plan for the\n            development of commercial banks, and thus achieve\n            sustainable institutional development impact. The\n            establishment of an independent agency, is essential in\n            attaining discipline by the Borrower, as well as a formal\n            Fiscal Agency Agreement is critical to compliance with the\n            Loan Agreement's financial, environmental, and other\n            applicable legal covenants. Furthermore, early ownership of\n            project design, and clear institutional arrangements,\n            facilitate capacity building. Such capacity could then focus\n            on the competitive aspects of a limited number of\n            financially strong banks, rather than aiming at including\n            all possible smaller banks, a choice inherent in meeting\n            objectives, but a trade-off that needs to be revised. It is\n            questionable whether the need to keep an independent agency\n            after project closure is valid, for provided the\n            participating financial institutions fulfill the\n            qualification criteria, discretionary credit could be used\n            as an untied source of financing."}, "docdt": "2000-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
