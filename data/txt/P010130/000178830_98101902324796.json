system of Sri Lanka by a program of enhanced routine and\n            periodic maintenance, thereby reducing transport costs. The\n            project would provide for rehabilitation and limited\n            improvement of 112 miles of road; resealing or resurfacing\n            of about 150 additional miles; strengthening, repair or\n            replacement of 30 bridges and procurement of road\n            maintenance and workshop equipment. The project would also\n            strengthen the road maintenance services of the Department\n            of Highways and lay the foundation for improved routine and\n            periodic maintenance."}, "docdt": "1979-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
