implementing its Five-Year Development Program for the\n            Telecommunications Sector, which aims at reducing\n            Rawanda's geographical isolation from other countries,\n            improving the internal telecommunication network, and\n            extending it to rural and urban areas presently unserved.\n            The proposed project would provide for: (a) expansion of the\n            urban cable network in several towns by about 1,300\n            mainlines, and increase of the number of subscriber's\n            installations by about 3,000, in Kigali and other towns; (b)\n            installation of a new exchange at Rwamagana, equipped for\n            200 lines; replacement of 10 existing exchanges, with added\n            capacity of about 2,000 lines; installation of call charging\n            equipment and adaptation of the installation at Kigali and\n            other exchanges for interface with the new inter-urban\n            exchange; (c) installation of an automatic trunk exchange,\n            equipped for 300 circuits; replacement of existing ten HF\n            and low capacity UHF links, and installation of microwave\n            equipment for three new routes; (d) expansion of the telex\n            exchange at Kigali, provision of teleprinters for about 100\n            additional telex subscribers, and installation of voice\n            frequency telegraphy equipment at about 12 centers; (e)\n            construction of a warehouse and other buildings."}, "docdt": "1980-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
