I. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background and Organization
1.01      Rwanda, a small landlocked country in Eastern Africa (see map), is
one of the world's poorest countries and is included in the UN's list of
"25 least developed countries". Rwanda's population is estimated at about
4.8 million and is growing at an estimated 3% annually.  Population density
is high at about 183 km2. The major economic activity is agriculture, with
90% of the population dispersed throughout the rural areas as small farmers.
Main cash crops for export are coffee, tea and pyrethrum.  There is also
some mining of cassiterite (a tin ore) and wolfram (a tungsten ore).
1.02      The Ministry of Posts and Communications (MINPOSCO) is responsible
for regulation of telecommunications services within the country, allocation
of radio frequencies for all services, and licensing of private radio
installations. Within the Ministry, the Directorate General of Telecommuni-
cations (DGT) is responsible for the management of the services and is
headed by a Director General.
Access to Service
1.03      Access to telephone services in Rwanda is inadequate, particularly
in rural areas. With an estimated 0.056 telephone subscribers per hundred
population (or about 1 telephone per two thousand people), Rwanda has one
of the lowest telephone densities in the world (Annex 1). At end 1978,
of the 2,721 subscribers about 70% were in the capital city, Kigali, with
the remainder being distributed among other smaller towns. Registered
waiting applicants are mainly in Kigali and waiting times are long. There
is an unknown number of potential subscribers in the extensive areas where
the network has not yet penetrated.
1.04      Given inadequate access to the public telephone system, there
are approximately 50 licensed HF networks serving primarily private industrial
and commercial concerns, and religious missions - which generally provide
school and/or health services. It is not known how many unlicensed radio
systems (HF or VHF) may exist. At present there are virtually no public
call offices to provide nonsubscribers with telephone access.
Usage of the Service
1.05      Existing telephones are classified according to their location
as private or official. At present about 50% of subscribers are private and
50% official. The smaller towns have a higher percentage of official
subscribers. There is no breakdown between business and residential
services, as residential telephones are also used primarily for business
due to the difficulty of getting connections in the business districts.
In Kigali about 99% of traffic is local, 0.5% in interurban and 0.5%
international. In the regional centers interurban traffic is about 20% and
local about 80%, there is at present no international traffic.



- 2 -
Quality of Service and Existing Facilities
1.06      Quality of service is poor.  During business hours there is high
call traffic congestion. Service to subscribers is also frequently
interrupted by defaults on the lines. This is particularly common during
the rainy season. Interruptions in the interurban network last weeks at
a time. A discussion outlining the inadequacies of existing facilities
is presented in Annex 2.
Demand for Service
1.07      No comprehensive study of the existing and potential subscriber
demand or for public call office access has been undertaken to date. Since
1975 the annual growth in number of subscribers has averaged 6.5% per annum
with any increases in supply always being immediately taken up. In late 1978
the Telecommunications Department requested from other Ministries lists of
priority sites requiring telephone service.  The following summarizes the
results:
Ministry of Health                -   14 hospitals
Ministry of Natural Resources   -    5 mining centers
Ministry of Education             -   95 schools
Ministry of Youth and Sports    -   13 youth training centers
Ministry of Interior              -   Link all major centers, missions,
schools, hospitals, clinics,
commercial centers, mining and
industrial centers.
Ministry of Agriculture           -   All rural projects, tea factories,
coffee plantations, cooperatives
and other development projects.
These responses, particularly the Ministries of the Interior and Agriculture,
although not quantified,are an indication of the latent demand in Rwanda for
the most essential telecommunications services, as well as being an indication
of how Rwanda views the priority role of telecommunications in its development.
In the absence of a comprehensive study, telephone usage has been conservatively
projected to grow at 20% per year over the 1980-1984 period.
Sector Goals
1.08      Telecommunications sector goals are in harmony with those of the
national development plan which gives priority to the need to overcome
Rwanda's geographical isolation vis-a-vis other countries, and vis-a-vis
the enclavement of areas within the country. Communication is seen as an
important means of achieving this goal.
1.09      The goals established for telecommunications in the current five-
year plan include:
-    improvement in communications with communes; and
-    completion of infrastructure to allow direct communication
with other African countries.
-    improvement in communications to production centers.



- 3 -
Communication requirements are indicated between prefecture capitals and
Kigali, from subprefecture headquarters to regional centers, and from
communes to prefecture capitals.
Sector Constraints
1.10      The major constraints which have impeded progress in the
telecommunications sector has been the lack of continuous long-term foreign
exchange financing, the lack of control over implementation, both from an
investment and planning point of view, and inadequate maintenance.
IDA's Role
1.11      IDA first became associated with the telecommunications sector
in Rwanda through a sector mission carried out in March 1979. Following
this mission, IDA assisted Rwanda by preparing terms of reference to secure
consultants to prepare a telecommunications master plan and to help design
a project suitable for IDA financing. Part of the cost of the consultancy
was financed by IDA through the Project Preparation Facility. IDA's role
in the telecommunications sector of Rwanda is primarily focused on
institution building and providing much needed independent technical and
economic advice.

II. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Plan and the Program
2.01      A first draft telecommunication investment program was designed
within the framework of the national five-year plan. The updated program
for telecommunications now under consideration covers the period 1980-84.
It is set out in detail in Annex 3 and includes the following:
(a) ongoing works, which include:
(i) domestic network: a national transit center (cutover
1982), expansion and rehabilitation of the Kigali
network, and 50 public call office installations;
works began towards the end of 1979;
(ii) international network: an earth satellite station,
type B, (cutover expected end of 1981); an inter-
national transit center (cutover expected beginning
of 1982);
(b) the proposed first project (see para. 2.03); and
(c)  preliminary works needed for expansion of facilities from
1985 onwards.
This program is estimated to cost about RF 2.2 billion (US$24 million),
with a foreign exchange component of about RF 2.0 billion (US$21 million),
(Annex 4). The program is adequately designed to meet the highest priority
needs for improvement and expansion of telecommunications services within
the anticipated resources and the physical and managerial capability of DGT.
Project Concept
2.02      The project is designed to help the sector program towards its
goals as described in paragraph 1.09. In order to achieve sound development
of the total network while spreading the service in an equitable manner, the
project is designed to foster expansion of the domestic telephone and telex
network. The telex network expansion is needed as the present telex facil-
ities will be saturated during the program period. The expansion of the
domestic telephone network aims principally at bringing service to areas
which are not, or are insufficiently, served at present. These include a
new development zone at the outskirts of Kigali, and provincial towns and
those rural centers which are of primary importance for an equitable socio-
economic development of the whole country.
The Project
2.03      The project provides for:
(a) the expansion of urban cable networks in several towns
by about 1,300 main lines, and increase of the number



- 5 -
of subscriber installations, by about 3,000, in Kigali
and other main towns;
(b)  the installation of a new exchange at Rwamagana, equipped
for 200 lines; the replacement of ten existing exchanges,
the added capacity will be a total of about 2,000 lines;
installation of call charging equipment and adaptation of
the installation at Kigali and other exchanges for the
interface with the new trunk exchange;
(c)  the installation of an automatic trunk exchange, equipped
for 300 circuits; the replacement of ten HF and low capacity
UHF links with facilities for adequate reliability and
capacity; the installation of microwave equipment for three
new routes. A total of 100 new channels will be equipped;
(d)  the expansion of the telex exchange at Kigali, the provision
of teleprinters for 100 additional telex subscribers, and
the installation of voice frequency telegraph equipment at
about 12 centers;
(e)  miscellaneous (vehicles, tools, instruments, etc.);
(f)  construction of a warehouse and of other buildings; and
(g)  technical assistance and training services.
Project Costs
2.04      The estimated cost of the project is about RF 1,624 million (US$17.5
million), with a foreign exchange component of about RF 1,430 million (US$15.4
million). The cost details are given in Annex 4 and summarized below:

- 6 -
2.05      The cost estimates are based on prices experiences in other similar
conntries for similar types of equipment. No taxes or duties are charged on
local or imported telecommunications equipment. Previous procurement shows
that in Rwanda, which is a small and landlocked market, suppliers' quotations
tend to be on the high side. This has been taken into account in the estimates.
The local costs are based on prevalent costs of civil works, or costs of small
equipment and services available in Rwanda. Technical assistance costs as
shown above are based on 104 manmonths consultancy services estimated at
US$10,000 per manmonth and 72 manmonths of resident technical assistance
estimated at US$7,000 per manmonth.
Contingencies
2.06      A physical contingency of 5% has been provided on foreign and local
costs. Price contingencies have been applied for all equipment based on an
annual price escalation of 8% in foreign costs and 15% for local costs. They
are considered adequate and reflect the declining cost in real terms of
telecommunications equipment. The resulting estimated overall price escala-
tion amounts to about 21% of the estimated base cost plus physical contingency.
Project Financing
2.07      Project costs would be financed as follows:
US$ million       %
IDA                             7.5          43
France                          3.9           22
Canada                          4.0           23
Government of Rwanda            2.1           12
17.5         100
2.08      The proposed IDA credit of US$7.5 million would be to the Government
of Rwanda on standard IDA terms and would finance about 43% of total project
costs. France, through Fond d'Aide et de Coopération (FAC), and Caisse
Centrale de Coopération Economique (CCCE), would finance the equivalent of
US$3.9 million (about 22% of project costs). Canada, through CIDA, would
finance the equivalent of US$4.0 million (about 23% of project costs).
Confirmation of co-financing arrangements as condition for credit effec-
tiveness was agreed during negotiations.
Procurement
2.09      All equipment to be financed by the proposed IDA credit will be
procured through international competitive bidding (ICB), except for a few
items costing about US$0.5 million. The items excluded from ICB and proposed
for negotiated purchase on grounds of compatibility are:
(a) additional interworking equipment to be installed in
the existing Kigali local exchange; and
(b) additional equipment to increase the capacity of the
existing telex exchange.



- 7 -
The prices paid for the negotiated purchase items would be subject to IDA
approval and would have to be reasonable in terms of ICB prices offered.
Contracts for vehicles and sundry equipment costing less than US$50,000 and
not exceeding a total of US$500,000 would be awarded following Government
procurement procedures, which are satisfactory.
Disbursements
2.10      Funds from the credit account would be disbursed on the following
basis:
US$000's
(a) 100% of foreign expenditure on
equipment for local telephone
network, exchange equipment
long distance network and telex             4,100
(b) 100% of foreign exchange expenditures
or 80% of local expenditures (excluding
duties and taxes) on vehicles,
training equipment and civil works;           700
(c) 100% of foreign exchange expenditures
and 90% of local expenditures on the
cost of technical services and
technical assistance; and                  1,600
(d) an unallocated amount transferable
to above categories as appropriate          1,100
7F500
2.11      Disbursements against (a) to (d) would be fully documented.  An
estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Annex 5.
Project Implementation
2.12      The Directorate General of Telecommunications (DGT), (Chapter IV),
will be responsible for implementation of the project and will employ con-
sultants to: (a) prepare the specifications and bidding documents for the
telephone switching equipment, cable networks, microwave VHF/UHF radio
equipment, open wire carrier systems and rural network materials; and (b)
provide expert assistance for the supervision of installation and acceptance
testing of telephone switching and microwave systems. A provision has been
made in the project for technical services support of about 176 manmonths
consisting of 90 manmonths of engineering and 10 manmonths of financial
experts (see terms of reference in Annex 6), for the execution of the project
and 76 manmonths for training experts. DGT will lay and join the cables



- 8 -
and install the subscriber facilities by itself in the provincial towns;
in the metropolitan area, it will be assisted by the supplier. DGT will
assist the contracters rho will supply and install the telephone exchanges
and microwave and VHF/UHF radio equipment. During the execution of the
project, supervision will ensure that equipment will only be procured when
the building to house this equipment is certain to be completed by delivery
time. Civil works for construction of buildings and access roads will be
carried out by DGT. During negotiations assurances were obtained that,
prior to equipment tendering, a contract for the construction of
an equipment storage building had been signed. An estimated project imple-
mentation schedule is given in Annex 7.
Performance Indicators
2.13      Performance indicators to help monitor DGT's project implementation
and operational and financial performance are given in Annex 8. These
were discussed during negotiations and confirmed for inclusion in DGT's
project progress reports to be sent to IDA.

III. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
3.01      The economic analysis discussed in this chapter relates to the
1980-84 program of which the project forms an integral part. The program
is designed towards achieving the objectives of the telecommunications sector,
which are derived from the National Development Plan (paragraphs 1.16 and 1.17).
Telecommunications and Economic Development
3.02      Rwanda is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa;
most of its people live on small, dispersed farmsteads and 96% of the
population live in the rural areas. Kigali, the capital and only major
town, houses most of the Government and commercial operations. The existing
telecommunications system is rudimentary and of poor quality and does not
provide an adequate base for carrying out national development programs in
other sectors. Because of the poor transport system, internal telecommunica-
tions linlE radiating from the capital are essentîal for administrative and
trading purposes, as well as to support national health, education and rural
development programs.
3.03      The 1980-84 telecommunications investment program should assist in
providing the communication base necessary to (a) increase the rate of
economic growth in order to provide greater employment opportunities and
more income to the poorest segments of the population; (b) give the Govern-
ment a more active role in mobilizing financial resources and in participating
in mixed enterprises in the commercial and productive sectors; and (c) foster
decentralization of economic and social activity away from the capital city,
and promote balanced geographic distribution through development poles, the
settlement of the present population in villages, and migration from densely
to less densely populated areas.
3.04      With regard to international communication, Rwanda's enclave
position in the center of Africa, combined with the fact that it is one of
the poorest countries of the world and has limited natural resources, means
that its Government and its people must place great reliance on communications
links with the outside world. These links are necessary for the efficient
ordering and monitoring of imported comsumption and investment goods, as
well as to ensure that export earnings are not reduced through poor distribution.
They are also needed for effective aid, diplomacy and private communications.
The importance of independent links with the rest of the world was underscored
durirg the recent hostilities in Uganda, when the overland trade route through
that country was cut off, and telecommunications connections through Kampala
to other countries were severed.
The Distribution of Benefits
3.05      The distribution of the benefits resulting from the program will
either directly or indirectly be felt by all segments of Rwandese society.
The upgrading of communication among health and education facilities, and
greater efficiency in business, transportation, and rural development programs
will flow from improved communications.



- 10 -
3.06      The establishment of 50 public call offices (PCOs) in rural
areas will for the first time extend public telephone access to a broad
spectrum of the population. In the rural areas PCOs will be installed
first in the larger and more economically viable settlements. The reha-
bilitation and expansion of the long distance network will provide better
quality of service and increased access. The main beneficiaries of the
long distance network will be the economic development activities, e.g.,
tea factories, agricultural co-operatives, rural development projects;
and social services such as clinics, schools and training centers. The
ultimate beneficiary in these instances will be farmers and their families.
3.07      Finally, the proposed project will have a favorable financial
impact on Government development programs in other sectors in that over
the project period it is estimated that DGT will generate $6.0 million of
general revenue for Government use (paragrapn 5.06).
Tariff Policies
3.08      Given the scarcity of resources available to the telecommunica-
tions sector in Rwanda, tariffs are one means through which telecommuni-
cations services can be directed to high priority users. However, the
allocational aspects of tariff policy have not in the past been a prime
factor in determining tariff level or structure.  Hence, telephone
installation and rental charges are relatively low in Kigali, and rentals
in smaller exchange areas are charged at twice the rate of those in the
capital city. Also there are no differential rates between daytime peak
period calls and off-peak nighttime and weekend calls over the long distance
network. Local call charges, however, are not low by international standards
and, overall, revenue received by DGT is sufficient to generate a projected
rate of return of not less than 10% on revalued fixed assets (paragraph 5.10).
3.09      To better rationalize tariff level and structure toward ascertaining
what telephone tariff charges, if any, might better promote the overall national
equity and efficiency goals of government, DGT will undertake a tariff review
under terms of reference suitable to IDA, to be completed by July 1, 1981.
During negotiations assurances to this effect were obtained and also that
Government would discuss, with IDA, the implementation implications of this
review not later than December 31st, 1981.  A table of existing tariffs is shown
at Annex 9, and agreed draft terms of reference for the study are in Annex 10.
Least Cost Solution
3.10      The telephone network design has been based on standard engineering/
economic techniques for minimizing capital and recurring costs. Experienced
engineers have carried out most of the planning and design for the network
expansion. The current technologies adopted are acceptable. Appropriate
provision periods for the various types of plant have been adopted.
3.11      The long distance and international networks will comprise a mix
of coaxial cable microwave radio and satellite circuits which should provide
a reliable network. The extension of the local switching system will be
either crossbar or electronic switching, depending on the prices offered to
an open international tender, that the most cost-effective technology is



- il -
adopted. The new international switching center will be an electronic
system which will provide efficient manual assistance positions with visual
display units and keying of charging information. All these individual
elements of the program have been engineered to provide a sound telecommu-
nications network.
Return on Investment
3.12      The internal financial rate of return, defined as the discount rate
which equalizes the present value of cost and revenue streams (at 1980
prices) attributable to the 1980-84 program, is 12%.
3.13      This rate of return significantly understates the real benefits
to be derived from the investment program partly because the benefits stream
used in the calculation does not include any of the consumer surplus which
telephone users receive. In recent years, inflation has resulted in prices
falling in real terns and it is projected that they will continue to do so.
Hence, a portion of the consumer surplus can be estimated by (a) tabulating
over the program period the prices in 1980 real terms, which the existing
subscribers and existing registered applicants have demonstrated a willing-
ness to pay; and (b) assuming that the new applicants will also be willing
to pay the same real amount as existing subscribers and waiting applicants
have demonstrated a willingness to pay. Given these assumptions, all of
which are considered reasonable, the quantifiable estimate of the economic
rate of return would be 18%.
Risks
3.14      The project offers limited risk.  The principal risk is the
possibility of delayed physical implementation due to unforeseen circum-
stances. In telecommunications projects, which comprise a relatively
large number of independent activities, delay in the completion of a few
works does not generally prevent the use of other newly created assets.
Furthermore, costs and benefits are often delayed in roughly the same
degree, so the impact on the rate of return may not be significant. A
sensitivity analysis on the economic rate of return (Annex 10), shows that
a combination of 10% higher capital costs and 10% lower revenues, would
result in a return of 15%.
Environmental and Health Aspects
3.15      Telecommunications projects have very little direct impact on the
environnent. The plant is mostly unseen and it consumes little energy.
Through its use as an alternative to communications involving physical
movements, however, telecommunications has the potential to conserve energy,
reduce environmental pollution, and facilitate such items as health delivery
and emergency care.

IV. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Organization and Management
4.01      The Directorate General of Telecommunications (DGT), which
will be the implementing agency for the proposed project, is a part
of the Ministry of Posts and Communications. The Ministry's present
organization chart is shown in Annex 11. As a government department,
DGT's development plan, personnel, administrative and financial
policies are required to conform to the directives of the council of
the Ministers and the regulations governing the civil service in
Rwanda. DGT's budget forms a part of the Government's budget; its
investment funds are managed by the Ministry of Planning.
4.02      DGT is headed by a director general appointed by the Minister
of Posts and Communications. The Director General has reporting to
him the departmental heads of Accounts, Technical and Planning, and
Operations.  An International Telecommunication Union advisor is working
with the technical and planning division.
Management and Control
4.03      The management, budgeting and control systems operating in the
present organization need considerable strengthening. There is no internal
budgeting system, and the flow of management control information is erratic
and non-structured. There is a need for a disciplined, yet simple, management
information system to provide condensed and relevant information to the
Director and the Departmental Managers.
4.04      To help DGT during this critical phase of expansion, the proposed
project includes technical assistance for engineering experts of about 90
manmonths. One technical expert is already at work in Kigali to prepare
bid specifications. The project also provides about 10 manmonths of
accounting assistance. Draft terms of reference for these consultants are
shown at Annex 6. During negotiations assurances were obtained prior to
appointment that IDA had been given an opportunity to comment upon draft
terms of reference and proposed contract for this technical assistance.
Assurances were also obtained that prior to the appointment of any financial
assistance that IDA would be given an opportunity to comment on draft terms
of reference and draft proposed contract.

Staff and Training
4.05      Staff distribution by category is given in the table below:
Staff Classification
Technical and administrative                        54
Technicians and specialized workers                 66
Operators, linesmen, cable jointers,
drivers and unskilled workers                   320
Total                                        440
In comparison with similar sized entities in other countries,
the number of staff is high when compared with the telephones in
service (109 per 1,000 DELs), although small networks do tend to have
a high staff density. Throughout the project period, DGT does not
anticipate expanding its staff and by end 1984 staff density will have
reduced to about 60 per 1,000 DELs.
4.06      A new training school has recently been opened in Kigali.
The training program is designed primarily for operators, linesmen,
switching technicians and cable jointers and incorporates both introductory
courses and refresher courses. Personnel at levels higher than these are
not trained in Rwanda, but are sent to other more advanced schools in
Africa (Senegal and Madagascar). The school can accomodate about 50
students and has a classroom capacity to train each year, at least 20%
of the staff requiring training. Constraints on this capacity are lack
of adequate training equipment, and in the future, when contracts run
out, a lack of teachers. It is estimated that in order to have a
fully operational and continuing training facility it will be
necessary to recruit three trainers of various disciplines (Annex 6,
paragraph 15), each for a period of two years. The school has no course
for management or accounting training. It is proposed that, for accounting,
a specific one-month course will be held each year. The project provides
for the technical assistance requirements of 76 manmonths of teachers.
Provision is also made in the project for training equipment and for
senior members of the organization to attend overseas management courses.
Assurances were obtained, during negotiations, that draft terms of
reference for the abovementioned technical assistance would be submitted to
IDA for its comment and that prior to appointment IDA would have an
opportunity to comment on the appointees.
Accounting and Budgeting System
4.07      The General Directorate of Telecommunications (DGT) does not
enjoy financial autonomy. Its operational costs are controlled and
accounted for on a cash basis by the Secretary General's Department
within the same Ministry. The operating revenues for transactions with
the private and parastatal sectors are, however, controlled and accounted
for by DGT. The cash proceeds from these revenues are paid by DGT
into a Treasury account. In the case of credit transactions with



- 14 -
Government organizations, DGT's role is limited to the issuing of
invoices and the individual organizations make payment direct to the
Treasury or alternatively having the amounts due offset in their
ministerial or departmental role accounts by the Ministry of Finance.
DGT disbursements under the Development Budget and its foreign loan
and aid transactions are controlled by the Ministry of Plan.
4.08      The DGT does not maintain commercial accounts.  During project
preparation memorandum commercial accounts for the years 1976 to 1979
were prepared. During negotiations assurances vere obtained that
DGT would continue to prepare memorandum commercial accounts and that
these would be forwarded to IDA within four months of the end of the
financial year. Financial advisory technical assistance (paragraph 4.04)
would be used by DGT to assist in the preparation of these accounts.
Billing and Collection
4.09      Fixed annual rentals are billed in advance and call charges
are billed after they have been incurred. The current billing cycle is
on a monthly and bi-monthly basis, which is adequate for the current level
of activity. At present, however, bills are on average issued between two
weeks to two months after the period to which they relate. Subscribers
can pay in any post office and are expected to do so within two weeks.
If not paid, the amount is added to the subsequent month's bill together
with a reminder to pay. The policy is that if this second bill is not
paid within two weeks then the subscriber is disconnected. Telephone
accounts receivable at December 31, 1979 were estimated to be RF 140 million
of which RF 133 million represented private and parastatal sector users.
This is an overdue factor of about eight months. Government debtors are off-
set against their treasury account (see paragraph 4.07). Over the life of the
project, with improved management reporting, overdue receivables are expected
to reduce from about eight months to about four months outstanding.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that every six months DGT
prepare and forward to IDA a receivables ageing analysis by type of user and
would institute procedures to ensure a level of outstanding receivables of
four months, by December 31, 1982.
Audit
4.10     The Ministry of Finance from time to time will appoint special
investigators from within the Ministry to examine the financial state
of affairs of the various ministries and their departments. There is no
recognized system of annual independent audits within Rwanda. There is
a shortage of qualified French speaking auditors in the region and this has
led to difficulties and delays in the auditing of accounts of governmental
corporations. Nevertheless, during negotiations assuranceswere obtained
that DGT's annual memorandum commercial accounts would be audited each
year by auditors acceptable to the Association and that audited accounts
would be forwarded to the Association within six months of the end of
each fiscal year.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Financial Performance
5.01      The past financial performance of DGT as shown in the
memorandum commercial accounts, prepared during project preparation, has been
reasonable. A summary for the years 1976 to 1979 is given below:
1976       1977        1978        1979
(in thousands of Rwandaise francs)
Operating revenues    186,733    191,550    235,874    248,660
Operating costs        146,542    158,274    174,542    185,897
Operating surplus       40,191      33,276      61,332      62,763
The rate of return on revalued assets during these years has risen from about
9% in 1976 to about 27% in 1979. Annex 12 shows these figures in more detail.
Present Financial Position

- 16 -
Valuation of Assets
5.03      DGT's records on fixed assets are incomplete and historic
cost and year of acquisition for each item cannot be firmly established.
No plant accounts are maintained and book value of assets has been
calculated based upon historic Governnent development budget costs
and bilateral aid. Present asset figures and future projections are
considered to be accurate to the extent that a major proportion
(in value terms) of the assets currently in service will be replaced
during the course of the project.
5.04      DGT has never established the effect of inflation on the value of
its fixed assets. To reduce possible distortion in future assets value
by price inflation on the one hand and declining unit costs from improved
technologies and economies of scale on the other, DGT's net fixed
assets in operation have been adjusted to reflect the current value of
the assets, and have been revalued by 6% per annum for the forecast
period.
5.05      During negotiations assurance were obtained that, not later
than December 31, 1980, DGT would propose to IDA a method for revaluation
of its fixed assets in accordance with methods agreed upon with IDA.
Assurances would also be obtained that DGT would review the value of its
fixed assets annually thereafter, in accordance with the methods agreed
on with IDA for the purposes of calculating the rate of return.
Financing Plan
5.06      The forecast of sources and application of funds is based on
DGT's capital expenditure program and is shown in Annex 13. Following
is a summary of the financing plan for the period 198044.

- 17 -
The above financing plan assumed that DGT will continue to operate as a
government department and to pass all surplus cash to the account of the
Treasury.
5.07      Of the total requirements during the project period, DGT's
internal cash generation would be expected to be the equivalent of a
37% contribution, which is reasonable. This internal cash generation is,
however, transferred to Treasury (paragraph 4.07). Bilateral sources would
finance 60% of program costs, IDA 27% and Government budget 13%.
Future Financial Performance
5.08      Financial statements projected for FYsl980-86 are given in
Annex 12 thru Annex 14. A summary of DGT's expected future financial
performance, assuming inflation on operating costs consistent with these
rate& usad in estimating project costs, is i.iven balow.

Debt service coverage (times) 3.3       3.7   3.8    2.3    3.2    4.6    5.6
5.09      DGT's projected financial performance over the project period is
satisfactory. The operating ratio should drop to about 64.0%, due to the
build-up in capacity utilization and planned staffing efficiencies. With
a high fixed cost element, an operating ratio of this order is quite
accaptable.  The debt service coverag-e rate is estimated to average about 3.8
throughout the period and should not fall below 2.3, which is considered
to be reasonable.
5.10      In respect of tariffs, it is assumed that there will be no
increases during the project period. The present forecasts show the rate
of return on the estimate of revalued assets to be not less than 10%
throughout the Project period. A rate of return of 10% would be adequate
to meet DGT's future financial requirements. During negotiations assurances
were obtained that DGT would maintain tariffs at a sufficient level to
achieve a rate of return on revalued average net fixed assets of at least
10% each year.

VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations assurances were obtained from Government
that as condition for credit effectiveness:
(a) co-financing arrangements had been confirmed (para. 2.08).
6.02      Assurances were also obtained that:
(a)  a contract for construction of an equipment storage
building has been signed prior to equipment tendering
(para. 2.12);
(b) DGT will undertake a review of the level and structure
of its tariffs, under terms of reference suitable to
the Bank, to be completed by July 1, 1981, and that
Government would discuss with IDA the implementation
implications of this review not later than December 31,
1981 (para. 3.09);
(c) DGT would submit to IDA, for comment, prior to
December 31, 1980, its proposed methodology for the
valuation of fixed assets (para. 5.05); and
(d)  DGT would maintain tariffs at levels sufficient to
achieve a rate of return on revalued average net fixed
assets of at least 10% (para. 5.10).
6.03      Provided the above conditions are met, the proposed project
constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit to Government of Rwanda of
US$7.5 million equivalent.

2.        The local exchanges are automatic, all fairly recent (installed
since 1970), but of the step-by-step type, without registers. The last
shipment of an extension for Kigali exchange was severly damaged during
transport and only part of the 3,500 lines installed is being used. Six
of the provincial exchanges have defects, and cannot be utilized to their
full capacity; the other exchanges work satisfactorily. A telephone
switching expert, seconded by ITU, visited Rwanda to analyze the problems of
the present switching equipment, and proposed solutions to allow for the
expansion of the network. One of the major problems is the impossibility of
the six exchanges to allow subscriber trunk dialing (STD). His conclusion
was that these should be replaced as soon as possible (see para. 2.03(b)
project description).
3.        The local network in Kigali, as well as elsewhere, is presently
saturated and in most areas no new subscribers can be connected, although
the exchanges themselves operate at only slightly more than 50% capacity.
The main problem is the poor quality of the existing cables (armored cables,
insulated with paper or plastic), laid directly in the ground, which are
no longer waterproof, thus creating short circuits on the subscriber lines
when it rains.
4.        A recent technical ITU study has shown that the principles in use
in Rwanda for expanding the subscriber network were not optimal. The new
proposed method (star with distributing cabinets instead of spurs connected
to a loop transport cable), should decrease the cost of connecting new
customers.

5.        Long Distance Network - all interurban traffic is manual, handled
by a heterogeneous manual toll center with five operator positions.  The
quality of service is poor, mainly because of the poor functioning of the
equipment.  All interurban and international traffie transits by three
cables connecting Kigali toll center to the nodal repeater station at
Mount Jari and these cables suffer from the same problems as those of the
local rietwork (see paragraph 1.09). During the present program execution,
it is planned to connect Kigali toll exchange to the repeater of Mount Jari
by a 300/600-channel microwave link, which should improve the situation.
But the other links, from Mount Jari to the provincial towns are also often
out of service due to the poor quality of the equipment; of the six links
originally equipped with three voice and four telex channels, only one
telex link has been working, and most links have only one voice channel
working. The remaining links, using HF radio equipment suffer the defects
inherent to this type of transmission (dependence on atmospheric and
ionospheric conditions), they are scheduled to be replaced by UHF/VHF
links.
6.        Telex and Telegraph Services - of the 60 telex subscribers, only
one is located outside of Kigali. One teleprinter is installed in each
provincial exchange (except Kibungo), to provide telex service, but, as
mentioned in paragraph 1.11, only one telex link can be used. A new
semielectronic telex exchange has been installed and was cut over at the
beginning of 1979.
7.        Telegraph is provided by old Morse code equipment with trans-
mission over HF links. Only two positions are equipped in Kigali, and it
may take some days before a telegram is actually transmitted.
8.        International Telephone, Telegraph and Telex Services - as a
consequence of the dissolution of the East African Community, the semi-
automatic telecommunication connection of these countries has been stopped,
and all links are operated manually. Kampala (five voice channels and
five telex channels) does not answer any more. An HF link has been installed
on a make-shift basis to Nairobi. The UHF link to Bujumbura (seven voice
channels) is often out of service. The HF radio links to Brussels (telephony
and telex), Paris (telephony and transit), and Frankfurt (telex and transit)
are working reasonably well. These three links are insufficient to carry
the offered traffic and delays are frequently a day or more. Two other
HF links, to Kinshasa and Abidjan are no longer operated because they are
uneconomical, the traffic being too low.

GENERAL DIRECTORATE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS
FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Description of Works in DGT's Program 1980-84
1.        DGT's 1980-84 telecommunications development program has the
following components:
(a) ongoing works, which are part of the initial 1977-81
development program;
(b) the new works proposed in the telecommunications
project forming part of the current program 1980-84; and
(c)  preliminary works needed for essential expansion from
1985 onwards.
A brief description of the major works included in the program follows:
(a) Ongoing Works
2.        Rehabilitation and expansion of the cable network of Kigali;
works have begun to expand the cable network of Kigali by about 3,000 pairs.
This will release the congestion of the network and allow connection of
additional subscribers in Kigali during the program period, financed by a
grant from Netherlands.
3.        A national transit switching center, financed by France, is
expected to be cut over in the beginning of 1982. It will have a total of
about 288 junctions.
4.        Replacement of the HF link Kigali-Ruhengeri by a microwave link.
The project is financed by a grant from Belgium and is expected to be
completed during the first half of 1981.
5.        Connection of about 65 rural communities to the public telephone
network by means of PCOs. The first 15 constitute an experimental project
which should be completed by 1982 and is financed under a UNDP/ITU project.
On the basis of experience gained, an additional 50 PCOs, to be financed by
the United Nations and the Government of Switzerland, will be installed.
6.        Earth satellite station:  it is an Intelsat standard B station
equipped initially for 14 channels (8 telephone channels, 4 reserved for
telegraph/telex transmission, and 2 for service channels). The satellite
station is financed by a grant from Japan.  Cut-over is scheduled for the
end of 1981.

7.        An international switching center of an electronic type will replace
the existing manual center, and will allow semiautomatic operation. It will
be equipped initially with 40 international junctions and 50 national junctions.
It is planned to be operational by the middle of 1982.  It is financed by a
grant from Japan.
8.        An international telex center, the function of which is to give
automatic international dialing to the telex subscribers. It is also
financed by Japanese grant, and will be operational by the end of 1981.
(b)  New Works Under the Proposed Telecommunications Project
Local Telephone Exchanges
9.        The project provides for:  (a) the replacement of the six older type
ATEA exchanges in the following towns: Kibuye, Gitarama, Gikongoro, Nyabisindu,
Kibungo and Byumba. The new exchanges installed in these localities will have
a capacity of 200 lines; (b) replacement of the following existing centers (and
capacity of the new equipment): Butare (500), Gisenyi (600), Ruhengeri (400),
Cyangugu (400); (c) creation of a new center of 200 lines in Rwamagana; and
(d) call charging equipment and additional equipment needed in Kigali local
exchange to interface with the new toll center.
Local Cable Distribution Networks
10.       The project provides for the installation of cable, associated
network hardware, and telephone sets to connect about 1,300 additional
subscribers in the provincial towns, and the installation of about 3,000 new
subscribers in Kigale and in provincial towns.
Long Distance Transmission Facilities
11.       These facilities include replacing the existing HF links Kigali-
Cyangugu and Kigali-Gisenyi with new SHF systems; replacing the existing UHF
links 1/ from Kigali to Butare, Kibuye, Gitarama, Gikongoro, Nyabisindu,
Kibungo and Byumba by SHF links; constructing a new SHF link Kigali-
Rwamagana; and adding the necessary equipment in Cyangugu and Mount Jari to
open new direct routes. Altogether a total of about 100 additional circuits
will be put in service during the project period.
Telex Services
12.       The project provides for extension of the domestic telex exchange
in Kigali by 100 lines, for additional teleprinters to allow the commission
of about 100 new subscribers, and the installation, at about 12 provincial
1/ Which cannot expand to meet the traffic increase brought about the project.

13.       The project provides for the construction of a warehouse, buildings
to house the new exchanges and repeater stations. It includes vehicles and
the tools and instruments necessary to carry out the acceptance tests of the
equipment, and the external plant construction.
Technical Assistance and Training
14.       Technical assistance consists of:
(a)  90 man-months of telecommunications technical experts and
10 man-months of financial experts. Their proposed terms
of reference are as per Annex 6. The experts will provide
on-the-job training to their counterparts in DGT, and
about 10% of their time in Rwanda will be devoted to giving
courses to DGT's staff;
(b) about 76 man-months of professors to staff the training
schools. The professors will teach the following subjects:
external plant; transmission equipment; switching equipment;
and other courses about the operational aspects of tele-
communications (operators training, etc.); and
(c) provision for senior management to attend overseas courses
and seminars.

Study of Tariff Structure
Draft Terms of Reference
1.        The purpose of the study is to develop the principles which should
guide formulation of an appropriate structure of tariffs for telecommunica-
tions services in Rwanda, and to apply these principles in the form of a
recommended structure of tariffs for application for 1981 through 1984.
2.        The basic approach to establishing an appropriate tariff structure
will be that of marginal cost pricing, with the constraint that overall
revenue generation must be sufficient to ensure financial viability of the
telecommunications entity. Marginal cost, or the amount which would be
saved to the economy if marginal demand (e.g., an additional telephone line,
an additional call) were not met, may take either of two forms:
(a)  cost to the telecommunications entity of supply, where
capacity exists to meet the demand; and
(b) cost to the other competing user of doing without the
service, where capacity is insufficient to meet the
demand.
Thus the study has to have both a cost accounting dimension and a demand
assessment dimension, as well as to include a financial analysis to assess
the adequacy of revenues generated from the point of view of financial
viability.
Cost Accounting
3.        The purpose of this part of the work is to identify the marginal
costs of the principal different telecommunications services offered,
distinguishing between Kigali, major regional towns and country areas:
(a)  provision of telephone connection;
(b) local calls;
(c) long distance calls;



- 35 -                 ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 3 pages
(d) international calls; and
(e)  telex, and same subcategories.
Such costs will be specified in 1981 values.
4.        The bases of the calculations will be:
(a)  financial accounts of the enterprise;
(b) operating records of the enterprise;
(c)  spot-checks to establish on a sample basis the marginal
costs of particular services; and
(d)  relevant data available from other telecommunications
administrations.
Demand Assessment
5.        The purpose of this part of the work is to assess the strengths of
demand for each of the different services offered by the telecommunications
entity, and the sensitivity of that demand to the prices which might be
charged. This is needed for two purposes: (a) in order to estimate the cost
to users (or potential users) of doing without the service, for cases where
it is not possible to meet demand fully; and (b) in order to identify those
services which are in least elastic demand (i.e., demand will be least
affected by price changes), so that they should be made to bear the major
part of any mark-up necessary to cover overheads and enable the telecommunica-
tions entity to attain overall financial viability.
6.        This work will require thorough review of existing records on
applications for service, calling rates, ineffective calls, etc., followed
by surveys of a sample of existing and potential users in order to deepen
knowledge of the strength of demand for the different services and of the
amounts that customers would be prepared to pay for the different services
(or that they would suffer as losses, or extra expenses, if the services
were not available).
Social Considerations
7.        Attention must be given, in connection with the Demand Assessment,
to the possible need to charge certain incipient users, e.g., services in
distant rural areas, or public call offices, at rates below those that would
be indicated by marginal cost and financial viability considerations, as a
means to stimulate socially highly desirable use. Certain limited cross-
subsidization of this nature may be a worthwhile means of bringing tele-
communications facilities within the reach of poorer people who would other-
wise be excluded.



- 36 -                  ANNEX 10
Page 3 of 3 pages
Financial Analysis
8.        The approximate tariffs for the different services (some of which
may well turn out to need to be cost-based while others may need to be more
demand-based) must then be multiplied by estimated levels of service require-
ments to assess total revenues for 1981 and the following five years. These
should be compared with updated projections of costs, to assess the future
financial status of the enterprise.
9.        Iterations may be required in order to produce a structure of
tariffs that is consistent with financial viability.
Final Results
10.       The results of the study should be a recommended set of prices for
the various services, with alternative possibilities where appropriate, and
projections of the effect of application of such prices on the enterprise's
revenues and financial performance. Recommendations should also be made
as to how the tariffs should be adjusted over time in light of changes in
costs including inflation.
Resources Required
11.       The study will require approximately six weeks of effort on the
part of an economist, a financial analyst and an engineer, each with experi-
ence in telecommunications, and supplemented by the necessary staff to
assist with survey work.

Return on Investment
1.        The benefit period of the program extends from 1980-2000, when
on average the equipment provided under the program is expected to have
substantially completed its useful life.
2.        Capital expenditures are based on the estimated requirements
during the program period, excluding preinvestments for future programs.
Asset values have been adjusted to reflect 1980 values.
3.        Incremental revenues assigned to the program are primarily based
on the expected additional telephone and telex subscribers and the traffie
increase brought about by the program. Incremental costs excluding depre-
ciation and interest are based on the additional assets, traffic and staff
requirements expected from the program. All revenues and costs have been
deflated to bring them to their comparable 1980 price levels.
4.        A summary of the programs incremental cost and benefit stream at
1980 price levels is as follows (in Million RF):
Capital         Operating          Net
Year      Expenditure   Costs   Revenues   Benefits
1979           251         -          -         -251
1980          372          6          41        -337
1981           580         5          82        -503
1982          453         13         132        -334
1983           220        14         187        - 47
1984            79        15         238         144
1985            -         18         282         264
1986-2000         -         25         319         294
5.    The internal rate of return for the above benefit stream is 12%.

6.        Applying a standard conversion factor of .74, and estimating
the future consumer surplus by tabulating over the program period the prices
in real terms (1980 level) which existing subscribers and applicants are
demonstrating a willingness to pay, and assuming that new subscribers are
prepared to pay the same real amount, the economic rate of return is 18%.
Labor has not been shadow priced as DGT mostly employs skilled staff of
which there is no surplus in Rwanda.
7.        A sensitivity analysis on the above rate of return shows that with
10% higher capital costs and 10% lower revenues the rate of return will be
15%.
