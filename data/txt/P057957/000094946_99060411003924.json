The benefits of the\n            project include: a) It will stem the losses of the coal\n            companies and eventually turn a money losing state\n            controlled sector into a competitive and profitable private\n            industry; b) from the point of view of society, the\n            immediate beneficiaries of the Program will the miners and\n            their immediate dependents; c) the population of the mining\n            regions will benefit from the continued social peace and\n            employment opportunities; and d) the Polish people will\n            indirectly benefit through improved economic performance and\n            an assurance that their tax payment are being applied to\n            constructive needs rather than to propping up a loss-making\n            industry. The major risks include: 1) implementation may\n            slow down due to continued unwillingness of mine management\n            to close capacity; 2) a lack of sufficient funds to meet the\n            demand for social packages in 1999 will compound the first\n            risk; 3) the companies may fail to be profitable; and 4)\n            companies may be slow to implement high priority\n            environmental improvements. These risk are addressed in the\n            program design and implementation."}, "docdt": "1999-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
