Lessons identified feature the continued\n            implementation of the coal sector reform, and, useful\n            insights for future Bank operations to support coal sector\n            reform. The comprehensive approach to coal sector reform\n            taken by the government, should be maintained, as well as\n            the Inter-Ministerial Coal Steering Committee, which\n            provides a coordinated approach for addressing, and\n            monitoring implementation issues. However, and although the\n            current coal sector program showed positive initial signs,\n            further employment restructuring, and mine closures, will be\n            needed for full privatization, and viability of the\n            industry. Voluntary employment restructuring has slowed\n            down, and job creation in the regional economy needs\n            particular attention: financial performance needs\n            improvement, and budgetary constraints needs to be applied,\n            to achieve privatization which would speed the\n            Government's transfer of price risks to the private\n            sector, protecting itself, and taxpayers from the risk of\n            further subsidies. Careful consideration should be given if\n            prime mines initiate the privatization process, for it could\n            risk a large residual of unattractive mines. From an\n            operational standpoint, the Bank is in a unique position to\n            play a highly constructive role, given its experience in\n            coal sector restructuring, and social mitigation, by\n            bringing in skills, forging consensus, and, ensuring\n            interactions prod privatization processes. It is suggested\n            that a sector adjustment operation should be the instrument\n            of choice, for it supports all the social, environmental,\n            technical, and managerial aspects involved."}, "docdt": "2001-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
