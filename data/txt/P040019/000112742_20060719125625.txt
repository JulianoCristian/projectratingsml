   IEG Mission: Enhancingdevelopment effectiveness through excellenceand independence inevaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent EvaluationGroupassessesthe programsand activitiesof theWorld Bankfor two purposes:
first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluation processand to verifythat the Bank'swork is producingthe
expected results, and second,to helpdevelop improveddirections,policies,and proceduresthrough the
dissemination of lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As part of this work, IEGannuallyassesses about 25 percentof the
Bank's lendingoperations. Inselecting operationsfor assessment, preferenceis givento those that are innovative,
large, or complex;thosethat are relevantto upcomingstudies or countryevaluations; those forwhich Executive
Directors or Bankmanagementhave requestedassessments; and those that are likelyto generate importantlessons.
The projects, topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessmentsupport larger evaluationstudies.
       A ProjectPerformanceAssessment Report(PPAR)is based on a review of the ImplementationCompletion
Report (a self-evaluationby the responsibleBank department)and fieldwork conducted by IEG. To prepare
PPARs, IEGstaff examines project files and other documents, interviewoperational staff, and in most cases visit
the borrowingcountry for onsitediscussionswith projectstaff and beneficiaries.The PPARthereby seeks to
validate and augmentthe informationprovidedin the ICR,as well as examine issues of special interestto broader
 IEGstudies.
       Each PPAR is subject to a peer review processand IEGmanagementapproval. Once cleared internally, the
PPAR is reviewed by the responsibleBank department and amendedas necessary. The completed PPAR is then
sent to the borrowerfor review; the borrowers' comments are attachedto the document that is sent to the Bank's
Boardof ExecutiveDirectors. After an assessmentreport has beensent to the Board, it is disclosedto the public.


About the OED Rating System
      The time-testedevaluation methods used by IEGare suitedto the broad range of the World Bank's work. The
methodsoffer both rigor and a necessarylevelof flexibilityto adapt to lendinginstrument,project design, or
sectoralapproach, IEGevaluators all apply the same basic methodto arriveat their project ratings. Following is
the definition and rating scale usedfor each evaluationcriterion(more informationis availableon the IEGwebsite:
http://worldbank.org/lEG/eta-rnainpage. html).
      Relevance of Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's
current development priorities and with current Bank countryand sectoralassistancestrategies and corporate
goals (expressedin Poverty ReductionStrategyPapers, CountryAssistance Strategies, SectorStrategy Papers,
OperationalPolicies).Possibleratings: High, Substantial,Modest, Negligible.
      Efficacy: The extentto whichthe project's objectiveswere achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
accounttheir relative importance. Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency: The extent to which the projectachieved, or is expectedto achieve, a return higherthanthe
opportunitycost of capital and benefitsat leastcost compared to alternatives. Possibleratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible.This ratingis not generallyappliedto adjustment operations.
      Susfainability: The resilienceto risk of net benefitsflows over time. Possibleratings: HighlyLikely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      lnstitutionalDevelopment Impact: The extentto which a project improves the abilityof a countryor region
to make more efficient, equitableand sustainableuse of its human,financial, and natural resourcesthrough: (a)
betterdefinition,stability, transparency, enforceability,and predictabilityof institutionalarrangementsand/or(b)
better alignmentof the mission and capacityof an organizationwith its mandate,which derivesfrom these
institutionalarrangements. InstitutionalDevelopmentImpactincludes both intended and unintendedeffects of a
project. Possibleratings: High, Substantial,Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently.Possibleratings: HighlySatisfactory,Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory, HighlyUnsatisfactory.
      BankPerformance: The extentto whichservices provided by the Bank ensured qualityat entry and
supported implementationthrough appropriatesupervision (including ensuring adequate transitionarrangements

         This is the Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) on four lending operations
to the Republic o fMadagascarfrom 1996to 1999, to assist inimprovingpublic management
and creating a favorable environmentfor the private sector, with the overarching objectives of
opening the economyto marketforces andreducing poverty.

 Summary
 1.     This i s the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) on four operations,
approved inthe second halfo f the 199Os, aimed at supporting the transition of
Madagascar from a largely dirigiste economy since independencein 1960 to a market
economy. In 1996, anew government initiateda shift to policies basedonprivate sector
ledgrowth andintegrationinto the world economy, with the overarching objective o f
reversinga dramatic decline inincomeper capita over the previous decades. The Bank
 supported this shift by engaging into a dialogue on structural reforms articulated along
two axes, a changing role o f the public sector and promotionofthe private sector as
 engine o f growth, andcovering four areas: broad-based growth ledby foreign
investment; humancapital development; strengtheningthe public sector's ability to
 deliverquality services; andnaturalresource management. Implementationwas
 supported by two StructuralAdjustment Credits (FY97 andFY99), accompaniedby two
technical assistance (TA) operations meant to mitigate the implementation capacity risks
 associated with the reforms: the Public Management Capacity BuildingProject
(PAIGEP) andthe Private Sector Development andCapacity BuildingProject (PATESP),
both o fFY97.

2.      Implementationandresults were affected by three categories o f factors. First,
internally, a persistently fluidpolitical situation, markedbyinstability, rivalries, and
resistance to change, ledto varying degrees o f commitment to and ownership o freforms.
This culminatedina deep politicalcrisis consequent to contestedpresidential elections in
December 2001,duringwhich two parallelgovernments were established. The crisiswas
resolved inJuly 2002, when the international community recognizedthe Ravalomanana
govemment of the current President. The unstable political situation was exacerbatedby
weak institutional andadministrativecapacity. Second, external shocks (three cyclones
and a major increase inoil prices in 2000 - the Bank extended two Supplemental Credits
to mitigate their negative impact) considerably disrupted the carrying out o freforms.
Third, implementationwas negatively affected bythe-overambitious goals andcomplex
design o fthe Bankprojects, notably the two TA operations. These were restructured to
sharpen their focus, while SAC-I1underwent a major restructuring to respondto the new
priorities and revised policy choices o fthe government emerging from the 2002political
crisis.

3.      Overall, the results were mixed, but, despite all the difficulties encountered, the
main outcome i s that Madagascar succeededinmoving - however imperfectly - towards a
market economy andto opening its economy to the outside world. This positive
outcome, however, is tempered bythe little progress achieved inreducingpoverty during
the period. The analysis has led to the following ratings.

4.      PAIGEP. Outcome i s ratedunsatisfactory because achievements were mixed and
fragmentary due to insufficient commitment, frequent conflicts and changes inthe
administration, andpoor coordination. Institutionaldevelopment impact i s ratedmodest
because the impact onthe keyministries and entities responsible for improving resource
allocations and service delivery was minimal. Sustainabilityi s rated likely basedon
increased capacity inmacro-economic management, budget cycle, treasury operations,

                                              xiv


and thejudiciary. Bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory because of
numerous shortcomings at entry as the Bank overestimated GOM's commitment and paid
insufficient attention to institutionalissues. Nevertheless, duringimplementation, the
Bank responded flexibly to the rapidly changing situationand was able to keep the
dialogue open. Borrower performance i s rated unsatisfactory becausecommitment was
weak and a lack o fleadership ingovernance, reallocation o fresources, andpoverty
alleviation.

5.      SAC-I. Outcome i s ratedmoderately satisfactory becauseprogress was
considerably delayed inprivatization, a key reform area, andno progress was recorded in
redirecting resources to the social sectors. Institutional development impact i s rated
modest becauseo fincreased capacity inthe areas o ftrade, private sector development,
and dialogue between the private andpublic sectors, but there was very little progress in
the management ofthepublic sector. Sustainability is ratedlikely onthebasis ofno
reversal inpolicies andprogress inreachinga consensus onthe content o f SAC-11. Bank
performance i s rated satisfactory becausekey conditions for opening the economy were
well identifiedandprioritized, and, after disbursement o fthe single tranche, the Bank
showed consistency inbringingthe reform agendamoving towards SAC-11. Borrower
performance i s ratedmoderatelysatisfactory because o fweak commitment to reforms
andaninability to initiate a serious poverty reductionprogram.

6.      PATESP.Outcome i s ratedmoderately satisfactory becauseit helpedin
formulating divestiture policies and launchingthe first phase o fthe privatization
program. However, the overall divestitureprogramremained well behind schedule.
Although the project succeededinbroadening and strengthening business services to
some SMEs, several broader objectives o f developing the private sector were not
achieved. Institutionaldevelopment is ratedsubstantial on the basis o f an emerging
capacity to formulate privatization strategies andmanage the privatization program and
the establishment o fregulatorybodies inkeypublic service sectors. Sustainabilityis
rated likely on the grounds that some institutionalstructures are now inplace to promote
private sector development andcompetition. Bankperformance is rated satisfactory
because Bankassistance and advice were not only consistently strong but also well
targeted to the priorities as they emerged from implementation o f SAC-II. Borrower
performance i s rated unsatisfactory becausecommitment to reforms remainedlukewarm
andbecausesome successful private sector development structures were unnecessarily
dissolved.

7.      SAC-TI. Outcome is ratedmoderatelysatisfactory becauseresults were mixed
anduneven. While progress was madeinmacro-economic management, privatization,
andbusiness climate, littlewas achievedinpublic financial management andgovernance.
Public resource management continuedto beneglected, with a negativeimpact on
poverty alleviation. Institutionaldevelopment impact i s ratedmodest because, overall,
little was achieved inraisingthe capacity to formulate and implementpolicies.
Sustainability is rated likely because o fno reversal inpolicies, despite the crisis.
Moreover, the risks o freversalhave diminishedthanks to a greater acceptance o freforms
bythepublic opinion andtheprivate sector. Bankperformance isratedmoderately
satisfactory. The credit was generally well-designed, reflecting the Bank's knowledge o f

                                               xv


country conditions that hadbeen accumulated over several years, and it was supervised
flexibly, especially inthe face of shocks. However, there were shortcomings inthe
Bank's performance, it continued to overestimate government's commitment and
underestimate institutional weaknesses. Inaddition, itbecame too absorbed by the
privatizationprogram at the expense o f issues o fresource allocationandpoverty
reduction, where virtually no progress was made as noted above. Borrower performance
i s ratedmoderatelyunsatisfactory because o f lukewarmcommitment, a reactive attitude
to Bank'spresence, and a lack o fvision to addresspoverty reductionby systematic and
coherent policies.

8.       The following lessons emerge from the assessment.

     0   The recordo f fragile political stability inMadagascar pleads for designingpolicy
     development operations ina flexible manner based either on a menu-based approach
     to tranche release, or preferably, on aprogrammatic series o f one-tranche operations
     withprior actions.

     0   GivenMadagascar'srelatively low absorptive capacity, TA operations for
     supporting reforms should be well focused andhave limited objectives initially aimed
     at implementationbottlenecks.

     0   NewinstitutionsinMadagascar need continued assistance from the donor
     community. Establishngnew institutions does not ensure their effective operations.
     Continuedsupport i s required, for example, to strengthenthe different regulatory
     authorities created inthepublic service sectors and competition ingeneral, as well as
     the business framework. Similarly, continuedassistance i s neededto strengthen the
     judiciary, which i s a long-termundertaking.

     0   Consideration shouldbe givento revive the Private Sector Support Fund, which
     proved successhlprior to the 2002 crisis, or to set up a similar scheme to promote
     PSD.

     0   The domestic revenue collectioninMadagascar i s particularly low. Much greater
     attention than inthe past should begivenbythe authorities andbythe Bankto
     revenue mobilization andreallocationof public resources for povertyreduction,
     without whch recent improvements insocial indicators will not be sustained.

 1. Introduction

 1.1    After over twenty years o f dirigisme, Madagascar started inthe mid-1980s to
reduce the role o fthe state andto liberalize its economy. But the reforms were piecemeal
andhesitant untilthe mid-1990s. In1996, anew government presentedan economic
programto the National Assembly consistent with policy advice from the International
MonetaryFund(IMF) and the Bank and based onprivate sector ledgrowth and
integration into the world economy. The Bank supported this shift inpolicy by
deepening the dialogue withthe Government of Madagascar (GOM) on structural
reforms.

 1.2    The four operations reviewedhere find their origin inthis shift. The objective o f
this ProjectPerformance Assessment Report (PPAR) is to assess the extentto whichthey
succeededinassisting the country inits transition to amarket economy open to the
outside world and inreducingpoverty. They were articulated along two axes: a changing
role ofthe public sector from economic agent to public service provider, andpromotion
ofthe private sector as engine o f growth. Implementationo fthe reforms, supported by
the two SACS,was to be facilitatedby two corresponding capacity building operations,
one for the public sector, andthe other for the private sector.

1.3     The report i s structured as follows: Section 2 provides the background and the
strategic context inwhich the four operations were prepared; Section 3 discusses the
PAIGEPas setting the stage for undertakinginitialreforms; Section 4 discusses the
implementationandresults of SAC-I; Section 5 discusses the PATESP as support for the
development o fthe private sector; and Section 6 discusses SAC-I1and its outcome.
Section 7 draws conclusions and lessons.

2.      Backgroundand Context

2.1     Madagascar has a population o f about 18 million, growing at 2.7 percent p.a.,
with three-fourths livinginrural areas. Itis among thepoorest countries, with anincome
percapita ofUS$290. After over two decadesof state dirigisme following independence
in1960, therewere some attempts atliberalizationinthe late 1980sleadingto some
improvement inthe economic situationo fthe country. However, this was interruptedin
1991by demonstrations andstrikes insupport o fpolitical liberalization. After a lengthy
transition to democracy, recovery was blockedbypolitical factionalism andpolicy
differences on economic reform. Political instability andinfightingpersisted to mid-
1996, when Parliament adopted a motion of no-confidence inthe government (GOM),
openingthe way to the appointment o f a non-political Prime Minister andthe return o f
PresidentRatsirakainnationalelections. InJune 1996, the new government presented an
economic programto Parliament consistent with advice fi-om boththe IMFandthe Bank
and, inAugust 1996, Parliamentadopted the necessary legislationfor the implementation
o freforms agreedunder a structural adjustment program. This is the immediatepolitical
backgroundto the four operations reviewedhere.

2.2     The more liberalpolicies adopted by the mid-l990s, the subject o fthe present
PPAR, ledto an average growth rate of 4.6 percent over 1997-2001, outpacingpopulation

                                              2


 growth for the first time indecades. However, Madagascar's political scene continued to
be markedby tensions between different factions andparty rivalries, a feature o f the
country's political life. This erupted inthe openwhenthe December 2001presidential
 elections were contested bythe two main candidates, President Ratsiraka andhis
 contender, Marc Ravalomanana, mayor o fthe capital. It ledto a deep political and
 economic crisis, duringwhich two parallel governments were established, critical
infrastructure was destroyed, key social services were discontinued, and export activities
virtually stopped. The crisis was resolved inJuly 2002, when the international
community recognized the Ravalomanana government. Growth and poverty were
adversely affected bythe crisis with GDP falling by 13 percent in2002. Stabilizationand
reform resumed after a new government was inplace and the economy rebounded in
2003. Madagascar reached the decisionpoint underthe enhanced Heavily IndebtedPoor
Countries (HIPC) initiative inDecember 2000, and the completionpoint in2004.

2.3     Decades o fpoor performance had a dramatic impact onpoverty, which reached73
percent in 1997 (76 percent inrural areas). Extremepoverty (those who cannot affordto
buyabasic foodbasket evenifthey spendtheirtotal incomeonfood items) hadreached63
percent in 1997 (66 percent inrural areas). The relatively strong growth during 1997-2001
failed to reducepoverty significantly, while the 2002 crisis wipedout whatever benefits
hadbeengained. In2002, povertyhadreached81percent nationwide(62 and 86 percent
inurbanandruralareas, respectively). MadagascarissueditsInterimPovertyReduction
Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) inNovember 2000 andits full PRSP inJuly 2003.

THESTRATEGYCONTEXT

2.4     The early attempts at reform duringthe late 1980s andearly 1990s led GOMto
take several liberalizationmeasures in 1994, including floating the exchange rate and
abolishing import prohbitions. The same year, the Bank issued a Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) focusing onpromoting a private sector- and export-led growth, tackling
poverty, improving naturalresource management, buildingcapacity, and improving
project implementation. Underlyingthemes were the redefinitiono fthe role o fthe state,
improvingthe quality o fpublic services, and expandingthe role o fthe private sector in
investment andthe provision o f services.

2.5     The four operations reviewedhere were ingestation duringthis periodandwere
identifiedinthe 1994CAS. At the time, there was anincreasingrecognitionin
Madagascar that increased investmentwas the pre-requisite to growthwhich would help
alleviate poverty. This was seen as urgent andrequireda redefinition o fthe role o fthe
state. Preparation o f an adjustment program started inthis context butprogressedvery
slowly, over three years, 1994-96, andmoving inparallelwith the ups and downs inthe
political situation. Itwas not untilthe new leadership inplace inmid-1996 was willing to
undertake reforms, that a coherent program could take shape. The Bank seized this
opportunity to deepen its dialogue andstructure its interventionby launchinganew CAS,
(January 1997), a structuraladjustment program(SAC-I), andtwo technical assistance
(TA)projects to helpimplement the latter. The CAS concludedthat poverty couldonly
bereducedthrough growth andthat only the private sector could deliver such a growth.
Its major themes were aligned on GOM's priorities: broad-based growth ledby foreign

                                                            3


investment; humancapital development; strengtheningo f the public sector's ability to
deliver quality services and create an enabling business environment; andnatural
resource management to reduce degradation and develop eco-tourism.

2.6         SAC-Iwas the vehicle to initiate reforms centered on opening the economy to
international competition andintegrationinto the world economy. The PAIGEP,an
extension o fthe capacity buildingefforts undertakenunder the FY89Economic
Management and Social Action Project (EMSAP),3was to assist the public administration
inimplementingthe reformprogramwhilethe PATESPwas to assistinmoving
decisively on reforming the Public Enterprise (PE) sector andpromotingprivate sector
development (PSD). SAC-I1was to deepenandbroaden reforms, with aparticular
emphasis on PSD. BothTA operations were meant to mitigatethe implementation
capacity risks associatedwith the reforms. The implementationperiod o fthe four
operations ranfrom 1997 through 2002.

3.          The PublicManagementCapacityBuildingProject
            (PAIGEP)

BACKGROUND

3.1         The project was a follow-up to the Economic Management and SocialAction
Project (EMSAP)mentionedearlier whch hadidentifiedweaknesses ineconomic
management andpublic finance (budget formulation, expenditure programming, PE
reform) and ingovernance (census andmanagement o fpublic sector employees).
Implementationhad also revealed inadequate data andtools for policy formulation and a
lack o fcapacity to provide adequate public services. Thus, the project was to support
GOMinimplementingthe reformprogrambybuildingits capacity inpolicy-making, in
public resource management, andingovernance.

OBJECTIVESAND DESIGN

3.2        The objectives were to assist in(i)          improving economic management and
(ii) addressing governance issues, specifically: (a) a more effective effort to identify,
define, implement andmonitor economic policies; (b) raisingthe capacity and efficiency
o f the civil service ina context o f a redefined role o fthe state and an on-going
decentralization process; and (c) making effective the "rule o flaw" andimproving the
security o fbusiness transactions throughthe independence and increased effectiveness o f
thejudiciary. Support consisted o f TA, training andequipment. There were seven
components, four corresponding to the first objective, andthree to the second one:

RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

3.3    The objectives were relevant andconsistent with the Bank strategy, inthat they
addressedthe mainweaknesses inpublic sector management and aimed at assisting
GOM's inimplementingthe adjustment program. However, ownership at the
administrative andtechnical levels was marredfiom the beginningas a result o f the

                                               5


 fragmented structure o f the central ministries. Although this had beenidentifiedby the
Bankduringpreparation as a sourceofpotential conflicts and as an obstacle to effective
implementation, politicalpressure preventedany streamlining of those ministriesprior to
project approval. The negative impact ofthis situation was underestimated at entry and
 assistanceto policy-making was often undermined by this state o f affairs duringthe
whole period covered bythe adjustment program. The matter was only solvedby a
ministerialreorganization after the 2002 crisis. Inaddition, the design o fthe operation
was too complex with too many different types o f activities dispersedover several central
andtechnical ministries, despite the fact that the administration was knownto beweak
 andlackingincoordinationcapacity.

IMPLEMENTATIONANDACHIEVEMENTS

3.4      Implementationsuffered from overambitious goals, complexity indesign, and
lukewarmcommitment to reforms. Equally important, it took place ina fluidpolitical
situation, frequent changes inappointments, restructurings o fthe centralministries, and
uncertainties raised by a revisiono fthe ConstitutioninJuly 1998. The project didnot
succeedinadapting to such important andrapid changes. Without strong leadership from
GOM, repeated adjustments hadto bemade inproject activities to match strategic
realignments bythe authorities. At the same time, the projectmanagement found it
difficult to coordinate various sub-components.

3.5      InJuly 1998,QAGratedarapidquality ofsupervisionassessmentas "marginal".
Itnotedthat: (i) Bank team was fblfilling amanagement rather than a supervision
                 the
role; (ii)structural reforms were severely lagging; (iii) political change and staff
                                                        constant
turnover were requiringcontinued remedial education o f officials on the project andits
objectives; and (iv) the project hadnot taken root. Itrecommended that, at the mid-term
review, the project bemorenarrowly focused onkeypriorities o finterest to GOMand
consistentwith structural reforms, with new indicators agreed. Itconcludedthat the
focus on development impact was marginal, that design, readiness for implementation,
andborrower commitment were questionable, and that the project was too complex.

3.6      InOctober 1998,the mid-termreviewrecommendedasubstantial restructuringto
facilitate implementation, without modifying objectives. The restructuringwas decided
onthe basis o f the following: (i) QAG assessment; (ii) revisiono fthe
                                   the                      the
Constitution; and(iii)  changes inthe organization o fkeyministries in 1998. Inaddition,
it was largely inspiredby the need to refocus support to the implementation o f SAC-II,
which was under preparation.

3.7      Therestructuring, effectiveonMay 1,1999,consisted o fclosing some
components and streamliningothers as follows: (i) Statistical Office component was
                                                     the
closedbecause2 sub-components (national accounts andbusiness cycles) hadbeen
completed satisfactorily; the third one (household-welfare surveys) was transferred to the
MFBcomponent; (ii) State Secretariat for EconomyandPlanningcomponent was
                       the
closed (except for the study fundtransferred to the TSA), because o fits weaker role after
the 1998ministerialrestructuring; (iii) Civil Service reform component was to be
                                        the
closedby end 1999 (after a national seminar) for lack o fpolitical support; (iv) the

                                                       6


Decentralizationreform component was closed (except for ongoing activities inthe pilot
urbancenters), because o f a change inGOM's strategy on decentralization; and (v) under
the MFB component, support to the Treasury was reoriented to its computerization
instead o f its reorganization.

3.8       InJuly 1999,the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) didanewrapidquality of
supervision assessment. Although it commended the Bankteam for bringingthe project
back on track andrefocusing it, it noted that intensive supervision was required, efforts
neededto bemaintained, andkey outcome objectives were to beidentifiedandtracked.
Itmaintained its negativerating for designandreadinessfor implementationat approval,
butrevisedits ratingofGOM's commitment onthe basis ofits adoptionofthe program
supported by SAC-I1 (approved inMay 1999).

Achievements underEconomicManagement

3.9       Technical Secretariat for Adjustment (TSA). Assistance contributedto the
formulation o fthe 1996-99 PolicyFramework Paper (PFP) andthe IMFprogramandwas
the main support for the finalizationo f SAC-I. The TSA carried out surveys and studies
inseveral areas(visas, tourism, fishinglicenses, andlandtenure, judicial reform, and
social security), some of which were eventually included into SAC-11. It also produced a
monthlymacro-economic indicator note andplayed an important role inorganizingand
conducting the public information campaignon the adjustment program. Starting in
2000, its capacity became over-stretched due to increased involvement inthe preparation
o fthe I-PRSP andthe HIPC initiative, which prevented it fiom monitoring sectoral
reforrns and supporting the development o f sectoral strategies. Similarly, it limitedits
ability to coordinate its activities with those o fthe Statistical Office andthe Forecasting
UnitatMFB.

3.10     Statistical Ofice. Activities were carried out as planned: (i) nationalaccounts
                                                                                      the
for 1993-95 were revised inaccordance with the 1993 UNmethodology and stored on
CD-ROM.4Sevennational account experts were trained, but five have left the Office
since then; (ii)   household surveys were carried out in 1997 and 1999 on the basis o f an
analysis o fthe 1993 survey to assess the evolution o fpovertybetween these dates. This
provedusehl inthe preparation o fthe I-PRSP, especially in the regionalworkshops. At
restructuring, the responsibilityfor poverty monitoringwas transferred to (Ministry o f
Finance andBudget (MFB); and (iii)            six business cycle surveys were produced. Despite
the satisfactory completion o fthe tasks planned, the capacity o fthe Office i s still limited.

3.11     StateSecretariatfor Economy and Planning.' The formulation o f sectoral
policies and correspondingPublic InvestmentPrograms (PIPS) andPublic Enterprise
Programs (PEPS)was not undertaken following the 1998ministerialrestructuringwhich


 The StatisticalOfficedecidedto adopt anewbaseyear, 1995, for its NationalAccounts, but, as of 2002, the
conversionhadnot beendone.
 In1996,two ministries wereresponsiblefor budgetpreparation,executionandmonitoring:MFBwas responsiblefor
preparingthe currentbudgetandfor all budget execution, andthe Secretariat for preparingthe investmentbudget and
for overallmonitoringo f GOM'sprograms. In 1998, MFB itselfwas divided, and in2002, the ministries o fFinance, -
Budget, and Economywere mergedinto a singleministry.

 reduced considerably the role of the Secretariat. As a result, there was no solidbasis for
 a reallocationo f resources, and the 2000 performance targetswith respect to reducing
 public expenditures, andmaintainingthe levels of the PIP and o f social spendingwere
 not met. The component was dropped at restructuring.

 3.12     Ministry of Finance and Budget. The budgetandtreasury nomenclatures were
 unifiedwhile budget execution was improved bymakingappropriations available early to
 line ministries, by giving spending authority for healthand education to deconcentrated
 offices-Health       and SchoolDistricts-of the ministries,6 andby simplifyingseveral
 controls. An integrated computerized public finance management system was established
 as apilot operation inToamasina, the country's mainport, andwas to be installedat the
 nationallevel. Payrollmanagement was improvedbythe computerization o f aunified
 databasebetweenthe Ministry of Civil Service andMFB. The Permanent Secretariat for
 Macro-economic Forecasting was strengthened andperformed satisfactorily; producing
 goodquality macro-economic frameworks used for thebudget, the IMFprograms, the
 PRSP, andthe formulation o fthe HIPC triggers. It also issuedan annual reviewofthe
 macro-economic situation. After the 2002 crisis, it was integrated into the Economic
 Directorate o fMFB.

 3.13     An organizational audit o fthe Treasury was completed byconsultants in 1998,
butGOMconsidered that it was ofpoor quality andnotrespondingto its needs. Its
 recommendations were not implemented. The remainingfunds were redirected to the
 computerization o f operations. Completedin2000, it allows for timely informationon the
 execution o fthe budget. Withregard to external oversight o fpublic accounts bythe
 Office ofthe Auditor General (OAG), considerable progresswas achieved. As of
 October 2005, final audited accounts for 1993-98 hadbeen approvedbythe National
Assembly andthose for 1999-2001 were withthe Assembly for adoption. At the same
date, OAGhad sent its comments onthe 2002 accountsto MFB andwas auditingthe
2003 accounts.

Achievementsunder Governance

3.14      Civil SewiceReform. A substantial amount o fwork, workshops, audits, and
studies, ledto the preparation ofanew draft statutethat was approved bythe National
Assembly butrejectedbythe Senate for lack o fpolitical commitment and coordination
w i t hthe administration. Institutionalauditswere carriedout for six ministriesleadingto
reforminsome o fthem: the disengagement from productionactivities inPublicWorks and
Transport; the reduction ofnon-permanent staffinAgriculture; delegation o f decisions to
field managers at the district levelinEducation; andsome lesserrestructuring inJustice
andHealth. Overall, results weremixedbecauseo funclear strategiesindecentralization
anddeconcentration. The component was closedinlate 1999.


  The transfer ofspendingauthority to deconcentratedoffices was successfulin increasingthe amount oflocal control
over spendingandmost districts function more or less. However, the districts focusedprimarily on infktructure,
mostlyrehabilitation offacilities or new buildings. Sincefacilities were inadequate inany case, this was not wasted
investment, butother constraintssuch as inadequatestaffhg, lack of staff training, poor teacher attendance, and
inadequateteachinghealth supplies, were not addressed. Another problemis that the districts remain dependent on the
centralgovernmentbudgetallocations.

                                                          8


3.15    Decentralization. Assistance was intemptedfollowing a change inGOM's
decentralization strategy, following the 1998 revision o f the Constitution creating new
administrative level^.^ Many o f the revisions, particularlythe transfer o f competence,
budgetary assignments, and the structure o f inter-governmental fiscal relations, remained
undefined and the nature o f inter-relations between levels uncertain. As a result, the
project was no longer inapositionto influence core policy decisions or provide
assistance and guidance inthe absence o f clear direction. However, the pilot programs to
improve localmanagement, establish guidelines on accounting standards, and raise
revenue mobilizationwere successfully implemented in 12communes and some positive
experiments have since been extended to a large number communes. The component was
closed at restructuring.

3.16    Judicial Reform. There was progress on several fronts: (i)                   aNational School for
Magistrates andClerks was established, which still runs today with funding from the
nationalbudget anddonors. Itnow has a section for Magistrates specializing infinance
andadministration; (ii) business legislation(commercial code, companies' law,
                              the
guarantees and securities, etc.) was revised; (iii)          several basic laws and other legal
publications were reprintedand distributed to all magistrates and other legal personnel,
CD-ROMswere widely disseminated, andseveral securedlibraries established; (iv) in
2001,anArbitration Center was opened; and(v) the provisiono fmaterials, supplies and
IT equipment permittedto reduce the backlogof cases inthe capital andinthree
provinces.

MONITORINGEVALUATION OTHERISSUES
                  AND                      AND

3.17    Theproject includeda list o findicators to measureprogress under each
component, statedinterms o f activities, outputs, milestones, and dates. The indicators
were adequate andcorresponded to the right data to be collected, given the objectives o f
the project. However, M&Eimplementationwas mixed: for components not dropped
after the restructuring, some outputs were produced on time, others with delay, and still
others were not produced. For the components terminated at restructuring, many
activities were not completed. There i s insufficient information to asses -andthe ICR
does not discuss - the extent to which data collectedor outputs produced informed
directly decision-makmg processes andresource allocation. There were no issues with
respect to compliance with safeguards and fiduciary requirements.

OUTCOME

3.18    Unsatisfactory. As mentioned above, there are few indicators providing
quantitative results, partlybecauseo fthe disruption causedby the restructuringandthe
numerous administrative and institutional changes. Overall, achievements were mixed
andfragmentary dueto insufficient commitment, frequent conflicts andchangesinthe
administration, andpoor coordination. Economic management was not strengthened as


 The 1998 ConstitutioncreatedRegions, as distinct fromprovinces and communes, but, as late as the end o f2003, they
hadnot been established. The new Constitution also createdDistrictsas deconcentrated unitso fthe central government
andthe most important interfacefor public service delivery.

                                               9


 expected: results were poor inthe management o fpublic resources and their reallocation
 to the social sectors; sectoral strategieswere not redefined and public expenditures and
 the budgetnot readjusted accordingly, a major shortcoming inthe years leading to the
 preparation of a PRSP.Leadership andcommitment were missing to make strides in
 governance, and the efficiencyof state institutions indeliveringpublic serviceswas not
 improved, except for someprogress under thejudicial component. Most opportunities
 for reformwere missed.

 INSTITUTIONAL     DEVELOPMENT

 3.19    Modest. Impact on the different ministriesand entities involved was limited.
 Some progress was made inthe formulation of the macro-economic framework, the
 management o fthe budget cycle, the oversight o fpublic accounts, and thejudicial
 system, butthere was no improvement inrevenuemobilization(see Table 1in Section 4).
Also, there was no progress inraising GOM's capacity to manage andredirect resources
 inlinewithaprogramof povertyreduction. Infact, there was no attempt to formulate
 such a program and redesigninstitutional frameworks accordingly. A broad vision was
missing inthat respect. Finally, keyreforms were abandoned inthe areas most likelyto
raise the efficiency o fpublic expenditure and quality inthe delivery o fpublic services,
i.e., civil service and decentralization.

 SUSTAIN  ABILITY

3.20    Likely. The ratingi sjustified onthe basis o f increased capacity inmacro-
economic management, budget cycle, treasury operations, andthejudiciary. Also, there
was no reversal inpolicies, evenin2002. The consolidationo fpolicy-making andits
monitoringunder a single ministryafter the crisis should facilitate the sustainability o f
whatever was achieved underthe project.

BANKPERFORMANCE

3.21    Moderately Unsatisfactory. Quality at entry was unsatisfactory, despite the
amount o fwork that went into project preparation. The Bankoverestimated GOM's
commitment andpaid insufficient attention to the possible consequences o f a fragile
institutionalset-up. The projectwas also overburdened bytoo manyandtoo different
components. Risks were well identifiedbut insufficient care was takento define and
prepare mitigating measures. Infact, this task turned out to be done by QAG in
advocating safeguards against the risk o f even greater difficulties inimplementation.
Although the Bankteam heededQAG's recommendations and acted swiftly by
streamliningthe project, supervision continued to suffer fkom poor design at entry.
However, task management inthe field, permitteda constant dialogue with officials, thus
minimizingthe risk for negative developments.

BORROWER      PERFORMANCE

3.22    Unsatisfactoq. GOM's commitment was weak, showing no resolve intackling
the institutional problems besettingimplementation. GOMwas essentially passive, letting
the Bankteam assumedecisions and tasks falling normally under its responsibility. Q A G

                                              10


had characterized the Bank team as "fulfilling a management rather than a supervision
role". With the arrival o f SAC-11, GOMbecame more pro-active, notably inmacro-
economic management to meet the requirement ofmaintaining a sound framework. This
helped reinforce to a certain extent the structures directly involved inthis area, such as
the TSA andMFB. However, GOM showed no leadership inpromotingthe program
areas concernedwith governance, reallocation o fresources, andpoverty alleviation.

4.      The FirstStructuralAdjustment Credit (SAC-I)

BACKGROUND

4.1     Given GOM's poor recordintacklingreforms, the Bankwas very cautious in
preparing the project. Active preparation didnot start untilthe following actions hadbeen
taken: flotation o fthe currency in 1994; elimination o f subsidies on flour andrice;
appointment o findependent administrators to the two state-owned commercialbanks;
loweringo fthe maximumtariff from 50 to 30 percent; reorientation ofbudget allocations
to primaryeducation, basic health services and social fund communityprojects; creation
(September 1995)o f ajoint public/private sector group, the Committee for Reflection on
Competitiveness (CRC), to develop recommendations to mobilizeprivate investment;
andappointment o fthe Independent PrivatizationCommission (CIP) (established in
January 1995)to draft a new privatization law (enacted inAugust 1996). Preparation
also moved as agreed actions were taken, with all conditions to be met prior to Board
presentation. Appraisal took place after Parliamentinmid-1996 hadvoted a motion o fno
confidence followed bythe appointment o f a non-politicalprimeminister.

OBJECTlVESAND DESIGN

4.2     The objective was to break Madagascar out o f a povertytrap byhelpingrestore
investor confidence, specifically by: (i) underpinning a fimdamental relaxation o f controls
andrestrictions facinginvestors andtourists; and(ii) the stage for aresolutiono fthe
                                                      setting
external payment problems o fMadagascar (debt rescheduling at the ParisClub and
mobilizingexceptional donor support). Actions prior to Boardpresentation fell under the
following headings: (i) Macro-economic management: fiscal management; monetary and
financial policies; exchangerate policy; and external trade; (ii)Incentivesfor private
investment in exports and labor-intensive activities: divestiture o fPES; fiamework for
private sector incentives; tax incentives; banking;petroleum; telecommunications; vanilla;
andairtransport; and(iii)  Refocusing public expenditures: restructuring o f expenditures
towards the social sectors. The Credit consistedo fa single tranche, disbursedupon
effectiveness. GOMs progamwas detailed in a Letter o fDevelopment Policy (LDP).
h e x B lists actions prior to preparation andprior to Boardpresentation.

RELEVANCEOFOBJECTIVESAND DESIGN

4.3     The objective was relevant and fully consistent with the 1997Bankstrategy in
tacklingthe mainobstacles to growth andto PSD. An implied objective was to provide
credibility to the reform programvis-&vis domestic and foreign investors, creditors, and

                                                           11


 donors and to persuade themto extend financial assistance.' By stating that the objective
 was to break Madagascar out o f a povertytrap shouldbe interpreted as only initiating a
 movement inthat direction as it would be unrealistic to expect a three-year reform
 programto impact poverty significantly. SAC-I, prepared inparallelwith the PAIGEP
 and the PATESP, suffered from the same shortcomings as those mentioned above for the
 PAIGEP,i.e., unevencommitment and fragmented structure ofthe central ministries.
 The design of the operation -a singletranche - was well advised inthe circumstances.
 However, for the same reason, given the fragile political situation and the stop-and-go
 reforms of the past, there was a highrisk o f much reduced commitment once the tranche
 would be disbursed. This is infact what happened, delaying completiono fthe reforms
 listedinthe LDP by over one year.

 IMPLEMENTATIONAND ACHIEVEMENTS

 4.4       Implementationwas negativelyaffected bycontinuedpoliticalinstability and,
 after disbursement, by reduced commitment to reforms. Inaddition, the complexity o f
 some components ledto unexpected difficulties inexecution, particularly inthe
 privatizationo fPES, which posed enormous challenges. Also, institutional weaknesses
'persistedwith efforts under the PAIGEP insufficient to overcome them. By the end o f
 1997,at closing, Bank expectations h.adnot been fulfilled and there was a fairly large
 unfinishedagenda,' most importantlythe privatization o fthe two state-owned barks
 (BTMandBFV) and o fthe oil company, SOLIMA. This PPARassessesimplementation
 andachievements onthe basis ofactions taken prior to Boardpresentation andprogress
 made over 1997-98, i.e., untilpreparation o f SAC-II started inearnest inNovember 1998.

 AchievementsunderEconomicManagement.

 4.5       Macro-economic stability was maintainedand GDP growthreached 3.7 and 3.9
 percent in 1997 and 1998,against targets o f 3.0 and 3.5 percent. Growthperformance
 was mainlydue to an increase in investment, from 10.9 percent o f GDP in 1995 to 14.8
 percent in 1998. Butthere was no progress inrevenue mobilizationwith tax revenues
 stagnating at 9-10percent of GDP, a very low level by Sub-SaharaAfkica standards. The
 overall fiscal deficit deteriorated further due to a lower than expected reduction in
 expenditures. Overall, performance was good instabilizing the economy, mainlydue to
 the monetary and financial policies pursued(Table 4.1).



 * Atappraisal in 1996,debt servicing absorbed45 percent o f exports o fgoods and services starving the country of
 foreign exchange. Inthe best scenario calculated at the time, debt rescheduling and exceptionaldonor fmancing were
expectedto cover only halfo fthe gross financing requirementsto reach and sustainareasonablerate o fgrowth, the

4.6      Inflation and credit to GOMwere kept under control thanks to the Central Bank's
tight monetary stance following measures adoptedin 1994 (increases ininterest rates;
increased reserve requirements; and limitsto credit to the Treasury). Inflation fell from
49 percent in 1995 to 6.2 percent in 1998, almost on target. The tight monetarypolicy
was also dictated by the needto absorb excess liquidity causedby the indiscriminate
lending o fthe two state-owned banks, which hadresultedinlarge monetary expansion in
1994 and 1995. The exchangerate remained determinedbymarket forces since its
flotation inMay 1994. A harmonizedtariff with three rates (a top rate o f 20-25 percent
and an average rate of 15 percent) was to be introduced by 1998, but, by the endo fthe
year, only equipment, primaryimports andbasic consumption itemsbenefited from a 5-
15-25 percent rate structure, with a weighted average rate still above 15 percent.

AchievementsunderIncentivesfor PrivateInvestmentinExportsandLabor-
IntensiveActivities

4.7      Frameworkfor Private Sector Incentives and TaxIncentives. Conditions prior to
Board presentationrelating to entry and exit visas, work permits, and other restrictions on
foreigninvestment were sustained, while legalmonopoliesinpower, petroleum, telecom,
andair transport were lifted.The fiscal incentives formerly providedbythe investment
code and incorporated into the tax code prior to Board approval were maintained. In
addition, taxation o f imports designated for theproductiono f exports was reduced; a
special service was created to monitor the largetaxpayers; the Value Added Tax (VAT)
was extended to all activities above a threshold with a zero rate limited to exports; and
most exemptions to the VAT were eliminated.

4.8      Divestiture of Public Enterprises. The 1996Privatization Law definedthe
privatizationprogram andestablished a legal andinstitutionalframework consisting o f (i)
a PrivatizationCommittee (PC) composed o frepresentativesfrom the private andpublic
sectors and assistedby a Technical Secretariatresponsible for coordinating the preparation
andexecution o fprivatizationtransactions; (ii) aPrivatizationTrust Fundresponsible for
establishing a share warehousing scheme to holdminority shares inprivatizedPESpending
their sale to employees of the privatizedPESandthe public at large; and (iii)Social and
                                                                              a
RegionalDevelopment SupportFundresponsible for ensuringthat benefits o fthe
privatizationprogramwould accrueto the less privilegedinsociety. Inapplicationo fthe
newlaw, a decree, issuedinMay 1997, listed45 PES(to which was addedthepublic
telephone company, TELMA, inearly 1999) slated for privatization. A concomitant law

relatingto the settlement of disputes arising out o fprivatizationestablishedanArbitration
Commission. None o fthese entities, however, was operational at project inception.

4.9        Progress was very slow because o fpolitical infighting and strong resistance. By
the end o f 1998, only ahandful o f small PEShadbeensold or liquidated and the bulk o f
the privatization agenda was infact pushedto SAC-11. Specific Board conditions applied
to some o f the largePES,but, here also, progress was slow. The sale o fBank for rural
Development (BTM) andNational Bankof Commerce (BFV), expected by the end 1997,
was delayed due to political interference. BFV was sold only inDecember 1998, and a
sale protocol for B T M signed only inApril 1999. Inpetroleum, although the sector had
been liberalized in 1995, the legal instruments requiredto render the decisions effective
were issuedonly before Boardpresentation. Another Boardconditionwas to allow at
least one other oil company to enter the market and compete with SOLIMA, but the very
existence ofPetroleum Company (SOLIMA) provedto be a deterrent and the condition
was modified to the sale o f a controlling interest under SAC-11. Intelecom, the sector
hadbeen liberalizeddejure prior to Board, but competitionbecame effective only after
four mobile phone operators, selectedon the basis o f competitive bidding, entered the
market in 1998. Inair transport, the market had also been liberalized, but there was no
progress inthe sale ofAir Madagascar. Insum, by end 1998, little progress hadbeen
achieved inprivatizing SOLIMA, Telephone Company (TELMA), andAir Madagascar.
Different transactions were under discussion butwith new conditionality plannedfor
SAC-II."

Achievements under PublicExpendituresRestructuring

4.10       The objectives o frestructuring expenditures infavor o f the social sectors were not
achieved. Between 1989 and 1994, expenditures onprimary and secondary education
were generallybetween 1.6 to 1.8 percent o f Gross Domestic Product (GDP) andon
health about 1percent." Table 2 shows that minimalprogress was achieved inraising
allocations for education (total sector) over 1997-98, while allocations for health
decreased. Actual expenditures were even lower.12 Also, monitoringo f andreporting on
expenditures for the sectorswere expected to be strengthened, but little was achieved,
andinstitutional strengthening inthat areawas incorporated into SAC-11.




lo
 Although there was no SAC conditionality for the vanilla sector, GOM withdrew its support to IVAMA, the trading
parastatal, and, in 1997, the export tax on vanilla was abolished. At end 1998, IVAMA was under liquidation.
l1
 As a condition o fBoardpresentation, the 1996budget allocations for educationand healthwere increasedby 0.1
percent o f GDP. Neither the Government's Medium-TernAdjustment Programfor FY1996-99 nor SAC-I contained
specific targets for further years for expenditures inthe social sectors. GOM's program referred only to "Increase
social spending, inparticular onbasic health care andprimary education".

MONITORINGEVALUATION OTHERISSUES
                 AND                AND
4.11 SAC-I didnot contain any specific monitoring indicators or milestones to assess
progress after disbursement o fthe tranche at effectiveness. Progress was monitoredby
reference to GOM's commitments under its FY96-99 reformprogram. There were no
issues with respect to fiduciary safeguards.

OUTCOME

4.12     Moderately Satisfactoly. Some objectives weremet, others only partially, andstill
others were not. Macro-economic stability was maintained, inflationdeclined
substantially, andprior achievements inexchange rate andtrade policies were sustained.
The businessclimate was somewhat improvedwith better incentives for PSD, but effective
implementationleft muchto be desired. Inthree important areas, progress was very
limited: (i) privatizationo fBTMwas considerably delayed; (ii) the legal
             the                                                    although
monopolies intelecom, petroleum, and air transport were abolished, noprogress was
achievedinprivatizingthe incumbent companies or in attracting competition, except for
mobilephone operators; and(iii)    expenditures were not redirectedto the social sectors.
Despite the numerous shortcomings, the ratingisjustified onthe basis that SAC-Iwas the
first - and important - step to opening the economy to market forces andto the outside
world. Changingthe climate was a valuable outcome, giventhe isolationofthe country
sinceindependence.

INSTITUTIONAL      DEVELOPMENT

4.13    Modest. Institutionalcapacity was somewhat strengthened inthe areas o ftrade
andPSD andthe public andprivate sectors entered into a dialogue on incentives for
investment. However, there was little progress inthe management o fthe public sector,
either inthe PEdivestiture program, where vested interests and oppositionremained
strong, or inthe ability to redirect resources to povertyreduction. There was definitely
less GOM's ownership in those areas with a corresponding lesser interest in
strengthening the responsible ministries and entities.

 SUSTAIN ABILITY

 4.14    LikeZy. There was no reversal inpolicies. Moreover, the initial steps taken under
  SAC-Ipermittedto arrive at a consensus on the content o f SAC-11. From then on, it
 became clear that it would havebeen very difficult for any government to backtrack on
 reforms.

 BANKPERFORMANCE

 4.15    Satisfactory. The key conditions for openingthe economywere well identified
 andprioritized. Inthat sense, quality at entry was satisfactory, but, at preparation, the
 Bank overestimated GOM's commitment, a shortcomingwhich affected also the
 PAIGEPandthe PATESP. The Bankcorrectlymadethe processing ofthe project
 conditional on actual progress, given the country's prior record. It was also right, after
 disbursement, to insist onpursuingthe agendabefore launchingthe appraisal o f SAC-11.
 Thisperiodprovidedthe Bankwith the necessaryinsightinto GOM's priorities and
 constraints andthus helped clarify the content o f SAC-11. However, the Bank didnot
 seize the opportunity to deepenthe dialogue onthe conditions amenable to wideningthe
 tax base, raisingrevenue, andredirectingresources to the social sectors. It became too
 absorbed bythe privatizationo fthe large PES.

BORROWER       PERFORMANCE

 4.16   Moderately Satisfactory. Performance varied according to components and
 degrees o fcommitment and ownership. Disciplinewas demonstrated inmacro-economic
management and incurbing inflation and there was some commitment to liberalizethe
PSD framework. But GOMwas unable to overcome the obstacles to privatizationand to
initiate a program to improvepublic services and start tacklingpoverty reduction.

5.       The PrivateSector Developmentand CapacityBuilding
        Project(PATESP)

BACKGROUND

5.1     The project hadits origin inthe economic and sector work bythe Bank and IFC in
the early 1 9 9 0 ~which hadidentified the obstacles to private sector-led growth and
                      ~ ' ~
highlightedthe needto improvethe general business environment and strengthen the
managerial, technical, and financial capacity o f existing enterprises. Also, in 1994-95,
the private sector hadbecome increasinglyvocal indemandingreforms andprogress in
privatization. With the new leadership inplace inmid-1996, the stage was set to designa
project aimed at supporting the PSD components o fthe reform program. The new
climate had allowed setting clearer objectives for PSD under SAC-I.l4

OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

5.2           The objective was to support accelerated export-led growth, specifically by:
(i)  designingand implementingreforms inmarket deregulation, de-monopolizationand
competition, PE divestiture, andthe tax systemto addressmajor constraints to increased
private investment, efficiency, exports, andjob creation; (ii)                fostering an improved
government-private sector dialogue; and (iii)              strengtheningcapacities and skills o fprivate
firms and associations. The Credit supported two reformprograms:

5.3           TheEconomic Policy Reform Program, consisting of: (i) and             design
implementation o freforms inthe business environment andprivate sector incentives;
(ii) toprivatization,includingtheestablishmentofthePCanditsTechnical
      support
Secretariat, the PrivatizationTrust Fund, the Social andRegionalDevelopment Support
Fund, aRetrainingFundto finance the training andredeployment ofemployees affected
privatization(later institutionalized under the name Programme d'Action Sociale et
Economiquepour laRCinsertion Professionnelle                   - PASERP),I5and          the Arbitration
Commission; and (iii)          tax reform (modernization o fthe VAT and strengthening ofthe
fiscal and customs administrations - component to bemonitoredbythe Fiscal Affairs
Departmento fthe MF).

5.4          ThePrivate Sector CapacityBuilding Program, consisting of: (i)                    establishment o f
a Private Sector Support Fund(PSSF) to provideprivate firms andbusiness associations
access to support services, international data, and market sources; (ii)                   TA andother
support to the CRC; (iii)         establishment o f a Seminars Fundto finance seminars between
GOMandtheprivate sector on competitiveness; and(iv) establishment andoperation o f
a FDImatch-making scheme through the creation o fa Match-makingFund.

RELEVANCEOF OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

5.5          The objective was highly relevant and consistent withBank strategy. Inaddition
to strengthening GOM's capacity to carry out the reforms, the project aimed at raisingthe
capacity o f domestic firms by exposing themto foreign operators andworld markets.
However, it attempted to tackle too many different aspects o fprivatization andPSD, and,
as a result, its designwas overly complex: activities were spreadover several entities,
some functioning, others existing onpaper only, and still others to be created;
conventions were requiredto makesomeproposed funds operational; procedure manuals
andimplementationplanswere to bedrafted, etc. All these provedto be a constraint to a
rapid start o f the project.

IMPLEMENTATION             AND ACHIEVEMENTS

5.6         Effectiveness ofthe Credit was delayed by 9 months, fiom May 1997 to February
1998 (against one month expected at appraisal), to satisfy the several conditions relating

          ~~~~




l5The inclusion of a Retraining Fund, with SDR2.3 million, was decided at negotiations, without a precise institutional
set-up. Itwas institutionalized inOctober 1997 as Programme d'Action Sociale et Economique pour laReinsertion
Professionnelle(PASERF'), effectively establishedinOctober 1998,andbecameoperational only inApril 1999. It was
a follow-up to the Programme de RkinsertionProfessionnelle (PRP) establishedunder EMSAP.

                                                         17


 to the complex institutional set-up mentioned above. Inthis context, pressure from
 vested interests andpolitical interference became additional causes o f delay. Before
 effectiveness, QAG had conducted a quality at entry assessment, rated as marginal. It
hadnotedthe over-complexity of the project, the questionable commitment of the
 authorities, the lack ofreadiness for implementation, the inadequaterisk assessment, and
 the mismatchbetween the capacity o f the entities responsible for implementationandthe
tasks expected fiom them. The assessmenthad concluded byrecommending to reduce
 the numbero f components and to sharpenthe focus o f intervention.

 5.7        Theprojectwas restructured inJuly 1998, without changesinobjectives. Three
 components were dropped, none o fthemhaving started bythen: (i)                        the tax reform on the
 basis o f an improved dialogue inpreparation of SAC-I1(which bythen had an increased
 focus on liberalization andprivatization);16 (ii)           the Match-making Fundonthe basis o f
negligible success and impact;17and (iii) Seminars Fundon the basis o fthe need for a
                                                      the
 sharper focus. The ICRnotes that, inretrospect, quality at entrywas indeedmarginally
 satisfactory. IEGconcurs witht h s assessment. The restructuring ledto a much leaner
project, and, as preparation of SAC-I1progressed, its focus improved and narrowed. It
became the mainvehicle to provide support to PSD andto the privatizationo fthe
incumbent companies intelecom, air transport, andpetroleum. The PATESP agendawas
increasinglydrivenbythe requirements to meet the conditions for tranche release under
 SAC-II.

Achievementsunderthe EconomicPolicyReformProgram

 5.8       Market Liberalization andPrivate SectorIncentives. A FacilitationCenter was
created to facilitate access to informationand simplify businesscreation andregistration
procedures, but remained largelynon-operational. Procedures for obtainingwork
permits andvisas were simplified. Inthe mining, telecom, air transport, andpetroleum
sectors, the primaryand secondary legislationwas completed (competitive licensing
award, technical standards, price adjustment mechanisms) and the capacity ofthe
regulatorybodies was strengthened inlicensingprocedures, compliance with
internationalstandards, andmonitoring.

5.9        Public Enterprise Divestiture. The privatizationprogramwas to beimplemented
inthreephasesover five years (1997-2002), covering 120PES.InphaseI(1997-98), 46
PESwouldbeprivatizedor liquidated.l9 Assistance consisted mainly o f financing
internationalexperts to the PC and its Technical Secretariat to designprivatization
strategies andprepare transactions. From the onset, Bankmissions also played a
significant role inadvising on the structure andsharingo fresponsibilities between the PC
andits Secretariat, sincethesewerethe key actors inthe divestitureprocess. During


l6There had also beena disagreementon the modalities o f a bonus incentive schemelinked to tax collection, which
were a condition o fdisbursementunderthat component.
l7Despite a pilot phaseprior to appraisal which hadbeen characterizedby the Bankteam as a complete success.
  A fully functioning "one stop shop" was established only in2003 underthe successor project, the Private Sector
Development Project-I1(PSDP-11), approved bythe Board inAugust 2001, (Cr. 3567-MAG).
l9Out o fthese, there were 11large companies dominating major sectors, 30 smaller ones slated for divestiture, and 5
slated for liquidation.

                                                     18


 supervision, the Bank advised on procurement procedures, proper sequencing inthe
privatizationprocess, active communication campaigns, and timely preparation and
implementationof social safety net measures. By Credit closing, the divestitureprogram
was not completeddue to resistance from vested interests, the complexity o f some
transactions, and the inordinate amount o ftime and energy spent onthe large PESin
 support o f SAC-IL2' GOMwas supposedto set-up a tracking systemto monitor fiscal
transfers to PESbut it failed to do so. A CountryFinancialAccountability Assessment
conducted in2003 concludedthat few transfers hadbeen abolished and that the Treasury
didnot have the capacityto monitor the financial situationofPES. Underthe scheme to
promote local ownership, a strategy for the distribution o f shares inprivatizedcompanies
 (criteria, mechanisms, etc.) was developed, but the fundwas not operational by Credit
closing.

 5.10     ThePASERP was meant to mitigate the social costs o fthe program. However,
after becoming operational inApril 1999, its mandate was substantially broadened from
 financing severancepayments to becomingthe mainbody responsible for all social
 aspects o fprivatization. Itthus becameoverwhelmed by activities incommensurate with
its capacity and staff, all the more so that it hadbeen assigned responsibility also for the
 Social and RegionalDevelopment Support Fund. This created considerable confusion in
the execution o fthe program. For the three years 1999-2001,only 821employees
benefited from the program out o f2,256 eligible beneficiaries.

Achievementsunder the PrivateSector CapacityBuildingProgram

5.11 Private Sector Support Fund. The Fundwas established successfblly and acted
as intermediary betweenrecipient firms, mostly SMEs andbusiness associations, and
local andinternational suppliers o fbusiness services. Itreceived 1,532 requests, o f
whch 809 were approved for a total amount o fUS$5.9 million, o fwhich 66 percent were
financed by the Fund. According to aNovember 2002 survey, 83 percent o fbeneficiaries
were satisfied ofthe support provided. The Fundalso played an important role in
facilitating accreditationo f I S 0 norms inquality, environment, and accounting, andin
supporting the launching o fthe Afiican Growth OpportunityAct andthe US-Madagascar
Business Council. These latter initiatives led to a substantial increase intrade and
investmentbetweenthe U S andMadagascar. Despite its success, the Fundwas closed
after the 2002 crisis because it was deemedby GOMto have too much autonomy in
managing its budget.

5.12      Government/Private Sector Dialogue. The CRC was very active indebating
issues and inairing them inthe media and it contributedto launchinga consultative
process involving the private sector, civil society andpublidprivatepartnerships.
However, its impact remainedlimitedinterms o finfluencingGOMdecisions inpolicy
making. Itwas dissolved after the crisis andreplacedbyamuchless independententity
composed inpart o fministers.



2o By December2002, strategieswere completedfor 35 companiesandtransactionsfor 17, including 10that were
liquidated.

MONITORINGANDEVALUATION OTHERISSUES  AND

5.13     The project document contained a matrix ofperformance indicatorsper
component, stated interms o f units (e.g., number of firms, values, percentages, etc.) and
sources o fmeasurement by the end of the project (i.e., byPY5). While the nature o fthe
indicators was adequate, the measurement units andthe targets by PY5 impliedinmany
cases the existence of data (from the statistical office, reports, surveys, etc.) unlikely to be
readily available. There i s insufficient information about whether data were actually
collected duringimplementationand, ifso, how they were utilized. The ICR limitsitself
to record achievements under each component. Therewere no issueswith respect to
compliancewith fiduciary safeguards.

OUTCOME

5.14    Moderately Satisfactory. The project contributed indirectly to the growth
performanceo fthe secondhalf o f the 1990sbyhelpingGOMimplement               - with
reasonable success - its PSD and divestiture policies, despite the difficulties encountered.
This positive outcome i s due to the refocused objectives after restructuring, reducing the
risks of dispersion. The fact that the privatizationprogramwas not completed does not
alter fundamentally this assessment, as the priority givento the large PESwas deliberate
to have a demonstmtioneffect o fthe role o fthe private sector, as illustratedbythe surge
inFDIover 1999-01(Table 1inSection4). Itremainshowever that averylargeportion
o f the privatizationprogramwas postponed (as o f end 2005, it was still not completed).
The activities directed at SMEs also contributed to reaching the objective. Unfortunately,
this component was not carried over under the successorproject (Private Sector
Development Project-I1(PSDP-It), approved by the Board inAugust 2001), following
the decision o f the post-crisis government to discontinue the scheme. Insum, the
PATESP ledto muchprogress considering the situation from which the reformprocess
started, and, without it andthe advisory role o fthe Bank,results under the program
would havebeenvery different. However, as early as 2000-01, it was clear that a
successorproject would beneededto complete the agenda. This provedto be a sound
decision, as the PSDP-11, effective since November 2002, became the mainvehicle to
consolidate the still fi-agile achievements o fthe PATESP.

INSTITUTIONAL     DEVELOPMENT

5.15    Substantial. Theproject succeededinstrengtheningsome institutions, not least
bymakingthem operational to cany out theirmandate. Themainbeneficiaries were the
Technical Secretariat o fthe PC andthe regulatory authorities. However, after closing,
these were still weak andinneedo ffurther support to buildtheir staff and expertise -a
serious challenge giventhe complexity o fthe tasks involved. Thus, continued support
was providedunder PSDP-II. Onthe other hand, the project hadno impact on the two
funds aimed at disseminating ownership inprivatizedPESanditis questionable whether
theywere apriority inthe circumstances. Similarly, there was littleimpact onthe
PASERPdue to its changein mandatethat blurredits original objective. Incontrast, a
serious loss was causedby the decisionto dismantle the Private Sector Support Fund.

 SUSTAINABILITY

 5.16     Likely. There was no major reversal inpolicies that mighthave affected
 negativelythe support providedby the project, even duringthe 2002 crisis. Most ofthe
 benefits were sustained eventhough further strengtheningunder PSDP-I1was needed.
 The extent to w h c h thebenefits gained under the PASERP are sustainable is not known
 (it was also extended underPSDP-11). Butthe benefits associated to the activities under
 the CRC andPrivate Sector Support Fundcomponents are unlikely to be sustained since
 their activities were discontinued. Overall, the benefits generated were resilient to the
 effects o f the crisis andmitigatedits adverse impact on economic performance.

 BANKPERFORMANCE

 5.17     Satisfactory. Although quality at entrywith respect to design was unsatisfactory,
 the analytical work carried out bythe Bank duringpreparationwas a solidbasis for
 defining the content ofreforms. Bankperformance during supervisionwas satisfactory,
with consistency insupport and staffing. O fparticular importance, the Bankreacted
positively to Q A G assessmentby narrowing the scope ofthe project while preserving its
keyobjective. The alignment ofassistancewith the SAC-11agendawas also well advised,
 since this was the cornerstone of the adjustment program. Finally, the decisionto launch
 a successorproject was timely.

BORROWERPERFORMANCE

5.18      Unsatisfactory. GOM's commitment to reforms was lukewarm well into project
implementation. Resistance from vested interests and fi-ompolitical quarters responsible
for key sectors, as well as poor coordination andpoor governance within the
administration, interferedwith anddelayed the implementationo f the privatization
program.'l Inaddition, GOM showed no coherent vision for the role o f PASEW and
underestimated the potentialrole o fthe Private Sector Capacity Buildingcomponent as
an indispensable complement to public policies. It erred indissolving the successful
Private Sector Support Fundandinunderminingthe independence o f the CRC, two
structures that could have strengthenedPSD further. These shortcomings showed the
continued skepticism o f GOMvis-a-vis the role o fthe private sector.

 6.           The Second StructuralAdjustment Credit (SAC-11)

 BACKGROUND

 6.1          The President's Report o f SAC-I1stressed the continuedvalidity ofthe 1997 CAS
 andnotedthat progress under SAC-I hadbeenslower thanexpected, particularlybecause
 o f inadequate ownership o f specific reforms, such as inprivatization. In addition, it
 argued that, with a single tranche under SAC-I, the Bank hadnot hadthe leverage to push
 the reform agenda forward. Eighteenmonths hadbeen spent incompleting the SAC-I
 agenda after its disbursement. Onlythen didthe Bank feel that preparation o f a second
 operation could be launched. This had created a dilemma, however, because, inthe
 absenceo f Bank involvement and sustainedreforms, donors hadbeenreluctant to
provide budget support. Indeed, a major concern o f the Bank since early 1998 hadbeen
to press for the adoption o fhighlyvisible measuresas ajustification to start actively
preparinga second operation, andthus senda strong signalto the donor community to
 extendbudget support in 1998.

 OBJECTIVESAND DESIGN

6.2           The objective was to achieve higher growthandreducepoverty by: (i)
consolidation o fmacro-economic stability; (ii)             privatization and introductionof
competitiveregulatoryframeworks; (iii)               improvement inthe business environment by
targeting promising sectors andpromoting transparency inlicensing for the exploitation
o fnaturalresources; and(iv) strengthening o fpublic finance by expanding the tax base,
increasingnon-tax revenues, and ensuring that resources allocatedto the social sectors
were effectivelyusedfor the poor. The designreflectedthe lessons from SAC-I. The
issue of leverage was addressedby adopting a multi-tranche "menu-based" approach
recognizingthat implementationevolvedover time andthat flexibility was needed. The
Credit hadthree tranches, with amounts increasing insteps. Excluding the general
conditiono fmaintenance of macro-economic stability and including those prior to Board
presentation, there were four sets o f conditions (see Annex C).

0         First, conditions prior to Boardpresentationcoveredthe completionofSAC-I
          measuresand some additional ones: (i)        reforms inthe telecom, mining, fisheries, and
          exemptionregime; (ii)    adoption o f an Arbitration Law; (iii)      reconciliation o fthe
          budget andtreasury classifications; and (iv) signingof a sale protocol for BTM.


0         Second, effectiveness o fthe Credit and disbursement of the first tranche were subject
          to conditions ensuringprogress before disbursement and a greater chance o f success
          inimplementation, especiallyoftheprivatizationprogram. Theyincluded: (i)
          submission o f a detailed actionplan for the implementationo fthe PASERP;" (ii)
          establishment andregistrationofjoint ventures relatingto the sale o f SOLIMA's oil
          operations andconclusiono fcontractual arrangementsrelatingto the transfer of

      ~~~~




22Eventhough this provision was specified inthe Development Credit Agreement (DCA) as condition of
effectiveness, it applied to the release of each tranche, as a Supplemental Letter stated that it was to be read
as part of the general condition o f "satisfactory progress inthe canylng out o fthe program".

                                                       22


   ownership o f its non-oil operations; and (iii)          establishment o f a legal andregulatory
   framework, including the regulatory body, for the petroleum sector.

e  Third and fourth, each o fthe secondandthird "menu-based" tranches would
   comprise a core measure and additional measures inPSD andor inpublic finance
   reform. Each core measure would involve the sale o f either TELMA or Air
   Madagascar (including the establishment of a fully operational regulatory framework
   andbody). The additional measureswere to be selected from atotal o ffour PSD
   areas and four public finance areas:23

PSR areas:

   Measure I:Mining: enactment o f arevised MiningCode, includingimplementation
   decrees; and actionplanto expedite the processing o fminingpermit applications;
   Measure 2: Land tenure: facilitation o f access to land; andinvitationto investors to
   submit bids for five tourism andfive industrialzones;
   Measure 3: Business environmentandjudicialprocesses: (a) actionplanto improve
   caseload management and substantive progress inthe same; and (b) actionplanfor
   the purpose o f streamlining formalities/procedures requiredto carry out economic
   activities, and substantive progress inthe same; and
   Measure 4: Sector liberalization and additional sector reforms: (a) grantingat least
   two airport concessions to qualified and experienced private operators; (b) invitation
   to telecom operators to bidfor anationallicense; and (c) enactment of a law and
   issuance o f decrees governing the fiscal regime o f largeminingprojects.

PublicJinance areas:

e  Measure 5: Revenuepolicies and monitoring: establishment of aunitwithinthe
   MinistryofBudgetto monitor public revenues andto review medium andlong-term
   tax policy andtax administrationreforms;
e  Measure 6: Expenditure monitoring in social sectors: (a) establishment o f a
   monitoring system to capture the implementationo f social policies and expenditures
   actually incurred for primary education andbasic health; and (b) canying out o f a
   survey to assess performance inthe deliveryo fprimaryeducation and basic health
   services;
e  Measure 7: Fishing licenses:(a) establishment o f a system to allocate shrimp fishing
   licenses ina non-discretionary, competitive andtransparent manner; (b) annual
   adjustment o fshrimp fishing fees inaccordance with the new allocation system; and
   (c) carrying out the recommendations o fthe audits o fthe Fonds de DCveloppement
   Halieutique et Aquicole (FDHA); and
e Measure 8: Financial sector reforms: (a) carryingout the financial, organizational
   andactuarial audits for two insurance companies andthree social security funds; and
   (b) adoptionofactionplansto improvetheir performance.



 The exact language o fthe additional measuresi s inAnnex C.

                                               23


6.3      Thus, the second tranche would bereleasedafter one core measure and at least
four out o f eight additionalmeasureswere completed, the choice beingleft to GOM. In
addition, it was subject to either completing the sale o fBTMas per the April 1999
protocol or, incase o f unsuccessful negotiations, proceeding with divestiture.The third
tranche would be released after the remainingcore and additionalmeasureswere
completed.

6.4      The Bank'sRegionalOperation Committee agreedto raise the amount o fthe
Credit from US$75 to US$lOO million to cover the social cost o fthe privatization
program. However, there was no provision, either inthe DCA or inGOM's legislation,
specifying such an allocationto the PASERP andno such allocationwere made. The
two-year reforrnprogram, detailed ina LDP, was to be completed by December 31,2001.

RELEVANCEOF OBJECTIVESAND DESIGN

6.5      The objective was highlyrelevant and consistent with Bank strategy, with
emphasis rightlyplacedon: (i)     completingthe privatizationo fthe largePES(indeed, in
hindsight, this provedto bethe centerpiece o f SAC-II); (ii)  promoting the liberalization
of sectors with a good potentialfor growth; and (iii)   strengthening the management o f
public resources to widenthe tax base andredirect expenditure to the social sectors.
Since there hadbeenno bQdgetsupport from the Bank in 1998, the project highlighted
the need for Madagascar to obtain external support to sustain macro-economic stability
andexpenditures onbasic services. The designwas also relevant inthat itrespondedto
the situationfaced after the disbursement o fSAC-I, when it hadbecome clear that
reforms had lost their momentumand commitment had subsided. The "menu-based"
approach was realistic andthe inclusiono f a programto mitigatethe social impact o f
privatizationwas well advised.

IMPLEMENTATION AND ACHIEVEMENTS

6.6      Implementationwas much slower than expected andwas directly andnegatively
affected by two external shocks (three cyclones and the sharp increase inoil prices in
2000) andbythe political crisis o fthe first halfo f2002. These ledto sudden shifts in
priorities. To start, there was a delay o f 13 months between approval (May 1999) and
effectiveness (June 2000) due to the complex negotiations andunforeseen complications
intheprivatizationo fseveral lots ofSOLIMA (see para.6.2), that were exacerbatedby
the increase inoilprices. Thefirst tranche was disbursedin July 2000.

6.7      BetweenFebruary and April 2000, Madagascar was hitbythree cyclones with
considerable damages inparts of the country. The Bank approved a Supplemental Credit
of US$20million inJuly 2000 to provide: (i)     fast-disbursing foreign exchange to
compensatepartially for lower export earnings andhigherimport needs in2000 and
2001; and (ii)  counterpart funding for the reconstructiono fhealth and education
facilities, roads, bridges, etc. GOM took upon itselfto monitor and evaluate
reconstruction and decided, despitethe absenceo fconditions prior to disbursement, to
withdraw funds from the Credit intwo installments, the first upon effectiveness, and the

                                                           24


second after completionof 50 percent o freconstruction inthe most affected areas.24The
first installment was disbursed inSeptember 2000. Reconstruction took much longer
thanplannedandthe secondinstallment was disbursedonlyinJuly 2002.

6.8        The doubling of oil prices between 1998 and 2000 to more thanUS$30 per barrel
put heavypressure on foreign exchange andthe stabilization program, with additional
financingrequirements for 2001 estimated at US$SOmillion. The Bank approved a
second Supplemental Credit o fUS$30million inDecember 2000 to cushion the impact
o fthe oil shock and avoiddisruption inprogram implementation. The counterpart funds
were to reduce the specific taxes on petroleumproducts and/or maintainexisting rebates
to mitigatethe impact on the poor. Thebalance o fthe financing gap was expected to be
filled by extraordinary donor contributions andhigher export growth. The Credit was
disbursed inJune 2001, without conditions.

6.9        Although implementationcontinued to be slow and unevenduring2001, the Bank
was o fthe opinion that, overall, the programwas achieving its objectives, given the
maintenance o f a relatively strong macro-economic performance ina stable price and
deficit environment. For second tranche release, GOMhadchosen, by mid-2001,the
privatizationo f TELMA over Air Madaga~car.~~                   Ithadplannedto sendaninvitationto
negotiate to the winning bidder, uponreceivingthe bidsinDecember 2001. However,
withthe conditions relatingto the regulatoryframework already fblfilled and faur o fthe
eight additionalconditions also met (1: mining; 3: business environment andjudicial
processes; 5: revenue policies andmonitoring; and 6: expenditure monitoring insocial
sectors    - see  para. 6.2), the Board approved inDecember 2001 a waiver to the
requirement o f a sale of 34 percent o f TELMA's voting stock to avoid unduepressure on
GOMduringnegotiations. Instead, issuanceo fthe invitationto negotiate was considered
as meetingthe core condition. At the same time, the closing date was extended fi-om
December 2001 to December 2002, andthe second tranche was released inJanuary2002.

6.10       Followingthe crisis o f 2002, consultations between GOM andthe Bankwere held
inJuly/August2002 to take stock ofprogress achievedandtoreviewtheprioritiesofthe
new government to readjust the program accordingly. The review concludedas follows:
(i) December2001,noprogresshadbeenmadeinfinancialsectorreforms(auditof
    since
pensionandsavings funds), infacilitating accessto land, andno invitation hadbeen sent
to investors for the development o ftourism and industrial zones; (ii) hadbeen           there
progress intheminingsector (adoption o f a law on largeminingprojects) andinair
transport (inMay 2002, GOMhad signed a two-year management contract with
Lufihansa Consultingto operate Air Madagascar); (iii) the crisis, illegal licenses
                                                                      during
hadbeen issued inthe fishery, mining, and forestry sectorsbyvarious officials; and




24GOMplannedto withdraw the secondinstallment after 350 primaryschools inthe 10most heavilydamaged school
districts and 33 out of 82 primaryhealth centers destroyed hadbeenrehabilitated, reequipped, and staffed.

 (iv) after the crisis, the new government hadlaunched a series o femergency measuresto
 tackle corruption and strengthen public financial management (see para. 6.22 below).26

 6.11 Upon completingthe review, the Credit was restructured andthe conditions for
 thirdtranche releaserevised, with anotable shift infavor of governance andfinancial
 management. Some conditions were amended, others deleted, and still others added. The
 core measure relating to air transport was amendedfrom the sale o f amajority of shares
 inAir Madagascar to the signingo famanagement contract. Theadditionalmeasures2,
 4, 7 and 8 were modified as discussedbelow. Annex D lists the changes indetail. Onthe
 whole, the conditions were substantially diluted: not only were they less constraining, but
 they essentially confirmedmeasurestaken sincethe endofthe crisis inJune/July 2002,
 thus ratifyinga de facto situation. GOMandthe Bank agreedon a supplementto the
 original LDP and on amendments to the DCA. The Board approved the restructuring in
 September 2002 andthetranche was releasedinOctober 2002.

 Achievements underEconomicManagement

 6.12      Upto the endof2001, macro-economic stability was maintained. Growth
 reached an average o f 5.2 percent over 1999-2001 due to the goodperformance ofprivate
 investment, inparticular o f foreign direct investment(FDI) intextiles, petroleum, and
 mobile telephony, with         i!!age   spillover effect on small businesses and employment.
 Therewas also a substantial increase intourism. Inflationremainedcontained, hovering
just below 10percent per year. Buttax revenues continuedto performpoorly, stagnating
 at an average of 10.6 percent o f GDP over 1999-01 as a result o ftax exemptions, weak
 tax administration, andwidespread fraud inthe run-upto the presidential elections o f
 2001. The fiscal deficit rose from an average o f 5.6 percent o f GDP over 1996-98 to an
 average o f 6.3 percent over 1999-01 (Table 1inSection 4). The crisis ledto a dramatic
reversal inperformance, with GDP falling by 12.fpercent in2002, and investment fiom
 18.5 percent o fGDP in2001 to 14.3 percent.27After the crisis, the economy rebounded
with acumulative growthrate o f about 15percent over 2003-04.

Achievements under Privatizationand CompetitiveRegulatoryFrameworks

6.13      The LDP specified that the state hadtotal or partial ownership o f about 136
enterprises andthat, by June 30,2000, it would sell its controlling interests i n - o r
proceed with liquidations o f 4 6 o fthese, ie., the list ofM a y 1997plus TELMA.
However, SAC-I1included specific conditions only for BTM, SOLIMA, TELMA, and
Air Madagascar. As aresult, andas notedearlier, SAC-II focused onthese latter three
andonconcluding BTM's transaction, which was a conditiono f second tranche release.
Divestiture o fthe other PEScontinuedto be carried out under the PATESP.

6.14      The sale ofBTMwas completed inNovember 1999. Inthe petroleumsector, the
regulatory framework and regulatorybodybecame operationalinSeptember 1999, but


26Duringthe crisis, corruption hadflourished, public resources squandered, andthe President' Special Fundsoverspent
to the tune o fUS$25 million vs. a budgeted amount o fUS$400,000.
27The largest drop was inFDI, falling from US93 million in2001 to US$8.5 millionin2002 and, inthe textile sector
where foreign investment dominated, output fell by 81.1 percent.

                                                        26


the sale o f SOLIMA and o f its subsidiaries provedto be a long and arduous process. The
division of the assets into lots raised difficult issues o fproperty rights and landtenure,
andrequiredthe creation o f severaljoint ventures.The complexityofthe operation was
exacerbated bythe increase inoil prices as GOM and the new owners had to agree on a
timetable and a formula to align domestic and world prices. The transaction was deemed
completed inJune 2000, with the sale o fthe refinery andthe oil terminal at Taomasina,
thus clearingthe way for Credit effectiveness. However, the transactions ofthe other lots
(logistics, distribution, etc.) were concludedmuch later, the last one inMarch2005.

6.15      The privatizationo f TELMA was considerably delayed due to contested property
rights, litigation over biddingprocedures, andthe political crisis. The transaction was
finally closed inJune 2004, with DISTACOM, a HongKong group, holding 68 percent
o fthe shares (34 percent from the state and 34 percent from FranceTelecom for a total o f
US$25.2million).'* The objective o finvitinga secondfixed line operator was abandoned
at restructuring, although GOMreserved the right to launch a bidto that effect. Inair
transport, the regulatory authority was established in 1999, but the privatization o fAir
Madagascar was abandoned. After a bidwas launched inFebruary 1999, the process
stalled due to an unsettledclaim o fthe U S EximBank on the airline's largest asset, its
Boeing 747. Inaddition, the events o f September 2001 andthe crisis ledto a sharp
deterioration inthe financial situationo f the company makingits sale unattractive. This
led GOMto revise its strategy infavor of a management contract with Lufthansa
Consulting, signed inMay 2002 and renewedinMay 2004. Inthis climate, the twin
objective o fprivatizing airport infrastructurewas temporarily abandoned.

6.16      To sum up, achievements were mixed andconsiderably delayed. The number o f
issues encountered inthe privatizationo fthe largePES,together with resistance from
somepolitical quarters and labor unions, absorbed an enormous amount o ftime and
energyfor both GOMandthe Bank. Byproject closing, none o fthe three major
privatizationshadbeen completed bythe original deadline. Moreover, there were many
shortcomings, such as incomplete adherence to procedures, lack o f clarity inthe h c t i o n s
o f the PC vs. the secretariat, andlack o f expertise inthe latter. Finally, IEGnotes that the
ICRi s silent onthe divestiture o fthe remaining 43 PES,anindicationo fthe
overwhelmingattention accorded to the three major companies. After December 2002,
the privatizationprogramwas carried over underPSDP-K2'

Achievements underImprovementinthe BusinessEnvironment

6.17      The project aimed at improving the business environment by targetingpromising
sectors andpromoting transparency inlicensing for the exploitation o fnaturalresources.
Three sectors were targeted as initial engines o f growth: mining, fisheries, andtourism.


28The state currently holds 22percent; TELMA's personnelholds4 percent; and 6 percent are to be transferredby the
stateto the Privatization Trust Fund.
29As of end May 2005, ofthe 43 remainingPES,24 hadbeen sold and 5 liquidated; biddingdocumentswere under
preparationor sent for 4 companies; consultantswere being recruitedto preparethe bidding documentsfor 6
companies; andbiddingwas suspendedfor 2 companies. The NorthernRailway Companywas operatingunder
concessionand aconcessionagreementwas underpreparationfor the SouthemRailway Company(Source: Internal
Bankdocument ofAugust 2005).

                                                          27


Inmining, anew transparent andnon-discriminatory regulatoryframework (additional
measure 1)30     was put inplace with the enactment of a new Code in 1999, a new cadastre
inMay2000, andthe enactment ofalaw governingthe fiscaIregime oflargemining
projects (at restructuring, additional measure4 was limitedto the enactment ofthat law,
while the conditions relatingto airport concessions anda secondtelecom company were
dropped).

6.18      Infisheries (measure 7),licensefees for shrimp fishingwereraisedby 100
percent in 1999 and, inJune 2000, GOMadopted an allocation system based on
transparent, competitive, andnon-discretionary delivery o f licenses. The system
functioned for the 2000 season, but failed already in2001, as operators enteredinto
informal cartel agreements insubmittingtheir renewalbids. At restructuring, the
requirements o f adjusting annual fees inaccordancewith the new systemando f carrying
out the recommendations o fthe audit o fthe Fonds de DCveloppement Halieutique et
Aquicole were removed (the audit hadnot beendone). A new requirementwas added,
i.e., that the forestry sector be subject to a similar licensing system as for fisheries, and
this was adopted inAugust 2002. In addition, the revised measure 7 requireda review o f
 all licenses granted inthe two sectors andthe withdrawal o fthose issued illegally. During
the crisis, illegal licenses hadbeenwidely issuedby local authorities. As noted above, no
progress was achieved indevelopingtourism andindustrial zones (this was dropped
under measure 2 and replaced by actions pertainingto governance - see below).

6,19      Inthe areaofjudicial processes, anactionplanto improvecaseloadmanagement
was prepared andapproved bythe Bankin2001, butwas not implemented pendingthe
findings andrecommendations ofa forum tasked to expeditejudicial proceeding^.^'
However, before approval o fthe plan, the Ministry of Justice had already adopted a
number of measures with some success. Inthe area o fbusiness environment, an
Arbitration Law was adopted and a Center for Arbitration andMediation set up before
Boardpresentation, but recourse to arbitration i s limitedbecauseo fthe highcosts. On
the basis of consultations with the private sector, measuresaimed at streamlining the
formalities for enterprise creationand for environmental appraisals were adoptedbut they
were hardlyimplemented(see additionalmeasure 3 para. 6.2).32

Achievements underPublicResourceManagement

6.20      A TechnicalUnitonRevenueMonitoringwas createdinthe BudgetMinistryin
March2000 to collect, analyze, anddisseminate data relatingto public revenues and a
group was made responsible for formulating mediumand long-term fiscal policy (see
measure 5 para.6.2). InDecember 2001, the Unitissued a report on revenues at the
central and decentralized levels andontrends intax collection over five years. However,
it didnot succeedinanalyzingthe determinants o frevenue, closingtax loopholes, and


30InSeptember 1999,asconditiontoBoardpresentation,thepermitallowingamilitaryentity,theOfficeMilitaire
Nationaldes IndustriesStratkgiques (OMNIS), to engageinmining activities had beenwithdrawn.
31A revised action planwas to bepreparedon thebasis ofthe conclusions ofthe forum, buthadnotbeendone bythe
time the ICRwas written (June 2003).
32As noted above, an effective "one stop shop", under the acronym of GUIDE, was createdonly inOctober 2003 under
PSDP-11.

identifyingweaknesses intax administration or ways to broadenthe tax base.
Nonetheless, the creation o fthe Unit,the submission o f its report, and the prospect of a
conference on tax policy in2002 were considered as meetingthe condition for second
tranche release. Duringthe crisis, the Unit was dissolved.

6.21    In2000, GOMestablished a systembywhich spending decisions for education
andhealthwere delegatedto deconcentrated offices to speedup the use o fbudget
allocations inoutlying areas (see measure 6 para. 6.2). A Technical Monitoring Unito f
Social Expenditures was created to monitor social policies and expenditures actually
incurred, includingperformance under the new deconcentrated system. It carried out a
tracking surveyto analyze the proportiono fbudget flows actually reachingprimary
education andhealthcenters andproduced quarterlyreports on expenditures based on
budget items and hctions. However, it failed to produce recommendations onpolicies
andaction plansonhow to increase social expenditures or to improve executionrates.

AchievementsunderGovernanceandPublicFinancialManagement

6.22    The original conditionality didnot address specifically governance and financial
management, although these were underlyingconcerns. Duringthe July/August2002
consultations, GOM and the Bank agreedthat actions taken by GOM inthe aftermath o f
the crisis ir,the areas of mti-comptionandfiiancial management would be substituted
to actions not takeninlandtenure (measure 2) and financial sector reforms (measure 8)
as conditions for thirdtranche release. Accordingly, the following replaced measure 2:
creation o f a task force responsible for proposinga national anti-comption strategy and
adoption o f a decree requiringministers, senior officials, andjudges to declare their
assets andthose o ftheir close relatives. Measure 8 was modifiedto cover actions taken
to strengthen financial management: tighter control over the use o fthe Special Funds,
including sanctions against officials involvedintheir misuse, and adoption o f a decree
mandating OAGto carry out semi-annulaudits o fthe Special Funds; completion o f an
audit o fthe HIPC funds for 2001; andmergero fthe Ministries o fFinance and o fBudget,
thereby bringingto closure a long-standing obstacle to improving fiscal policy andpublic
financial management. The new conditionalitywas infact nothingmore than a rubber
stamp ofthe urgent measurestaken to addressthe unique situationthat haddeveloped
duringthe crisis, andwith noprovisionor requirement for furtherreforms. Actual
implementationand/or institutionalization o fmost o f these measureswere infact
undertaken under subsequentprograms or operations.

MONITORINGEVALUATION OTHERISSUES
                AND                AND

6.23    Inadditiontotheseriesofconditions referredto above, SAC-11containedthree
simpleoutcome/impact indicators at project end (originally December 31,2001),
compared to end 1998: increase inFDIas a share o f GDP (fi-om 0.4 to 1.7 percent);
increase inthe share of private investment (the public investment/private investment ratio
declining fi-om 1.2 to 0.9); and anincrease inthe growth rate (above 5 percent). The three
targets were met by end 2001 (see Table 1in Section 4). SAC-I1also listed
intermediate/output indicators with targets set for the closing date. There i s no
informationwhether data were collected to verify these targets or whether they were

utilized. The ICR discussescompliance with the tranches conditions only. There were
no issues regarding compliance with fiduciary safeguards.

OUTCOME

6.24       Moderately Satisfactory. Achievements were mixed: satisfactory inmacro-
economic management untilthe political crisis, moderately satisfactory inprivatization,
business climate, andpublic financial management, andunsatisfactory inpublic resource
management. Ingovernance, the measures taken after the crisis could not have any
measurable impact by Credit closingand corruptionremains pervasive, especially inthe
j ~ d i c i a r y .The progress recorded ingrowth was wiped out in2002, revealing the fact
                   ~ ~
that reforms remained hostageto the fragile political and social environment. Poverty
was slightly reduced inurbanareas thanks to the increase inFDIbut the situation
stagnated or worsened inrural areas. Here again, the crisis of 2002 wiped out whatever
benefits hadbeen gained. However, the budgetary support providedby the Credit
prevented the crisis from havingworse consequencesonpoverty.

6.25       Despitethe disappointing results, achievements under SAC-I1consolidated the
transition to a market economy initiatedunder SAC-I, by laying the foundations for a
PSD-driven growth. The main achievement o fthe SAC-VSAC-II programmaybe
chstracterized as having arrestedthe "dirigisme" o f the previousdecades, with little risk
of reversal, Insum, the two SACSset the stage-but not muchmore - for the
government, after the 2002 crisis, to embark on a more resolute policy o f growth cum
poverty reduction.34 The rating i sjustified on the basis ofthis conclusion.                         .

INSTITUTIONAL         DEVELOPMENT

6.26       Modest. Little was achieved inraisingthe capacity to formulate andimplement
policies. Some o fthe units created were dissolved or were largelyineffective, such as in
public resources management. InPSD andprivatization, GOMremains dependent on
external assistance, andthe regulatoryauthorities remainweak andreportedly receive
technical support from the enterprisesunder their oversight. Inthe fisheries sector, there
i s no effective competitionand, inthe area of facilitating the creation ofbusiness
enterprises andjudicial processes, institutionalcapacity was only slightly improved. In
governance and financial management, a new institutional set-up was inplace only after
Credit closing. Onlyintwo areas was capacity strengthened: inmining, with the
establishment o f a hllyfunctioning cadastre and inpublic finance, with the long-awaited
merger o fthe ministries o ffinance andbudget. Overall, institutionalcapacityremains
very weak.

SUSTAIN     ABILITY

6.27       Likely. There was no reversal inpolicies, despite the crisis. Several positive
factors concurred to reduce the risk o freversal: the government emerging from the crisis


33Underthe decreerequiringhighofficials to declaretheir assets, there are important remaining exceptions.

showed commitment to pursuingreforms and did so starting in2003, althoughat a slower
pace than anticipated; public opinionhas come to accept the reforms, particularly a
greater role for the private sector, althoughthere i s a growing impatience to see concrete
results interms o f employment opportunities and reductionininequality; and the private
operators who have invested inthe privatizationprogramhave now vested interests in
maintainingand strengthening the reforms. However, the remaining challenge for any
government i s to deliver benefits rapidly andmore widely, especially to the rural
populations.

BANKPERFORMANCE

6.28    Moderately Satisfactory. The agenda o f SAC-11was well identifiedandits design
appropriate. Indeed, by appraisal, the Bankhad a goodknowledge o fthe political
uncertainties and o fthe economic challenges. It was particularly concerned about the
long implementingdelays. However, despite the precautions taken (menu-based
tranches), there were weaknesses at entry, notably the overestimation of the commitment
to some reforms ando fthe institutional capacity to carry out several reforms
simultaneously. Inparticular, the Bankunderestimated the complexity inherent to the
privatization o f large andpowerful PES,notably the multitude o flegal issues involved.
Inthat sense, the component was notreadyfor implementation. Duringsupervision, the
Bark demonstrated redismarid flexibility, viz., itreacted quickly andpositivelyto the
cyclones andthe oil shock. Unfortunately, the dominance o fthe privatization agenda
considerably reduced the attention given to other components. This was eventually
reflected intwo ways, the absence o f anyprogress under some "additional measures" and
the "formal" fulfillment o ftranche release conditions under others, notably inpublic
resource management (measures 5 and 6).

6.29    After the crisis, the Bankplayed an importantrole inhelping GOMselect key
areas demandingurgent attention, but endorsed revisions inthe thirdtranche conditions
that were nothngmore than a rubber stamp o f actions taken. This was understandable in
the circumstances but meant little interms o fbuildinga solidbasis for future reform. At
the time, the Bankwas drivenby the willingness to transfer fimds rapidly to the new
government to mitigatethe effects o fthe crisis. Finally, it failed to monitor adequately
performance under the Cyclone Supplemental Credit. Despitethe many shortcomings on
the part o fthe Bank, its very presence andinvolvement were critical to the turnaround in
economic policy after decades o fmismanagement.

BORROWER      PERFORMANCE

6.30    Moderately Unsatisfactory. The commitment to reforms was lukewann
throughout and opposition to some ofthem was strong, inparticular to the privatization
o fthe largePES,symbols o fautonomy. For historicalreasons, the mentality i s strongly
nationalistic andisolationist-still an obstacle to attracting FDI. Inareas less contentious
thanprivatization, GOMdidnothavethe will or the capacity to translate decisions into
permanent andworkable mechanisms or to create institutions capable o f applying and
enforcingpolicies ina consistent and systematic manner. This was particularly the case
inresourcemanagement. To alarge extent, itwas apassive actor, reactingto external

                                              31


events andto the recommendations o fBank missions. Also, it was not capable to
neutralize abuses that underminedthe implementationor the success o f some
components. Finally - andmost importantly-it failed to take advantage o f the program
to formulate and develop pro-poor policies andbuildeffective mechanisms to reduce
poverty and inequality as well as the urban-rural disparity.

7.      Lessons

7.1     The following lessons emerge from the assessment.

    0   The recordo ffragile political stability inMadagascarpleads for designing policy
    development operations ina flexible mannerbasedeither on amenu-based approach
    to tranche release, or preferably, or on a programmatic series o f one-tranche
    operations withprior actions.

    0   GivenMadagascar's relatively low absorptive capacity, TA operations for
    supporting reforms should be well focused andhave limitedobjectives initially aimed
    at implementationbottlenecks.

    0   New institutions inMadagascar need continued assistancefrom the donor
    community. Establishingnew institutions does not ensure their effective operations.
    Continued support i s required, for example, to strengthenthe different regulatory
    authorities created inthe public service sectors and competition ingeneral, as well as
    the business fi-amework. Similarly, continuedassistancei s needed to strengthen the
    judiciary, which i s a long term undertaking.

    0   Consideration should be given to revive the Private Sector Support Fund, which
    provedsuccessful, or to set up a similar schemeto promotePSD.

    0   The tax effort inMadagascar i s particularly low. Muchgreater attention than in
    the past should be givenby the authorities andbythe Bankto revenue mobilization
    andreallocationo fpublic resources for povertyreduction, without which recent
    improvements insocial indicatorswill not be sustained.
