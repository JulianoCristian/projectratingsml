(USD A/C)", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated satisfactory,\n            with project sustainability likely. The overall performances\n            of both the World Bank and the Borrower are satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included the following: 1) Governance\n            reforms, such as civil service and justice reform, cannot be\n            tackled by one project alone. Such reforms are fundamental\n            and sensitive. They require strong and sustained commitment\n            from the highest authorities. This project's experience\n            demonstrates that delivering high quality advice and studies\n            is not sufficient for ensuring that reforms will be\n            implemented. These studies and advice were useful only when\n            political will existed. 2) Capacity building projects that\n            support economic reforms should allow for sufficient\n            flexibility in   project design to be able to accommodate\n            changes in the reform program. In Madagascar, flexibility in\n            project design ensured that important changes in the reform\n            program could be technically supported by the project. In\n            the context of frequent institutional changes, the\n            flexibility of the project to adapt to these changes proved\n            critical for achieving positive reform results. 3) Capacity\n            building projects need a firm anchor in the administration\n            to support economic reforms   effectively. The\n            implementation of the project by an independent unit\n            detached from key ministries lowered   the potential impact\n            of technical project outputs in several areas. Furthermore,\n            the project implementation unit was not able to influence\n            policy in all areas in which the project was active. One\n            obstacle lay in the fact that the project components were\n            spread relatively thinly across a number of different\n            ministries. As a result, several concerned ministries did\n            not develop sufficient ownership of the project. However,\n            ownership is not entirely a function of the institutional\n            structure but it has to go hand in hand with a demand for\n            reform, as project implementation showed: probably the most\n            successful part of the project, the establishment and\n            functioning of the National School Magistrates, was rather\n            detached from project implementation and no core staff of\n            the School was financed through the project. The success of\n            the School is rather due to its establishment being\n            politically uncontroversial and at the same time immensely\n            popular with the legal profession in Madagascar. 4) In poor\n            countries with large capacity building needs, a programmatic\n            and sequential approach to fulfilling governance-related\n            needs might be preferable to tackling them in parallel\n            through one project."}, "docdt": "2003-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
