   public management and creating a favorable environment for\n            the private sector, with the overarching objectives of\n            opening the economy to market forces and reducing poverty.\n            The following lessons emerge from the assessment: design\n            policy development operations in a flexible manner based\n            either on a menu-based approach to tranche release, or\n            preferably, on a programmatic series of one-tranche\n            operations with prior actions; technical assistance\n            operations for supporting reforms should be well focused and\n            have limited objectives initially aimed at implementation\n            bottlenecks; new institutions in Madagascar need continued\n            assistance from the donor community; give consideration to\n            reviving the Private Sector Support Fund or setting up a\n            similar scheme to promote PSD ; and much greater attention\n            than in the past should be given by the authorities and by\n            the Bank to revenue mobilization and reallocation of public\n            resources for poverty reduction."}, "docdt":
