satisfactory, as practically all output objectives were met.\n            The key lessons learned include: 1) It is unreasonable to\n            expect an investment project which disburses on the basis of\n            narrowly-defined outputs and contributes a marginal amount\n            to overall sector spending to effect wide-reaching policy\n            reform. 2) Project success in a community setting is usually\n            due to shared leadership at the project\n            identification/preparation stage, strong community\n            participation in all phases of the project cycle, and the\n            capacities for self-reliance to be found within the\n            community. 3) Project design must incorporate adequate\n            institutional measures aimed at strengthening the\n            implementing agency right from the beginning. 4) Thorough\n            integration of project implementation units and activities\n            within an implementing agency increases the probability of\n            objectives being achieved and sustained. 5) Given the poor\n            performance of several firms in implementing or supervising\n            civil works, new options for the monitoring of works and\n            ex-ante/ex-post evaluation of firms must be seriously\n            considered and piloted. 6) Specific project outcome and\n            impact measures in addition to input and output indicators\n            should be established during design, consistently monitored,\n            and evaluated as part of the project to determine project\n            achievement and impact."}, "docdt": "1998-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
