down the pace of reforms. Some risks can be, and are being, mitigated. On the
country side, the GoJ has already taken a number of actions that indicate a
strong commitment to reform, including front loading a number of tough
reforms, putting in place supervisory arrangements to ensure that reforms are
effectively managed on a day to day basis, and building an unprecedented social

accompanied by technical assistance in critical reform areas to build capacity.
Finally, the IMF, Bank and the IDB are closely monitoring the macroeconomic
situation to try and address, to the extent possible, any emerging macroeconomic
risks. Nevertheless, a significant risk remains if debt dynamics do not improve,
and cannot be mitigated without a more significant resolution of the country's
debt.

﻿IBRD PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A PROPOSED
ECONOMIC STABILIZATION AND FOUNDATIONS FOR GROWTH
DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
TO JAMAICA
I. INTRODUCTION AND COUNTRY CONTEXT
1.    This Program Document presents a proposed Development Policy Loan (DPL) for
Jamaica. The proposed stand-alone operation, in the amount of US$130 million, supports the
Government of Jamaica's (GoJ) ongoing efforts at structural reforms. Good progress on
structural reforms is critical to attract private sector investment and leverage opportunities that
could help the country break its continued cycle of high debt and low growth. The reforms are
part of Vision 2030, the country's National Development Plan which sets development goals for
economic prosperity, human development, security, and management of natural resources. This
operation has two key pillars: (i) improving investment climate and competitiveness and (ii)
improving public financial management for sustained fiscal consolidation. The operation is
aligned with the FY 14-17 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) currently under preparation
which is expected to focus on building conditions for broad based private sector led growth,
improving public sector efficiency and reducing vulnerability.
2.    Jamaica's progress on poverty and shared prosperity has been seriously
undermined in the recent past due in large part to economic shocks that are amplified by
structural weaknesses in the economy. Jamaica has experienced low growth, high public debt,
and serious social challenges for almost three decades. These factors have eroded Jamaica's
competitiveness, leading to economic stagnation and volatility. For the past 30 years real per
capita GDP increased at an average of just 1 percent per annum, making Jamaica one of the
slowest growing developing countries. Nevertheless, between 1997 and 2007, Jamaica managed
to reduce its poverty rate from 19.9 to 9.9 percent of the population. The global financial crisis
resulted in a significant reversal of this progress, as poverty increased sharply to 17.8 percent in
2010, and unemployment reached 16 percent in 2013 (compared with 9.7 percent in 2007), with
youth unemployment at 30 percent.1
3.    The crisis particularly affected the poor and middle class. While a large part of the
population suffered from negative real consumption growth, economic difficulties
disproportionately affected the bottom 40 percent of the population. This has led to higher
inequality, reversing a previously positive trend. The share of consumption of the bottom 40
percent of Jamaica's population, which had improved from 16.7 percent to 17.8 percent between
2001 and 2007, fell slightly to 17.3 percent in 2010. Rural areas were the hardest hit by the crisis,
with the rural poverty level increasing from 17 percent in 2008 to 23.2 percent in 2010.
4.    The Government of Jamaica (GoJ) has articulated a comprehensive program of
reforms that includes fiscal consolidation and a strategy to promote private sector-led
growth. In December 2011, the People's National Party (PNP) won a five year mandate,
1 Note that the Government of Jamaica is currently revising its poverty calculation methodology, with support from
the Bank. These numbers may change in the future if a revised methodology is adopted as is currently planned.

﻿securing two thirds of the seats in Parliament.2 The GoJ signed an IMF Extended Fund Facility
Arrangement (EFF) for SDR 615.4 million (about US$932.3 million) for the period of April
2013 to March 2017, to support its reform program. The Government's economic reforms will
also benefit from support from the World Bank and the IDB, with each having agreed to allocate
US$510 million over the next four years. A number of significant policy actions were taken prior
to the signing of the EFF Arrangement and the pace of reforms has persisted as evidenced by
Jamaica's successful completion of the EFF's first review in September 2013.
5.     Together, the three multilaterals are supporting a wide range of structural reforms
designed to stabilize the economy, reduce debt, restore confidence, and build the
foundations for growth and resilience (Figure 1). The Bank, IMF, and IDB have a long record
of partnership in Jamaica. In 2010, the three institutions supported the Government in addressing
the adverse impact of the global financial crisis with a billion dollar financial package that
included a US$200 million Bank DPL, similar support from the IDB, and a US$650 million IMF
disbursement under a Stand-By Arrangement. The three institutions supported reforms that
focused on fiscal and debt sustainability and public financial management. This time around, the
institutions have come together once more to provide financial support for a comprehensive
reform agenda under an IMF-led program. The Fund-supported program has focused on debt
restructuring, fiscal consolidation and financial sector reforms. The IDB has focused on tax
reform, including the legislation to reform the incentive system. The Bank is playing an
important role supporting structural and institutional reforms to lay the foundations for future
growth, enhance competitiveness, social protection and resilience, and improve public sector
management, which are critical to the goals of debt reduction and sustainable growth. The Bank
and IDB are coordinating their assistance in the different sectoral areas to ensure
complementarity and consistency.
6.     This DPL supports initial steps towards removing key impediments to making the
policy and institutional framework in Jamaica more conducive to supporting future
growth. Reversing Jamaica's low growth requires that Jamaica simultaneously (i) addresses the
macro imbalances that have led to an unsustainable debt level; (ii) improves the business
environment to attract strategic investments; and (iii) establishes mechanisms to manage the
costs of natural disasters and to build social resilience by improving the delivery of critical social
services. The Government has taken the first steps towards macro stability and debt sustainability
(para 11). This DPL is part of an IFI package and supports Government's efforts to implement
reforms that improve the investment climate and support fiscal consolidation. While raising
growth rates in the short term is a difficult proposition, these reforms, if deepened and sustained,
could significantly transform the policy and institutional landscape in Jamaica, attracting new
investments that create jobs, improving the institutional arrangements for public service delivery
and affording opportunities for all to compete in a global workplace. It is envisaged that this
stand-alone operation will be followed by a programmatic series under the new CPS that will
deepen reforms in these areas. The proposed DPL is complemented by Non-Lending Technical
Assistance (NLTA), support through the Bank-managed DFID trust fund, and a number of
investment operations that are under preparation.
2 Jamaica is a Westminster-style parliamentary democracy. The PNP also won local elections in March 2012
confirming a strong support of its manifesto.

﻿7.     While risks associated with meeting the objectives of this operation are high,
inaction could be costly, and the GoJ's strong commitment and serious approach to reform
implementation suggests that returns to this operation could be high. The 2010 IFI
supported Stand-By program was not successfully concluded, and by early 2013 there were
speculations regarding Jamaica's ability to roll over large debt maturities. This time around, the
GoJ has taken a number of actions that indicate a stronger commitment to reform. First, the GoJ
undertook a number of tough reforms upfront, as prior actions to the IMF supported program
(para. 11). Second, they have put in place layers of implementation and supervisory arrangements
to ensure that reforms receive high priority on a day to day basis. Third, the Government signed
an unprecedented social compact with key stakeholders who have committed to support these
reforms (para.52). Jamaica also faces a key opportunity to take advantage of the widening of the
Panama Canal to transform itself into a global logistics hub (para. 17). The Government appears
convinced of the risks of inaction and its recent actions and dialogue with the IFIs support this
assertion.

II. MACROECONOMIC POLICY FRAMEWORK
2.1 Recent Economic Developments
8.     Jamaica has experienced a difficult macroeconomic situation since the global
economic crisis. Jamaica was hit hard by the global economic crisis, as tourism and bauxite
revenues plummeted, FDI and remittances declined and the economy contracted by 1.2 percent
3


﻿on average per year between 2009 and 2011. This contributed to raising Jamaica's debt ratio
which reached 146.1 percent by end-March 2013. The country's debt service ratio averaged
between 85-90 percent of revenue in recent years, leaving the Government with no option but to
refinance maturing debt obligations and limiting fiscal space for productive expenditures.
9.    Despite a strong effort at macro stabilization in January 2010, which included a
large domestic debt exchange, limited structural reforms hurt economic prospects and
derailed the Stand-By Arrangement signed with the IMF in 2010. After the global crisis, the
strong macro stabilization effort was not followed by a commensurate effort on structural
reforms. The country launched a strong macro stabilization effort in January 2010, which
included a large domestic debt exchange (Jamaica Debt Exchange, JDX). The JDX reduced
interest payments providing the country with an opportunity to reduce its financing needs and
begin the process to establish sustainability of the debt. The Government had initial success with
divestment efforts, and made progress in the area of tax administration, however the IMF
Standby Arrangement went off-track in 2011, halting official flows to the country, just as interest
rates were turning upwards and rescheduled payments coming due. The country was unable to
fully secure the gains from the 2010 debt restructuring as pace of reforms slowed.
10.   Jamaica narrowly averted an economic crisis in early 2013. By early 2013, investor
confidence eroded partly due to the delays in concluding a new arrangement with the IMF.
Continued macroeconomic challenges as well as the lingering effects of Hurricane Sandy, which
hit the island in October 2012, negatively impacted economic performance. By February 2013,
the Jamaican dollar had depreciated by 15 percent over the previous 12 months, foreign
exchange reserves were barely US$900 million (less than half their level in 2010), and Jamaica's
ability to refinance the large debt service payments due that month became a subject of
speculation.
11.   The macro and fiscal reforms implemented under the new IMF supported program
have worked to partly restore confidence to the Jamaican economy. The fiscal stance
improved in the run up to the IMF agreement, and difficult prior actions were implemented. This
included a second comprehensive domestic debt exchange (that restructured 65 percent of GDP
worth of debt and resulted in a fall in interest payments from 25.5 percent of revenues and grants
in FY12-13 to 18.5 percent in FY13-14), a multi-year wage agreement with trade unions, and an
upfront new tax package that restricted the use of discretionary tax waivers. Since the agreement,
the economy has begun a slow path to stabilization as reserve losses were contained and the
exchange rate, while depreciating slightly, stopped its free fall. The fiscal stance continues to
improve, and the central government primary surplus reached 5.4 percent in FY2012/13
(compared to an average of 3.9 percent for the previous two years). The financial sector appeared
to take the second debt restructuring in its stride, despite its high exposure to government debt,
and did not utilize the $850 million support fund established by the Government.
12.   Economic targets and structural benchmarks for the first review of the IMF
Program have been met, but growth remains elusive, and inflationary pressures persist.
Real GDP declined by 0.1 percent in the first quarter of FY2013/14. This performance compares
to an average decline of 0.8 percent for the four preceding quarters. The weak growth
performance is mainly explained by low external and domestic demand and a cautious investor
stance. Low domestic demand reflects the impact of depressed real wages and high
4


﻿unemployment. CPI inflation picked up in the second half of FY2012/13, but inflation impulses
were eventually tempered by the first quarter of FY2013/14. During the first half of 2013,
inflation was driven partly by the impact of pervasive drought conditions on some agricultural
crops as well as higher international commodity prices. Thus, despite a general weakness in
consumer spending, inflation reached 9.7 percent (year-over-year) in July 2013, compared to an
average of 6.6 percent over the previous two years.
13.     The Bank of Jamaica (BoJ) relaxed monetary policy in early 2013, but since then
monetary conditions have tightened. Effective February 2013, BoJ reduced the interest rate on
the 30-day Certificates of Deposit by 50 basis points to a historical low of 5.75 percent, down
from 6.25 percent where the rate had been over the previous 18 months. More recently, the BoJ
has actively sterilized its reserves build-up, while the lengthening of maturities in the NDX has
contributed to reduced commercial bank liquidity. To ensure orderly adjustment in the exchange
rate, the monetary authorities have sought to curtail excess liquidity through increased offerings
of US$-indexed bonds and attractively priced Jamaica dollar securities. Nonetheless, the
currency has continued to depreciate this fiscal year.

2.2 Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability
14.    Jamaica's macroeconomic outcomes are expected to improve under the IMF-
supported program, with a significant turnaround in the fiscal and current account
deficits, and a resumption of growth to 2.2 percent per annum by FY16/17. Table 1 presents
the macroeconomic framework underpinning the IMF-supported program. The projections are
ambitious, and subject to downside risk. In particular, while the GoJ is working hard to meet
fiscal targets, growth outcomes may be lower than projected, requiring an even tighter fiscal
consolidation effort if the debt overhang is to be reduced significantly. Jamaica's tight linkages
with the global economy make it difficult for growth to materialize in a depressed global
environment. As the projections indicate, growth will remain subdued initially given the
contractionary impact of fiscal consolidation, and will need to be supported by early success in
securing large investments.
15.   A decisive shift of the growth trajectory will require existing growth drivers to
perform as well as success in developing new areas of economic opportunity. On a sectoral
basis, growth drivers in the past have been very narrowly focused on tourism and bauxite (which
together account for 30 percent of GDP), and remittance flows which are high at 14 percent of
GDP. Sustained higher growth will require a significant turnaround in manufacturing and
services and strong growth in agriculture and tourism. In addition, a decisive growth turnaround
would require a combination of targeted large private investments and structural reforms to
improve the business climate. The latter could reverse the historical decline in productivity levels
that have in the past prevented the translation of reasonably high investment rates into robust
growth and raise the chances that large investments would materialize.
16.    Jamaica faces an important opportunity that can potentially generate significant
FDI inflows which would transform the economy. The expansion of the Panama Canal,
projected for completion in 2015, will result in significant rerouting of trade flows, and Jamaica,
given its geographic location and as the third deepest natural harbor in the world, is well
positioned to transform into a global logistics hub. While it is still early to get precise estimates
of potential investments, these could be as high as $4-8 billion over the next decade, which in an
7


﻿economy of about $15 billion could yield unprecedented gains. Approximately $1.2 billion in
investments can come in over the next few years for three significant infrastructure development
activities: $400 million to expand the Kingston Container Terminal as part of the Logistics Hub
Initiative (LHI, three bidders have been prequalified), $100 million for upgrades to the Norman
Manley International Airport (to be bid shortly), and approximately $700 million for
development of an approximate 360MW power plant (a bid has been awarded). Discussions are
underway for the development of a second port and related logistics arrangements. Should these
investments come on-stream soon, they could help offset part of the contractionary impact of
fiscal consolidation.
17.   A number of other investments are well under preparation. These include a North
South Highway project (US$650 million, under construction), a $500 million beverage
investment (finalized in 2012) and smaller investments in tourism, ICT and sugar estates. The
Government also has a significant PPP pipeline they are actively working on, which includes
tourism, roads and education projects. The IFC's portfolio in Jamaica is already the largest in the
Caribbean and it has recently committed a $500 million local currency bond which it plans to
deploy in funding new projects as they come on stream.
18.   These projected investments and the related growth impact will not materialize
without decisive actions on macro stabilization, especially a record of sustained fiscal
consolidation. The Government has committed to ambitious targets, including an annual 7.5
percent primary surplus target for the Central Government over four years and a zero fiscal
balance for public entities. Achieving the fiscal targets set under the IMF program and legislated
by the Fiscal Responsibility Framework (FRF) will require implementing proactive measures for
expenditure reduction and revenue enhancement. The budgeted primary surplus of 7.5 percent of
GDP for 2013/14 requires a 2.1 percent of GDP increase from the FY12/13 primary balance of
5.4 percent of GDP. This adjustment will be underpinned by a 0.6 percent of GDP increase in tax
revenues and a 0.4 percent contraction in primary expenditures (all of which results from a wage
bill reduction facilitated by the civil service wage freeze, Table 3). On the revenue side, upfront
tax revenue measures implemented in February 2013 would facilitate the increase in tax
revenues. The financial position of state owned enterprises (public bodies), which have been a
source of significant contingent liabilities in the past, is expected to be in balance and an increase
in user fees of some public bodies will yield savings of 0.2 percent of GDP. Fiscal adjustment
over the four year EFF will require a reduction in the wage bill from 10.6 to 9 percent of GDP
and an increase in tax revenues of about 0.2 percent of GDP. Capital expenditures are expected
to increase by 1.1 percent of GDP. By 2015/16, the overall public sector balance is expected to
be in surplus after many years, with a 1.8 percent of GDP improvement over the four year
program period. The FRF will be amended to incorporate the requirements of a fiscal rule that
stipulates limits on the annual budgets that are calibrated to reduce debt to no more than 60
percent of GDP by 2025/26.

﻿19.    Fiscal consolidation will improve prospects for debt sustainability, but the high debt
levels will persist in the medium-term. The
program  is projected to   sustain  a progressive        Figure 1. Jamaica Public Debt Sustainability

20.    Financing needs over the next few years remain high, and will benefit from       IFN
support. Despite a reduction in debt service             Figure 2. Jamaica External Debt Sustainability

21.    Inflation is expected to persist in the      300

short-term  but will decline over the program      Source:IMF
period. The pass-through of exchange rate
depreciation as well as drought conditions created inflationary pressures during the first half of
2013. However, weak domestic demand conditions will likely keep CPb inflation within the
Bank of Jamaica's forecast range of 8.5 to 10.5 percent in FYIl3/14, declining over the four-year
period as the economy stabilizes.
22.    On the external front, depreciation of the exchange rate should help Jamaica
become more resilient to exogenous shocks. Exchange rate depreciation will improve price
competitiveness and contribute to a narrowing of the current account deficit (Table 2). The
extent of the improvement in the current account is likely to be partly countered by a recovery in
investment. FDI coupled with official flows from the IFIs will lead to a gradual recovery in
9


﻿foreign exchange reserves. Exchange rate depreciation, combined with fiscal sustainability and
lower interest rates will support a modest growth recovery if planned investments materialize.
23.   The financial system is expected to remain well capitalized and profitable. Despite
the two debt restructurings, financial sector soundness indicators remain strong with all financial
institutions exceeding the 10 percent minimum capital adequacy ratio. Non- performing loans
have declined from 9 percent of total loans in December 2012 to 5.8 percent in June 2013 as a
result of write-offs, payments and loan growth, with provisioning increasing to 101 percent of
NPLs in June 2013. Bank deposits and the retail repo market have remained stable with no
financial institution coming forward to request assistance from the $850 million Financial Sector
Stability Fund. However, the over reliance on holdings of government securities (banks still hold
around 40 percent of government securities) as well as the relatively high-interconnectivity
amongst financial institutions have increased system-wide risk of spillovers. Planned legislative
reforms under the IMF program should serve to mitigate some of these risks.
24.   On balance, despite the existing challenges and risks to the macro program, the
country's macroeconomic framework is considered adequate for development policy
lending. Supported by the IMF, the Government has articulated a strong program of fiscal
consolidation that remains on track, facilitated a flexible exchange rate regime, and maintained
monetary stability. This is also a testament to the ambitious quantitative benchmarks agreed to in
the ongoing IMF supported program. The first review of the program was successfully
completed on October 1, 2013. The second review is expected to go to the IMF's Board around
December 20, 2013 and will cover targets achieved through end-September, 2013. Nevertheless,
a significant risk remains if debt dynamics do not improve and cannot be mitigated without a
more significant resolution of the country's debt.
III. THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORM PROGRAM
25.   As mentioned above, the Government of Jamaica has launched a homegrown
comprehensive program of structural reforms to significantly transform the economy. In a
recent speech, Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller outlined the multi-sectoral policy
framework that guides Jamaica's reforms, stating that the framework is designed to ensure macro
stability through fiscal prudence, address energy sector issues, develop human capital, optimize
trade and investment, advance justice and national security, resolve environmental and social
challenges, and implement transformative projects, such as the Logistics Hub (see Annex 2,
Letter of Development Policy).
26.   The reforms recently announced by the Prime Minister will contribute to the
implementation of the National Development Plan (NDP) "Vision 2030" Jamaica's long-
term strategic plan which aims to transform Jamaica into a developed country by 2030.
The plan, structured around four national goals and 15 national outcomes (Box 1) seeks to
address critical development challenges and lay a foundation for inclusive and sustained growth
and competitiveness, mitigate medium-term social effects of fiscal consolidation and climate
resilience and protect social gains while moving towards fiscal and debt sustainability. GoJ
recognizes that the failure to implement many initiatives was due to a weak institutional structure
10


﻿and is now committed to improving the efficiency of the public administration and build social
cohesion.

IV. THE PROPOSED OPERATION
4.1 Link to Government Program and Operation Description
27.    While Jamaica faces a complex set of development challenges, the persistent lack of
growth is an important one. Solutions to Jamaica's low growth problem are complex. A 2011
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) highlighted that despite relatively high investment
rates (averaging 20 percent of GDP or more) the Jamaican economy has not grown. The CEM
attributed this to persistently low factor productivity levels, and the prevalence of an enclave
growth model. The CEM pointed to three key binding constraints to growth, namely fiscal and
tax distortions, the prevalence of high crime, and deficient human capital. Combined with other
contributing factors such as high energy costs, this makes for a difficult environment to do
business, and a situation of low productivity. The report recommended, among other things, a
comprehensive overhaul of the tax policy regime including a streamlining of tax incentives, a
targeted focus on crime prevention, and initiatives to encourage vocational training while
strengthening school systems. Combined with improvements in the business environment, these
could go a long way in raising productivity and growth levels.
28.    Nevertheless, the Government's reforms to date have been impressive and are a
good start at addressing growth constraints. A significant overhaul of the tax legislation, as
evidenced by the tabling of comprehensive tax incentives legislation and a bill to cap waivers to
charities (a large source of tax expenditures that had been misused in the past) can decisively
change the framework for tax policy, boding well for transparency and predictability of the tax
regime. Commensurate improvements in tax administration can raise revenues (tax revenues to
GDP were 24 percent in 2012/13), improving prospects for medium term fiscal sustainability.
11


﻿The multi-year wage freeze and the second domestic debt exchange give the GoJ some fiscal
space to implement underlying structural reforms that will change the profile of expenditures.
Much more needs to be done, however, to create an investor friendly business climate that is
conducive not only to the goal of attracting large infrastructure investments but also to foster
broad-based growth that is underpinned by a healthy MSME sector, a thriving agribusiness
industry that has good linkages with tourism, and a fast growing set of creative industries where
Jamaica seems to have the ingredients to establish a significant niche.
29.   The objective of the proposed DPL is to support the Government of Jamaica's
implementation of a set of policy and institutional reforms to increase competitiveness and
improve fiscal management. Reforms aimed at improving competitiveness include a range of
investment climate related actions that will remove identified constraints to doing business, such
as contract enforcement, delays in obtaining construction permits, access to finance, and lack of
support to MSMEs. Even with significant progress on improving competitiveness, investor
confidence will not return unless sustained progress is demonstrated on the fiscal front. This
requires success at addressing the key underlying causes of the rigid expenditure patterns that
make fiscal adjustment difficult, namely the large wage bill (currently 10.6 percent of GDP), the
defined benefit pension program for civil servants that is entirely funded by budgetary outlays,
and the public sector investment program, which is unable to deliver growth dividends in its
present, un-prioritized form. It also requires decisive action on eliminating discretionary tax
waivers and addressing the fiscal health of public enterprises which, in the past have been a large
drain on the budget. The DPL supports actions in a number of these areas, and policy milestones
have been strategically chosen to support the start of important structural reform efforts with
legislation to follow where needed, and possibly supported in successive DPLs. The DPL
supports the reduction of a number of binding constraints as identified in analytical work (Table
5). Within the strategic areas, the reforms supported by the DPL are those in which the Bank has
an ongoing engagement and/or can bring value added, and where the Government has articulated
a strong set of reforms that will bring meaningful change.
4.2 Prior Actions Results and Analytical Underpinnings
PILLAR I. Improving the Investment Climate and Competitiveness
30.   Within the overall objective of the DPL, Pillar 1 focuses on helping to establish the
necessary conditions that would facilitate higher and productive private sector investment
which is necessary for growth in Jamaica. To help create the condition for more productive
private investment, the proposed DPL would support numerous government initiatives already
underway which could have a transformational impact on the country's ability to attract private
sector investment and generate jobs. The reforms would improve the investment climate and
support small business growth.
Investment Climate
31.   Jamaica ranks relatively low in investment climate related indices. Key weaknesses
include access to affordable energy, finance and a tax regime with numerous waivers. To address
this, the GoJ launched an ambitious agenda to improve the business climate by establishing the
National Competitiveness Council (NCC). The secretariat of the NCC is housed at JAMPRO, the
12


﻿investment promotion agency. JAMPRO officials work closely with a number of GoJ Ministries,
Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to address critical investment climate reforms that should
unlock Jamaica's growth potential. The NCC has identified a number of key reforms to address
the most critical constraints facing the private sector. The comprehensive tax incentives
legislation that was recently tabled in Parliament as part of the IMF-supported program will go a
long way in streamlining the tax framework and increasing transparency in the tax regime.
32.    The reforms supported by this operation seek to resolve key investment climate
bottlenecks faced by the private sector. A key issue is the enforcement of contracts. Civil
courts-the main vehicles for dealing with commercial disputes in Jamaica-are severely
backlogged with some cases taking years before being heard. The DPL supports reforms to
increase the civil jurisdiction of the lower courts to improve the efficiency of disposing of
commercial disputes. Another issue is the building permits process. Applications, fees, and
requirements for building permits vary by parish, and once submitted it is difficult to track the
status of the application. This creates problems for investors who have to navigate different
processes, but more importantly need a more reliable time frame to line up financing and
construction planning. A final investment climate area supported by the DPL is improving access
to credit. MSMEs have limited access to finance as banks and financial service institutions are
reluctant to extend credit without standardized credit reporting and assessment. The DPL
supports the establishment of credit bureaus in Jamaica. Two have been licensed and are
operational now. The credit bureaus will collect credit information and perform credit analysis
required by the banks and other financial service institutions that extend credit to the private
sector, particularly for MSMEs which have limited access due to lack of information about them.
*  Prior Action 1: The GoJ, through the Judicature, has expanded the civil jurisdiction of
Resident Magistrates' Courts by increasing from JM$250, 000 to JM$ 1 million the
ceiling for claims that may be considered in these courts, in order to reduce the backlog
of civil cases.
*  Prior Action 2: The GoJ, through the Ministry of Local Government and Community
Development, has standardized and harmonized application forms for construction
permits across all Parish Councils.
*  Prior Action 3: The GoJ, through the Ministry of Finance and Planning, has licensed at
least one credit bureau which has begun to issue credit reports.
33.    Results. The above investment climate reforms would remove some of the key
impediments for private sector development. The reduction of the backlog of commercial cases
should reduce the time taken to resolve a case and hence facilitate contract enforcement and
dispute resolution. Currently to enforce a contract through the courts in Jamaica takes 655 days
and costs 45.6 percent of the claim. The standardization and harmonization of construction
permits will facilitate construction activity by increasing predictability of processing. In the
future, the GoJ plans a full rollout of an online tracking system that will enable builders to
identify the agency and contact person that the application is with, so that issues can be resolved
transparently and quickly. The credit bureau will increase access to credit to MSMEs by
reducing information asymmetries between lenders and borrowers on borrowers'
creditworthiness. The MSMEs will benefit from a reduction in the length of time it takes to
process credit/loan applications, while for companies it is expected to reduce delinquency and
13


﻿late payments leading to a reduction in non-performing loans in the medium-term. As a next step
in improving access to credit, the government is working on legislation to expand what can be
used for collateral.
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)
34.   MSMEs are responsible for the majority of the employment in Jamaica, and are
important potential drivers of future economic growth, however they face severe
constraints. A weak enabling business environment, limited access to finance, low skills and
informality are key constraints for MSMEs. Only 28 percent of MSMEs in Jamaica have a line
of credit compared to an average of 49 percent in LAC. Excessive regulatory and administrative
procedures, fees and financial requirements are a further barrier for MSMEs and result in a high
level of informality. Given these constraints, the GoJ's 2013 MSME & Entrepreneurship Policy
represents a significant step to provide a coordinated and targeted framework to support MSMEs
in an effort to expand their contribution. Through its envisaged Implementation Plan under the
purview of Ministry of Industry, Investment and Commerce (MIIC) and accompanying
monitoring and evaluation component, this Policy would begin to unlock the cross-cutting
MSME constraints and facilitate MSMEs contribution to greater economic growth and job
creation. The policy framework, which was established through extensive collaboration, includes
measures to reduce bureaucracy and increase efficiency including simplification of tax
procedures, incentives to install energy efficient technology in MSMEs, and measures to position
MSMEs to take advantage of the proposed logistics hub for better integration into global supply
chains. Measures to increase access to finance for MSMEs are underway, including the passage
of the Secured Interest in Personal Property Bill which will recognize alternate forms of
collateral, and the roll out of the mobile money initiative, which will particularly benefit
MSMEs.
Prior Action 4: Parliament has approved the Micro, Small and Medium Size Enterprise
(MSME) and Entrepreneurship Policy to support the growth of MSMEs.
35.   Results. By creating an enabling business environment, improving access to finance,
enhancing business and development support and fostering a culture of entrepreneurship and
innovation, MSMEs will be well positioned to take advantage of new business opportunities,
create jobs and increase their contribution to the economy. By providing a better and more
supportive business environment, this should encourage MSMEs to move out of the shadows of
informality, which in turn will improve their growth prospects and contribution to public
finances. In addition, the GoJ has no single window for business registration, thus the private
sector must deal with numerous MDAs to get necessary approvals. The introduction of a single
registration Superform in the near future will help resolve this issue and provide greater clarity
and transparency.
36.   Going forward, the government will need to build on reforms in other sectors to
improve the foundation for broad-based growth. Over the next few years, the government
will need to build a strong reform program that addresses other key constraints in the economy.
Among these challenges are lowering the cost of electricity - Jamaica currently has one of the
highest energy costs in the world due to the dominance of oil, small-scale and aging equipment,
14


﻿and high losses, and requires strengthening the regulatory framework to enable the growth of the
sector. Another challenge is lowering cost and increasing penetration of ICT services,
particularly broadband, as limited competition are holding back the potential impact of ICT as a
key growth enabler across sectors. Further, to ensure effective implementation of one of the
government's key growth initiatives, the LHI, reforms to modernize customs will need to be
undertaken. Other key constraints would also need to be addressed including continued efforts to
reduce crime (where good progress has been made in the recent past), education and skills
development, and reforms to build resilience to natural disasters which periodically set back
progress by imposing high budgetary costs and hampering growth.
PILLAR 2. Improving Public Financial Management for Sustained Fiscal Consolidation
37.   The second objective of the DPL is to contribute to fiscal consolidation efforts by
improving public financial management and supporting expenditure controls in key areas.
Given tight fiscal space, there is a need for increased efficiency in the use of public monies, and
also better risk management of financial liabilities. Efforts are underway to contain the long term
costs of large expenditure items, such as pensions and wages to preserve the gains from recent
fiscal consolidation efforts. Tax policy is to be radically overhauled. Better public sector
oversight will support fiscal risk management, and budgetary reforms will strengthen budget
management. The public sector investment program is being streamlined to achieve fiscal
efficiency. The proposed DPL supports Government initiatives already underway in Jamaica to
transform and rationalize Jamaica's public sector, improve the management of the wage bill for
better service delivery while meeting GoJ's fiscal consolidation targets, and improve the budget
process.
Public Sector Pension Reform
38.   Changes to the public pension system are needed to make the program more
affordable in the long term, as well as bring it closer to global standards. Expenditure on
public pension is expected to double as a percentage of GDP in the next 30 years, reaching more
than 2.2 percent of GDP by 2042. Implicit pension debt is currently estimated at 40 percent of
GDP. The technical team at the Ministry of Finance has prepared the White Paper, and the
proposed DPL supports the implementation of pension reforms as per the recently prepared
White Paper, including increasing the retirement age to 65 (equating it to the National Insurance
Scheme), introducing employee contributions, reducing accrual rates and moving away from
using the final salary as a basis for calculating pensions in the benefit formula. Legislative
changes will be required to facilitate the implementation of the new system. These measures are
expected to reduce the cost of pensions relative to the current system. Implementation of pension
reform is slated to begin in FY2015/16.
* Prior Action 5. The Cabinet has approved the tabling in Parliament of a White Paper for
a reform of the public sector pension that introduces key changes to contain the cost of
pensions to the Government.
39.   Results. The government of Jamaica will take the first steps towards establishing a legal
basis for a public sector pension system which is financially sustainable in the long run, as the
cost of pensions are contained and eventually reduced.
15


﻿Tax Reform
40.    The Government has implemented reforms to the tax regime that will greatly
increase the transparency of tax policy and reduce revenue leakages. As identified in the
Bank's 2011 CEM, "Unlocking Growth", the rampant use of discretionary tax waivers created a
non-transparent tax regime which resulted in distortions in the allocation of capital and decreased
the productivity of investment, lowering potential growth of the Jamaican economy. After much
analytical work and technical assistance, in February 2013, prior to the signing of the agreement
with the IMF, the Cabinet issued a decision curtailing discretionary tax waivers to less than 0.1
percent of GDP, including legally binding waivers. In October 2013, the Government tabled in
Parliament the Fiscal Incentives Bill and the Income Tax Relief Bill for Large-scale Projects and
Pioneer Industries, both important pieces of legislation designed to provide a rules based
framework for the granting of tax waivers, as well as a Charities Bill, which will establish a
similar framework for waivers to charities. All pieces of legislation are expected to be approved
by Parliament by the end of the calendar year. Given the significance of this reform in the overall
set of reform policies, this DPL facilitates the transition to this new tax regime by supporting the
tabling of the Fiscal Incentives Bill in Parliament. This action is harmonized with the relevant
structural benchmark under the IMF-supported program.
* Prior Action 6: The GoJ has tabled in Parliament on October 29, 2013, a Bill called the
Fiscal Incentives (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2013, to transition to a generally
competitive business tax regime with the elimination of existing sector-based incentive
programs and the introduction of generalized incentives through a rules based and non-
discretionary system.
41.    Results: The passage of the Fiscal Incentive Bill (as well as the Bill for Large Scale
Projects and the Charities Bill), expected by end-2013, will go a long way in fundamentally
transforming the tax regime in Jamaica from a largely discretionary framework that gave
significant latitude to Ministers to grant waivers, to a broad-based, rules-based and transparent
regime that will provide predictability for the private sector while promoting competitiveness
through lower tax rates. Complemented by tax administration reform, this could increase
budgetary revenues and promote fiscal sustainability.
Public Service Reform
42.    The GoJ is undertaking a restructuring of its public sector in order to achieve long-
term macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability. The high wage bill is a key source of risk to
fiscal sustainability and the Government is undertaking actions to constrain the growth of
personnel expenditure. The Fiscal Responsibility Framework sets a target for reducing the size of
the wage bill to 9 percent of GDP by March 2016. The measures to attain this objective, include:
(i) reduction of the size of public sector establishment; (ii) development of strategic human
resources management function of the Government; (iii) transformation of selected public
entities into executive agencies (with devolved human resource management); and centralization
of government corporate services to benefit from economies of scale through consolidation of
selected administrative functions.
16


﻿43.   To support a rationalization of public sector employment, the Government requires
reliable data on current public employment. Strategic management of public employment is
hindered by the lack of accurate information. In 2010, public sector data was collected and stored
as Excel files. In 2012, an application called e-Census with fairly comprehensive data storage
capability was developed and populated with the available 2010 data. The data is remotely
accessible through web access by Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDA). However,
"cleaning", updating and using the personnel data base have not happened. The administration of
the database is disconnected from the responsibilities for public service management assigned to
the newly established Strategic Human Resources Management Division (SHRMD) in the
Ministry of Finance. MDAs are not legally required to maintain an updated profile of their public
servants. The Establishment Department and the Public Expenditure Department (PED) of the
MOF do not have access to reliable data to carry out functional reviews and for making informed
personnel management and expenditure decisions. This poses a risk that the GoJ may have
difficulties in controlling the implementation of measures aimed at reducing the wage bill
relative to GDP. The DPL supports first steps on public sector reform by establishing the
information base for functional reviews of the public sector.
* Prior Action 7. The GoJ has clarified the respective roles and responsibilities of the
Strategic Human Resource Management Division of the Ministry of Finance and
Planning and those ofpublic entities in maintaining and using updated central personnel
information.
44.    Results. Government has reliable data to support transformation and rationalization of
public sector employment to support making informed managerial decisions about how to
effectively allocate limited resources. The public service database in e-Census is up to date,
covers all MDA employees. Management of human resources will strengthen internal controls,
increase responsibility and accountability of public entities for management of their personnel,
and ultimately will improve motivation for stronger performance.
Budget Management
45.   Improving the process related to budget formulation is a high priority in Jamaica,
given the urgent need for further progress on fiscal consolidation. Much has been achieved
in this area with the Fiscal Responsibility Framework that sets out clear fiscal targets to be met in
2016. Some progress has also been made on the adoption of Central Treasury Management
System (CTMS) to improve cash management. Less progress has been made in other areas,
however, such as the establishment of a clear budget calendar that specifies when steps will be
completed and identifies the officers accountable. This results in inadequate time for analysis and
decision making, with the budget typically submitted to the Parliament after the start of the fiscal
year. The budget execution system currently allows for overspending at the discretion of
government officials thereby creating the need for either supplemental budgets or arrears. The
DPL would envisage the following prior actions and triggers:
* Prior Action 8: The GoJ has taken concrete steps to improve budget management by i)
adopting a budget calendar for FY14/15 that has been approved by the Cabinet, and ii)
completing the implementation of the Central Treasury Management System for at least
17


﻿thirty MDAs resulting in ninety percent (90%) of all MDA payments being done via
electronic transfers.
46.    Results. Adoption of an interim budget calendar for 2014/2015 and a permanent budget
calendar for 2015/2016 to force fiscal discipline and control in the budget preparation process.
Clear ceilings within which MDAs draft their budget and determine priorities will be achieved.
Budget execution will be strengthened and spending items will not be approved by GoJ on an ad-
hoc basis, which had resulted in reallocations to the budget and which was introduced on a
continuous basis. Prioritization and credibility to the budget will result in improved service
delivery, and there will be transparency in the use of government resources. The migration to
CTMS will improve cash management and reduce idle balances in government accounts thus
minimizing the need for additional borrowing. The complete implementation of the CTMS would
allow the GoJ to reduce check writing, as well as improve financial information availability.
Public Sector Investment Program
47.    To improve public investment planning and effectiveness, a more unified treatment
of all public investments is needed, so that planning is done in a more managed and
consistent manner. Public investment planning in Jamaica is currently managed differently
according to funding source. Projects are classified by Capital A (central government resources),
Capital B (donor funded) and Public Bodies. As a result, investment planning is fragmented,
limiting the capacity to have an overall view of public investment goals. This creates a challenge
to strategically plan and prioritize public investments, to leverage it for growth and compromises
accountability and transparency in the use of government investment resources. The development
of an integrated process of strategic planning and budgeting, in line with the implementation of a
system that makes use of the economic and financial analysis of public investment projects, will
help the GoJ establish clear criteria for public investment prioritization.
48.   The public sector investment program (PSIP) will be improved by the creation of a
user-friendly centralized database. This database would capture all public investment
projects-regardless of funding source-that can be accessed by all public entities and
eventually the public. Such a database will allow policy makers to identify synergies and
priorities for public investment. The database will also include a prioritization matrix application
that will allow the use of different prioritization criteria to select projects for PSIP and monitor
them.
* Prior Action 9: The GoJ has adopted a policy to uniy procedures, requirements and
responsibilities regarding public investment projects (Capital A, Capital B, public bodies
and PPPs) and approved the implementation of these new procedures for Capital A and
Capital B projects for 2014/15 to improve public investment management.
49.    Results. A PSIP that captures all projects and prioritizes across the MDAs, including
information on operations and maintenance for budget planning, will give the GoJ the ability to
evaluate results and the impact of the entire PSIP as well as monitor outputs of projects on a
periodic basis. Additionally, the annual budget presented to the legislature, including the
supporting documents submitted with or around the same time as the budget, will provide a
complete picture of central government capital expenditure.

﻿Analytical Underpinnings
50.    In several reform areas, the Bank has an active engagement with the government
which helps the choice of reforms being proposed. Selection of the reforms is based on recent
analytical work, on-going and proposed investment projects technical assistance and regional
work. Table 5 details the specific reports and activities that have informed the selection of the
prior actions.
Table 5. DPL Prior Actions and Analytical Underpinnings

Investment         Plan, led by Financial Secretary; Note on PSIP Role drafted by the World Bank (August 2013),
which highlighted benefits of unifying all public investments for planning purposes.
4.3 Link to CAS and Other Bank Operations
51.    The proposed operation is fully aligned with the FY14-FY17 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) that is currently under preparation. The proposed CPS is expected to focus
on building conditions for broad based private sector led growth, improving public sector
efficiency and reducing vulnerability. The two pillars of the DPL match the strategic objectives
identified in the forthcoming CPS, and the reform program proposed addresses several of the
key sectors contributing to the CPS targets.
52.    Several Bank operations are also supporting the implementation of the identified
reforms. Pillar I builds on the ongoing projects, AAA and TA engagement in private sector
related reforms, including the Jamaica Growth and Competitiveness Project, ICT Sector Policy
Notes for Jamaica, the Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF) Chapter for Jamaica, and the Jamaica
Energy Security and Efficiency Enhancement Project, and various trade related work. It also
3 The HRMIS system will be financed by a proposed IDB loan. This prior action strengthens the implementation and
operational arrangements that will support the forthcoming ICT system.
19


﻿builds on the extensive work of the IFC in Jamaica which has focused on PPP transactions,
funding MSMEs, credit reporting and energy efficiency. The IFC recently launched a Jamaican
dollar bond program to make long term currency funding available for various sectors including
infrastructure. This should provide a significant source of funding for the LHI. Pillar II builds
upon an active World Bank engagement on public sector management issues, supported by the
Jamaica DFID trust fund which has provided extensive technical assistance in the areas of debt
management, parliamentary oversight, government communications, and public investment
policy. It is also coordinated with the proposed Public Sector Modernization Project. Other
related Bank work included a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis of the fiscal reforms.
53.   Going forward, a programmatic NLTA is also being prepared to provide technical
assistance for the implementation of reforms, particularly in those areas that do not have a
strong existing Bank engagement. In particular, the NLTA is expected to provide support for
agricultural risk management, anti-corruption, health and growth identification.
54.   The design of this DPL has also benefited from lessons learnt from the previous
DPL operations in Jamaica. In particular, the importance of providing technical assistance or
investment lending to bolster capacity will be specifically addressed in the NLTA. Other lessons
incorporated include formulating policy actions to be sensitive to the staffing recruitment
challenges faces GoJ, choosing prior actions that are achievable within the envisaged time frame
and developing results indicators that are directly impacted by the policy action, given Jamaica's
vulnerability to external events.
4.4 Consultations, Collaboration with IFIs and Other Development Partners
A.   Consultations
55.   The Government's reform program is an outcome of extensive consultations with
stakeholders. The GoJ has undertaken a broad consultation process on its long-term
development plan-Vision 2030-which incorporates many of the reforms supported by the
DPL. Vision 2030 was publicly announced and consultations took place throughout the country
with various target groups including youth and community groups, special interest groups, and
the emigrant diaspora (via the web). More recently, the Jamaican government signed the island's
first social partnership agreement (SPA) with the Private Sector, Trade Unions and Civil Society
on July 31, 2013.
56.   A broad coalition is needed to create the necessary consensus in society to design
and implement reform measures that are nationally acceptable and have a better chance of
successful implementation. A key risk facing reform implementation in Jamaica is the potential
risk that vested interests would block reforms. The SPA (para 55) incorporates specific targets
indicative of reform progress, such as reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio; improving Jamaica's
ranking in the World Bank's ease of doing business, as well as rates of unemployment, economic
growth, and levels of energy diversification. The targets will be monitored by the Partnership
Council which includes representation from the four groups (government, private sector, trade
unions and civil society) that signed the agreement as well as from the Opposition political party
that did not formally sign, but accepted the arrangement. The Partnership is managed out of the
20


﻿Office of the Prime Minister and holds monthly meeting with the various stakeholders to monitor
progress towards reforms. A committee for conflict resolution has been established so that
partners can work out differences before committing to a resolution that then has the support of
the Partnership. The Partnership also works closely with the Economic Program Oversight
Committee (EPOC) to monitor the government's reform program, and serves as an on-going
forum of consultations that can improve implementation of the government's reform and their
sustainability. The EPOC consists of government and private sector representatives who meet
frequently to monitor progress. A full time secretariat housed in the MoF supports this
Committee.
57.   Consultations, involving multiple stakeholders, have also taken place on the specific
reform measures supported by the DPL. The proposed pension reform was derived from
deliberations on the Green Paper from a multitude of stakeholders, including representatives of
several bargaining units, the Private Sector Organization of Jamaica, and discussed thoroughly
by the members of the Joint Select Committee of Parliament. For other policy actions,
consultations were conducted during the formulation stage, particularly those related to the
private sector, including the ongoing Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF) initiative.
B.   Collaboration with Other Development Partners
58.   The Government's development program is receiving strong financial and technical
support from multilaterals and other donors. The Government's macroeconomic reform
program has been prepared with IMF support. On the proposed loan, the Bank has collaborated
closely with the IMF and IDB, to ensure synergies in the package of reforms being supported
and to avoid duplicative efforts in the technical assistance provided. IMF is supporting reforms
on macro and fiscal stability, and the financial sector. IDB is focusing on tax policy. This DPL
complements these reforms by focusing on policies that lay the foundations of economic growth
and measures to improve public sector efficiency. The Bank also collaborates closely with DFID,
which has provided a Bank-executed trust fund for broad ranging public sector reforms in
Jamaica.
V. OTHER DESIGN AND APPRAISAL ISSUES
5.1 Poverty and Social Impact
59.   Poverty and social impacts of policy measures supported under this DPL are
expected to be either positive or negligible, with some reforms expected to have a more
direct positive impact on the poor and vulnerable groups than others. Given the time
constraints under which this operation has been prepared, the PSIA has focused on desk review
of secondary sources and primary research that was based on interviews with key local
stakeholders and experts. All the specific policy reforms supported by this lending operation
address the socioeconomic challenges of inequalities and vulnerabilities analyzed and may
contribute to answer key challenges faced by the Government of Jamaica to reduce poverty and
increase shared prosperity. Annex 5 details the reform-specific impacts.
60.   The reforms proposed in Pillar 1 are expected to have a positive impact.
21


﻿Employment generation will be stimulated indirectly by improved business environment and
access to credit, especially considering that MSMEs are targeted. Improved access to finance
would be particularly beneficial for women since they make up a relatively large portion of the
informal sector (57 percent) and own-account workers (58 percent). With regard to the
improvements in the efficiency of the system for the registration of land this will build on
previous GoJ positive outcomes and continue to benefit poor households in squatters settlement,
estimated at 20 percent of the population, and in rural areas.
61.    Policy reforms in Pillar 2 will also have important redistribution effects by means of
improved fiscal efficiency and improved quality of public expenditures and controls. A
reform of the public sector pension system can lead to better management of government
liabilities, which in turn will improve fiscal sustainability and increase fiscal space for needed
pro-poor expenditures. The unsustainability of the current defined benefit pension scheme needs
to be addressed or it will have more severe implications for overall fiscal expenditures. Pension
reforms will have an impact on the income stream expected as accrual rates will be lower,
though this is in part mitigated by grandfathering those with less than 5 years to retirement,
reducing the accrual rates of those already in the system, and only applying the new lower
accrual rates to new hires. The reform, however, does not discriminate between men's and
women's retirement age, with women being more negatively impacted based on the assertion
that women take care of unpaid family work, both for children and increasingly for the elderly,
and therefore could be compensated by an earlier entry in the pension system. In order to assess
the gender impact of pension schemes, it is thus necessary to consider all mechanisms that can
offset the negative impact for women, such as care pension credits, minimum pensions and
unisex tariffs, as well as derived pension rights. Considering the gradual approach of the
government pension reform, there is opportunity for integrating pension reform with appropriate
labor market and social policies and thus mitigating the risks of unequal distributional impact of
the reform across social groups and gender. A comprehensive gender impact assessment as part
of the pension reform process could also be considered in a forthcoming DPL.
62.    The overall conclusion of the PSIA is positive. All the policies considered have clear
positive distributional effects on the poor and vulnerable groups, in both the short and in the
medium to long term. Although few challenges have been pointed out by this assessment,
especially with a view to increase the gender sensitivity of the policy reforms, the opportunity for
stronger citizen engagement and the need to have more robust poverty and social impact analysis
and evaluation of those reforms in order to make the necessary adjustments, the desk review and
the consultations have indicated no significant negative impact of the policies being pursued.
5.2 Environmental Aspects
63.    It is expected that the policies and reforms supported by this operation will not have
any negative environmental impacts. An on-site review was taken to cover all prior actions. Of
the prior actions, there was a particular focus on construction permits. The streamlining of
construction permits has a potentially positive impact on the environment in that it would
enhance conditions for sustainably managed private sector growth, as transparency in the
transaction process would provide opportunities for informed urban planning decisions. However
the approval process for construction permits requires the co-ordination and integration of
various government agencies, under the existing legislative framework. As such, the intention to
22


﻿accelerate the issuance of construction permits should take into consideration the requirement to
incorporate results of consultations with these agencies and other stakeholders, including civil
society, in cases of projects where the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) has
determined that a full environmental assessment is required.
5.3 Fiduciary, Disbursement and Auditing Aspects
A. Fiduciary
64.   The GoJ is making progress in improving their public financial management system
to mitigate fiduciary risks. A comprehensive assessment of the Jamaica PFM systems (PEFA)
was originally carried out in 2007 and repeated in February 2013. Both reports observed that
performance of the GoJ PFM systems varied across the budget cycle.
65.   The GoJ budget is prepared with due regard to Government Policy. The medium-
term fiscal planning process is underpinned by the Fiscal Responsibility Framework, which has
been in effect since 2010. Medium term fiscal forecasts and expenditure frameworks have
recently been introduced as part of the budgeting process. Furthermore, the budget classification
used by the GoJ is broadly compatible with international standards, and presents recurrent and
capital expenditures within a single framework. The prepared budget is relatively credible at the
aggregate level, however, a recent assessment observed an increase in unreported government
expenditures, primarily attributed to unrecorded arrears, tax waivers and tax refunds. Fiscal and
budget information is accessible to the public.
66.   Predictability and controls in budget execution have been limited by the monthly
cash rationing system and weak tax collection. In addition, while the internal audit function
has seen some improvements, internal controls, particularly those related to payroll expenditures
remain weak. At the same time, the public procurement framework has demonstrated some
improvement by making tenders the default procurement method.
67.   Cash management and bank account reconciliation processes have demonstrated
some improvement in recent years. Significant progress was achieved in the last six months
with the almost complete roll-out of the CTMS. However, the timely reconciliation of bank
accounts by various MDAs still remains an issue.
68.   The existing payment, accounting and reporting system    (FINMAN) allows for
comparisons of budget estimates and out-turns, by economic categories for various MDAs.
However, this information is captured at the payment stage only. Commitment data is not
recorded in FINMAN, apart from the schedule of debt service payments. In addition, in year
financial reports produced by the system do not have capability of reporting revenue and
expenditure out-turns on a monthly basis by administrative classification. As such, the
Accountant General's Department is still unable to produce the whole of Government budget
reports by administrative headings.
69.   The conversion of the annual financial statements to meet the international cash-
basis IPSAS standard is a major outstanding issue in the agenda of the PFM reform. The
23


﻿annual financial statements covering all central government entities are still lacking. Individual
MDAs, as well as LGAs and AGAs, produce annual financial statements. These statements are
presented in a consistent format but not all of the national standards are clearly spelled-out and
compatible with IPSAS. The Government has chosen to support the accounting and financial
reporting reform, commencing with the adoption of Cash IPSAS, proceeding to a commitment-
based budget accounting system, and culminating with the adoption of accrual accounting
standards in the long run. The GoJ has also decided to replace (FINMAN) with a new integrated
system, (IFMS), in order to meet the increased financial recording and reporting needs and
improve fiscal accountability and transparency.
70.   All central government entities are audited annually. A full range of audit services is
performed and follows procedures and templates developed in keeping with the INTOSAI
standards. Financial statements are usually presented for audit with some delays.
71.   Overall, the fiduciary and PFM  framework is adequate for development policy
lending. Further improvements to developing a sound PFM system and improved quality of
public expenditures continue to be high on the GoJ agenda. As part of this effort, the Jamaican
authorities have already implemented a number of important measures. Recent achievements
including centralization of the treasury management system and implementation of the Fiscal
Responsibility Framework (FRF) demonstrate the GoJ commitment to the ongoing effort.
However, as is discussed above, there still remain a number of significant weaknesses, especially
in the area of strategic resource allocation, budget execution, accountability and transparency.
The GoJ is has recently prepared an updated PFM Action Plan based on the findings of the latest
PEFA assessment. This operation, as well as other operations, currently prepared by the WB and
IMF will continue providing direct support to the identified priority areas, together contributing
to the strengthening of the existing PFM environment.
B. Disbursement and Auditing
72.   Foreign exchange management system. The IMF jointly with the World Bank
conducted the Financial System Stability Assessment in 2006, and IMF also conducted a
Safeguard Assessment in 2010 and found that the central bank control environment within which
foreign exchange is managed is satisfactory. The Bank of Jamaica has well established
procedures that ensure the integrity of its operation. It also has in place a well-functioning
internal audit department and accounts are audited by independent external auditors. The Board
of Directors of the Bank of Jamaica has an Audit sub-committee of the Board, which provides
oversight of the financial management and control environment.
73.   Disbursement, Reporting and Auditing Arrangements. The proposed loan will follow
the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy support. Loan proceeds will be
disbursed once evidence of fulfillment of prior actions has been accepted and the necessary
approvals by the World Bank and Jamaica have been obtained. The proceeds of the loan will be
disbursed into an account designated by the Borrower that is part of the country foreign
exchange reserves account at the Bank of Jamaica. The administration of this loan will be under
the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. Given that the fiduciary environment at the Bank of
Jamaica is adequate, no specific audit of the deposit account will be required.
24


﻿74.   Loan Administration. The Bank would disburse the loan proceeds into an account of the
Bank of Jamaica denominated in US dollars. The Bank of Jamaica will immediately credit the
disbursed amounts to the account of the Ministry of Finance and Planning, thus becoming
available to finance budgeted expenditures. Within a week of this funds transfer, the Ministry
will provide the Bank with a written confirmation.
5.4 Monitoring and Evaluation
75.   The Ministry of Finance and Planning has responsibility for the coordination,
monitoring and ensuring completion of the prior actions under the DPL. Monitoring and
evaluation is supported by the various ministries. The Bank has an extensive and active program
in Jamaica in several of the policy reform areas identified under the DPL, and monitoring of
results of the DPL actions will therefore be continued through the other Bank programs.
VI. SUMMARY OF RISKS AND MITIGATION
76.   The overall risk of achieving the objectives of the operation is high. Jamaica is
entering a demanding transition period, where difficult reforms will only yield results in terms of
growth acceleration and shared prosperity over the medium term. There is a risk that political
commitment may weaken and social tensions increase, or that natural disasters may adversely
impact fiscal consolidation efforts and set back the reform program. Some risks can, and are
being mitigated.
77.   The medium to long term results of the program supported by the DPL faces three
types of risks: macroeconomic, governance and political and capacity risks.
(i)   Macroeconomic risk. The economic situation continues to be fragile, and the Jamaican
economy remains highly vulnerable to external shocks and natural disasters. The combination of
a large current account deficit, low foreign exchange reserves, high unemployment and limited
fiscal space significantly reduces the Government's flexibility to absorb unforeseen shocks,
including those resulting from natural disasters. Growth targets are ambitious, and require both
the continuation of good policy and a favorable external environment. Specific risks relate to (i)
potential changes to the PetroCaribe Agreement which provides sizeable financial flows, and (ii)
increased stress in the financial sector after two large domestic debt exchanges.
* Mitigation: The Bank is monitoring this risk closely by working with the IMF and IDB on
the Jamaica program, and will pace assistance under future budget support programs that will
contribute to further strengthening the country's overall macroeconomic framework. The
Government is undertaking appropriate policies to build economic resilience.
(ii) Governance and political risks. Jamaica faces a heavy reform agenda which could lose
steam if early results are not sufficient to maintain political and popular support, and if vested
interests are accommodated. The DPL complements difficult reforms underway under the EFF
Arrangement which have consumed considerable political energy.
* Mitigation: The authorities are fully aware of this risk and are promoting continuous
consultation and awareness-raising around benefits of sector reforms. The Bank, through the
25


﻿DFID trust fund, is providing technical assistance on the development and implementation of
a communication strategy for more effective outreach from the MoF to other parts of the
Government on the reform agenda. In addition, the Government has signed a Social
Partnership Agreement (SPA) with the Private Sector, Trade Unions and Civil Society (para
56) which is intended to form a broad coalition around the reform agenda to ensure the
sustainability of reforms and mitigate against a relapse of political commitment.
(iii) Capacity risks. The multi-faceted reform agenda raises the risk that government capacity
and fiscal resources could be stretched thin, that implementation could be delayed and that
enforcement of new legislation could be weak. Legislative capacity has been stretched given the
amount of legislation that needs to be drafted and approved over the next few years. In addition,
an ongoing public sector wage freeze has greatly hampered the Government's ability to attract
and maintain talent and made it difficult to create new positions. Several of the reforms require
the Government to hire personnel with scarce skills, and there is a risk that the Government will
not be able to fully operationalize some of the reforms within the envisaged timeframe.
* Mitigation: To support policy actions underpinning the DPL, the Bank has secured financing
for training opportunities for public sector staff as well as for technical assistance, including
in the form of special advisors focused on design and implementation of key reforms so that
they might be able to take on some of these tasks without additional hiring requirements. On-
going technical assistance is being provided in access to finance, doing business, PPP and
other areas.

JAMAICA
November 6, 2013
Dr. Jim Yong Kim
President
The World Bank
1818 H Street NW
Washington DC 20433
Dear Dr. Kim,
Economic Stabilization and Foundations for Growth Development Policy Loan
The Government of Jamaica (GOJ) appreciates and welcomes the technical and financial support of the
World Bank for the successful achievement of the goals, outcomes, and reform measures articulated in the
Vision 2030 Jamaica National Development Plan. The Government of Jamaica is fully committed to the
sustainable development of the country and continues to undertake major structural reforms that support
growth and help reduce poverty.
Background
The Government of Jamaica has embarked on a wider ranging program of fiscal consolidation and structural
reforms with the objective of significantly transforming the economy, creating jobs and reducing poverty.
The economic program is supported by four main pillars: fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability to
engender a stable and resilient macro-economy; monetary and financial system stability; structural reforms to
strengthen productivity and competitiveness and strengthened social stability to protect the most vulnerable.
Much progress has been made in the area of fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability. The primary
balance for the first quarter (April-June) of FY2013/14 was better than budgeted and Jamaica is on track to
meet a primary balance target of 7,5 percent of GDP this fiscal year. In the area of debt sustainability, the
successful National Debt Exchange (NDX) lowered interest rates on domestic debt and extended maturities.
This resulted in a reduction in interest payments from 25.5 percent of revenues and grants in FY2012/13 to
18.5 percent in FY2013/14, without affecting financial market stability. Progress has also been made in the
area of monetary policy and financial sector reforms and deeper financial sector reforms are envisaged going
forward to phase out the retail repo model currently practiced by securities dealers and introduce a wider
range of financial services, including collective investment schemes.
Jamaica's creditable economic performance is underscored by the recent upgrade by Standard & Poor's,
which noted that the Jamaican economy has stabilized and expressed their expectation that the country's
ambitious fiscal targets for this year will be met. The IMF's September 2013 Report to their Board on
Jamaica's economic performance, acknowledged the GOJ's "financial discipline" and "steadfast
implementation of the initial reforms".
30


﻿Structural Reforms to Support Growth and Resilience
For over three decades, Jamaica's economy has faced serious challenges to achieve sustained levels of
economic growth. This has resulted in a continuing fragile economic environment with considerable
underlying vulnerabilities and a high public debt level that imposes an enormous fiscal burden.
While efforts at fiscal consolidation are underway, they need to be complemented by a growth and
development strategy that transforms the Jamaican economy. The Government of Jamaica is undertaking a
range of structural reforms with the objective of increasing factor productivity and firm competitiveness,
identifying and securing financing for strategic investments, increasing the efficient use of government
resources whilst reducing vulnerability.
a. Private Sector Growth
The Government is committed to deepening the role of the private sector to achieve the growth agenda. The
core components of this agenda are strategic investments, improving the business environment,
macroeconomic stability, entrepreneurship and innovation, energy efficiency and human capital
development.
Creating the conditions for improving the ease of doing business is of critical importance to attract foreign
and local investments. Jamaica is ranked 90th among 185 countries in the World Bank's 'Doing Business
Report'. The Government of Jamaica is taking steps to improve the business environment and raise
Jamaica's ranking in the surveys such as the World Bank's Doing Business indicators. To this effect, we
have already undertaken several measures that would improve the business climate including:
operationalizing Jamaica's first credit bureau to improving access to credit; increasing the civil jurisdictions
of the lower courts to reduce back logs in the civil courts, leading to better contract enforcement. As part of
the improvement of the business environment in Jamaica, the 'Super Form' will be introduced. This Super
Form will consolidate applications from five different government agencies and is a major step towards
eliminating the red tape that hampers the registration of new businesses in Jamaica
Over the last two decades, it has become increasingly clear that Jamaica has lost, and is continuing to lose its
competitive edge in goods production. At the same time, however, Jamaica's competitive advantage in the
services sector has increased, particularly in the logistics and shipping sector. This advantage has become
even more critical, given the expansion of the Panama Canal, Jamaica's unique geo-strategic location, and
the natural resource endowments which include two of the best natural harbours in the world. Our imperative
is to integrate the Jamaican economy into the global value and supply chain and the Logistics Hub Initiative
(LHI) is seen as the central plank toward achievement of this objective. Jamaica Logistics Hub is a
clustering of global third party logistics providers and large global businesses with substantial cargo flows to
take advantage of sea-air connectivity opportunities and trade corridors from production houses in the
Asia/Pacific and other regions to the growing markets of over 800 million people in the Americas. The
Government of Jamaica is prioritizing the development of the LHI, which plays a critical role in Jamaica's
growth strategy, with the objective of positioning Jamaica as the fourth node in the global logistics chain,
joining the Netherlands (Rotterdam), Singapore and Dubai. Successful implementation of the LHI will not
only generate significant income and jobs for our people, especially the youth, but will also transform
Jamaica's position in the global economy.
To this end, concession of the Kingston Container Terminal (KCT) represents a key infrastructure investment
of the LHI. In recent years the KCT has deteriorated in terms of berth depth and operational capacity, and
requires substantial investment to facilitate physical improvements and sustained efficiency of port
operations to ensure its continuance as a preferred container hub in the sub-region. A successful concession
of the KCT terminal is not only essential for advancing the LHI, but can greatly enhance the value and
contribution to the economic development of the country. The Government of Jamaica is committed to
31


﻿allocating the KCT concession through a transparent and competitive manner and thus set the stage for
greater interest and competitive bidding for future PPP projects.
Alongside the economic programme and mega projects to build and maintain the necessary macroeconomic
stability and growth, there are institutional programmes aimed at transforming Jamaica's education system to
ensure the country remains competitive and help to achieve the Prime Minister's mandate that "no one is left
behind". The primary education school curriculum is undergoing renewal to be completed by 2016. The
compelling purpose of the curriculum renewal is to achieve the required levels of literacy and numeracy.
Review of all subjects of the national curriculum is underway and will be rolled out in September 2015. The
contents of all subjects are being revised with particular attention to Science and Social Studies, and with
more emphasis on Civics and Jamaican History.
b. Transforming the Public Sector to support Economic Growth
The GoJ is taking several steps to transform and modernize the public bureaucracy to make it more
responsive, efficient and effective in contributing to sustainable growth, while streamlining costs. Other
initiatives are underway to strengthen budget processes and improve the management of the public sector
investment programme.
The present pensions arrangement is unsustainable and the GOJ is committed to addressing this issue, Much
work has been done in the area of civil service pension reform that has led to the development of a White
Paper on this issue titled "Reform of the Public Pensions System", which details parametric changes in the
current pension system including the gradual increase of the retirement age to 65, and the contribution of five
percent (5%) by employees. The revised pension system is expected to be implemented in FY2015/16. It is
expected that over time, systems that provide for better monitoring and processing of pension payments will
be in place.
Tax reform is a vital and necessary step to shore up our public finances, particularly the reduction and
eliminations of distortions in the tax system with regard to tax incentives and waivers. In October 2013, the
GoJ tabled in Parliament the Fiscal Incentives Bill and the Income Tax Relief Bill for Large-scale Projects
and Pioneer Industries. These are both key pieces of legislation designed to provide a rules based framework
for the granting of tax waivers. Likewise, a Charities Bill is also being tabled that will establish a similar
framework for waivers to charities.
The new Strategic Human Resource Management Division (SHRM) at the Ministry of Finance and Planning
is focusing its energies on activities such as the training and development of persons as well as succession
planning for the overall sustainability of the Public Sector. The objectives of this Division are:
* To link the Human Resource Management function to strategic business objectives.
* To allow the Public Sector to better identify, develop, and deploy the knowledge, skills and abilities
required to achieve maximum impact and contribute to the creation of value within the local
economy.
* To establish a framework and approach to recruit, develop and retain the best talent in the public
sector.
This new division is a merger of the Public Service Establishment Division in the Ministry of Finance and
Planning and the Corporate Management Development Division of the Cabinet Office. One of the first tasks
of this division is to bring synergy to the human resource management practices across the public service.
During the course of this financial year, the Government will be procuring an enterprise-wide human capital
management system to provide technological support to the human resource management practices. A major
weakness to be addressed by the system is the lack of complete employment data for the sector which
impairs the ability of entities to efficiently manage their Human Resource Management processes such as
pensions, training and development, staff deployment, succession planning and leave administration.
The Government of Jamaica is establishing a Central Treasury Management System --a central payments
platform - that is already underway. There are important efficiencies to be gained from the establishment of
32


﻿a new technical office to drive e-government and to provide new ICT systems and reduce the cost of
communication within government and enable the greater utilization of electronic transactions. In order to
ensure that the budgeting process is completed in a timely manner, a detailed budget calendar will be
approved for the 2014/15 budget.
Reform is also underway to improve public investment planning, to facilitate better management and
utilization of resources. To this end, we recognize that the success of the public sector investment program
(PSIP) is highly dependent on the initial assessment of the issue as well as the mechanisms that are used to
make the decision regarding how to allocate. As a first step, a Cabinet Submission has been prepared
outlining the unified procedures that will apply to all public investment projects regardless of the funding
type. The PSIP Policy Paper will be tabled annually with the Budget documents and will include the past
year's public investment performance, the current year's plans & projections and the medium term profile.
Another key step taken is the establishment of a public investment projects database which will eventually
include all public investments of the GoJ (Capital A, B, and public bodies), and improve planning and
monitoring.
c. Improving Resilience
Jamaica remains vulnerable on several fronts, including natural disaster sudden shocks which can be a
significant strain on the fiscal accounts and are sources of volatility. Necessary reforms to mitigate these
vulnerabilities are actively being undertaken.
Considering the mechanisms that need to be activated and the services that are provided during disasters the
Government has introduced the Disaster Risk Management Bill which will enhance the country's ability to
respond to disasters. The Bill seeks to: recognize existing organizational structures such as the National
Disaster Committee, the Parish Disaster Committees and the Zonal Committees with their roles and functions
clearly established; establish a National Disaster Fund which will help alleviate potential disruptions to the
economic recovery programme in the event of a disaster; legally evacuate persons identified to be at risk as a
preventative measure; and identify and describe high risk areas as "especially vulnerable areas" and outline
the steps to be taken in respect of such areas.
Linked to disaster preparedness is the need to ensure the structural integrity of buildings. Accordingly, the
Building Act was reviewed. The purpose of this Bill is to facilitate the regulation and enforcement of
Jamaica's building code at the local level which considers natural hazards including wind, rain and seismic
events; enforcement of such a code minimizes potential redirection of financial resources to reconstruction
from predetermined development projects, and therefore limits the Government's implicit liability to
response and recovery expenditures.
Another source of vulnerability is the high incidence of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). NCDs
account for upwards of 60 percent of deaths in Jamaica annually and cost about US$170 million per annum.
The Government is committed to the World Health Assembly resolution of 2012 to reduce premature deaths
from non-communicable diseases by 25% by 2025. The Ministry of Health has formulated the first
comprehensive strategic plan for NCDs in Jamaica, which will address the four major conditions causing
death and disease in the country: Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, Chronic Respiratory Diseases
and the four major risk factors - physical inactivity, unhealthy eating, harmful use of alcohol and tobacco
use.
Jamaica is also committed to addressing crime and community safety. To this effect the Government is
rolling out successful initiatives to reduce crime. The National Crime Prevention and Community Safety
Strategy (NCPCSS) serves as a framework for securing support and approval and to instigate detailed
planning in the area of crime prevention and community safety by the Government of Jamaica. The NCPCSS
represents an integration of over 50 consultations from public and private sector bodies, civil society, NGOs,
IDPs, and residents. Recently the Ministry of National Security signed a Memorandum of Understanding
with 1 8 Government agencies to facilitate collaboration and information exchange for the Jamaica Crime
33


﻿Observatory, a web-based crime and violence statistics databank covering the five parishes with the highest
incidence of crime. The move will ensure standardisation and accessibility to timely and reliable crime
statistical data, to inform the Government's strategy and efforts to reduce the incidence of crime and
violence, particularly in high risk and vulnerable inner-city communities in Jamaica.
Finally and in recognition that the people of Jamaica are partners with the Government as we go through this
reform process, the Government of Jamaica signed the island's Social Partnership Agreement (SPA) with
the Private Sector, Trade Unions and Civil Society on July 31, 2013. The SPA is a consolidation of years of
work and will include a programme of measures to achieve macroeconomic stabilization and growth with
equity initially over the period 2013-2016.
In furthering our commitment to the people of Jamaica to provide better governance, the Government of
Jamaica is in the process of streamlining the existing institutions that are tasked with combating corruption in
Jamaica. In particular, legislation is being tabled in Parliament to establish a single anti-corruption agency
that would merge three existing agencies-- Corruption Prevention Commission, the Integrity Commission
and the Office of the Contractor General-- that by concentrating efforts and resources in the fight against
corruption will be more effective in reducing corruption.
The Government believes that the policies and actions described in this letter will take us a long way toward
achievement of Jamaica's growth and resilience strategy. The Government has taken all the agreed actions
included in the First Foundations for Growth and Resilience Development Policy Loan and will continue to
implement the additional measures identified in the country's reform programme to ensure success of the
reform.

IMF Completes First Review under Extended
Fund Facility Arrangement for Jamaica and
Approves US$30.6 Million Disbursement
Press Reiease No. 13/374
September 30, 2013
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) today completed the first review of Jamaica's
performance under an economic program supported by a
four-year, SDR 615.38 million (about US$944 million, the
equivalent of 225 percent of Jamaica's quota in the IMF)
Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement. The completion
of this review enables the disbursement of SDR 19.97
million (about US$30.6 million), which would bring total
disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 156.72
million (about US$240.4 million).
Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Nayouki
Shinohara Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair of
the Board, stated:
"Overall program implementation under the Extended Fund
Facility (EFF) has been strong, despite the weak economic
environment. The authorities' continued committment to
the program objectives of strengthening Jamaica's fiscal
position and creating the conditions for sustained economic
growth will be critical to a revival of investor confidence
and domestic demand In the period ahead.
"The program for the remainder of fiscal year 2013/14
focuses on structural reforms to strengthen the fiscal
framework. Priorities include the enactment of an effective
fiscal rule to lock in the gains from the fiscal adjustment
thus far, and a comprehensive tax reform to broaden the
tax base and reduce distortions. An expected short delay in
submission to parliament of a new law on tax incentives
should not postpone its enactment.
"Achieving broad-based growth and enhancing social
protection are central pillars of the authorities' economic
program. The growth agenda should be bolstered by
further actions to enhance the business environment and
support well-targeted public investments, in close
collaboration with development partners.
"Close monitoring of the financial system remains essential
to forestall the emergence of vulnerabilities following
February's restructuring of the public debt. A
comprehensive reform of the securities dealers sector
would also be important for safeguarding financial
stability."

﻿ANNEX 5. POVERTY, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Prior actions                Poverty, Social and Gender Impact Analysis                                 Environmental Impact
Pillar 1: Improving Investment Climate and Competitiveness

to incorporate results of consultations with these Agencies and other
stakeholders, including civil society, in cases of projects where NEPA
has determined that a full Environmental Assessment is required. The
National Resource Conservation Authority Act of 199p1.
Pillar 2: Improving Public Financial Management for Sustained Fiscal Consolidation
PAa. Pensions        Positive, with gender issues to be strengthened: A reform of the pension  Neutral
system, as indicated in the White Paper on Public Sector Pension System
(2013) can lead to better management of government liabilities, which in
turn will improve fiscal sustainability and increase fiscal space for
needed pro-poor expenditures. The unsustainability of the current defined
benefit pension scheme needs to be addressed or it will have more severe
implications for overall fiscal expenditures. Pension reforms will have
an impact on the income stream expected as accrual rates will be lower,
though this is in part mitigated by grandfathering those with less than 5
years to retirement, reducing the accrual rates of those already in the
system, and only applying the new lower accrual rates to new hires. The
reform however does not discriminate between men and women
retirement age (equalization of retirement age), with women being more
negatively impacted based on the assertion that women take care of
unpaid family work, both for children and increasingly for the elderly,
and therefore should be compensated by an earlier entry in the pension
system. Most importantly, the gender neutrality of the reforms results in
pension systems that reproduce (or even reinforce) existing gender
inequalities in the labor market and in the division of social roles within
households, producing gender differences in pension income. In order to
assess the gender impact of pension schemes, it is thus necessary to
consider all mechanisms that can offset the negative impact for women,
such as care pension credits, minimum pensions and unisex tariffs, as
well as derived pension rights in case of marriage or divorce and for
37


﻿survivors and how these different features combine together. In addition,
gender effects of pensions' reforms can have an effect also on younger
generations, introducing dis-incentives for women to enter into formal
labor market. Considering the gradual approach of the government
pension reform, there is opportunity for integrating pension reform with
appropriate labor market and social policies and thus mitigating the risks
of unequal distributional impact of the reform across social groups and
gender. A comprehensive gender impact assessment as part of the
pension reform process could also be considered as part of a deeper
PSIA.
