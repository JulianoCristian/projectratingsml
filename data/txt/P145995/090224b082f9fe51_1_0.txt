           Economic Stabilization and Foundations for Growth (P145995)

                                      ICR REPORT


1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.     This Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) describes the
results of the Economic Stabilization and Foundations for Growth Development
Policy Loan (DPL) for Jamaica. This DPL was a stand-alone operation, put together to
quickly deliver financing to the country in a situation of high economic uncertainty. The
Loan was approved by the Bank Board of Directors on December 12, 2013, and disbursed
upon loan effectiveness on December 17, 2013. This operation, in the amount of US$130
million, was part of a package put together jointly with the IMF and the IDB in support of
Government’s efforts to implement stabilization policies and structural reforms.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

2.      The Jamaican economy has long suffered from low economic growth, which
fed into, and was aggravated by, a heavy debt burden. For the past 30 years, real per
capita GDP increased at an average of just 1 percent per annum, making Jamaica one of
the slowest growing developing countries. From outside, the country was hit by declining
export prices and natural disasters. In addition, domestic factors such as weak financial
regulation, insecurity associated with high crime, loss of competitiveness due to real
exchange rate appreciation and rising real wages, undermined economic activities. Finally,
the large share of public resources devoted to debt service reduced the fiscal space and was
an additional constraint on Jamaica’s growth.

3.      Jamaica was hit hard by the global economic crisis in 2008. Tourism and bauxite
revenues plummeted, FDI and remittances declined, and the economy contracted by
1.6 percent on average per year in 2009-2011. Unemployment rose, and the poverty level,
which was reduced from 19.9 percent to 9.9 percent in 1997-2007, climbed back to
17.8 percent in 2010. Early that year, the Government initiated a stabilization program
supported by an IMF Stand-By Arrangement, which was accompanied by a domestic debt
exchange (JDX). However, limited structural reforms derailed the Stand-By Arrangement
in 2011, halting official flows to the country, just as interest rates were turning upwards
and rescheduled payments came due. As the pace of reforms slowed, the country was
unable to secure the gains from the debt restructuring.

4.     In early 2013, Jamaica was facing a looming economic crisis. Jamaica’s debt
reached 147 percent of GDP, and it faced interest payments of about 10 percent of GDP,
forcing the Government to refinance maturing debt obligations and limiting fiscal space
for productive expenditures. Investor confidence eroded partly due to the delays in
concluding a new arrangement with the IMF. Continued macroeconomic challenges as well
as the lingering effects of Hurricane Sandy, which hit the island in October 2012,


                                             7
negatively impacted economic performance. By February 2013, the Jamaican dollar had
depreciated by 15 percent over the previous 12 months against the US dollar. Net
international reserves reached barely US$900 million (equivalent to 6 weeks of imports of
GNFS), less than half their level in 2010, and Jamaica’s ability to refinance the large debt
service payments due in that month was in doubt.

5.      To address the deteriorating situation, the Government of Jamaica (GoJ) put
together a comprehensive program of reforms that included fiscal consolidation and
a strategy to promote private sector led growth: the National Development Plan
“Vision 2030 Jamaica”, and the Medium Term Socio-Economic Policy Framework
FY2012-15. The GoJ took a number of actions that indicated commitment to its Plan. In
particular, it implemented several reforms upfront, as prior actions to a new IMF program,
and it signed an unprecedented social compact with key stakeholders who committed to
support these reforms.

                             Table 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators
                            (percent of GDP, unless otherwise indicated)




6.      To anchor its reform program, the GoJ reached agreements with the IMF, the
IDB and the World Bank. It signed an IMF Extended Fund Facility Arrangement (EFF)
for SDR 615.4 million (about US$932.3 million) for the period of April 2013 to March
2017. 2 The World Bank and the IDB supported the Government’s program, each with

                                                     8
US$510 million to be disbursed with various Bank instruments over that four years period.
As per the Country Partnership Strategy for Jamaica, 50 percent of the Bank financing
would be provided in the form of Development Policy Loans and 50 percent in form of
Investment Loans. The Development Policy Loan under review in this ICR was the first
operation under this arrangement.

7.      Together, the three multilaterals supported a wide range of structural reforms
designed to improve the fiscal stance, reduce debt, restore confidence, and build the
foundations for growth and resilience. The IMF-supported program focused on debt
restructuring, fiscal consolidation and financial sector reforms. The IDB support focused
on tax reform, including the legislation to reform the incentive system. The World Bank
DPL supported structural and institutional reforms to enhance competitiveness and
improve public sector management.

8.       Several prior actions were implemented in the run up to the IMF agreement.
Those included a second comprehensive domestic debt exchange (NDX) 3, a multi-year
wage agreement with trade unions, and an upfront new tax package that restricted the use
of discretionary tax waivers. Following the agreement, international reserve losses were
contained and the exchange rate stopped its free fall. The fiscal stance improved, and the
central government primary surplus reached 5.4 percent in FY2012/13 compared to an
average of 3.9 percent for the previous two years (Table 1). A sign of initial success was
that the financial sector did not utilize the $850 million support fund established by the
Government to bridge over that period. Jamaica successfully completed the first review of
the EFF in September 2013, as it met the economic targets and structural benchmarks of
the first stage of the IMF Program. 4

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

9.     The Program Development Objective of the DPL was to support reforms in
the areas of competitiveness and fiscal management. The Prior Actions and Key Results
Indicators of the Program are presented in Table 2.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators

10.     Neither the PDOs nor the Key Indicators were revised over the life of the Program.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

11.     The program supported implementation of policy and institutional reforms,
many of which were already ongoing, in two main areas (i) increasing competitiveness
and improving the investment climate; and (ii) improving fiscal management. In the
first area, reforms included strengthening contract enforcement, reducing delays in
obtaining construction permits, improving access to finance, and enhancing support to
MSMEs. In the fiscal area, the DPL addressed both expenditure as well as revenue issues.



                                                11
On the expenditure side, it targeted key underlying causes of the rigid expenditure patterns,
namely the large public sector wage bill, the defined benefit pension program for civil
servants that was entirely funded by the budget, and the public sector investment program,
which was not delivering growth. On the revenue side, it aimed at eliminating discretionary
tax waivers, which are distortionary and had been a substantial drain on the budget.

(i)     Investment Climate and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)

12.     The reforms supported by the operation sought to resolve key investment
climate bottlenecks faced by the private sector. To strengthen the enforcement of
contracts, the DPL supported expanding the civil jurisdiction of the lower courts to reduce
backlogs and expedite resolution of commercial disputes. To reduce red tape in the
construction industry, the DPL supported the standardization and streamlining of building
permits. In addition, the DPL supported the establishment of Credit Bureaus in Jamaica to
improve access to credit, particularly by MSMEs, which had limited access to credit due
to financial institutions’ lack of information about them.

13.     MSMEs are responsible for the majority of the employment in Jamaica.
However, they face severe constraints, including a weak enabling business environment,
limited access to finance, low skills and informality. Excessive regulatory and
administrative procedures, fees and financial requirements are a further barrier for MSMEs
and resulted in a high level of informality. To address these issues, in 2013, the GoJ put
together an MSME & Entrepreneurship Policy Framework, which included measures to
reduce bureaucracy and increase efficiency, including simplification of tax procedures, and
initiated steps to facilitate access to finance by MSMEs.

(ii) Improving Public Financial Management for Sustained Fiscal Consolidation

14.      The DPL supported fiscal consolidation by improving public financial
management and by widening the tax base. Given the tight fiscal space, it was essential
to increase efficiency in the use of public funds by improving budget management and
containing the long-term costs of large expenditure items, such as pensions and wages. In
addition, tax policy needed to be radically overhauled, and the public sector investment
program streamlined to achieve fiscal efficiency. The DPL supported several Government
initiatives already underway in Jamaica to transform and rationalize Jamaica’s public
sector, improve the management of the wage bill, and improve the budgetary process.

15.      Changes to the public pension system were needed to make the pension system
financially sustainable in the long term, as well as to bring it closer to international
standards. 5 In December 2013, the Ministry of Finance and Planning prepared a White
Paper for pension reform, which included: (i) increasing the retirement age to 65, equating
it to the National Insurance Scheme; (ii) introducing employee contributions of 5 percent
of salary; (iii) reducing accrual rates from 2.2% to 1.8% per year for new employees; and


5
  Budgetary expenditures on the public sector pension system amount to about 8 percent of primary
expenditures, and the contingent liability of the system is estimated at about 40 percent of GDP.


                                               12
(iv) replacing the final salary as a basis for calculating pensions by the average salary of
the last 5 years.

16.    Tax reforms were designed to reduce revenue leakages and increase
transparency. The widespread use of discretionary tax waivers created a non-transparent
tax regime, which favored selected sectors, distorted economic activity, and meant
foregone tax revenue. In February 2013, prior to the signing of the agreement with the IMF,
the Cabinet issued a decision curtailing discretionary tax waivers to less than 0.1 percent
of GDP, including legally binding waivers. In October 2013, the Government tabled in
Parliament three Bills designed to provide a rules based framework for granting of tax
waivers to businesses and charities. The bills were approved in December 2013.

17.      Public service reform was needed to improve efficiency of the public sector
and to reverse the growing trend of the wage bill. The Government aimed at reducing
the wage bill from 11 percent of GDP in 2012/13 to 9 percent of GDP by March 2016. 6
The measures to attain this objective included: (i) a wage freeze; (ii) reducing the size of
public sector establishment; (iii) developing strategic human resources management
function of the Government; (iv) transforming selected public entities into executive
agencies; and (v) centralizing government corporate services to benefit from economies of
scale through consolidation of selected administrative functions. The DPL supported the
first steps of this reform through the establishment of a comprehensive information base
for personnel and for functional reviews of the public sector.

18.     Improving the budget formulation process was considered essential to sustain
fiscal consolidation. The DPL supported the adoption of an interim budget calendar for
2014/2015 and a permanent budget calendar for 2015/2016 to introduce and enforce fiscal
discipline, transparency and control in the budget preparation process. In addition, it
supported migration to the Central Treasury Management System (CTMS) and the
Treasury Single Account (TSA) to improve cash management as well as financial
information availability.

19.     The public sector investment program (PSIP) was fragmented and not
transparent. Public investment planning in Jamaica was traditionally managed differently
depending on the various funding sources. 7 As a result, there was no overall view of public
investment performance and results. The DPL supported creation of a user-friendly
centralized database of investment projects, which would allow policy makers to prioritize
projects, monitor them during execution, and evaluate their results.

  This target, which is anchored in the EFF, was deferred by one year to March 2017 at the seventh review
of the IMF’s EFF: “Seventh Review Under the Arrangement Under the Extended Fund Facility and

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

21.    Overall, performance of Jamaica’s fiscal consolidation and reform program
has been on track. The government made strong fiscal consolidation efforts, and met its
primary surplus targets with 7.7 percent of GDP in 2013/14 up from 3.2 percent of GDP in
2011/12 (Table 1). The IMF completed seven reviews of the EFF to date. 8 For the first
time, with support of the DPL, the budget for FY2015/16 was presented, discussed and
approved by Parliament before the start of the fiscal year. Also for the first time, planned
revenues were presented jointly with budgeted expenditures, allowing Parliament to have
a comprehensive budget discussion, rather than doing it piecemeal as in the past. All in all
Jamaica’s performance in the last two years has been much better than in the past with the
support of the three multilateral institutions.

22.     With regard to the DPL indicators’ targets: 3 were met, 2 were met with some
delay, 2 were not met, and data on the remaining one was not available at the time of
the ICR mission (Table 3). The particular important areas of pillar 2, which is about fiscal
consolidation, were achieved: Parliament approved a tax reform to replace most sector-
based incentives by a more general and transparent incentives regime; virtually all
payments of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) were electronically processed;
and over 90 percent of public investment projects were included in an online database.
There were delays in processing the reform of the public sector pension system and in
implementing the personnel database of the MDAs. At the same time, the percentage of
total construction permits approved within 90 days actually decreased in 2014 compared
to the previous two years, thereby missing the indicator target. Still, there was substantial
progress in this area, as permit applications were harmonized across all parishes and the
required checklist was streamlined. That facilitates the application process and allows both
the authorities and users, to track permits applications in the AMANDA online system. In
addition, in December 2014, cabinet approved a 2-track system, whereby simple
applications follow a streamlined process, releasing resources to expedite processing of
commercial permits, which have a stronger impact on economic activity.

                                                that most firms are shifting to the new regime. The impact

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

23.     In early 2013, following several failures of stabilization and reform programs,
Jamaica faced an imminent fiscal crisis. Following the NDX, market financing all but
dried up, and the government had no alternative but to seek multilateral financing (IMF,
IDB, World Bank), which was tied to the adoption of a comprehensive stabilization and
reform program. At the same time, the reform program supported by the multilaterals
reflected key objectives of the government’s own National Development Plan, thereby
ensuring ownership of the program.

24.     Implementation of the DPL program was carried out jointly with the IMF and
IDB programs, thereby reinforcing the impulse for reform. The three multilaterals
shared a common view on the main factors affecting Jamaica’s economic and social
development. The three IFIs coordinated design of their programs, and jointly put forward
the required financing package.

25.     Supervision of the DPL program was facilitated by several related Bank
investment projects, and by technical assistance. The Growth and Competitiveness
project and the Public Sector Financial Management project that were implemented in
parallel with the DPL, and the Strategic Public Sector Transformation project, which was
approved by the Board in September 2014, included reforms closely related to those of the
DPL. Those projects, together with the TA provided by the Bank with DFID funds, were
instrumental for implementation of the reforms included in the DPL program, particularly
those aimed at improving management of the public sector.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Design

26.     The Ministry of Finance and Planning, which received the budgetary support,
had responsibility for the coordination, monitoring and ensuring completion of the
prior actions under the DPL. Monitoring and evaluation was to be supported by various
ministries. In addition, as mentioned above, the World Bank had an active lending program
in Jamaica in several of the areas included in the DPL, and monitoring of DPL indicators
was therefore going to be strengthened through other World Bank projects.

Implementation and Utilization

27.     Information from official sources was not always available in a timely fashion
to support supervision. That was compensated by close consultation with the IMF, which
carried out quarterly reviews of its own program, and with the IDB, which had its own
program and also followed up closely implementation of reforms in the country. At the
same time, World Bank missions helped in monitoring several of the IMF EFF’s
benchmarks, such as rationalization of the public sector investment program, whose
implementation was supported by the DPL.




                                           18
2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

28.     This stand-alone DPL was followed by a Programmatic DPL: “The First
Competitiveness and Fiscal Management Programmatic Development Policy Loan”,
approved by the Executive Board of Directors on March 12, 2015. Building on this DPL,
the programmatic DPL has a more ambitious program, expanding substantially the scope
of reforms and taking them several steps forward.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

29.     The objectives of the Economic Stabilization and Foundation for Growth DPL
were very relevant when the operation was appraised and they remain relevant to
date. The main problems of the Jamaican economy remain its weak economic growth and
the dire fiscal situation, both of which feed into and are aggravated by the heavy debt
service burden. Thus, the Program emphasis on improving the business environment to
encourage private investment and on improving public sector management and execution
of the PSIP are still very much relevant to date. Likewise with regard to reforms of the
public pension system, tax policy, and the civil service. All components of the DPL were
consistent with the Government’s priorities and reform program, which were also
supported by the IMF and IDB (paras. 6-8).

30.     As for design, the scope of the DPL program was modest as suggested by the
choice of results indicators. 11 This enabled the DPL to be used as a vehicle to deliver
quickly financial support to the country in crisis. But several of the Prior Actions and
indicators’ targets (such as the tax reform and the review/monitoring of public sector
employment) were also included in the ongoing IMF’s EFF. 12 A stronger sectoral and
social focus could have made better use of the World Bank’s comparative advantage in
those areas, particularly in a situation where the IMF and IDB were primarily focusing on
the macro-fiscal components of support.

31.    The DPL was aligned with the FY14-FY17 Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS), which was under preparation at the same time. 13 The two pillars of the DPL
matched the strategic objectives identified in the CPS, and the DPL reform program
addresses several of the key sectors contributing to CPS targets. Several Bank investment
operations were also supporting implementation of similar reforms.




11
   The performance indicators included targets for end 2014 notwithstanding the DPL closing date of 30 June
2014. This was in recognition of the longer period of time required for implementation of reforms. The DPL
team noted that the earlier closing date was chosen on specific advice of the loan department.
12
   In later stages, the EFF incorporated structural benchmarks originally included in this DPL, such as the
Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP) and the public sector employment review (IMF, 2015).

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

32.      As mentioned above, the Program Development Objective of the DPL was
twofold: to support the Government of Jamaica’s implementation of a set of policy and
institutional reforms aimed at increasing competitiveness and improving fiscal
management.

33.      Reforms aimed at improving competitiveness included a range of investment
climate related actions to remove constraints to private sector activities. The Doing
Business 2015 Report ranks Jamaica’s ease in doing business in the 58th place (out of 189
countries), up from 85 the previous year. 14 That is a substantial jump, which was due
almost totally to a major improvement in the “Getting Credit” indicator, whose ranking
rose from 125 to 12. While part of the improvement in this indicator came from
methodological changes there was also progress on the ground. Access to credit improved
particularly for first time borrowers, for whom the credit bureaus provide a credit history,
which they lacked before. However, it seems that lenders are not using the information
from the credit bureaus efficiently yet. In particular, they use that information to accept or
reject loan applications, but they do not price risk, i.e., they do not adjust the size, maturity
or interest of a loan according to the credit history of the borrower.

34.     Prior Action 3 of the DPL was “The GoJ, through the Ministry of Finance and
Planning has licensed at least one credit bureau which has begun to issue credit
reports” (Table 1). The Program Document (PD) mentions that two had been licensed and
were operational as the DPL was being prepared (PD, para. 32). 15 Thus, while the
establishment of credit bureaus contributed substantially to improve the business
environment in Jamaica, it is not clear whether there is a causal link between the DPL and
that outcome.

35.     In the past two years, public financial management improved markedly, and
there was substantial progress on fiscal consolidation. In March 2014, Parliament
amended the Financial Administration and Audit (FAA) and Public Bodies Management
and Accountability (PBMA) Acts, establishing a well-defined budget calendar. On that
basis, in March 2015, for the first time government submitted the FY2015/16 budget to
Parliament before the start of the fiscal year. Government authorities view that and the
pension reform as the main contributions of the Bank program. The DPL program
contributed also to government completion of the public sector employment database,
which had been created in January 2013. In addition, there is a new framework for
managing public sector investment projects (PSIP), and over 90 percent of investment
projects in execution are in a single electronic database. 16



14
   Because of the lag between the collection of information and its publication in the Doing Business report,
DB2015 reflects the situation in 2014 compared to 2013, which covers the period of the DPL program.
15
   The first credit bureau was licensed in March 2012 and became operational in July 2013 (Jamaica Observer,
March 12, 2014).
16
   Improving PSIP management is being supported by the Bank’s Strategic Public Sector Transformation
Project, approved in September 2014.


                                                    20
36.     Fiscal consolidation is on track. The central government primary fiscal surplus
was 7.7 percent of GDP in FY2013/14, up from 5.4 percent of GDP in FY2012/13, while
the overall budget balance was zero for the first time in many years (Table 1). That was
achieved largely by maintaining the multi-year wage freeze in the public sector. While
declining somewhat following the 2013 debt exchange, public debt is still near 140 percent
of GDP - very high compared to other emerging economies. Nevertheless, Jamaica was
able to successfully place a US$800 million Eurobond in July 2014, Jamaica’s largest bond
ever, at an interest rate of about 8 percent.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

37.     The overall outcome of the program is rated Moderately Satisfactory. As
mentioned above, the objectives of the DPL were very relevant when the operation was
prepared, and they remain relevant to date. At the same time, there were moderate
shortcomings in the operation’s achievement of its objectives, which by definition are long
term, as well as some implementation delays. However, most performance indicators
targets were either met or are expected to be met, showing progress towards achieving the
PDOs.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

38.    Poverty and social impacts of policy measures supported under this DPL were
expected to be either positive or negligible. 17 The reforms proposed in Pillar 1 were
expected to have a positive impact. Employment generation was stimulated indirectly by
improved business environment and access to credit, especially considering that MSMEs
were targeted. Improved access to finance could be particularly beneficial for women since
they make up a relatively large portion of the informal sector (57 percent) and own-account
workers (58 percent). Reforms in Pillar 2 could also have significant redistribution effects
by means of improved fiscal efficiency, leading to improved coverage and quality of public
services.

39.      The gender impact of the DPL is not straightforward. The public service
pension reform raises the retirement age of both men and women to 65 years. Women may
be more negatively impacted, since they tend to take care more of unpaid family work,
both for children and increasingly for the elderly. In order to assess the gender impact of
pension schemes, it is thus necessary to consider all mechanisms that can offset the
negative impact for women, such as care pension credits, minimum pensions and unisex
tariffs, as well as derived pension rights.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening


17
  Given the time constraints under which this operation was prepared, the PSIA focused on desk review of
secondary sources and primary research that was based on interviews with key local stakeholders and experts.


                                                    21
40.    Following previous DPLs to Jamaica, the Economic Stabilization and
Foundations for Growth DPL, together with the concurrent programs by the IMF
and IDB, contributed to strengthening of institutions in Jamaica. In particular, the tax
reform reduced discretion and enhanced transparency in the tax system, while the budget
process has markedly improved, as the 2015/16 budget was approved for the first time
before the start of the new fiscal year. In addition, public sector management would
improve by better monitoring of public sector employment, full implementation of the
CTMS, and improved planning and monitoring of the public sector investment program.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any): N/A

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops:
N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
 Rating: High

41.     The risk that development outcomes will not be maintained is rated high. The
Program Document (PD) of the DPL viewed the overall risk of achieving its objectives as
high because of three factors: (i) the fragile macroeconomic situation of the country at that
time, which reduced the Government’s flexibility to absorb unforeseen shocks, including
those resulting from natural disasters; (ii) the risk that the political commitment to the
program may weaken over time, particularly if there were no visible results soon; and (iii)
the risk that the reform agenda would overwhelm the limited implementation capacity in
the country, which was stretched thin to begin with.

42.      A year and a half later, the stabilization program remains on track and the
DPL Program made substantial progress in meeting its objectives. For the first time,
Jamaica has completed seven reviews of an IMF program in its first two years. It seems
that both the very challenging economic situation of Jamaica in 2013 and the support by
the three multilaterals gave the government the strength to pursue the reform agenda.
Moreover, many of the reforms are anchored in legislation, which increases the
probabilities that they would be maintained. However, since the risk of natural disasters
still stands, and given Jamaica’s poor performance in past reform programs, caution is
called when assessing risk looking forward. In addition, if growth were not to pick up soon,
political support for the Program may weaken. Thus, the ICR rates the risk to development
outcomes as high.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

43.     The Bank team prepared this operation under substantial time pressure.
While the scope of the DPL program was modest as suggested by the choice of results
indicators, this DPL set the stage for key structural reforms in a slow growing economy


                                             22
with a poor implementation record, and it was able to deliver urgently needed financial
support to the country in crisis. Government counterparts commented to the ICR mission
that the Bank team was very receptive to their concerns and that cooperation was good
throughout preparation and implementation of the program. Also, the Bank team
coordinated closely and effectively with the IMF and IDB. The Bank team received a
regional VPU award for the timely and innovative preparation of the DPL, as well as the
collaborative character of all team-member interactions.

44.     On the other hand, several performance indicators in the DPL have limitations
in assessing progress in the program. For example, the number of construction permits
approved within 90 days includes both residential and commercial. However, commercial
construction is the more relevant variable for economic activity. The total number of
permits was chosen as a proxy indicator, since the Ministry of Local Government does not
regularly disaggregate construction permits approved within 90 days, but it is problematic
since commercial permits are only about one-tenth of the total. Another indicator - the
number of formalized MSMEs, is beyond the control of the government, which can
improve the conditions for formalization, but cannot make it happen. Also, newly
formalized MSMEs could be either old or new enterprises, with very different impact on
employment generation. A third indicator - the tax reform - was a key element in the EFF
and where the IDB had been most active. Thus, there is no clear causality between the DPL
program and the tax reform. Finally, a stronger sectoral and social focus could have made
better use of the World Bank’s comparative advantage, particularly in a situation where the
IMF and IDB were primarily focusing on the macro-fiscal components of support.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

45.    There was one supervision mission and one ISR during the 6 months duration
of the DPL program, and in addition supervision of the DPL program was facilitated
by several related Bank investment projects, and by technical assistance. That was
adequate taking into account the duration of the program. The mission supervised jointly
the DPL and the DFID trust fund, which supported implementation of key government
reforms, including reform of the budget process, public investment management, debt
management, and strengthening of parliamentary capacity. The BTOR of the mission,
dated March 3, 2014, is concise and informative. After the mission, a separate note was
prepared on Jamaica’s credit bureaus, which describes in detail the status of the two credit
bureaus in place as well as their background and operating processes. In addition, related
Bank investment projects served as additional vehicles for supervision of specific
component, these were: The Growth and Competitiveness project and the Public Sector
Financial Management project, which were both implemented in parallel.

46.     The ISR dated April 13, 2014, reports some findings that are somewhat
different from what the ICR mission found. In the Implementation Status Overview, it
says: “Two of the target indicators have been already achieved: the number of sector-based
tax incentives is down to 1, and 100 percent of 297 public investment projects are in the
data base”. However, the ICR notes that the number of sector-based tax incentives was
reduced to 4, which in any case was the target of the indicator. It also notes that, as of April


                                              23
2015, only 91 percent of 139 public investment projects were in the database (Table 2).
The difference between the ICR and the ISR in the percentage of projects in the database
is probably due to the fact that in the past, the PSIP included various activities which were
not investment projects per se, such as maintenance works, and many entries in the PSIP
were there just by name. Meanwhile, the government “cleaned up” the database of those
activities, while it included projects executed by state owned enterprises, which were not
in the PSIP one year ago.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

47.     As per the ICR Guidelines, overall Bank performance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory for the reasons explained above.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

48.    Government performance is rated moderately satisfactory. It showed
ownership of, and commitment to, the stabilization and reform objectives, as witnessed by
the program being on track and as stated in the Fiscal Policy Paper FY2015/16. As
mentioned above, Government reforms since 2013 were supported by a broader program
to which the three multilaterals - IMF, IDB and World Bank, contribute financing; and this
DPL under review was part of this reform package. However, there were delays in
implementation of several reforms, resulting in moderate shortcoming in meeting some
performance indicator targets (Table 2). In addition, the government did not monitor
progress for all targets, as evidenced for example by the lack of data on the lower court
cases.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: N/A, as the program was implemented by the Government.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

49.     As per the ICR guidelines, the overall borrower performance is rated moderately
satisfactory for the reasons explained above.

6. Lessons Learned

50.    The DPL program was designed at a time when Jamaica was facing a looming
financing crisis and required a rapid response on the part of the Bank and other IFIs. After
lengthy negotiations, the IMF led the way, followed by programs by the Bank and IDB.
Several lessons emerge from that process:

A. General

   1. Coordination with other multilaterals enhances the impact of Bank
      operations. That lesson applies both to preparation as well as to supervision, since
      each institution has comparative advantages in different areas, all of which are
      essential for a comprehensive reform program.

   2. Building on that coordination with the IFIs, a Bank program could stress
      social sector and infrastructure areas, where it has particular expertise, rather
      than replicate reforms that are already included in the other IFIs programs.

   3. The use of technical assistance and/or investment lending to bolster capacity
      and accompany implementation of a DPL is essential for achieving
      development objectives. The TA provided under the DFID trust fund on public
      sector management and the Bank’s investment projects were instrumental for
      implementation of the DPL program.

B. Specific

   1. It is possible to successfully address a crisis situation in a country through a
      concerted effort of multilateral institutions in support of a committed
      government. The financing package put together by the IFIs, with Bank’s
      participation, helped the country overcome the crisis and restore investors’
      confidence. The fact that Jamaica was able to issue a US$800 million sovereign
      bond in mid-2014 is evidence of this success.

   2. A stand-alone operation was the best available tool to quickly deliver urgently
      needed financial support to Jamaica in 2013, at a time of high economic uncertainty.
      However, the Bank may want to look for an alternative tool designed specifically
      to deliver financing to countries in crisis, where targets and indicators are short-
      term in nature and light in preparation, to further expedite delivery of support to
      clients.

   3. Objectives and performance indicators need to be realistic and subject to clear
      and straightforward monitoring. Indicators need to be easily attributable to
      government actions and not depend on exogenous factors. If these conditions are
      not satisfied, tracking progress in achieving the objectives could be difficult.
