Decentralization\n            and Improvement of Secondary Education and Polymodal\n            Education Development Project are to: 1) strengthen\n            institutional capacity in the Provincial Ministries of\n            Education (PMEs) under a decentralized framework; 2)\n            increase the quality and efficiency of secondary education\n            in the selected PMEs; and 3) increase/improve physical\n            capacity to serve the secondary school-aged population more\n            effectively. The project consists of the three major\n            components. The first component is institutional\n            strengthening, which comprises four subcomponents: (1)\n            improvement of educational administration; (2) development\n            of Management Information Systems (MIS); (3) development of\n            a Education Quality Evaluation Systems (EQUES); and (4)\n            training of management and administrative staff. The second\n            component is educational quality improvement which consists\n            of five main subcomponents: (1) textbooks and teaching\n            materials; (2) staff training in education quality\n            improvement; (3) curriculum development; (4) school\n            management; and (5) school-based grants. Finally, the last\n            component is infrastructure improvement, which includes the\n            following subcomponents: (1) rehabilitation/maintenance; (2)\n            substitutions and extensions; and (3) new constructions."}, "docdt": "1995-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
