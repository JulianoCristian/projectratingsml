will\n            support Mexico's strategy to expand non-petroleum\n            exports. The project will have four components: (i)\n            expansion of the US$100 million Export Development Fund\n            established recently under the amended Capital Goods\n            Industries Development (R83-71 dated March 28, 1983); this\n            fund will provide urgently needed foreign exchange not\n            presently available to Mexican exporters from commercial\n            sources for importing inputs required by exporters; (ii)\n            credit for fixed investments required by exporters; (iii)\n            technical assistance and training to exporters for improved\n            production and more effective marketing; and (iv) technical\n            assistance to project implementing agencies for studies to\n            improve the Government's export development strategy\n            and for institutional strengthening. An estimated 400-600\n            exporters are likely to benefit from working capital finance\n            and 120-150 firms from credits for fixed investments under\n            the project. The annual export plans of these firms are\n            expected to account for between one-quarter and one-third of\n            Mexico's annual non-oil export earnings."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
