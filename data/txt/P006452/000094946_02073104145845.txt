MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Performance Assessment Repbrt on Brazil
Innovations in Basic Education Project (Loan 3375-BR)
Second Northeast Basic Education Project (Loan 3604-BR)
Third Northeast Basic Education Project (Loan 3663-BR)
School Improvement Project-FUNDESCOLA I (Loan 3375-BR)
This is a Performance Assessment Report (PAR) on four education projects in Brazil:
*  Innovations in Basic Educationt Project (Loan 33 75-BR) for US$245 million, which was
approved in FY9 1. The loan was extended by one year and closed on April 3, 1999.
*  Second Northteast Basic Education Project (Loan 3604-BR) for US$212 million, which was
approved in FY93. The loan was extended by one year and closed on June 30, 1999.
*   Third Northeast Basic Education Project (Loan 3663-BR) for US$206.6 million, which
was approved in FY93. The loan was extended by one year and closed on December 31,
1999.
*  School Improvement Project-FUNDESCOLA I (Loan 4311-BR) for US$62.5 million,
which was approved in FY99. The loan closed as scheduled-on June 30, 2001 and disbursed
completely.
The Bank's human resource development strategy for Brazil was relevant to its economic
needs, as perceived in each period, and the objectives of the projects have been relevant to the
economic needs of the country. But though the strategy (focusing on management improvement
at various levels) was necessary, it was not sufficient for alleviating poverty through education.
The Bank missed opportunities to enunciate classroom efficiency standards when it developed the
minimum operational standards for schools and to help state secretaries enforce them. The
relevance and efficiency of the Innovations and Northeast Brazil projects were modest; that of the
Fundescola project, which focused more on schools, is rated substantial, but this project served
few rural areas, and its poverty alleviation effect was limited.
The outcome of the Fundescola project is rated satisfactory. The outcomes of the
Innovations of Basic Education and Northeast Basic Education (NEBE) projects are rated
moderately satisfactory because project objectives were only partly achieved. The projects
exceeded or surpassed most targets for physical inputs and training but it is not clear that the
(vaguely worded) learning goals were met. The objectives of the two NEBE projects were
focused towards central management improvements, and these had little or no impact on quality
improvement. Due to design shortcomings, Bank performance for these two projects is rated
unsatisfactory. Bank performance for the Fundescola project, which was designed to target
schools, was satisfactory. Borrower performance is rated satisfactory for all but the Innovations
in Education project.



2
Overall, the Bank has promoted efficiency in various management levels, from state
secretariats to school-based management, but has not yet promoted effective actions to make
classroom instruction more efficient. Specific efficiency goals (e.g. spending 75 percent of class
time on actual learning activities) could become a part of the minimum operational standards.
Lessons
Experience with the projects confirms a number of OED lessons from education projects:
*  Attention to state, municipal, or even school management is necessary but is not
sufficient for improving classroom instruction effectiveness and efficiency. Attention
must also be paid to how the precious classroom time is used.
*  States and municipalities that are better off are more likely to take advantage of Bank-
financed resources. The challenge is to encourage the poorer ones to benefit as well.
*  Decentralizing school management to the municipal level is not a panacea. Autonomy
permits the poorest or least knowledgeable municipalities to fall behind, without much
possibility for helping their residents.
*  In addition to achievement tests, classroom observations may be used as predictors of
achievement. Unless there is after-hours coaching, children's knowledge is likely to
reflect information processing in classrooms. Classroom observations can potentially
provide feedback and promote improvements sooner than achievement tests, which must
first be developed, administered, and analyzed.
*  Students' health needs and problems must be addressed to optimize cognitive
development and classroom learning, requiring closer inter-agency coordination.

OED Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.
About this Report
The Operations Evaluation Department assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two
purposes: first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is
producing the expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through
the dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, OED annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lending operations. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are
innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons. The projects, topics, and analytical approaches selected for assessment support larger evaluation
studies.
A Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the Implementation Completion
Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
PPARs, OED staff examine project files and other documents, interview operational staff, and in most cases visit
the borrowing country for onsite discussions with project staff and beneficiaries. The PPAR thereby seeks to
validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
OED studies.
Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED management approval. Once cleared intemally, the
PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then
sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.
About the OED Rating System
The time-tested evaluation methods used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
The methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
sectoral approach. OED evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following is
the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the OED website:
http:l/worldbank.org/oedleta-mainpage.html).
Relevance of Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's
current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible. This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
Sustainability: The resilience to risk of net benefits flows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
Institutional Development Impact: The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or region
to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictability of institutional arrangements and/or (b)
better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate, which derives from these
institutional arrangements. Institutional Development Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
project. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
supported implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
achievement of development objectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) covers the four most recently
completed education projects in Brazil:
*  Innovations in Basic Education Project (Loan 33 75-BR) for US$245 million, which was
approved in FY91. The loan was extended by one year and closed on April 3, 1999.
*  Second Northteast Basic Education Project (Loan 3604-BR) for US$212 million, which was
approved in FY93. The loan was extended by one year and closed on June 30, 1999.
*   Third Northeast Basic Education Project (Loan 3663-BR) for US$206.6 million, which
was approved in FY93. The loan was extended by one year and closed on December 31,
1999.
*  School Improvement Project-FUNDESCOLA I(Loan 43 11-BR) for US$62.5 million,
which was approved in FY99. The loan closed as scheduled on June 30, 2001 and disbursed
completely.
The assessments were conducted to study the effectiveness of Bank strategy in some
extremely poor areas of the country with complex cultural and economic problems.
The PPAR is based on the following sources: Project or Implementation Completion Reports
(ICRs), Staff Appraisal Reports (SARs), Credit Agreements for the projects, and project files,
particularly the supervision reports. An OED mission visited Brazil in February-March 2002 to
collect other pertinent information. The author thanks the government officials who received the
mission for their extensive cooperation. Thanks are also given to the country office staff who
helped the mission.
Following standard OED procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the relevant
government officials and agencies for their review and comments, but none were received.






1.      Background
1.1     Brazil is working hard to equalize opportunities for its citizens, because historical factors
have created very inequitable distributions of wealth.' The income of the top fifth of the
population is 25.5 times higher than that of the bottom fifth. Inevitably, education has a similar
distribution. Public spending on primary education was only US$250 per capita in 1995, low for a
country with Brazil's per capita income.2 Inequity is particularly acute in the northeastern states,
where public spending on education amounted only to US$30 per capita up to 1995. As a result,
middle- class families send their children to private schools, until secondary or higher education,
when these with the highest scores attend public universities.
1.2     The inequitable distribution of govemment resources to schools has created problems,
which Bank projects of the 1980s and 1990s attempted to remedy. Primary education is almost
universal in Brazil,3 but only 51 percent of the students finishing 4th and 8th grade in 1995 could
do math wvork at their grade levels.4 Low quality of education results in high repetition rate in
poorer areas, dropout and subsequent low earnings as a result of limited schooling.5 Instructional
effectiveness and resources are at least partly to blame. Of the 69,300 primary school teachers
who had not finished even primary school, 47,000 or 67.8 percent were in the northeast in 1995,
96 percent of them in villages. Salaries as low as US$30 (20 percent of the national average)6
meant that villages were unable to hire more qualified teachers. Textbooks were rare, and classes
covered only 60 to 70 percent of the curriculum.7 Teacher training (often through lectures) or
mere salary increases had no impact on student achievement.8 Despite known benefits, preschool
attendance was low.9 Due to the complexities of state and municipal autonomy regulations, only
12 percent of the earmarked funds could be transferred to beneficiaries. As discussed below, the
efforts were met with partial success, and the Bank has searched for different intervention
designs.

2. Brazil: Structural Reform and Sector Policies. Report no. 13913-BR, June 30, 1995. In higher education public
spending is excessive, US$6000 per student, almost twice the cost of the best private universities (p. 52, 53).
3. Overall gross enrollment rate was 120% and net enrollment rate was 90% in 1998; repetition was 38.2% and dropout
21.2% in the Northeast in 1995. (School census data produced by the Fundescola project implementation unit, March
2002).

Development Department. Preschool attendance had a positive and significant impact on the average years of
schooling ultimately attained and reduces repetition by 3-5%. One additional year of preschool increases schooling
attained by about half a year. Possibly the gain is higher for children of illiterate parents. Though malnutrition is the
most deleterious during the early years, only 13% of the school feeding budget was targeted to children 0-6 years.

1.3    In 1995, Joao Santos, a desperate fifth grader from a rural school of the northeastern state
of Ceara, wrote a letter to the regional director complaining that his teacher was teaching very
little during class and expressing his fears that he would fail another year. In that year, a new
government renewed its commitment to education and brought about wide-ranging administrative
changes to increase education financing in the Northeast. Joao's letter has been the basis for 13
diagnostic studies and a sector study, "Call to Action" ("Chamada a Acao") to improve the
schools for the Brazilian poor.'" Education of the disadvantaged became a comerstone of the
poverty alleviation strategy of Brazil," and the studies formed the basis for a new generation of
projects.
1.4     The studies offered specific recommendations for use in designing future interventions.
One of them, involving classroom observations in 94 schools of Ceara and Bahia, pinpointed the
instructional problems with considerable specificity.'2 Use of time ("time on task"), classroom
organization, and opportunities to learn were closely related to early reading perfornance.
Teachers rarely used textbooks in class. They mainly gave writing exercises, such as copying
from the blackboard, dictation, and mimeographed sheets. These routine tasks also became more
frequent in the third and fourth hour of school, as teachers spent class time grading papers. The
classes that did more copying and other routine work had lower reading scores than classes doing
more reading and student-generated materials. School duration was actually three hours rather
than four.'3 Time on task was more important for raising the achievement of boys, who often end
up less educated and vulnerable to violent deaths.'4 Class size did not make a difference, but the
teacher's general education did. So did preschool attendance. The research also showed that the
average educational level of the community mattered more than the teachers' educational level,
but that the home environment accounted for only 10 percent of the reading achievement
variance; poor instruction mattered more. By grade 2, achievement levels were higher in state
than in municipal schools. Clearly, the important variables that determine achievement were
found to be in principle under government control; the challenge was and is how to overcome
institutional obstacles and complexities and teach the poor information that they can retain and
use.
1.5     The World Bank's involvement in Brazilian education has been extensive, both before
and after the "Call to Action." Since 1971, the Bank has financed 19 education projects, totaling
US$1.941 billion, of which 13 have been completed (Annex B Table 1). The main focus has been
primary education, but also on science and technology. In February-March 2002, an Operations
Evaluation Department mission assessed the outcomes of four primary education projects that
were implemented during the 1 990s. The review was based on the Staff Appraisal Reports,'5
Project Completion Reports (for older projects), and Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs),

Other Donor Activities
1.6   The World Bank is the main donor in Brazil for primary education. The Interamerican
Development Bank (IADB) invests in secondary, higher, vocational, and early childhood
education and spans various social agencies aside from the Ministry of Education. The World
Bank and IADB complement each other in their distribution of sectoral activities. However,
according to Ministry of Finance officials, there has been little coordination between the two
donors. Officials describe the procedures of LADB as more flexible, requiring fewer covenants
and conditions, with procurement standards closer to those of the government. On the other hand,
IADB task managers are reportedly present less often in the field, and the World Bank is seen as
offering more valuable sectoral advice.

2. Objectives and Implementation of the Assessed Projects
2.1     During the 1990s, the World Bank financed six primary education projects, of which four
have been completed and are the subject of this report. The primary focus of these projects was
quality improvement, rather than expansion of the system; primary education has in principle
been universalized, and the birth rate has dropped steadily in Brazil. The projects sought to
improve leaming conditions in existing schools, decrease the dropout and repetition rates, and
keep students in school on grade level. The guiding principle was that if management and
financing improvements were made in the system, leaming improvements would follow. (Table
1).

outcomes as objectives, and these were clearly not met. However, the SARs describe them as goals (pp. 12 and 13
respectively), to be met through improvements in management, educational materials, and training. This report follows
the latter definition.

2.2    All four projects initially faced procurement difficulties and implementation delays but
were eventually completed, and most activities were carried out
Innovations in Basic Education Project (Loan 3375-BR)
2.3    It took about four years to prepare this project and over seven years (1992-1999) to
implement this project, which focused on the state of Sao Paulo. The delays were due to
counterpart fund timing difficulties, which plagued all Bank projects until 1995. Donor fund
disbursements required congress approval; this was often given in October and funds had to be
spent by December. By 1995, only 15 percent of the loan had disbursed, and the Bank considered
canceling it. However, in 1995 a new State Secretary took over, who was keenly interested in
seeing the project through and was chiefly responsible for its completion. (See Annex A, Table I
for details).
2.4    The project introduced interventions that were subsequently widely used in Brazil.
About 60 percent of the loan proceeds were spent on civil works to refurbish schools in the
poorer areas of the state and bring them up to minimum operational standards (which included
textbooks, instructional materials, and computers for grades 5-8). Over 100,000 teachers of state
schools were trained on various curricular issues, and many received university education. Also,
schools carried out needs assessments and deliberations similar to those later used in the
Fundescola projects. By expanding planning activities and computerization, the Secretaria
became able to follow individual students and cleaned its rolls of multiple enrollments that
overestimated school population by 200,000. The project also helped develop the SARESP
(Sistema de Avaliacao do Rendimento Escolar de Sao Paulo), a criterion-referenced test that is
regularly administered in all schools to monitor school perfomnance. Acceleration and
recuperation classes were set up in many schools to enable overage and weak students to catch
up. Students in lower grades were separated from students in higher grades. A longer school day
(of five hours) was established, an intervention that was shown to raise student scores according
to a 1996 impact evaluation.'7 A number of schools were handed over to municipalities (a
process that continues), where parents and local officials may have closer quality control.
2.5    Other activities were not as successful. Emphasis was on providing diverse classroom
materials, not necessarily on reading them. Preschool education was not expanded as expected,
and the NGOs that would have been partners to this effort were found to have limited interest and
capacity. Prefects who were to receive new buildings for preschool education often made
requests for high-cost structures, which the implementation unit rejected. Very few of the
contemplated health interventions took place, partly because collaboration with the health
secretariat proved difficult.
Northeast Brazil II and Northeast Brazil III Projects (Loans 3604-BR and 3663-BR)
2.6    The two projects aimed at increasing student learning and graduation rates, while
reducing repetition and dropout (Table 1). Each project targeted a group of northeastern states
with the same components. The govemment implemented them as one project, often referred to
17. The evaluation was held before the project closed. Schools with good standards (that were, however, better
schools) and a longer school day had higher scores. (Neubauer, Rose, Claudia Davis, and Yara Lucia Esposito.

as NEBE (Northeast Basic Education Project). Learning was to increase through improving the
management of state secretariats of education and the physical environment of schools. The
Bank hypothesized that if state-level management became more financially efficient and if
educational materials and facilities were provided, the quality of education would improve.'8 Thus
the projects mainly financed construction and repairs for about 26,000 classrooms (about 49
percent of project costs), textbooks and materials (about 30 percent of project costs), training (7
percent of project costs.) and management studies (5 percent). A federal-level component (9
percent of costs) created a sample-based achievement testing system (Sistema Nacional de
Avaliacao da Educacao Basica - SAEB), pilot-tested a multigrade methodology (called escola
ativa), mass-produced textbooks, and developed a management information system. (Annex A,
Table I for details).
2.7     Similar objectives had been pursued earlier in the first Northeast Brazil project, with
ambiguous results.'9 Lessons were not sufficiently taken into account, either from the first
northeast Brazil or the Innovations project. The design of the NEBE II and III projects proved
very complex, as they tried to address simultaneously many of the education problems of the NE
with a broad coverage. They involved federal, state, and municipal levels of govemments and
nine states, each with its own political priorities and constraints. Initially, the projects' financing
system ignored the fact that municipalities were autonomous, and put states in charge of
implementing in areas where they had no responsibility. In some respects, the projects focused
on paperwork rather than on students. The states were required to do complicated management
studies and calculate annual management efficiency ratios and targets for staff, materials and
textbooks per student as a condition for getting funds for school construction. The Ministry of
Education unit in charge of bringing this work about was situated at a relatively low
administrative level and had limited authority. At the same time, the project had no clear
academic indicators or monitoring mechanisms beyond management efficiency targets.
2.8     As might be expected, quality at entry was unsatisfactory, and the NEBE project faced
severe delays for the first two years. (Total implementation took eight years.) The archives show
much correspondence inquiring about planning exercises in various states, hiring of consultants
and computer firms to calculate the management efficiency targets, transfer of raw records to
Brasilia to carry out this work. Municipalities were often unresponsive to the proposed
leadership of states, sometimes because of political differences. Due to financing rules,20
counterpart funds for school construction in the poorer northeast became higher than those
required for other states. The states of Maranhao, Piaui, Alagoas, and Pernambuco had particular
difficulty implementing their share of the project. NEBE was simplified in 1995, when a new
govemment renewed interest in education, and municipalities were able to get funds directly from
the federal government. A semi-autonomous project implementation unit was formed, with full-
18. Inappropriate teaching strategies are discussed in para. 1.31 (p. 9), but the teacher training component does not
prescribe specific remedies (p. 26; Staff Appraisal Report. Brazil: Second Northeast Basic Education Project, Report
no. 11298-BR, April 20, 1993). Similarly, see project description, p. 13-16 (Staff Appraisal Report. Brazil: Third
Northeast Basic Education Project, Report no. 11959-BR, October 29, 1993).
19. The Northeast Brazil project (Ln. 1867BR; 1980-88) built schools in 400 municipal units and attempted to improve
learning outcomes for 800,000 students. The audit report rated the project outcomes satisfactory but found that
instruction did not improve, and teacher salaries remained low; financing was also complicated. (Brazil. Northeast
Basic Education Project (Ln. 1867-BR) Performance Audit Report. No. 13242. World Bank 1994, p. 4-6; Brazil.
Northeast Basic Education Project (Ln. 1867-BR. Project Completion Report. No. 8266. World Bank 1989). An
impact evaluation corroborated findings (Educational performance of the poor: Lessons from rural northeast Brazil,
March 1992, Report No. 10881).

time staff for the work. Eventually, numerical output targets were met in terms of school
construction, large-scale textbook distribution, and large-scale teacher training (Annex A, table
2). A school census and management information system were developed and adopted by most
states, which made it-possible to get some student-level statistics. Large-scale teacher training
took place in a standardized system of lectures, but its impact was unknown. Project outputs were
scattered through a large number of schools, with some getting just paint, others teacher training.
Often funds went to those agencies that best knew how to take advantage of them; the poorest
municipalities had little understanding, or perhaps, interest in applying for project benefits, so the
poorest of the poor students probably got few if any benefits.
2.9    Due to increased government attention to the education of the poor, impressive changes
took place in the Northeast between 1996 and 2000; net enrollment rates in grades 1-8 increased
from 77.3 percent to 92.8 percent, the highest increment within the country. During the same
period, the promotion rate in the Northeast increased from 61.8 percent to 68 percent, while
dropout rates decreased from 21.2 percent to 18 percent.2' Project-level data are limited, but
improvement in dropout and repetition approximated that of state averages (See state averages in
Table 2). A target of 5 percent in dropout rates was met by six of the nine states, but a 10 percent
reduction in repetition was achieved only by one state (Annex A Table 2). A four-year study
cycle now gives students four years to learn basic reading without repeating years. Also, some
municipalities and states (e.g. Ceara) instituted automatic promotion policies, so children may
have attained higher grades due to these policies rather than increased learning. Thus, students
who earlier were seen as failing are now considered as learning within allotted time limits.
Nevertheless, it is unknown how the poor areas reached by the projects would have performed
without project inputs.

2.10    Project impact on learning not be substantiated, because there were no baseline data on
project beneficiaries. 22 However, testing issues also made comparisons difficult. SAEB test
content was altered, and many states showed small improvements or even decreases in
performance of all students between 1995 and 1997.23 Overall, project effects are confounded
with the important political developments in the country. In 1995, Brazil mandated training of
unqualified teachers, financing for municipalities, and school lunches for the poor. Since then,
the country has also enjoyed political and financial stability. The federal-level components of the

project, which supported these policies (large-scale textbook delivery and development of a
national testing service) were successfully implemented. As a result, textbooks now reach almost
all schools, and basic-education students use them free of charge.
School Improvement Project-FUNDESCOLA I (Loan 4311-BR)
2.11   Fundescola was designed to deal with some of the difficulties faced by the NEBE
projects as well as with the recommendations of the "Call to Action." The design evolved in two
important aspects: (a) integrating areas of state and municipal authorities and (b) focusing on
school-based management and strengthening. To reduce the complexities of state vs. municipal
financing, the management information system data available through the NEBE projects was to
establish microregions of intervention. These consist of densely populated urban areas
(ultimately established through legislation) along with associated periurban and rural areas, and
include state as well as municipal schools served by the agencies that operate in the microregion.
Thus, it was possible to concentrate multiple inputs and resources to a small number of schools
rather than disperse resources in a large number of schools and serve municipal schools directly.
Given the expense of reaching the sparsely populated rural areas, it was considered the best
possible design. The project was the first phase of program that will last 10 years. When 50
percent of the funds are disbursed and 75 percent committed, the second project starts, which
operates on a different group of schools, municipalities and states. Fundescola I implemented in
the north and central states, while the ongoing Fundescola II includes the Northeast (See Annex
A, Table 3 for details). In some respects, it expects to show the states how much school
performance can improve if multiple inputs are concentrated on a school that has strengthened
school-based management. The expectation is that states and municipalities may adopt this
school management model.
2.12   The schools chosen for resource transfer in the selected microregions are larger, with
over 200 and possibly better. (The follow-on project targets schools of over 100 students). The
project was designed to improve efficiency of resource delivery and decrease inequity within a
microregion. Its purpose is not to decrease inequity overall; in effect, it increases inequity
between project and non-project schools. (Equity may increase in the future if the local
governments adopt and expand the project design.) Part of the improved resources to schools
consists of repairs to attain minimum operating standards for schools (which also apply to all
schools in the country). Funds were also distributed to schools, and their use was audited on a
sample basis. Parental involvement is a key ingredient of the program. Small rural schools with
multigrade classrooms are attended to through the escola ativa program, which involves teacher
training, special instructional materials to enable students to form groups and partly study on their
own. Fundescola I operated 178 such rural schools, the follow-on project has thus far expanded
the number to a total of about 1225 schools in 19 states, ultimately benefiting 42,719 students
and 1,838 teachers.
2.13   The Fundescola I schools are asked to carry out an educational development program
(Plano de Desenvolvimento da Escola -PDE), during which they assess their needs and the
deficiencies of the school and students through an extensive and complex questionnaire. To
improve school performance, they must request materials and resources through a Projeto de
Melhoria da Escola (PME). The development process has been very popular, serving 1,724
schools rather than the planned 401 and cost US$11.5 million rather than the planned US$5.2
million. Five states (Acre, Mato Grosso, Goias, Tocantins, and Ceara) have adopted this plan as a
model for all schools.
2.14   Schools with and without PDE were compared through SAEB scores in mathematics and
Portuguese, and small but significant performance increases were found for schools with PDE.



10
Perhaps the PDE effects are partly due to parental tendency to send their children to these
schools, since the schools participating in Fundescola tend to be larger, better, and more likely to
have good results. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the effect was small. A more extensive
evaluation of 400 schools is underway. 24
Observations of Classroom Events in Project Areas
2.15   To assess project effects empirically, the OED mission visited state secretariat offices and
schools: (a) For the Innovations in Basic Education Project, eight schools in the state of Sao
Paulo, two of which were municipal; four were in outlying and poor municipalities largely
populated by migrants from the northeast. (b) For the NEBE project, 21 periurban and rural
(albeit not remote) schools in Ceara, Rio Grande de Norte, and Alagoas. (c) For Fundescola I,
five schools in the state of Goias, a state ranking in the top 10 states of math SAEB scores in
1999. The mission also visited eight schools in the northeast that participated in the Fundescola
II project, whose design is the same as that of Fundescola I. Almost all the schools visited had
received some benefit from the projects, either in terms of physical inputs or in teacher training.
Schools were chosen randomly from those located at distance that the mission could visit from a
state capital. (See Annex B for more detail for methodology and conclusions.) Observations
were (Annex C for more details):
2.16   Physically, most schools were in very good condition. Most were attractive and clean,
with the necessary space for materials and gatherings. So, the prerequisite attractive and physical
environment that is conducive to learning has been fulfilled.
2.17   Textbooks and instructional materials were present in most schools. The larger
periurban schools in the Northeast had books as well as audiovisual equipment, but rural and
semi-rural schools did not have enough textbooks for each student. Audiovisual equipment was
minimal and/or broken down. Most Sao Paulo schools reported having received instructional
materials, including mathematical games and art history panels. However, textbooks were
sometimes unavailable to the students or not used. Some of the more populous Sao Paulo
schools reported having a smaller number of textbooks than students, and thus kept the textbooks
in class rather than hand them out to students for the duration of the year. For various reasons,
some schools had still not handed textbooks out, one month after classes had started.
2.18   All teachers were reportedly qualified to teach. According to teacher and principal
reports, all teachers had at least secondary-level education. There is continuous training, and
teachers state that they find it useful. There was evidence of lesson planning, and material written
on the blackboard.
2.19   Some innovative measures have been implemented to improve learning. These
include accelerated classes for overaged children, adult literacy for parents and recuperation
classes for students falling behind (in Sao Paulo). However, these measures do not exist in many
Northeast schools.
2.20   However, in the schools observed, the classroom problems cited in earlier research and
"Call to Action" were evident. The teachers still do not use class time efficiently because of:
24. Initial draft of degree of implementation report. Paper presented to the American Educational Research Association
conference in New Orleans on March 11, 2002.

2.21   Unoccupied students in class. Often a teacher worked with one or two students while
the remaining students did nothing. Sometimes class work started late or ended earlier, with
students unoccupied during the first and last 5-10 minutes. Several classes were found without
teachers, with students either unattended or being partly attended by substitute teachers. On other
occasions the students had been sent home. The unattended classes were noisy and possibly
disturbing other classes. Principals reported that absenteeism is frequent, since teachers have a
right to a certain number of absences.: Also, teachers leave classes unattended to take training.
Reportedly, the frequent absence of teachers is one reason why curricula are not being completed.
Several schools in the Northeast said they cannot hire substitute teachers. Though the schools of
Sao Paulo can hire one, often there are more than one teacher absent.
2.22   Copying. Students in all states and all levels were observed copying extensively from the
blackboard. The older students copied because they had no textbooks. The younger ones often
copied a series of questions requiring brief answers (an activity that teachers described as 'text
production'). Acceleration classes to help overage students to catch up also included extensive
copying. When teachers were asked why such work was not assigned as homework (assuming it
fulfilled specific objectives), they often responded that the parents were too poor to monitor
students' homework, and there was no point in assigning any. The copying and laborious
production of short answers also seemed to be boring and unchallenging work.
2.23   Spending much class time in art and play. Particularly in Sao Paulo, classes were
repeatedly observed cutting up and pasting materials to help learn reading, and the mission was
shown workbooks with elaborate drawings and collages. However, these activities seemed to
take up much of class time that would have been devoted to actual reading practice and
attainment of basic skills. For example, students in remedial classes spend many hours of cutting
up and pasting articles in workbooks. The rationale given by teachers was that children
presumably need to construct the world from their own experience, so they must learn to read
from regular print and through primitive writing. Instead of using textbooks for grade 1, teachers
in periurban Sao Paulo schools taught reading through children's story books and magazines.
Though such activities may be pleasant and beneficial in the long run, they consume much class
time of students who are at a risk of early dropout.
2.24   Many students could not read. Overall, copying and art were observed in 34-47
percent of classes visited (Table 3). Limited time on task may be one of the reasons why most
students in the Northeast who were asked to read could not read aloud fluently until grade 5 and
could not calculate well. Students in multigrade classrooms (escolas ativas) of the Northeast
were particularly weak and could not read well enough to carry out the independent work
required of them. Some students in grade 2 were observed playing with letters while unable to
read the beginning of the grade I textbook. Though most students who were asked to read in
downtown Sao Paulo schools did so, the children in migrant periurban municipalities also could
not read fluently until grade 4. The low performing classes had many reading materials, but it was
unlikely that students would benefit from them if they did not know how to read. Though it was
not possible to attribute the skills level to the project or to compare NEBE with non-NEBE
schools in this aspect, SAEB scores and student flow rates bear witness of the overall low student
performance of the Northeast and point to the need for direct learning-oriented interventions.
2.25   Repeatedly, teachers attributed the students' low reading performance to family poverty.
Overall, principals and teachers reported satisfaction with the quality of work they were doing,
though several said that they did not have enough time in a school year to complete the
curriculum. Two Sao Paulo state schools reported that their SARESP test scores were above
average, although in both cases the scores reflected that students were achieving on the average
only half the objectives. In periurban Sao Paulo, however, teachers declared themselves unable to



12
deal with all the problems of the students, who live in very poor conditions and study in
overcrowded classes. Yet, the schools were not able to get extra help (such as tutoring) for
students who are falling behind in the early grades.
2.26   Some children were small and listless. Visibly, many students in the rural northeast
were smaller than children seen in Sao Paulo and Goias, and seemed less active. Perhaps some
lack basic vitamins and micronutrients that may help maintain attention in class, or have had
infections and violence incidents that have been shown to damage cognitive processing.25 The
effects of these factors on school performance are receiving increasing attention in the
educational literature.
2.27   Goias classrooms seemed more efficient. The Goias schools that had implemented
Fundescola I were well organized, and nearly all classes were observed engaged in learning work
(Annex table 3). All students who were asked to read, even in grade 1, did so relatively fluently.
Students in the one escola ativa visited were carrying out the instructional tasks as expected and
were articulate about the work they were doing. The state of Goias has devoted a lot of resources
towards achieving the minimum operational standards for schools and carrying out school
development projects. A large number of supervisors and trainers is available to follow up on
trainees; for example, there are part-time trainers, each responsible for following up on project
actions with five schools. The mission did not observe much time wastage in class but, according
to a local director the problem had been endemic. About four years earlier, the state made a study
and found out that four hours were reduced into two and that teachers spent most of the time
copying from blackboard. Actions were taken to improve time on task through inservice teacher
training, supervision, and follow-up.

suboptimal)
Note: some schools visited did not have classes at the time
2.28   All teachers and principals in the Northeast who were asked agreed that Fundescola's
school development process (PDE) was an excellent opportunity, and that their school was better
off as a result. Some found out that they needed training in mathematics, methodology, or in
computers. They had decided they needed audiovisual equipment (all eight schools) and
computers (four schools). However, the classes of these schools had limited instructional
activities, and most students who were asked to read could not do so. Arguably, PDE has been in
operation in the northeast only since 2000, and benefits might take longer to appear in schools.
However, it was unclear how basic reading and math skills would improve through audiovisual
equipment. One might have expected the schools requesting tutors for students who have fallen
behind, such as secondary school students who would help for a nominal amount. But only one
school in Fortaleza expressed an interest in such a program. (At any rate, tutors might not be an
eligible expenditure item under the project.) It is possible that the school development process
questionnaire unwittingly guides teachers to consider systemic school problems rather than their
own wasteful classroom practices. In a Fundescola training session of 120 principals, some
raised the issue of the questionnaire's complexity and vagueness, although recognized its
relevance.
2.29   State staff had positive opinions regarding project effectiveness. The OED mission
held meetings with project implementation unit staff as well as state teams in charge of
implementing the projects and asked a series of questions regarding benefits, challenges, and
outcomes. Overall, staff expressed favorable opinions regarding project effects (Annex B, Table
2). Though the management studies of the NEBE projects were deemed onerous, staff believe
that they forced some accountability, transparency, learning about computers, and awareness of
the availability of educational information and data. Microplanning data were seen as a useful
tool to reduce politically motivated decisions. School buildings were viewed as very positive



14
contributions, which children cherish. Difficulties and problems included implementation of
instructional components, lack of local-resources, complexity of the tasks, and difficulty in
including the poorer municipalities. Overall, staff thought that the states visited are much better
off having executed the project than if they had not.
3. Ratings
3.1     Strictly speaking, the Bank's human resource development strategy for Brazil was
relevant to its economic needs, as perceived in each period, and the objectives of the projects
have been relevant to the economic needs of the country. But it was not sufficient to provide the
skills that might alleviate poverty through education. The Bank missed opportunities to enunciate
classroom efficiency standards when it developed the minimum operational standards for schools
and to help state secretaries enforce them. It also led the govemment to spend scarce resources in
trying to bring about bureaucratic changes. The projects' relevance and efficiency were modest.
(See discussion at the end of this section.)
3.2     The Innovations in Basic Education project established some innovations that have
proved effective and were institutionalized. It attained most of its student access and teaching
objectives, but the important health and preschool education objectives were not attained, partly
due to a weak coordination among government and non-government agencies. Secretariat staff
considered that activities such as remedial classes improved learning, and the evaluation, which
was carried out only on certain activities, showed that a longer school day increased student
scores. However, the extent of overall learning improvement and retention of students as a result
of the project is uncertain. For these reasons, outcome is rated moderately satisfactory.
3.3     The NEBE projects met and sometimes surpassed their physical targets (Annex A, Table
2) in terms of school construction, materials, and training. Bureaucracies were not streamlined as
a result of management studies, but computerized management information and school census
became a reality as a result of the projects. The sustained testing work carried out through SAEB
and the continuing ability to deliver large numbers of free textbooks throughout the country show
that the Ministry of Education acquired the capacity to carry out such complex tasks. Teacher
training did take place, though its effectiveness is unknown and dubious. States carried out very
few of project-supported innovations. The projects were to increase students' learning, but it is
unclear whether the goal has been achieved, since no baseline achievement data were collected.26
Observations by the mission and opinions of local staff suggest that learning achievements were
limited, but it is unknown how students would perform without the project.
3.4     Also it is difficult to separate the effects of the project from the effects of better
government policies. The general reform of 1995 made it possible to increase financing for the
poorer municipalities and for teacher salaries. The project coincided with a period of political
and financial stability as well as staff continuity, both at the federal and at the state levels.
Although project funds accounted for about I percent of the education budget, the government
26. The states visited by the mission had evaluation departments, which were publishing reports regarding performance
of various areas in the SAEB, institutional evaluation, and other issues (Eg. Avaliacao das Escolas Publicas. Relatorio
Final de Lengua Portuguesa. Rio Grande do Norte, Secretaria de Estado da Educacao, March 1999. Avaliagao das
Escolas Publicas. Relatorio Final de Matematica. Rio Grande do Norte, Secretaria de Estado da Educacao, March
1999. Estudos das PrAticas Avaliativas de Professores das Series Iniciais. Secretaria de Educacao Basica do Estado do
Ceara, 1997.) However none of the states visited had evaluated the effectiveness of the NEBE and Fundescola projects
at the state level.



15
found the projects useful to implement. The outcomes of the NEBE projects are rated moderately
satisfactory.
3.5    Like NEBE, Fundescola I met and surpassed its physical targets. Its interventions have
been enthusiastically received, and teachers state that their schools are stronger as a result of the
interventions. Many staff who were interviewed stated that the repaired schools, sports facilities,
clean places, and existence of materials nearby make students and teachers willing to come to
school and stay. However it is unknown how much school appearance and availability of
audiovisual materials contributes towards performance improvement. The needs assessment
instrument does not help teachers focus on how they spend class time, a major problem identified
by previous research and mission observations. However, a small but significant difference in
learning outcomes was shown in favor of Fundescola schools. Given physical accomplishments
and staff opinions, outcome is rated as satisfactory.
3.6    Thought the Innovations and the Fundescola projects had evaluation designs, lack of
longitudinal data collection makes it hard to attribute student achievement improvements to the
project. As discussed earlier, SAEB test scores dropped significantly all over Brazil between
1997 and 1999 for grade 4. (Decreases at grade 8 were small.) Though the reduction is attributed
partly to test changes, it may also be due partly to a larger number of poorer students taking the
test, some of whom had gotten to grade 4 through automatic promotion. The projects in each
state reached only a small proportion of students. Thus, the overall effects of Bank projects
cannot be substantiated.27
Institutional Development Impact
3.7    To reach the hundreds of thousands of schools in Brazil, overlapping and partly
redundant structures have evolved, creating federal, state, and municipal school systems. In some
parts of the country they make bloated bureaucracies, with teachers leaving difficult classrooms
for desk jobs. All projects attempted to improve the effectiveness of these structures.
3.8    The Sao Paulo "Innovations" project attempted to establish a sustainable testing system,
shrink the number of staff involved in managing the system, and promote private-public
partnerships in preschool education. Though the testing system was established, the partnerships
for preschool education were not. Given a policy of gradually assigning primary schools from the
state to municipalities, it is uncertain whether the project helped reduce the number of
administrative staff. Overall, institutional development is rated modest.
3.9    The NEBE projects operated from the untested hypothesis that if staff were reduced in
the nine state secretariats of education and funds were better used, learning in schools would
increase. At the same time, the projects initially ignored the fact that municipalities were
autonomous and did not have to follow directives from states. Though Bank financing ushered
the computer age in the state education offices of the Northeast, the institutional development
effect at that level was negligible. As a secondary activity, however, the projects also supported
important national efforts to produce and deliver large quantities of textbooks as well as develop
a national achievement test. Overall, institutional development is rated modest.
27. Ideally, achievement and time on task for the effects of NEBE 11 and III on the states of Bahia and Ceara could be
evaluated by repeating the literacy achievement test used in 1996 in the same schools and comparing the data with the
baseline established at that time.



16
3.10   The Fundescola I project attempted to deal with the overlapping municipal and state
administrations by creating notional microregions that contain both types of schools and focusing
on school-based management therein. The goal of the projects is to convince local authorities
that the microregions are an effective management tool that is worth "multiplying" in other areas.
The concept may succeed; the state of Goias announced its intention to create school
development projects in all schools. Because the project significantly promoted school-based
management, institutional development is rated substantial.
Sustainability
3.11   The sustainability of all four projects is rated likely. Recurrent expenditure budgets are
available to maintain the buildings, training initiatives, and textbook production and distribution.
The testing instruments developed through the Innovations and the NEBE projects have gained
wide use and acceptance, and their continued use is all but assured. The sustainability of the
Fundescola I project depends on this ability to be replicated throughout the various states where it
has operated. The state of Goias is in the process of generalizing the school-centered
methodology in all schools.
Bank Performance
3.12   The Bank has been faced with the challenge of improving educational effectiveness in a
huge country that has overlapping autonomous administrative structures. Bank financing is a
minuscule amount of the federal and state budgets, and project effects on the system are small.
(For example, Bank projects refurbished buildings in only 96 of the 1200 schools of Alagoas.)
The effectiveness of Bank projects depends on a multiplicative effect, i.e. on whether states and
municipalities will think that the Bank promotes designs likely to bring about visible
improvement in quality and management of about 276,000 schools. Since the federal government
does not own any of the schools, Bank efforts must be concentrated in conceiving of effective
means to bring about change and persuading various authorities that these are effective. In the
past decade, the Bank has been trying hard to find the way. it focused first on physical outputs
and expansion of the system, and it is now looking towards improving quality.
3.13   The Innovations project, which dealt with a single state of mainly urban schools, paid
attention to instructional issues, learning outcomes, and impact evaluation. But the NEBE
projects expected to improve educational quality only indirectly, through encouraging state
secretariats to spend their funds more effectively. The SARs of the projects show much detail
about organizational effectiveness of central offices, and the PIU and government gave
centralized and clear standards for buildings and equipment. However, there were no details on
teacher training content or the instructional methods in the textbooks to be printed. It was left up
to staff of states and municipalities to figure out what to do on these issues. With hindsight, it is
hard to understand why these interventions would bring about classroom improvements or why
the Bank would think so. It may be that Bank staff sought remedies in areas where the Bank has
more expertise, such as management and economics. This focus led the state governments to
spend considerable time and money in calculating annual management efficiency targets. In the
meantime, changes in schools as a result of the NEBE projects were minimal.
3.14   Like NEBE, the Fundescola projects have also emphasized management efficiency, but
focused on lower levels, municipality and school. Based on the "Call to Action" research, the
Bank formed the hypotheses that: (a) multiple concentrated actions on schools would improve
learning; (b) operating in microregions was more effective than spreading partial benefits
throughout a state; and (c) when school staff discovered their weaknesses and received the



17
resources they thought they needed, classroom instruction would improve. Thus, Fundescola also
had a hands-off stance on classroom efficiency, despite specific guidance from research regarding
measures to take (para. 1.4). The Project Appraisal Document of Fundescola I (PAD) includes
annexes of economic analyses with calculated rates of return, financial and procurement issues,
and a poverty analysis, but no specifics on reducing classroom inefficiencies.
3.15   The search for more effective project designs is continuing. The Bank has gradually
discovered that by focusing on the school management may not necessarily bring about
instructional improvement in the classroom. Therefore the Fundescola II project has more
specific teaching and leaming components, and the Fundescola III (currently being appraised)
will include even more specific actions, such as video-based integrated teacher training. Because
emphasis on microregions and schools has received much acclaim, it forms the basis of the newly
effective Bahia and Ceara projects. It is hoped that ongoing and future projects will be adjusted
to include greater emphasis on classroom efficiency.
3.16   Overall, Bank perfornance is rated satisfactory for the Innovations project and
unsatisfactory for the two NEBE projects. On balance, performance for the Fundescola I project
is also rated satisfactory because of the research that went into its design as well as the
responsiveness to borrower needs.
Borrower Performance
3.17   The Innovations project faced many financial difficulties, and crucial health-related
components were not carried out due to a lack of coordination among various government
agencies; performance is therefore rated unsatisfactory. Borrower performance for the other
three projects is rated satisfactory. Since 1995, the govemment has consistently implemented
pro-poor education policies that made it possible to increase teacher salaries and transfer federal
funds directly to schools on a per-student basis, thus bypassing state bureaucracies. Also, in the
course of the years, the govemment adjusted its regulations and laws to make it possible for
donor-financed projects to receive counterpart funds as necessary. In addition, competent staff
were appointed to project implementation units, who contributed to the eventual implementation,
despite earlier delays. They helped carry out components, particularly for several secretariats in
the Northeast that faced implementation difficulties.
3.18   The NEBE projects showed qualified financial audits, particularly for the years 1994 to
1998. There are cases of double billing and ineligible expenditures. The govemment changed
the software used to better describe and screen disbursements. The Fundescola I project audits
did not indicate problems.
Bank Strategy Contributions Toward the Education of the Poor
3.19   Since 1995, the Bank's education strategy documents have focused on reaching the poor
and increasing equity in education. What was the long-term effect of the letter that brought forth
"Chamada a Acao"? If Joao Santos were to return to his rural Ceari primary school seven years
later, what would be different?
3.20   The Bank's country assistance objectives focus on inequity of resource distribution as the
major problem in Brazilian education.' The "Call to Action" included 13 studies (at a cost of
about US$400,000), the distribution of a consciousness-raising video - featuring a prominent
northem singer - to state and municipal secretary training sessions, and the design of the 1 0-year
Fundescola program on the basis of findings. However, Fundescola, the Bank's response to "Call



18
to Action", did not attempt to increase equity or improve overall quality of education in the states
it operated. It focused on the easier-to-reach urban areas and nearby rural areas (where
multigrade escola ativa classes were instituted). The residents of the more populous areas
received more inputs; it was possible for a periurban school to receive multiple inputs from
NEBE and Fundescola projects. However few if any investments were made in rural areas of the
sparsely populated Northeast. Unless Joao's teacher received training from the NEBE project and
changed her ineffective behaviors or the municipal secretariat showed unusual initiative and
obtained help directly from federal funds, Joao's school may be in about the same condition as in
1995.
3.21   The Bank has had important constraints and limited options in designing projects that
would effectively reach Joao's school. Because the federal government does not own any
schools, the Bank must somehow work through secretariats, and prefects who often change. The
project implementation unit cannot dictate rules but must convince and provide incentives. Some
government staff reported to the mission that public interest in the education of the poor is rather
limited, because many middle class children go to private schools, and the poor may elect local
authorities on the basis of infrastructure accomplishments. Because Bank projects can only reach
a finite number of schools, the strategy has been to get the biggest effect possible for the
coverage. As a result, Bank financing in the last decade has not focused substantially on the
poorest schools or on increasing equity. To the contrary, it mainly financed the larger schools
most likely to show results, and in effect may have unwittingly contributed to increased inequity
between the urban and rural poor.28 Some actions specifically aimed at inequity are being
undertaken with the new Bahia and Ceara basic education projects (Ln. 4591-BR and 4592-BR),
which focus on the lowest-performing municipalities.
3.22   Nevertheless, Joao and his younger siblings may have to wait a decade before instruction
in their school becomes more efficient, if it does. Perhaps state governments will eventually
adopt Fundescola as a state-wide model, and after several years and deliberations, the teachers in
Joao's school may realize that they are wasting students' time. The pace of progress towards
effective learning in public schools serving the poorest students appears glacial.
4. Issues for Future Consideration
Project Designs Built on Untested Theories
4.1    Three of the four projects (i.e., NEBE and Innovations projects) were designed on the
untested hypothesis that more efficient management at the central or school level would improve
learning outcomes and enable students to progress in school. Two of them were not implemented
in a coherent way to demonstrate it, and only the third one has developed concrete strategies and
actions to test the hypothesis at the school level. However, there is considerable research in the
educational, social and economic organizational theories that might point towards different
hypotheses.29 But there is no evidence it was brought to bear by the Bank in designing and
appraising the projects.
28. Fundescola 11 includes schools with populations of more than 100 students and may therefore include poorer
schools.

Psychology, vol. 2, p. 749-752. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1998.

Much Classroom Time is Spent on Ineffective Tasks or Inactivity
4.2     The importance of class time devoted to learning tasks ("time on task") cannot be
overemphasized. The international literature is replete with references and indications of its close
relation to achievement in various contexts."0 Efficient class time use must be emphasized a great
deal at every level of govemment contacts and various training levels. State and municipal
secretaries must be 'sold' on the idea; in turn, they need to sell the idea down the line to teachers,
supervisors, and school principals. The Fundescola project implementation team has much
management expertise; they can identify opportunities to promote specific actions down the line
to increase time on task in classes.
4.3     Certain teaching practices and philosophies reduce the valuable classroom time available
in class for actual acquisition and processing of useful information. The most important are
extensive copying from the blackboard, early laborious writing, extensive art, and doing in class
work that could be assigned as homework. Legal teacher absenteeism also is a major problem in
areas such as Sao Paulo. (See Annex B for details.) The limited instructional time is related to
low achievement in basic skills and possibly to the high repetition and age-distortion rates. Some
Brazilian teacher training manuals attribute students' low performance to the inability of poorer
families to help them with school work." With many students falling behind, classes are boring
and repetitive.,, With the inefficient use of time, the poor are often left out of secondary or higher
education. Eventually, few of these siudents are likely to pass the "vestibular," entrance
examination for the university. The best students go to the public universities and fill their
quotas, so few poor who pass the examination may be unable to afford the private universities
that accept them.
4.4     Practices that waste class time ultimately deterrnine how effective the Bank's loans are,
and thus cost real money to governments. Increasing the efficiency of educational expenditures is
a priority of state economic memoranda of the Northeast.3" Thus, classroom efficiency must
become a priority of Bank and government strategy and a primary focus for untapped savings and
efficiency gains. To help states improve class efficiency, time on task could be included in the
operational standards applicable to all schools. For example, a goal may be that 75 percent of
class time will be spent on learning activities. Principals and supervisors may use existing
classroom observation instruments to monitor how time is spent.
30. Time on task refers to the amount of time a student is actually engaged in tearning or teacher directed lessons and
activities. it is a gross measure of learning because it does not differentiate between levels, such as memorization and
analysis (e.g. Prater, M. 1992. Increasing time-on-task in the classroom. Intervention in School and Clinic, 28, 22-27).
31. The teacher training manuals examined by the mission attributed the limited literacy achievement to poverty
(Ministerio da EducacAo. Programa de FormacAo de Professores Alfabetizadores. Apresenta9Ao. Brazilia, January
2001. p. 9, 14). Other works, which discussed philosophy, activities, and attitudes to help bring about literacy were:

32. Remedial programs that limit students to repetitive basic skills activities actually "prompt students' lack of
engagement in their schoolwork and frequently result in limited achievement. ( Policy Studies Associates (1995).

4.5     Improvements in how teachers use class time can be brought about through (a)
behaviorally oriented inservice training and (b) supervision and follow-up by school principals
and supervisors. Time usage must be emphasized during school development projects (PDEs).
Since municipal and state officials are the decisionmakers, their training, notably through the
Progestao program could include videos and suggestions for specific behavioral change.
Ultimately, local media and parents must be sensitized to effective time use in class. The training
network is successful in carrying messages to educational staff. If effective messages and
behavioral reinforcement are provided to staff, classroom time use may increase.
4.6     To bring about classroom-level instructional improvements and develop monitoring skills
at all levels of management leading up to the classroom (including Secretaries of education), a
small Learning Innovations Loan (LIL) could be considered by the Bank. Through it, up-to-date
cognitive research could be applied to various classroom situations, particularly those of the rural
poor. Effects could be studied for maximal learning outcomes. The project would include
piloting of innovative teacher training methods that are most likely to bring about teacher
behavior changes.
Improve Poor Students' Chances for Catching up and Keeping up
4.7     Early acquisition of automatic reading and calculation is a prerequisite for processing a
volume of text and carrying out complex calculations.34 Students in multigrade classes (escolas
ativas) in particular need to acquiring reading skills early to follow instructions for further study.
Brazil still has children who are at high risk for early dropout, and early emphasis on reading
skills will increase the probability that they will remain literate after dropping out.35 Research on
this should be done.
4.8     Despite some spelling peculiarities in Portuguese, Brazilian students who receive
sufficient instruction typically achieve reading fluency by the end of the first grade. However, in
the schools that serve the poor, many do not achieve fluency until grade 4 or 5. By then, they are
in effect four years behind and may never catch up.36 The challenge is to deal sufficiently with
the difficulties of reading Portuguese37 and offer students intensive instruction and practice in the
early grades, before they fall behind.
4.9     As a result of delayed reading, cohorts of students have fallen behind and need to catch
up. Several states, such as Sao Paulo, have strategies for doing so, such as acceleration and
recuperation classes. Given the limited time on task, these classes may not be as effective as
34. Much research exists on this issue; E.g. Adams, M. J. 1990. Beginning to Read: Thinking and Learning about Print.
Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press; Feitelson, D. 1988. Facts and Fads in Beginning Reading. Norwood, N.J.: Ablex.

Schools. Washington, DC: World Bank.
36. Brazil: Teacher's Development and Incentives. Washington: World Bank, LAC Region. Report No. 20408 BR.
2001,p. 11-12.
37. The research on Brazilian Portuguese is somewhat mixed in regards to the regularity of the orthography. Pinheiro
(1995) claims it is highly regular for reading but little less so for spelling. There are only nine cases of unique mapping
between letters and phonemes, while Rego (1999) points out many more variant patterns and more asymmetry for
reading and spelling. (Pinheiro, Angela Maria Vieira. 1995. Reading and spelling development in Brazilian Portuguese.

expected. In addition to improving their effectiveness, other means must be sought among the
many innovations to enable poor students to get special attention. Some are:
- Enable schools to pay for students' tutoring more easily. Schools use their PME money to
buy audiovisual equipment and teacher training. However, the equipment usually cannot
help students improve their basic reading and arithmetic skills. Schools should be spending
the money to hire inexpensive tutors for the students who fall behind. These could be
secondary or even middle-school 'students. However, there is a concern that teacher trade
unions may be against this measure and that employment regulations may make such work
difficult. Means might be found to do so.
- Support homework and longer student exposure to learning. Several factors, including
parental illiteracy, may make it harder for students to focus on homework. Schools may
consider an 'integrated' hour for homework and a longer school day through the help of part-
time tutors to help students get more reading practice.
- Expand bolsa escola. This program, which pays students' families a small amount of money
to send their children to school, is functional where the mission visited, but fewer students
than the eligible population were being attended. The program could expand. As mentioned
earlier, however, classes must spend more of the available time delivering instruction, if the
students' time is to be usefully spent.
Increase Preschool and School Health Interventions
4.10   It is known that preschool programs have positive long-term effects for children from
disadvantaged families."8 These children often come with developmental delays and limited
language and psychomotor skills, which preschool programs can improve. However, these have
not been extensively financed by the Bank projects. The Innovations in Basic Education project
was unable to mobilize NGOs and municipalities to provide a sufficient number of places for the
poor. Coordination between different Ministries as well as between state and municipal levels
proved problematic, and few health services were given to children. Offering free preschool to the
poor should be a high policy priority.
4.11   However, the need for health-related interventions continues, particularly in the
Northeast. Some children suffer from malnutrition, lack of vitamins, parasitic infections, and
family abuse, which may decrease cognitive capacity later on. Clearly, there is a need for early
interventions, such as early childhood education. The Bank may consider including preschool
and early childhood education in its lending pipeline.
Autonomy Enables Disinterested Municipalities to Do Little
4.12   There is a countrywide process to "municipalize" primary education and pass state
schools on to the various municipalities. However, municipalities are not equal. Some have
officials who are more interested and motivated than others, so they may get more resources.
Also, the poorer municipalities may pay teachers less, and have difficulty finding good teachers.
Not surprisingly, children in municipal schools often have lower scores than children in state
schools by grade 2. Municipalization may in fact create a lottery for the poorer students. Those in
38. Barnett, Steven. 1992. Benefits of Compensatory Preschool Education. Joumal of Human Resources, 27:2, 279-
312.



22
better municipalities will do better, and those in poorer ones may do worse. Higher-income
countries have extensive parental involvement to monitor quality, but many areas in Brazil have
not yet gotten to this point.
4.13   In principle, states have a responsibility to help municipalities, though in practice
political obstacles may get in the way. Because of decentralization and autonomy, states and
municipalities have separate training and supervisory networks that often operate in the same area
(e.g. Sao Paulo) and duplicate the same processes, thus resulting in inefficiencies.
4.14   The problem is not easy to solve, since municipalities have the freedom to do as they
wish. Perhaps the states might take the leadership and create training program for all teachers,
principals, and local officials to increase the time spent on useful learning tasks. Municipalities
might be asked if they want to accept it or create their own. Some states have created voluntary
partnerships, but these are of little help when municipalities have little interest in promoting the
education of the poor.
Lessons
4.15   Experience with the projects confirms a number of OED lessons from education projects:
*  Attention to state, municipal, or even school management is necessary but is not
sufficient for improving classroom instruction effectiveness and efficiency. Attention
must also be paid to how the precious classroom time is used.
*  States and municipalities that are better off are more likely to take advantage of Bank-
financed resources. The challenge is to encourage the poorer ones to benefit as well.
*  Political stability, stable project teams, and policies to help the poor receive quality
education contribute a great deal to project success.
*  Decentralizing school management to the municipal level is not a panacea. Autonomy
permits the poorest or least knowledgeable municipalities to fall behind, without much
possibility for helping their residents.
*  In addition to achievement tests, classroom observations may be used as predictors of
achievement. Unless there is after-hours coaching, children's knowledge is likely to
reflect information processing in classrooms. Classroom observations can potentially
provide feedback and promote improvements sooner than achievement tests, which must
first be developed, administered, and analyzed.
*   Students' health needs and problems must be addressed to optimize cognitive
development and classroom learning. However, agency coordination problems may
make this task difficult, and means must be sought early on to eliminate obstacles.
*  Research financed by projects must be disseminated and put to action. Findings must be
communicated clearly and succinctly, through means that are likely to change behaviors
and attitudes. It may be cost-effective to spend money for translation (where needed) and
develop a follow-up action plan.



23
*  The theories and hypotheses that Bank staff develop about improving educational
outcomes should be validated and examined in light of pertinent research before being
integrated into project designs.
*  The Bank should acquire more expertise with respect to improving basic skills,
particularly in operations that target the poorest children.

Annex B. Assessment Methodology
Through field visits, OED collects qualitative information, which is integrated with
quantitative data where available. The limited time to assess projects (approximately one week
per project) means that missions have limited time in the field, and that travel to remote areas is
often not possible.
State staff opinions
The mission interviewed staff who had helped implement the projects in various states
(10 employees in Ceari, six in Rio Grande de Norte, and eight in Alagoas). The questions posed
to state and federal implementing teamns were:
What were the benefits of the project in your state?
What problems did you face in implementing the project? what help did you get?
Which components worked best in bringing about results, which did not?
How effective were the various consultants who worked on the project?
What training did you receive through the project? Did it teach you what it was supposed to?
The project had some qualified audits. What financial irregularities were there in your state, if
any?
What would be different in education sector of your state if the project had not existed?
What can you do to reach the poorer municipalities, for which you are not really responsible?
A summary of answers is provided in Annex B, Table 2.
School visits. The schools were sampled for visits on an incidental basis. Upon arrival
at a state, the mission asked state official to indicate sites of project implementation that would be
accessible within 1.5 hour of travel from the capital. Efforts were made to visit rural and low-
income schools to the extent possible. Also, the mission stopped by schools along the road to
various destinations when time permitted. Two or three staff members from the state Secretariat,
who knew the road to various schools and the work that had been carried out in them,
accompanied the mission. Thus, the schools that could be visited did not constitute a
representative sample of schools in a state or a project; it was impossible to visit the more remote
municipalities and isolated rural schools (in grot6es), where instructional delivery might be
poorer. Also, the time of visits was not random; they took place in late morning and during the
afternoon shift. However, visits in the schools were unannounced, and it was possible to see
everyday operation. Some class events were videotaped for discussion with officials.
School visits involved interviews with the school principal if s/he was available and any
teachers who were free. The visitors entered classrooms, observed the tasks in process, and asked
the teacher what she was doing and why. Some students in a class were chosen on an incidental
basis and asked to read or answer basic arithmetic questions. A questionnaire was prepared for
teachers' meetings, but it was applied only in three cases because it was not practical to meet
teachers in groups without interrupting classes.
To study the effects of the NEBE projects in the Northeast, the mission spent two days
visiting six primary schools around Natal, three days visiting eight primary schools around
Fortaleza, two days visiting seven schools around Macei6. For Fundescola I, the mission visited
schools around Goiania and Ner6polis. For the Innovations in Basic Education, the schools visited



30
were in and around Sao Paulo. The latter schools were larger, and it was possible to observe
many classes in each. The schools visited were: in Ceara, Paul Ayrton, Paulino Rocha (Fortaleza
municipal), Ruiz Barbosa, Luiz Gozaga dos Santos, (Maracanau), Valdemar Pereiro di Querois
(Eusebio), Natalia Candido de Suarez, Prof. Nevens Amando (Aquiraz), Fernando Augusto and
one state school (Horizonte). In Rio Grande de Norte, Escuela Amerinda Bezerres Furtado,
(municipal) and Francisca de Castro, (state) in Macaiba; Escola Antonio de Castro (state),
Francesca Fernandez (municipal) in Parnamirim; Maria Aurineide (state) and Francesca
Fernandes (municipal) in Nova Cruz. In Macei6, Marechal Deodoro primary school, Major
Alfredo Tenorio Lins (Marechal Deodoro), Escola Oliveira Silva, Eusebio Serafim (Pilar), unidad
escolar Valido Maya de Omena, escola Pedro Nnfiez (Craibas), municipal school of Coite de
N6ia (secondary grades). In Goias, rural escola ativa and urban escola estadual Dr. Negreitos
(Ner6polis), escola Jose Alvos de Assisi, Cecilia Meierlis (periphery of Goiania), rural escola
ativa Vincente Guimaraes (Bella Vista). In Sao Paulo, State schools Enio Voss, Cesar Martinez,
EEMMDC in Mooca (various areas inside Sao Paulo); Azevedo Soares, Padre Egydio in Caieiras,
municipalized school Tania Fernandez in Francisco Morato, Lydia Kitts Moreira in Guarulhos,
and Alberto Feijeira Rezende in Jundiai.
At the completion of each state visit, meetings were held with state officials, and
suggestions were given for improvement. Suggestions given to the officials included means to
deal with the issues presented in the main body of the text. (See Annex C).



31
Annex C. Specific Instructionally Oriented Issues
A number of issues emerged during school visits:
-   Extensive copying from the blackboard. Though some copying is necessary in any class,
Brazil has a tradition of extensive copying, partly due to an earlier lack of textbooks.39 The
students of primary schools copied, because teachers asked them to, those of middle schools
because books had not yet been given out, and those in secondary schools because they had
no textbooks. Linked to this issue was the limited use of textbooks.
-   "Text production" for students who do not yet read well. Their laborious writing consumes
valuable time that could have been, used to leam better reading.
-   Limited or no homework for children considered too poor; reading or writing work that could
be homework is assigned in class, thus reducing the time available to learn new material.
-   Basic skills drowned in art. Though some art is motivating and develops psychomotor skills,
too much may waste the precious time of poor children and drive them to the point of no
catch-up.40 The minimum amount to motivate students and yet not detract them from learning
tasks has not been explored. Because art work and secondary activities are also part of
remedial classes, they may reduce students' chances for catching up. Discussions with some
education specialists responsible for schools revealed a preoccupation with sophisticated
tasks (such as detailed diagnostics for children who obviously lack basic skills) and a lack of
understanding for the gross deficiencies and the time constraints of poor children.
-   Legal teacher absenteeism. In various states, teachers' unions have won the right to be absent
from class 1-3 days a month. In addition, they leave the classroom to take training, since
many have a second and third job and they really do not have the time to devote to training.
Rural schools have no substitute teachers, and classes of absent teachers often go home.
Urban schools may only have access to one, while there may be six teachers absent at the
same time. This is cited as one important reason why teachers send their own children to
private schools.
Possible ways to address these issues were discussed with state and federal officials during
the mission, as follows:
(a) Including time on task in the operational standards applicable to all schools. For
example, a goal may be that 75 percent of class time will be spent on learning
39. Copying is still recommended as stimulating and pleasant, though boring sometimes. (Ministerio de Educa,ao,
Secretaria de Educacao Fundamental. Programa,de desenvolvimento Profissional Continuado - Alfabetiza,ao. Modulo
- Alfabetizar com textos. Brazilia 2000, p. 97.)
40. There has been a big push to combine reading and writing in the early grades, with a renewed emphasis on spelling
deriving from work on early decoding. This may be overused. The idea of constructivismo is to allow the children to
dictate their own stories, which the teachers then write down and read to the children and then allow them to read. It
works well when the homes do all of the teaching of reading because few children who need to be taught to read in
school can learn from that method. It also requires extremely knowledgeable and dedicated teachers (Richard
Venezky, reading expert, Professor of Education at the University of Delaware; personal communication March 16,
2002).

activities. Principals and supervisors may use existing classroom observation
instruments to monitor how time is spent.
(b) Behaviorally oriented inservice training. All Bank projects of the 1 990s invested
heavily in teacher training, and the network functions effectively; throughout the
country, teachers regularly attend training sessions on various topics. However,
lectures and books are usually not very effective in modifying behaviors; role
modeling coupled with specific feedback are more effective. Training videos could
demonstrate desirable and undesirable instructional behaviors. These can be easily
created with a camcorder by visiting classes, or asking trainers to demonstrate (to
make sure teachers with negative behaviors are not offended). During training,
teachers may be asked to identify desirable and undesirable practices, understand the
rationale, reflect on what they do, and receive specific suggestions on what they
should do instead, such as: Assigning reading instead of copying and early text
production, a list of activities for idle time while waiting for a bell, group activities
for better classroom management, and giving doable homework
(c) Supervision and follow-up of how class time is used. Usually teacher classes are
not systematically supervised. However, Brazil has a human resource structure in
place that could do so easily. Many states and municipalities have supervisors (fewer
in the Northeast), who visit schools regularly. Also, most schools have full-time
principals. Though many are political appointees and not necessarily qualified, they
could learn to monitor teachers' use of time. They have a position of authority and
can easily hear the noise which usually signals that students are not engaged in
learning tasks. Rather than tolerate the situation as "normal", they can suggest
suitable activities to teachers.
(d) Emphasizing time on task during school development projects (PDEs). The PDE
is the Bank's main vehicle for school-level reform. The main process consists of a
lengthy questionnaire, which school staffs contemplate over several weeks. A part of
the questionnaire asks about the effectiveness of teaching-learning process, but it is
not sufficiently specific. For example, it asks whether teachers start and end classes
promptly and whether administrative issues are carried out with a minimum of
interruption.4' These questions could be rephrased to focus teachers on their use of
class time for effective learning.
(e) Sensitizing state and municipal officials. Training for state and municipal
administrators is carried out often, notably through the progestao program. Videos
and suggestions for specific behavioral change could be presented to them.
(f) Sensitizing local media and parents though the various meetings that
schools are expected to carry out. Better understand of constructive time
usage may create community pressures on schools to increase the time
devoted to learning.

What problems did you face in implementing the project? What were its
disadvantages?
Hard to equip schools with unsuitable infrastructure; they had to repair classes first               X
Repair work is unfinished; through Fundescola they cannot repair 'wet areas', only
classes                                                                                              x
Initially, much complicated bureaucracy was required, a 1997 change in PIU
administration improved conditons                                            x                       x
The govemment gave clear building and equipment standards, but no guidance on
teacher training (Alagoas)                                                                           X
Fundescola reached again some schools refurbished during the earlier projects (Natal)                X
-Schools that were not refurbished could not sustain and get equipment                               X
In Fundescola, Bank contribution is symbolic, 1% of expenditures, covers travel
expenses, some paint                                                                                 X
Lack of counterpart funds, stoppage of work                                  X                       X                                X
Implementation team changed when government changed                                                  X
No relation between components, objectives, results
Management improvements at state level - no ownership, unsatistactory
State management studies were useless
Project benefits were scattered in multiple schools                                     X
There was a cultural barrier, project was too high-level initially           X
States did not clearly particlpate in the appraisal, were not consulted sufficlently
Partnerships with municipalities did not work out well                       x                                                        X
The very poor were left behind; if no land were readily available, a school would not be
built                                                                        X
Many municipalities and their assorted distant schools have fallen behind    x
Earlier workmanship of school repairs was poor, many cost more to repair than rebuild  X             X
Lack of resources - small team had to build too many schools                 X
No guidance on how to improve teacher training                                          X
No computers in the more remote schools                                                 X            X
Getting teachers to use the materials kits                                              X
Initial difficulties in Fundescola were due to its being a separate rather than an
integrated program                                                                                                  X

The instrucUonal delivery improvements were the most difficult to implement                                        X
Getting the supplemental financing from the state to do the work                                                   x
Schools had difficulties in managing money, lack of experience                                                     X
Location of escolas ativas was done based on the political will of municipalities                                  X
The inputs of the NEBE projects were scattered among the schools, did not have
synergies
Which components worked best in bringing about results, which did not?
Video equipment and telensino are not effective in improving leaming outcomes  X
Accelerated dasses do not teach advanced skills, need revisions             X
Management indices calculated showed the magnitude of some problems                                X
Some non-teaching staff went back to dass, others retired, leaving recruitment open
for new ideas                                                                                      X
The exodus of non-teaching staff had limited effectiveness; Secretaria overstaffed
again                                                                                              X
Microplanning showed exactly where new schools were needed                                         X
With microplanning, team could argue that schools should not be where politicians
wanted them                                                                                        X
Schools are refurbished based on clear criteria rather than political desire for public
relations                                                                                                          X
Distance teacher training pilot worked well and went to scale during Fundescola  X
Teacher training was not effective                                                     X
Equipment given is kept locked in schools to prevent theft or destruction              X
School development project greatly changed teachers' minds                                                         X                X
How effective were the various Bank staff or consultants who worked on the
project?
A Bank staff came in to deal with educational work but was transferred and work
remained unfinished                                                                                X
Bank staff came repeatedly, were helpful and interested                     X                      X               X                X

Some consultants had rigid requirements, staff leamed to think on the same terms and
confront them                                                               x
What training did you receive through the project? Did it teach you what it was
supposed to?
Project management training, procurement, bids handling                     X          X           X               X                X

What financial irregularities or qualified audits were there in your state, if any?
Initially civil works quality was low                                                              X
Team did not correctly follow procedures on a few occasions                            X
Nepotism was encountered in municipalities, some less qualified people were given
jobs                                                                                   X
Decentralizaton of money to schools created some accountng irregularities due to
ignorance                                                                                                          X
Giving school construction funds to schools reduced overcharging and deficient
constructon                                                                                                        X

Significant abuse of school lunches, but this did not affect the project                                                            X
What would be different In education sector of your state if the project had not
existed?
The team would start from a lower level, no decentralized management                   X
There would not be as much transparency in govemment statistics                        X
There would be no minimum operational standards or implementation capacity             X           X

States would not have the capacity to do microplanning
Structured teams of staff might not exist in the states
SAEB, school census, other federal programs would be further behind
Quality of education would probably be the same                                                                    X
Quality of education is improving due to school development projects                                               X
Management would be more centralized without it and less transparent                               X

What can you do to spread project effects to the less capable municipalities?
The state cannot intervene with municipal education, even if the quality of education is
low                                                                                                X
Nothing, they are impotent; they see bad performance and cannot fix it      X                      X
Some municipalities are better at getting resources for themselves          x
Made agreement with some municipalities to repair their schools                        X
Doing so gradually as all schools of the state do school development projects                                      X                X

Qualitative evaluation, none based on achievement                                      X
There were no specific outcome targets or baseline data
No baseline data were collected on schools before various interventions     X          x           X
Various evaluative data can be produced from computer records, but not on
achievement
Evaluation was only done for 'concrete materials", not for school performance
NEBE project helped create the SAEB for sample-based achievement data
SAEB scores were available for various towns, but no specific performance feedback     X

Other issues and observations
A lot depends on the good will of the individual teacher                                          X
Students like the repaired schools, take care of them, vandalism reduced                          X
Though 3-5 years have passed, some schools look as if they were repaired yesterday                X
Dropout repetition were reduced, but due to policies rather than improved leaming     x           X
Directors do only administrative work, quality of education is not in their responsibilitief  X   X
Fundescola rules permit equipment purchase but no hiring of tutors for weak students              X
Municipal students are in poorer schools                                              X
Esola ativa textbooks need to be closer to national curricular standards, currently
