Lessons outline the\n            importance of measurable targets, and goals in project\n            design, consistent to operations, and relevant to\n            components, objectives, and outputs, for although the Annual\n            Management Efficiency Targets was seemingly adequate, the\n            reliability of measurable information was weak. The lack of\n            a coherent, detailed implementation plan was partly\n            conducive to delays, demonstrated among others, by the fact\n            that construction requirements were not foreseen prior to\n            actual implementation, revealing the lack of attentive\n            preparation in a project involving international financing,\n            aggravated by weak inter-governmental interventions, which\n            affected systems management, human resources development,\n            and the strengthening of management capacity. States should\n            assist schools through their municipalities, reaching\n            beneficiaries, by coordinating teacher training, school\n            rehabilitation, and provision of textbooks to improve\n            student learning. Thus, standardized teacher qualifications,\n            and pedagogical inputs should be established, backed by\n            technical assistance provision. These needs require a strong\n            political will, evidenced as well, by the delays suffered in\n            the development of the management information system, which\n            despite substantial attention, and input, failed to deliver\n            the necessary incentives to be adopted."}, "docdt": "2000-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
