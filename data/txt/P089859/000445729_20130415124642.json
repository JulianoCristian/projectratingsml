"Ratings for the Legal and Judicial\n            Implementation and Institutional Support Project for\n            Macedonia were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was substantial;\n            bank performance was bank performance; and borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned include: infrastructure activity took the\n            lion's share of the Bank financing as well as\n            supervision efforts. If infrastructure is seen as a\n            precursor or the first sequence in reforming the judiciary,\n            then a secondary or equally important reform would be to\n            building the capacity technical, human and planning\n            capacities of the judiciary to maintain and consolidate the\n            achievements made to date. The national judicial training\n            academy has made important advances in improving the overall\n            capacity of the judges, prosecutors and supporting staff at\n            a time of rapid change in the country's legal\n            framework. Nevertheless, it must be said with the rapidly\n            evolving legal framework, consolidation of this learning and\n            the reforms will take more time than the timeframe, and is\n            subject to reversals. Finally, measuring this project's\n            success is extremely difficult given the Macedonian justice\n            sector's rapid transformation during project design and\n            implementation. It will take considerable time and resources\n            to consolidate all of the reforms set in place during\n            Project design and implementation. The project made positive\n            contributions to the implementation of new court case\n            management and bankruptcy procedures, and streamlining\n            administrative cases, and as such, the Project's\n            success should ultimately be measured with this in mind."}, "docdt": "2013-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
