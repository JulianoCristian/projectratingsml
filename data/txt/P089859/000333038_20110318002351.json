The closing date for the project will be\n            extended from July 31, 2011 until March 31, 2012. It is\n            anticipated that remaining activities will be fully\n            completed in the eight-month extension period. Planned\n            activities that will be completed are: (i) the construction\n            period of the new Criminal Court in Skopje exceeds the\n            current closing date of the Project (July 31, 2011). Due to\n            general delays in starting this activity, and unforeseeable\n            delays at the start of the construction, including water\n            supply pipelines in the foundations, the construction was\n            delayed by a total of ten months. The anticipated completion\n            date is in January, 2012; (ii) to allow for a complete and\n            thorough analysis and final report, an extension of the\n            contract for the functional analysis from July 31, 2011, to\n            December 31, 2011, will provide the firm with sufficient\n            time to complete their analysis of the courts and for the\n            Judicial Council to test the analysis; and (iii) due to a\n            change in the management of the public administration from\n            the Ministry of Justice to the Ministry of Information\n            Technology, and the need for the Minister to familiarize\n            him/herself with the Bank's procurement rules and the\n            LJIIS project, this activity has encountered Delays. This\n            will be the first extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2011-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
