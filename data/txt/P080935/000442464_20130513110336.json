     for Mail were as follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory, risk\n            to development outcome was high, Bank performance was\n            unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was unsatisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: the Mali Growth Project was\n            too complex and should have been simplified at the design\n            and the restructuring stage. The wide scope of project\n            activities led to a situation whereby institutional\n            coordination was fragmented and at times implementation was\n            captured by sectoral interests. Restructuring and Mid-Term\n            Review (MTR) are important opportunities to review and\n            revise project design. Strong monitoring and evaluation\n            system is critical to drive and account for results.\n            Specialists on the World Bank and government side need to\n            design and supervise implementation of any monitoring and\n            evaluation system. The Strategies et Techniques d'Envol\n            des Entreprises (STEP) program showed that results can be\n            monitored in all the six years of its implementation.\n            Clinics on procurement and on financial management should be\n            held at any moment in the project, when issues arise. World\n            Bank team members can have advice from senior staff in\n            safeguards and procurement in the World Bank, to help\n            unblock the tourism infrastructure activity in the project."}, "docdt": "2013-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
