Project description Ref: PAD B.3.a, TechnicalAnnex 4
The project aims at (i) improving the investment climate as much as possible inorder to increase
total factor productivity (TFP) and foster growth, with a particular focus on SMEs and on key
sectors, (ii)expanding the availability of the infrastructure base, and (iii)
                                                                            promoting business
innovation through financial andnonfinancial services.

Project Component 1 - InvestmentClimate and Institutional Strengthening. The objective o f this
component is to help (i) implement the key recommendations that emerge from the recent
investment climate assessmentand improve the country's legal andregulatory framework inkey
areas so as better performances are reflected inthe DoingBusiness indicators; and (ii)strengthen
both policymaking and operational capabilities inkey sectors with a high growth contribution
potential.

Project Component 2 - Infrastructure Support for Growth. This component seeks to improve
economy-wide and sectoral total factor productivity by enhancing available infrastructure. This
will encompass (i) development of an industrial zone, (ii) improvement o f the Bamako
                    the                                         the
airport, (iii)
             the support to the expansion o fthe telecommunications network, and (iv) the support
to infrastructure improvement for tourism and mining.

Project Component 3 - Financial and Non-Financial Services for Innovation and Development.
The objective o f this component it to increase term financing for MSMEs and to providing
quality business development services to MSMEs, including supply chains, so that they can
innovate, develop and as to increase their output and productivity.

Component 4 - Project Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation. The objective o f this
component i s to ensure not only effective and coordinated implementation across various
institutions involved, but also so ensure that both intermediate and final results sought are
obtained.

Which safeguard policies are triggered, ifany? Re$ PAD D.6, TechnicalAnnex 10

The proposed project i s category B; and a strategic environmental and social assessment (SESA)
was carried out. It was concluded that the environmental safeguard policy (OP/BP/GP 4.01) is
triggered. The SESA has identified the environmental and social potential impacts, as they relate
to water and Bandresources, biodiversity. It has also identifiedthe possible positive and negative
impacts o fthe project sub-components.

At environmental and social levels, the Investment Climate component will have a highly
positive economic impact, but i s likely to generate negative effects as a result of land
degradation and poor management of risks related to industrial activities. The economic and
social impact o f the crafts    sub-component i s expected to be high, at both national and
international levels, in terms of high employment rate, high incomes and valuation o f local
products, if the moderate effects on environment and natural resources are well managed,
following provisions in the SESA report. The Tourism sub-component should not have
meaningful impacts on natural resources, but it may have effects on social and cultural values.
However, with careful implementation o f provisions and mitigation measures outlined in the
SESA report most of the concerns raised above will be very minimal. At the economic level,
positive effects are expected, mainly inm a l areas.

As for the mining activities, a very positive impact on the national economy and local
development i s expected, although negative potential risks on biophysical resources and social
environment (e.g. land degradation, water pollution) will need to be mitigated in due course. It
should be noted that these risks are unlikely to materialize during the project life. Ifand when
they materialize in the future, private mining companies would have to comply with Malian
safeguards regulations. Potential negative impacts o f the telecommunications-related activities
under this project are expected to rather minor when compared to expected benefits for the
national economy; and mitigation actions will be taken as required.

Country Issues

Mali has made significant economic and political progress over the past decade despite
considerable obstacles and adverse shocks. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth
averaged at about 5.6 percent per year from 1994to 2003, higher than the average GDP
growth rate of 3.2 percent for Sub-Saharan Africa countries over the same period. This
growth enabled real per capita GDPinMali to rise by 3.1 percent per year.

        Source: SIMA database, World Bank, 2004.

Despite progress over the past decade, poverty i s still widespread in Mali: In the late
199Os, almost 64 percent of Mali's population livedbelow the poverty line. Furthermore,
Mali's economy remains highly vulnerable to external shocks, such as adverse climatic
conditions and dependence on a narrow range of commodity exports that are vulnerable
to price and nominal exchange rate fluctuations.

Even so, Mali's economic growth potential remains largely untapped because of
insufficient microeconomic and institutional reforms, poor infrastructure, low levels of
human development, and weak institutional capacity-all    of which create difficult social
and economic conditions.

The Government of Mali (GOM) i s committed to achieving sustained and equitable
economic growth through continued macroeconomic reforms aimed at broadening the
economic base and by developing and diversifying sources of growth while strengthening
the enabling environment for the private sector to become the engine of growth. The
G O M has also initiated a series of actions aimed at accelerating private sector
development. In a drive to set up public-private partnerships, Mali launched its
Presidential Investors' Council in September 2004 to introduce a global business
perspective into policy design and implementation. The government i s seelung to
enhance the effectiveness of investment promotion efforts, which will entail merging the
National Center for Investment Promotion (CNPI) and the Agency for the Establishment
and Management of Industrial Zones (AZI-SA) to form a new entity, Mali Invest.
Reforms in various infrastructure sectors, including power, telecom, and railways are
either completed or under way.

The main challenge Mali faces i s diversifying its sources of growth to be able to cope
more easily with climatic changes, the volatility of the international price of primary
goods, and the limited supply response.The strategy focuses on the following themes:


0     Developing and diversifying the sources of growth through improvements in the
      investment climate to develop the private sector, including micro, small and medium
      enterprises (MSMEs);
0     Supporting sectors with highgrowth potential;
0     Setting up and maintaining required infrastructure to attract firms and improve the
      logistical chain; and
0     Enhancing skills for diffusing innovation and technology, including in the
      countryside where local development i s critical.

Sector-SpecificIssues

There are a number of sector-specific issues that the government needs to address to
establish a favorable investment and business environment, efficient infrastructure, and
higher firm-level productivity.

Investment Climate Constraints

A series of factors constraining growth stem from the shallowness of microeconomic
reforms, which result ininsufficient performance on the Doing Business indicators on the
one hand, and from constraints facing the performance of firms as found in the
investment climate assessment on the other hand. Improvements inthe overall investment
climate would foster a sustained increase in total factor productivity (TFP), which i s a
major source of growth. A growth accounting exercise performed by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2001, based on a Cobb-Douglas production function for the
entire economy linking the real GDP to labor, physical capital input, and TFP, showed
that while factor accumulation explains the bulk of output growth before the devaluation
of 1994 (with little or no role played by total factor productivity), TFP became a major
explanatory factor of growth during the 1995-2000 period, explaining about 20 percent
of output growth.2 The boost inTFF' growth is partly the result of the laggedeffects of the
structural reforms implementedinthe early 1990s. The analysis shows that maintaininga
sustained real GDP growth rate of 5-6 percent per year in the period ahead will require
TFP growth of about 2-2.5 percent per year.

The DoingBusinessindicators from the 2005 report reveal that Mali needs to bolster its
reform efforts to stimulate further both domestic and foreign investment. Inefficient
business registration process, labor market rigidities, problems with contract
enforcement, limitations to getting credlt, and weaknesses inregisteringproperty result in
missed growth opportunities. More flexibility in the labor market would help provide
more job opportunities and allow improvements in productivity and outputs. Due to
inefficiencies in the judicial system, contract enforcement requires about a full year and
entails 28 procedures. To mitigate this risk for businesses, Mali could benefit from an


  The private sector needs a minimum infrastructure plateform including an industrial zone and improved airport services to achieve
'higherand more effective investments.
  A large increase in capital stock explains the boost in average output growth between 1980-1985 and 1986-1994. Major investment
efforts were undertaken to raise cotton production, which increased by about 7 percent per year on average during 1986-1994,
comparedwith an average decline of about 1percent per year in the preceding sub-period.

                                                                   2

effective alternative dispute resolution mechanism. Income and government revenue
would increase as well. Further reforms are needed in the area of property registration,
accessing credit (which includes the difficulty of recovering a debt), protecting investors,
and closing a business. The Doing Business report found that, moving up to the top
quartile of countries on all indicators implies between 2.5 and.2.8 percentage points in
annual economic g r ~ w t hMali-specific indicators are discussed indetail in annex 1.
                                   . ~

Moreover, the 2004 Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) for Mali indicates a number
of constraints faced by firms in their operations. Cost of finance and access to finance
were ranked as major impediments to growth by more than half the firms surveyed.
Access to industrial land i s also a major constraint for more than a third of the firms.
Infrastructure constraints, such as the quality and reliability of electricity supply and the
time taken to obtain a telephone connection, increase the cost of doing business for firms.
The quality of road and rail transport facilities and services also requires improvement.
The I C A further reveals that firms perceive corruption as an important constraint to their
operations, with the cost of corruption averaging at about 3.3 percent of annual turnover.
There i s considerable room for improvement in the level of education and training and
productivity of the Malian workforce to enable it to move toward higher value-added
activities in various sectors. And finally, Mali must strengthen the capacity and capability
of institutions responsible for investment promotion and facilitation and enhance the
effectiveness of mechanisms for public-private dialogue.

Multiple Constraints to the Developmentof Sectoral Sources of Growth

Despite the government's efforts to liberalize and reform markets, the performance of the
Malian private sector has been less than impressive. Private sector employment (36,500
jobs) i s insignificant compared with employment in the rural sector (4 million jobs) and
the informal sector (1.2 million jobs). Among the factors contributing to this dismal
performance are limited local markets, low purchasing power, low productivity,
infrastructure constraints, highcosts of factor inputs, lack of slulls andhumancapital, and
overall weaknesses inthe business, regulatory, and institutional environment.

Limited access to industrialland. Access to serviced industrial land and reliable and
efficient infrastructure is a major constraint for investors. The existing industrial area at
Sotuba (in Bamako District) i s congested and dilapidated with inadequate infrastructure
and facilities. There i s an urgent needto develop an industrial zone that would encourage
new investors to start businesses and existing investors to expand them at a competitive
cost.

Poor conditions at Bamako airport: Being a landlocked country, air access i s vital for
the economic development of Mali. Conditions at Bamako International Airport, the
premier gateway to Mali, are not conducive to support the growth of the tourism industry
and the air logistics industry. The existing infrastructure and services are poor by regional
and international standards and there i s a need for significant improvements in the
operation and management of the airport to increase efficiency, safety, security and
convenience for passengers. Modem air freight handling and storage facilities are
required to address constraints such as freight security and quality of services. The
 Government has identified the upgrading of infrastructure and services at Bamako airport
 and improved management through a private concession as a key national priority.

Risk of decline in mining production. Since 2002, gold production has been nearly 60
metric tons per year, making Mali the third largest producer in Africa, after South Africa
and Ghana. In addition to this industrial production, artisanal and small-scale production
of gold occurs, estimated to be around 3 metric tons per year. On a macro level, the
financial and economic contribution of the mines i s substantial: since 1997, mining firms
paid about 40 billion FCFA in taxes, and have contributed a total of 150billion FCFA to
the economy in terms of gross payroll, local purchases of goods and services, value of
social community investments, and other contributions. However, it i s projected that gold
production will decline over the coming years unless new mines are discovered. It i s also
essential that small-scale mining be developed further so as to increase domestic
investment as well as sectoral linkages.

Untapped potential in tourism and crafts. Although statistics available on the tourism
sector are limited, trends show that Mali has managed to double tourist arrivals between
1990 and 2000, with an average receipt per tourist of $549 -a figure that only Ghana
outperformed among neighboring countries. According to the World Tourism
Organization's estimates, tourism receipts reached about $70-$90 million over the 1998-
2000 period, which represents about 3 percent of GDP. The impact of tourism on rural
development and employment i s non-negligible; and it is estimated that tourism employs
4,000 people directly, and a further 12,000 indire~tly.~ 2003, the World Travel and
                                                                    In
Tourism Council (WTTC) estimated that tourism represents 2.2 percent of Mali's
employment (65,000 jobs) and that once other activities affected by tourism are taken
into account, tourism creates 145,000 jobs directly or indirectly and provides US$199
million in income. Furthermore, tourism takes place in mainly rural areas where it can
have a substantial poverty-reducing effect on the local population. Finally, tourism also
offers synergies with the handicrafts sector that Mali is interested indeveloping further.

Limited access to telecommunications services. There has been significant progress in
the telecommunications sector in Mali with the licensing of a second national operator
responsible for doubling telephone penetration and the creation of an independent
regulatory agency. Considerable improvements, however, are requiredin the provision of
facilities and services to expand coverage and service quality (in Mali, the penetration
rate i s 2.5 lines per 100 people compared with 5.8 for Sub-Saharan Africa) and to reduce
costs for information and communications technology (ICT) services and increase their
accessibility and competitiveness in the region. Further improvements in the legal and
regulatory environment are needed to establish a level playing field, encourage private
investment and expertise, improve S M E competitiveness, and meet social goals. Mali
also needs to strengthen the capacity o f its regulatory agency inthis sector.

Limited access to financial and nonfinancial services for SMEs. As revealed in the
recent ICA, the cost of finance and the limited access to finance are rated as the most
serious constraints by enterprises. The Malian financial sector i s inadequately
developed, with the majority of banks offering traditional banking services and limiting
lending to short-term trade finance. Moreover, commercial banks lack the expertise and
resources to analyze the financial situation and risk profile of micro, small, and medium
enterprises (MSMEs).It should also be noted that the lack of reliable loan security and
effective legal and judicial protection against delinquent debtors i s the key hindrance

commercial banks face inexpanding into the MSME lending business.

2. Rationalefor BankInvolvement

The Government of Mali has requested Bank Group assistance in strengthening its
implementation of the poverty reduction strategy of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP), which calls for accelerated and equitable growth through private sector
investment. This project i s in line with the government's Policy Statement on Private
Sector Development, which sets out the growth agenda on which the government will
focus its attention and resources. In light of Mali's private sector structure, the focus on
the development of MSMEs is critical.

The proposed project draws on the Joint IDA-IFC MSMEProgram for Africa intended to
achieve greater impact for the client through close collaboration of the International
Development Association (IDA) with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and
bilateral donors, leveraging the comparative advantages of the different institutions. The
Bank will coordinate its activities closely with those of other donors active in private
sector development, including France, the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID), and Switzerland.' The Bank builds on its long track record of supporting
reforms in business environment, infrastructure development, and sector-specific support
(such as mining, tourism, and telecommunications) in both Mali and elsewhere.
Government officials, the private sector, and the donor community see the Bank as
having the knowledge and resources required to provide timely advice and technical
assistanceto manage the complexities of the program.

3. Higher Level Objectives to Which the Project Contributes

The proposed project supports the pillar of the PRSP aimed at improving the business
environment and developing infrastructure that would support key productive sectors to
enhance productivity and spur economic growth. The project i s also inline with the 2003
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), particularly under its theme of promoting growth. It
will complement the ongoing financial sector project as well as rural sector operations
that focus on diversifying agricultural exports. Moreover, the project supports the
achievement of the eighth Millennium Development Goal calling for private sector
development as a key element of the need for global partnership for development.


B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. LendingInstrument

The lending instrument used to support the proposed project i s a sector investment loan.
The project financing is a blend of IDA credit and grant. Mali qualifies for grant lending
as it i s among the poorest IDA-only countries that is particularly vulnerable to longer-
term debt sustainability problems. This particular project was selected for grant financing
because (i) private sector i s one of the key priorities of the PRSP, (ii) operation i s a
                                                                                  this
core element of the FY04-06 CAS, (iii)          the project has a strong pro-poor focus as it

supports employment creation and expansion of infrastructure services in rural areas, and
(iv) the Government has expressed a particular interest in applying IDA grants to this
project as it i s inline with the country's core development agenda.

2. Project DevelopmentObjectiveand Key Indicators

The overall project objective is to stimulate private sector investment and performance by
increasing total factor productivity and targeting sectoral sources of growth. The project
is designed to improve the investment climate, with a focus on reducing the cost of doing
business and fostering growth in sectors including mining, tourism and crafts, and
telecommunications.6

Key performance indicators, reflected in annex 3, are related to (i)investment climate,
particularly those indicated in the 2005 Doing Business report, (ii)                 availability of and
access to basic infrastructure, and (iii)support for MSME development.                               The
improvement o f the investment climate, particularly the "Doing Business" indicators, i s
expected to translate in a reduction of the cost of doing business. Moreover, successful
project implementation will result in increased private investment levels, a significant
number of new permanent jobs created, an expanded access to infrastructure services,
and increased productivity inthe private sector.

3. Project Components

This project seeks to assist Maliinimplementing its growth agenda, underpinned by the
PRSP and the private sector strategy and spelled out in the attached letter of sector
development policies (Annex 15), so as to create conditions to sustain high per capita
GDPgrowth of at least 5 percent per year on average.

To achieve this objective, the cornerstone of the agenda i s threefold: (i)              to improve the
investment climate so as to increase total factor productivity (TFP) and foster growth,
with a particular focus on SMEs and on key sectors; (ii)             to expand the availability of the
infrastructure base for private sector development; and (iii)to promote business
innovation through financial and non-financial services.

    dissemination of tourism statistics, strategy formulation and planning, image building,
    and marketing; (vi) training and certifying tourism professionals; and (vii) supporting
    linkages with external markets for both tourism and crafts.
0   EnvironmentaE aspects: (i)      conducting environmental and social impact studies; and
    (ii)providing training, information, andawarenessraising.

Component2: InfrastructureSupportfor Growth(US$24.49 million)

This component will consist of three subcomponents: (i)          developing an industrial zone,
(ii)improving Bamako airport, (ii)        strengthening infrastructure for sectoral entry points,
namely rural ICT, mining, tourism andcrafts.

Subcomponent 2.1: Industrial Park Development

To help Mali overcome the investment constraint of a shortage o f serviced industrial
land, the project will support (i)preparing detailed master and layout plans and
engineering designs for an industrial zone of up to 50 hectares (phase 1) at the site near
Bamako airport and supporting infrastructure and services; (ii)developing primary
external or off-site infrastructure, such as access roads and street furniture, intersections,
water, telecommunications and electricity supply facilities, sewerage and wastewater
treatment and disposal facilities, including costs for preparation of tender documents and
technical supervision; and (iii)       developing selected on-site facilities and services in
partnership with the private sector. Development of the industrial zone will be
implemented through a public-private partnership, with all on-site infrastructure
development as well as management of the zone to be carried out by a private entity that
will be identified through a transparent, competitive biddingprocess.

Subcomponent2.2: BamakoAirport Improvement

Bamako Airport i s the primary airport inMali, handling more than 90 percent of the total
national passenger traffic (423,500 passengers and 4.6 million kg freight in 2003).7
Bamako Airport currently serves more than ten regional airlines and one international
airline (Air France). The major passengertraffic corridors are between Bamako andParis,
Dakar, and Abidjan. The airport was first opened in 1974, the passenger terminal was
refurbished in 1994, and a second passenger arrival terminal was completed in 2002. The
existing cargo terminal, managed by a state-owned enterprise, i s in poor condition, and
freight security, in particular, is a major concern. A new airport fence was completed
recently at a cost of $1.9 million to improve airport security. But even with these recent
investments, the overall passenger and freight handling facilities are inadequate. The
priority improvements required include rehabilitating passenger and freight terminal
buildings and facilities; improving the runway, taxiways, parkmg aprons, and other
ancillary facilities; and upgrading power, water supply, waste management, and
telecommunications infrastructure.
The project will support the following efforts: (i)provision of technical advisory services
to review and update the Bamako airport master plan and designs and conduct economic
and financial analyses as required; (ii)     provision of technical advisory services to assist in
the preparation, negotiations and conclusion of a concession contract, with a private

operator to develop, operate and manage in-total all facilities and services at Bamako
airport (according to international best practice, World Bank guidelines and a competitive
bidding process) and on the principle that there will be no creation of public sector
monopolies in the process (iii)      support for the design and construction of priority
facilities and ancillary infrastructure by the private concessionnaire for the improvement
of Bamako airport, and (iv) technical assistance for the exploration of management and
financing options for secondary airports.

Subcomponent2.3: Infrastructure for SectoralEntry Points

Expansion of rural telecommunicationsand ICT. Under this subcomponent, activities
will aim at expanding the telecommunications network in rural areas to increase
teledensity and create new opportunities in those areas. The project will (i)   provide seed
capital in the universal access fund in the amount of $2.5 million to launch the program
on a meaningful scale; (ii)   help prepare all upstream work that would allow transparent
delivery of services; and (iii)  based on the recently finalized ICT strategy, support pilot
multipurpose projects in selected areas. Project funds will cover an output-based aid
(OBA) scheme for a certain number of pilot projects and will provide technical assistance
for the preparation of OBA in the launching, follow up, and marketing of the bidding
process.

Tourism and crafts. To further stimulate the demand of Mali as a tourist destination, this
subcomponent will help improve the quality of basic infrastructurein the tourism sector.
In the crafts subsector, the focus will be put on promoting traditional textiles.
Specifically, the project will help (i)support the rehabilitation of a dozen historic
monuments in Timbuktu and Mopti, (ii)        provide basic accommodations (rural camping
sites) in Mopti and Djenne; (iii)   enhance selected tourist trails; and (iv) rehabilitate and
equip the traditional textile center ("tissuth2que").

Mining development. Increasing the attractiveness of small-scale mining and building
linkages are crucial in maximizing the economic impact of mining activities. To that end,
the project will support (i)  the set-up and operation of pilot demonstration units for gold
and precious stones production, and (ii)     diversification efforts with a focus on plaster,
construction materials, and industrial minerals (for example, alhor andcoltan).

Component 3: Financial andNonfinancial Servicesfor Innovation and Development
(US$8.83 million)

This component aims at fostering innovation in the Malian private sector through the
provision of term financing services andquality business development services.

Subcomponent3.1: Access to Finance

This subcomponent will provide technical assistance to increase availability of term
finance and other specialized products suitable for MSMEs. It will consist of two
products: a credit enhancement facility and a trade finance enhancement facility. A third
product, a standby liquidity facility, may also be introduced in the project if discussions
with the Banque Centrale d'Afrique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) on this issue are successful.



                                               9

Credit Enhancement Facility. This innovative product i s designed to help local banks
raise medium- and long-term funding for MSME financing. IDA and IFC will help
mobilize a debt instrument such as a "long-term certificate deposit" to be issued in the
local or regional market by local Malian banks. This product will enable the
issuerhorrower to access local currency term debt at competitive pricing and establish its
name in the market. The IDA financing, in conjunction with IFC financing, would be
used for one or two pilot bond offerings, providing a demonstration effect to the local
market, after which, the residual IDA resources could be reallocated to other project
components. This facility is being developed in coordination with the ongoing IDA
Financial Sector Development Credit in Mali. The proposed project will provide a
guarantee o f up to US$3.5 million to enable Commercial banks to mobilize resources for
term lending to SMEs.

Trade Finance Enhancement Facility. A large number of the MSMEs in Mali are
trading companies that import a variety of goods to sell inthe local market. Most of these
imports are financed on a cash basis and outside of the formal financial system because
of the limited accessibility of trade confirmation lines from international banks available
to the local Malian banks for trade finance. As a result, cash collateral requirements for
confirmation of letters of credit (UCs) by foreign banks are very high and in many
instances equivalent to 100percent of the value o f the goods being imported. This facility
will complement and support the IFC's Trade Finance Enhancement Facility, which is
intended to increase the confirmation lines available to local Malian banks by providing
guarantees (up to 50 percent) to international confirming banks and thereby reducing the
level of cash collateral required. Ultimately, this product would facilitate easier access to
trade. IDA resources will be used only for the training of commercial banks' staff
involved inthe use of the proposed facility.

Standby Liquidity Facility. This product i s designed to address a key constraint faced
by local Malian banks whereby the local banks have an opportunity to increase term
lending targeted at MSMSEs but are constrained by the tenor of their key source of
funding-their     deposit book. By covering the mismatch risk through this facility, the
local banks can comfortably finance longer tenor assets using available short-term
deposits without violating the prudential requirements related to the transformation ratio.
The proposed structure is subject to approval by the regional regulatory authorities
(BCEAO and the Commission Bancaire) who will have to accept the Standby Liquidity
Facility as an instrument for managing liquidity risk. Pending the conclusion of the
dialogue with BCEAO and the banking commission, no direct funding from this project
i s set aside to support this instrument.

Subcomponent3.2: BusinessDevelopment Services

This subcomponent would address market failures that limitthe ability of SMEs to obtain
the necessary skills and business services to exploit opportunities and overcome
bottlenecks. On the demand side, the subcomponent would finance (i)        market linkages,
value chain programs, and firm-level consultancies through a matching grant and other
BDS instruments as needed; and (ii)a M S M E financing mentoring program. On the
supply side, it would finance (i)   a consultant development and accreditation program; and
(ii) entrepreneurship support for microenterprises. Under this subcomponent, support will
be provided specifically to selected value chains that have a high potential to create jobs
for the poor (for example, the artisanal textile industry and leather activities), as well as

                                               10

to enterprises to improve their competitiveness through an increased focus on quality
management.

Component 4: Project Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation (US$3.02
million)

The project will be implementedprimarily by technical ministries and agencies involved,
with the technical support of a project coordination unit (PCU). During project
preparation, the government appointed the National Center for Investment Promotion
(CNPI) to serve as project coordinator with the support o f the Financial Sector
Development Project Implementation Unit for procurement and financial management
activities. The government is currently taking the necessary steps to competitively select
the staff o f a PCU that will be placed under the purview of the Ministry of Investment
Promotion and Small and Medium Enterprises. The PCU will be accountable to the
project steering committee and will oversee procurement, financial management,
reporting, audits, monitoring, and evaluation for the project. In addition, the PCU will
hire, as needed, technical assistance to help implement specific activities such as those
pertainingto accessto finance and direct support to enterprises.

Although partner organizations will retain oversight of relevant technical aspects of the
project, the coordination arrangement will ensure the needed strong complementarity in
both policies and implementation so project objectives are met. The PCU will be
responsible for preparing biannual progress reports, facilitating the mid-term progress
review, ensuring adequate monitoring and evaluation, undertakingthe impact assessment
of the project, ensuring an orderly closing of the project, and leading the preparation of
the implementation completion report.

4. LessonsLearned and Reflectedinthe Project Design

The project design draws extensively on lessons learned from the previous private sector
development project completed in 2002 and other Bank assistance experience in Mali. It
also leverages global knowledge in all areas covered by the project. Project preparation
benefited from inputs from various units of the World Bank and involved expertise of the
World Bank's Global Product Groups such as the Small and Medium Enterprise
Department, Mining, Global Information and Communication Technologies Department
(GICT), and other units such as the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), IFC,
and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).

During project preparation, the team took into consideration lessons learned in various
relevant areas, particularly those pertaining to         business environment, MSME
development (including business development services), and industrial zones.

In the area of the business environment, previous Bank and FIAS reports have been
followed by action plans that were managed by a series of committees without much
contact with firm-level realities. The new approach adopted in this project design i s to
build on actual findings from a firm-level survey carried out in preparation of the
investment climate assessment. Moreover, instead of relying only on the perspective of
the local private sector, the project has benefited from the prospective global investors
who are members of the Presidential Investors' Council that was launched in September
2004, and will continue to meet semi-annually. These two features allow a public-private

                                            11

sector dialogue based on measurable performance criteria on the one hand, while keeping
inmindthat Malihasto compete inglobalmarkets on the other.

With respect to MSME development, the project design draws on findings and
recommendations spelled out in the joint IDA-IFC framework for M S M E Program for
Africa (December 2003). Under this framework, it was noted that the design of a M S M E
development program should integrate the business environment, access to finance, and
capacity-building activities. In that context, the Small and Medium Enterprise
Department, along with the Africa Project Development Facility (APDF), IFC, and
MIGA, has stepped upits contribution inthis program design from the outset, rather than
being brought on board for cross-support during project implementationonly. Taking into
account the shallowness of Mali's BDS market experienced in the previous private sector
development project, this project will emphasize the enhancement of the quality o f the
supply, while action on the demand side will remain of a pilot nature, except for targeted
value chains that are expected to play a demonstration role.

Regarding the industrial zone, the design has factored in the lessons learned from
decades o f experience around the world, including that of other African countries such as
Botswana, Cameroon, Kenya, Madagascar, and Senegal. From the outset, it was noted
that access to industrial land should be linked to the investment promotion effort, which
i s the push behind the proposed merger of AZI-SA and CNPI to form Mali Invest to
integrate the supply of quality infrastructure with an efficient regulatory regime. Mali, as
a major cotton producer, could benefit from the African Growth and Opportunity Act
(AGOA) advantages by creating conditions for increased investment in the textile
industry, which would of course require land. Where industrial parks are based on strong
private sector interest and are part of the overall sector strategy to enhance
competitiveness, they have the ingredients to be successful. Buildingon the global trends
of privately developed and managed zones with the public sector as regulator and
facilitator, the government has agreed that Mali Invest will focus on the public sector role
and a private sector entity will manage the industrial park.

5. Alternatives Consideredand Reasonsfor Rejection

The project encompasses a large development agenda tabled by the Government of Mali
from various sectoral perspectives. Until 2002, a stand-alone telecommunications project
was under preparation. Duringthe same period, as a private sector development project
was coming to an end, it had become obvious that further work was needed in the areas
of investment climate improvement and MSME development. Moreover, a miningsector
support project was also considered. In the context of the EyO4-06 CAS preparation,
there was a realization that the common denominator was the quest for private sector-led
growth, and it was agreed with the government to design a project focusing on sources of
growth rather than stand-alone sector-specific projects.

The project team discussed the alternative of addressing the MSME agenda on the one
hand and the distinctive needs of each sector considered as an entry point on the other
hand. However, this scenario would have led to ajuxtaposition of loosely related sets of
activities and was eventually rejected. The proposed integrated approach allows a sound
treatment of cross-sectoral issues pertaining to investment climate and institutional
capacity building, basic infrastructure needs, and linkages and complementarities among
sectors so as to maximize the growth potential.

                                             12

The option of providing support through a budget support-type operation was also
rejected because the provision of direct support in technical assistance, training, and
physical investments i s better suited in the Mali context to a project approach. At the
same time, the sector policy dialogue that will be sustained under the proposed project
will pay attention to the needed policy and legislative reforms that can help unleash
Mali's potential growth.
The option adopted was then to design a project comprising multiple sets of mutually
reinforcing activities, organized in accordance with the growth accounting framework.
The project seeks not only to increase investment levels but also to enhance their
effectiveness through improved productivity.


C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. PartnershipArrangements

In addition to leveraging synergies between IDA, IFC and MIGA, the proposed project
builds on and complements a series of other bilateral and multilateral donors'
interventions to foster private sector development. These include particularly France, the
European Union, and USAID. France i s playing an active role in a wide range of areas
including support to business associations, airport infrastructure, and access to finance.
The EU is providing support in the mining sector. Through its Mali Finance project,
USAID is involved in investment promotion activities. It i s expected that the African
Development Bank and the Islamic Development Bank will provide further assistance to
Mali inareas covered by the project.

2. InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements

Institutionalarrangements.The project will be implementedunder the purview of the
Ministry of Investment Promotion and Small and Medium Enterprises (MIP),which will
lead a public-private steering committee composed of representatives of key project
stakeholders. Operational implementation will be led by a project coordination unit
(PCU) inthe ministrythat will be supported by selected staff in technical ministries and
a private sector agency to which the implementation of financial and nonfinancial
services to enterprises will be contracted.
Financialmanagement.Within the PCU, financial management and accounting of funds
will be handled by a financial management specialist, assisted by an accountant. These
two staff will be responsible for (i)  preparing activity plans, monthly Special Account
(SA) reconciliation statements, and quarterly Statement of Expenditures (SOEs),
withdrawal schedule, quarterly financial monitoring reports, and annual financial
statements; and (ii)ensuring that the project financial management arrangements are
acceptable to the government and IDA, and that reporting to both entities i s accurate and
timely.
Flow of funds. The overall project funding will consist of IDA funds and counterpart
funds. With respect to banking arrangements, IDA will disburse the credit and grant
through two SAs opened and operated by the PCU. Three accounts will be maintainedby
the PCU: (i)an SA in FCFA, representing four months o f activity, to which the initial
deposit and replenishments from IDA funds will be lodged for payments of eligible

                                             13

expenditures; and (ii) Current (Project) Account in FCFA, to which counterpart funds
                         a
will be deposited. Interest income will be deposited to the respective accounts.
Additionally, an IDA creditlgrant Account will be opened and maintained in U.S.
dollars/FCFA/SDR to keep track o f drawdowns from IDA creditlgrant. The account will
show deposits made by IDA, direct payments by IDA, as well as opening and closing
balances.
Financial reporting. All bank accounts will be reconciled with bank statements on a
monthly basis by the PCU's finance department. Any difference will be investigated
expeditiously and remediedin a timely manner. A quarterly financial management report
(FMR) and audited annual financial statementswill be produced and submitted on time to
IDA.
A fully integrated financial and accounting system will be set up using appropriate
software as well as a detailed manual of financial procedures and chart of accounts,
including the format, content, and periodicity of the various financial statements to be
produced and submitted.

3. Monitoring and Evaluationof OutcomesLResults

An emphasis will be put on monitoring and evaluation to ensure that the proposedproject
achieves its development objectives. Under the MSME initiative, a monitoring and
evaluation framework is being formulated with a view to comparing results among
participating countries. The PCU will prepare monthly monitoring tables for the intemal
project management in which sectoral focal points will be involved. The unit will also
prepare quarterly progress reports for the steering committee and submit semiannual
progress reports to the World Bank.

The Project Implementation Manual (PIM) will include all periodic reporting,
monitoring, and evaluation arrangements throughout its implementation period. Financial
management and procurement plans, of which a draft plan for the two first years has
already been prepared, will be part of the PIM.

Outcome indicators to be collected will include the number of formal enterprises created,
increases in employment, and increases in the value of exports. To achieve that, the PSU
will liaise, inter alia, with the National Statistics and Industry Directorate (DNSI), the
commercial registry, and other relevant institutions.

In addition to periodic reports, independent operational audits will be carried out every
two years to assess impacts and identify ways to improve project implementation. The
2004 ICA and Doing Business indicators serve as elements of the base line, and they will
be updated in the course of project implementation. A mid-term review will be carried
out no later than 30 months after the project start, which will be an opportunity to
integrate lessons learned from the first period of project implementation so as to
maximize its results.

4. Sustainability

The proposed assistance to the Government of Mali through this project -which
encompasses financial, technical, institutional, and policy support in key areas critical to
growth- i s expected to trigger permanent improvements in the policy and institutional
                                             14

environment, to stimulate private investment, and to create new economic opportunities
for the poor in rural areas. The participatory approach of various stakeholders and their
empowerment throughout the implementation period are ingredients of ownership that
will ensure that policy changes are irreversible and that actions are sustained. The
implementation strategy of making technical ministries and private sector agencies
accountable for their respective segments of the project, with the skills enhancement
throughout    the implementation phase, will substantially contribute to project
sustainability. Moreover, all infrastructure developments financed by this project will be
sustained beyond the closing date and will be operated by the private sector, thus
increasing the latter's participation.

5. Critical Risks and Possible Controversial Aspects

The project i s designed on the assumption that the government will fulfill its
commitments on policy reform and that a number of critical conditions will be in place
for the duration of the project: (i)political and macroeconomic stability will continue and
impacts of shocks from adverse climatic and natural conditions will be manageable; (ii)
the government will remain committed to private sector-led growth and private-public
partnerships; and (iii) substantial improvements will be achieved in the management o f
major public utilities, especially power and water. The government has demonstrated a
commitment to growth and a willingness to establish dialogue with the private sector at
the highest level by establishing the Presidential Investors' Council. This commitment is
expected to continue. As part of its reform programs, the government has committed to
private sector participation in infrastructure (for example, in the transport and utilities
sectors), andthis commitment i s expected to strengthen.

Specific assumptions have also been made inrelation to each component, including that:
        Mali Invest will be established quickly through enactment of appropriate
        legislation under the new Investment Code (and both CNPI and AZI-SA will be
        dissolved through proper legal and administrative process).
        The government will maintain support of a secretariat for the Presidential
        Investors' Council to actively manage the process and implementation of the
        resulting actions andpolicy reforms.
        The government will concession the development, operation and management o f
        Bamako airport in total and the concessionaire will develop and manage the
        industrial zone either directly or through a secondary concession to a property
        developer.
        Pending legislation on the management of ground handling services at Bamako
        Airport will not create a monopolistic situation and will not adversely affect the
        processto secure the airport concessionaire.
        All prior commitments made by AZI-SA on allocation of industrial land sites will
        be managed through a transparent andjudicious process.
        Co-financing from the government and other donors will be in place for the
        development of the industrial zone at the airport.
        Support institutions, such as Mali Invest and OMATHO will be willing to change
        and respond to the measuresby government.
        Inter-ministerial coordination and cooperation will be strengthened especially at
        the level of the Steering Committee and the Technical Committee for the
        development of the airport and industrial zone.

                                              15

0 There i s adequate power-generation capacity to meet the initial demand of
  industries at the airport industrial zone.




                                         16

The project includes features aimed at mitigating key risks. First, a provision has been
made to support strengthening capacity within the key agencies, including consultancy
support and expert assistance as-needed for the entire life of the credit. Second, the
Project Steering Committee (PSC) will carefully monitor the implementation risks. The
PSC will include government representatives who have had previous experience in
dealing with IDA projects, as well as private sector representatives familiar with the
problems and characteristics o f enterprises in Mali. Third, the risk of lack of donor
coordination will be addressed by the PSC, which will liaise closely with all donors
interested in private sector development issues, as well as through the ongoing donor
coordination groups. Fourth, the risks of inadequate commitment to policy reforms and
institutions' unwillingness to change will be addressed by linkmg key aspects to the
PRSC instrument when Mali reachesthat stage.

It is expected that the PSC and the PCUwill perform well under the strong leadership of
the MIP. However, should the project implementation arrangements not perform as
expected, provisions have been made so that the government, in agreement with the
World Bank, can change the implementing partner to another institution or to a private
sector firm. The Bank will maintain active supervision to help resolve problems if they
arise.

Financial management aspects. The 2003 Mali Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) concluded that significant progress has been made in the areas of
financial management and that the country's own control systems are operating quite
efficiently despite a few weaknesses inthe supervision of projects.

Various measures to mitigate these risks have been identified, and thus the project risk
from a financial management perspective could be rated as moderate, provided that the
risk-mitigating measures are properly addressed. Therefore, financial management
arrangements are designed to facilitate the compliance with IDA fiduciary requirements
andto ensure that funds are used for the purpose intended and that timely information is
produced for project management and government oversight.

Table 1 identifies the key risks that project management may face in achieving its
objectives and provides a basis for determining how management should address these
risks.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. EconomicandFinancialAnalyses

The economic analysis reveals a net present value (NPV) of US$39.6 million, which
corresponds to an economic rate o f return of 26.1 percent. The project is expected to have
a wide range of positive impacts, including increased productivity and outputs in
supported MSMEs, increased production and exports from small-scale mining, job
creation in supported MSMEs, industrial park development, stronger tourism and
handicrafts sector, increased tax revenues generated from expanded tax base, and
increased access to infrastructure services. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the fiscal
impact i s positive in every scenario. As to financial analysis, it will be carried out for
both the industrial park and the airport once the private operators are selected.

2. Technical

Several features of the proposed project will bring new technology and management
know-how to Mali, particularly in the case of the industrial park, the privatization o f the
telecommunications incumbent, the universal access scheme of telecommunications
services and ICT, the demonstration centers in the mining sector, and business
development services. The latter will provide the impetus for skills and technological
upgrading within all sectors, with a high potential of sustainability beyond the life of the
project. At the core of this project i s the quest for improved MSME productivity as well
as both quality and reliability of products and services. It i s also expected that linkages
within the industries will evolve into competitive clusters that will play a sustained role in
technology diffusion. The technical analysis for the industrial park indicates positive
benefits not only in terms o f manufacturing growth and direct employment, but also
indirect employment and impacts on the services sector. In addition, there are synergies
to be tapped from the proximity of the industrial zone to the airport in terms of
developing a new urban growth center. As for the airport improvement, the current
technical feasibility analysis projects positive benefits on the travel and tourism industry
from the enhanced image of Bamako Airport as a safe, convenient and efficient gateway
into Mali as well as improving air access to the various tourism destinations in the
country. There are also potential opportunities for the growth of the air logistics industry.

3. Fiduciary

Duringproject preparation, the financial sector development project provided technical
support in the area of procurement. The recruitment of a procurement specialist i s
currently under way, and the contract will be signed before effectiveness. The financial
management assessments conclude that, provided the effectiveness conditions are met,
the Bank's financial management requirements will be satisfied.

The report-based disbursement method will be applied only after a satisfactory
assessment is carried out by the Bank financial management specialist (FMS) within the
first 12 implementation months. Meanwhile, the project will use the transaction-based
disbursement procedures (that is, direct payment, reimbursement, and special
commitments), as described in the World Bank Disbursement Handbook.



                                              19

4. Social

Consultations with key stakeholders within the public sector, the private sector, and civil
society were conducted throughout project preparation. The investment climate
assessment process thoroughly involved the private sector as well as professional
associations. The Presidential Investors' Council also contributed to confirming most of
the priority issues that need to be addressed to improve the business environment and
position Mali in the global economy which initially includes market opportunity
identification, governance, infrastructure, access to finance, human capital development.
In sectors where the project provides for support, key players were involved in the
definition of the scope of activities and they will remain engaged duringimplementation.
Youth and women, in particular, are expected to benefit from this project because they
are heavily involved in crafts and tourism-related activities. Owing to the expected
improvement in investment climate, combined with the availability of an industrial park,
the project i s expected to attract new investments.

5. Environment

As a category B project, the Mali Growth Support Project was required, under World
Bank safeguard policies, to prepare a Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment
(SESA), based on the triggering of the environmental assessment policy (OP/BP 4.01).
An international consulting firm, Cabinet GES-Conseil,          conducted the SESA in
conjunction with local consultants in relevant sectors covered under the project. The firm
used a broad consultation approach, in close collaboration with, but not limited, to the
ministries: mines; tourism and hotel industry and associated trades; transport;
infrastructure; industries and industrial zone development; environment and natural
resources; health; and labor. It also involved civil society, including local and regional
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), village community representatives, and other
relevant stakeholder and interest groups.

The specific objective of the SESA study was to assess the environmental and social
impacts of current and future investment activities in the country, following national and
World Bank standards for strategic environmental assessments and to propose measures
to mitigate, avoid, or compensate for the negative environmental and social impacts.
Proposed actions included technical and social measures, institutional andlegal measures,
research, and awareness building. The SESA also identified requirements for monitoring
andenforcement of recommended procedures, along with relevant monitoring indicators
pertaining to each sector. The study clearly outlined the institutional arrangements and
defined the roles and responsibilities of various parties involved in the mitigation and
remediation actionplans from institutional, regulatory, and technical points of view.

The SESA was submitted to ASPEN and has been reviewed and judged satisfactory.
Clearance of the SESA report was granted by the Regional Safeguard Coordinator on
October 19, 2004. Disclosure of the study took place in Mali on November 15, 2004 and
at World Bank InfoShop on December 28,2004.

6. Safeguard Policies

The strategic environmental and social assessment carried out underthis project provides
a framework that will be applied throughout the implementation of all planned activities.

                                              20

  Attention to safeguards will be ensured not only by complying with IDA'Ssafeguards
  policies and Malian environmental regulations, but also by ensuring that investors
  operating in the industrial park apply environmentally and socially sound business
  practices (table 2). For that reason, the project has made provisions to contribute to
  strengthening the capacity of the Malian institutions that will oversee these issues,
  specifically the Ministry of Environment and other relevant ministries.

  7. PolicyExceptionsand Readiness

  The project does not require any exceptions from IDA policies. All actions needed to
  meet fiduciary requirements and safeguards policies compliance have been taken or will
  be taken by effectiveness. A draft procurement plan has already been discussed at the
  time of pre-appraisal, and financial management systems, satisfactory to IDA, will be
  installed before project effectiveness. ASPEN has already cleared the strategic
  environmental impact assessment, and adequate budgeting has been provided in the
  project costs. Plans for staff and consultant mobilization have also been made to ensure
  adequate implementation support. The implementation o f the proposed project will be
  carried out in a sequenced manner supported by careful procurement planning. With
  respect to the Industrial park and the airport in particular, it i s expected that the two first
  years will be mostly devoted to carrying out comprehensive technical feasibility studies
  (building on the pre-feasibility work carried out during project preparation) and to
  selecting competitively the respective private operators.

Economic Backgroundand Sectoral Issues

Mali i s currently in a period of significant economic growth. However, one of the main
challenges facing Mali is the diversification of its sources of growth to be able to cope
more easily with climatic changes, the volatility of the international price of primary
goods, and a limited supply response. These challenges require Mali to develop and
diversify economic activities and to improve the investment climate to be more able to
sustain private sector development, includingMSMEs.

RecentEconomicDevelopment
Mali's economy is dominated by exports of cotton, gold, and livestock. About 90 percent
of Mali's export revenues come from these goods. The country belongs to the CFA zone,
which largely drives its economic evolution. Mali has a small open economy that
operates under a fixed exchange rate regime and i s a price taker. Since the beginning of
economic reforms implementedwith the assistance of the BrettonWoods institutions and
the 1994 devaluation, GDP has increased in real terms by an average of 5.6 percent a
year. The estimated growth for 2003 i s around 6 percent, the average annual inflation rate
i s around 2 percent, and the volume of exports has on average increased by 13 percent
annually. The public sector deficit has dwindled with time, decreasing from 13 percent of
GDP in the mid-1990s to 8 percent in 2002. The level of public expenditures, however,
remains unchanged at about one-fourth of GDP. (For key macroeconomic indicators, see
table Al.1.).

Although the favorable macroeconomic developments have allowed GDP per capita to
expand significantly, the incidence of poverty remains high, and most people still earn
less than a dollar a day (at 1995 constant prices).

 growth has been the influx of foreign
 capital into the economy and the recovery
 of exports. The devaluation triggered a
 massive inflow of official development
 assistance (ODA), but only for a short
 period. Starting inat1998, ODA declined
 to its 1993 levels,15 percentof

Exports have increased in a sustainable manner and now account for about a third of the
GDPcompared with only about 16percent in 1993, shortly before the devaluation of the
CFA Franc.

As previously mentioned, the Malian economy i s dominated by exports of gold, cotton,
and livestock. Iti s worth mentioning, however, that exports of cotton have been declining
since 1996, declining from 61 percent of total exports to 22.4 percent by 2002. Unlike
cotton, exports of gold have significantly risen from 18 percent of total exports in 1996 to
an impressive 65.4 percent in 2002. This specialization andreliance on specific products
from the primary sector implies some risks for the future. Mali, like many other
developing nations, faces a long-term deterioration of its terms of trade.

Sectoral Developments

Within the recent context of sustained economic growth, the share of industry increased
significantly by the end of the period. Industry, which includes mining, manufacturing,
and others, went from 18.9 percent of GDP in 1996 to almost 30 percent in 2002. This
growth comes largely from gold mining, whose share of GDP increased from 2.9 percent
in 1994 to 12.7 percent in 2002, and the development of other industries such as
construction, water, and energy, whose share in GDP increased from 8.3 to 13.8 percent
over the same period. Conversely,          the share of manufacturing in GDP was halved
between 1994 and 2002, declining from 7.7 percent to 3.2 percent.

At a more disaggregated level, Mali's economy is dominated by mining (15 percent of
GDP), trade (13.8 percent of GDP), food crops (11.3 percent of GDP), and livestock
farming (10.3 percent of GDP).

The private sector accounts for about 90 percent of GDP and employment. It dominates
in agriculture and the informal sector. About 80 percent of the firms operate in the
informal sector and are located in the capital city area, Bamako. In the early 2000s, the
labor force was around 5.2 million, with the informal sector employing around 1.2
million, and the agriculture sector around 3.9 million. The formal modem sector i s small
in comparison, employing only about 21,500 workers in 2002 (2003 firm census data).
Agro-industry and agriculture are the main providers of employment within the modem
formal sector, accounting for 37.8 and 22.4 percent of total employment, respectively
(FigureA1.4).

Agriculture sector. Agriculture, livestock, and other agricultural activities remain one of
the pillars of the country's economy. These activities accounted for about 34.2percent of
GDP in 2002, about 22.4 percent of formal employment for the same year, and a large
part of the population depends on this sector (formal and informal) for their livelihood.
The geographic area for livestock i s located in the northern part of the country and
around the Niger delta, whereas agricultural production i s mainly located in the south.
Mali i s the biggest producer of cotton in the franc zone. In 2001-2002, Malian cotton
accounted for about 22.6 percent of the total production in the franc zone. Malian cotton
i s largely known for its high quality and low production costs, but with small returns by
intemational standards. Production is almost entirely undertaken on a small-scale basis,
mainly by cooperatives in villages, and i s coordinated by the Cotton Sector Parastatal
(CMDT).        *
Miningsector. Mali has recently become one of the countries where production of gold
has grown the fastest. It producedonly 6.5 tons in 1995, but by 2002 it produced 63 tons
(an average annual increase of 32.8 percent over the period). Maliis now the thrd largest
gold-exporting country in Sub-Saharan Africa, after South Africa and Ghana. Fiscal
receipts to the government have been substantial: in 2003, a total of FCFA 46 billion
(approximately US$90 million) were paid by mining companies in terms of royalties,
indirect taxes, profits taxes, dividends, and customs duties. In addition to taxes, it i s
estimated that since 1997 mining companies have purchased local goods and services in
the amount of FCFA 152 billion and have created valuable social and physical
infrastructures at the mining sites. The increase in output partly results from the creation
of a new investment code introduced in 1999 to promote investment in the sector and
provide fiscal incentives, such as a tax reduction on miningrevenues from 6 to 3 percent.
Inaddition, the increase ingoldprices inrecent years fostered the development of mining
and e~ploration.~small decline in the production can be expected in the near future as
                            A
current stocks mature. It i s worth noting, however, that the current mining code now
shows some limits. The mines currently in use are close to the surface, but to continue
production, further digging will be required, which will increase production costs.
Furthermore, incentives within the miningcode decrease over time and are being de facto
reduced at a time when producers may need some assistance. So, in spite of phenomenal

  On March29, 2004, the price of gold reached US$421per ounce, its highest level in 14 years. Becausethe world demand for gold is
relatively stable, the recentincreasesmainly reflect downward expectationsof intemationalinvestors on the dollar and stock indices.

growth, all is not well within the sector. There are a number of weaknesses in the
government's ability to derive maximum benefit from the country's mineral potential.

The main challenge i s that it will be difficult to maintain production at current levels past
2011. The gold reserves are estimated at about 600-800 tons, about 10 years of
production at the current extraction rate. And mining operations are now using mineral
reserves discovered 15 to 20 years ago. Without new efforts ingeoscience management at
a regional scale by government and detailed exploration by the private companies, the
current reserves will be exhausted and production will begin to decline. Even though
some new projects may offset the decline, new exploration i s essential if gold i s to
continue its contribution to Mali's economic development. Figures A1.5 and A1.6
illustrate the projecteddecline infuture gold production.

An effort to improve productivity in small-scale mining is also needed. It is estimated
that over 150,000 persons derive a livelihood from small-scale mining. The installation of
small washing and milling equipment would help increase productivity and improve
health conditions.

Moreover, the government and private sector companies have difficulties in maximizing
benefit streams to local communities. Some of the private sector companies have begun
programs to emphasize linkages with local communities and to provide more in terms of
basic services and assistance. However, this i s not true for all of the mines, many of
                                                       26

which have endured community protests and labor strife. In particular, the issues related
to mine closure need to be addressed on an urgent basis, because some o f the mines will
be closing within the next five years. Government departments need to be strengthened
and procedures adopted to ensure that local communities accrue greater benefits and that
closure issues are handledproperly. At the national level, the government could do more
to properly record, report, and disclose the revenue streams it receives from the
companies. Many resource-rich countries have endorsed the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative, which provides a mechanism to disclose on a periodic basis the
receipt of revenue streams and can do much to lessen criticism that funds have been
misappropriated.

The government i s determined to derive more benefits from the mining sector on a
sustainable basis. To this end, policy pronouncements of the president and prime minister
in October 2002 and May 2004 underline three axes of government policy to rejuvenate
activities in the sector: training, local communities, and governance. Within these three
principal areas, this project will undertake actions to address the following specific
weaknesses and challenges:

        Capacity constraints in the mining administration, including lack o f motivated
        personnel and antiquated (office and laboratory) equipment;
        Inadequate or poor mix of skills in mining administration as well as aging
        supervisory workforce;
        Ineffective management of geoscience databases, lack of new exploration,
        cartography, anddeposit identification;
        Ineffective administration of the environment due to lack of appropriate
        legislation and standards, and capacity constraints in respect of impact
         assessments, monitoring, andpollution prevention programs;
        Inadequate management of social and economic impacts at the national and local
         levels;
        Inadequate procedures for recording, reconciling, and disclosing revenue streams
        paidby companies to the government;
         Absence of any structured programs to assist small-scale miners, especially to
         improve the living andworking conditions inthe miningcamps;
        Lack of precision and contentious elements inthe mining taxation regime and its
         application;
         Inability of various government departments to coordinate and communicate; and
         Lack of emphasis on diversification or investment in construction, quarry, and
         industrial minerals.

Tourism and handicrafts.Tourismis an important sector for Mali, accounting for an
estimated 3 percent of GDP and 2 percent o f total employment, and with potential
impacts on alleviating rural poverty. Tourist arrivals to Mali have doubled between 1990
and 2000, and Mali registered the second highest average receipts per tourist in West
Africa in 2002. A study by the Ministry of Tourism, UNDP, and the World Tourism
Organization in June 2003 identified opportunities to establish Mali as a diversified
tourism destination by promoting existing qnd potential cultural and historical sites such
 as Dagon country, Djenne, Mopti, Gao, Segou, Sikasso, and Timbuktu (a number of
which are designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites), as well as desert and Niger
river attractions and wildlife reserves (Bafing, Boucle du Baoule, and Gourma).
However, the study also highlighted a number of constraints hindering the growth of the
                                             27

sector: limited availability of quality accommodations (no proper rating system), variable
quality and service standards of accommodation facilities and restaurants, shortage of
trained and qualified tourist guides, accessibility barriers (frequency, reliability, and cost
of local air travel), issues related to the rehabilitation, renovation, and maintenance of
tourism sites, and weak capacity for tourism promotion and development in the OfJice
Malien du Tourisme et de 2'HhteZZerie (OMATHO). The latter has relatively few
specialized tourism professionals and a dysfunctional work program owing to the
multiplicity of its functions. A long-term objective would be to review its personnel
training scheme and organizational structure.
Untilrecently, tourism made little contribution to the development of the services sector,
inspite of the existence of historic sites of major interest (such as Djenne andTimbuktu).
Thanks to investments made for the "Africa Cup o f Nations," the country increased the
number of hotels to 134 (2,500 rooms) in 2001 from only 50 (900rooms) in 1992. One of
the major obstacles facing the sector i s the lack of adequate transportation for tourists
traveling between Bamako and the tourist areas, a factor that strongly limits the
operations of travel agents.
Exploiting Mali's potential must be achieved by addressing issues of (i)      clear legal and
regulatory framework, (ii)institutional rationalization and capacity building for all
professionals in the sector, (iii) sustainable impact on the environment and populations,
and (iv) building linkages with the local economy by encouraging the purchase of
equipment and products from local suppliers.

The other sector that needs attention is handicrafts. Because it employs such a large
number of people,       developing this sector can have an important poverty-reducing
impact. It i s estimated that about three-quarters of Mali's population lives in rural areas,
relying on agriculture and handicraft for subsistence, and a large share of the urban
population earns its living from artisanal products and services as well. Although reliable
statistics are not available, the national handicraft promotion agency estimates that up to
40 percent of the population is employed as full-time craftsmen. The artisanal sector,
within which the vast majority of articles are manufactured by individual craftsmen or
small enterprises, tends to employ more people than the larger manufacturing operations.
The handicrafts sector has been confrontedby more stringent demands by consumers for
quality and price competitiveness, often requiring investment in machinery to assist
craftsmen and provide training. Thus, support for the handicrafts sector is expected to
come in the form o f strengthening the economic situation of craftsmen (through grants,
for example); providing technical assistance to improve the range, marketability, and
quality of the sector; and encouraging professional, technical, and business education.

Since 2002, the World Bank Group has developed, on a pilot basis, a partnership with the
National Federation of Artisans of Mali (FNAM) aimed at buildingcapacity o f craftsmen
and microentrepreneurs in the area of business management. Youth college graduates
(called "cadets") have received training to work with artisans; as of the end of 2004, ten
cadets have been deployed in four regions of Mali (Bamako, Koulikoro, Skgou, and
Sikasso).

The highest potential for exporting handicrafts, with a proven record of marketability in
international markets, relates to the following products:
    0   Textiles, with every region havingtheir own designs and usingcotton (in southern
        areas) or wool (in northern areas). The most renowned Malian textile is the
        bogolan, based on cotton material and decorated with traditional patterns using
        natural dyes;
    0   Leather products, which could benefit from the combined advantage that Mali has
        a large livestock sector and two industrial tanneries;
    0   Jewelry, with a markedincrease inthe demand for African jewelry;
    0   Sculptures made from wood and stone, depicting human and animal forms, which
        have enjoyed growing worldwide popularity;
    0   Traditional musical instruments, with demand rising in line with the increasing
        interest inAfrican music;
    0   Pottery, with every region inMali having its own distinctive shapes andcolorings.

A value chain analysis of the two first subsectorswas carried out inthe context of this
project preparation; and this project will provide targeted support to their development.

However, a recent World Bank study rightly points out that a number of obstacles exist to
reachingthe full potential of the handicraft sector, including shortcomings inprofessional
and business education and lack of accessto funds to improve equipment andfacilities, to
acquire better and safer production methods, and to finance larger orders and stocks."
Moreover, there are also large variations in the quality of the raw materials used,
manufacturing techniques and processes remain rudimentary, tools, machines, and
equipment are often inadequate, and there are shortcomings in the alignment of products
and product range with customer needs and expectations concerning design andquality.

Telecommunications sector. The Government of Mali has already taken a series of
reforms inthe telecommunications sector, which include:

    0   Adopting Ordonnance 99-23 in 1999, which establishes the current legal
        framework governing telecommunications sector in Mali. This law was amended
        in2000 and2001 andfurther refinedwith anumber of decrees and administrative
        orders.
     0  Separating operational and regulatory functions, through the creation of an
        independent regulatory authority, the CRT. Since its creation, the CRT has been
        active, making equitable arrangements to interconnect new entrants, monitoring
        the implementation of the national policy objectives, supporting the reform of the
        sector, developing methods to ensure efficient use of scarce resources, and
        protectingthe interests of consumers.
     0  Formulating a sector policy to support the development of information and
        communications technologies (ICT) as well as a postalpolicy.

The government has also begun a program of gradual liberalization in the
telecommunications market.The government's efforts to enhance competition resulted in
the award of a second national operator license to IKATELin August 2002. The operator
 started its operations in February 2003 and has contributed to a notable increase in

Despite promising penetration growth rates, Mali i s still behind schedule with regard to
providing access to telecommunication services to its citizens. As shown in table A1.2,
the sector i s characterized by:

        Limited access to            infrastructure       sewices compared with regional benchmarks. With
        only 2.45 lines per 100 people, Mali's access rates remain well below the regional
        average of 5.86 lines in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as below the rates o f countries
        with a similar GNP (such as Benin, Togo, andGhana).
        Stagnating jixed line penetration rates in 2001-2003. This can be explained by
        SOTELMA's moratorium on investment until 2004 and IKATEL's current emphasis
        on mobile networks. A growing fixed line network is a key input to Internet access
        growth.
        A marked disparity of access to telecommunications among rural and urban areas.
        Only 253 localities out of 11,000 have access to telecommunication services. Rural
        access remains low at 0.02 line per 100inhabitants. And although less than 10percent
        of the population i s concentrated inBamako (relative to 68 percent in rural areas), the
        capital city has 75 percent of the telecommunications lines.
        Numerous institutional and cupacity constraints still facing CRT. These constraints
        hinder its ability to assume its responsibilities and to effectively regulate the fast-
        changing telecommunications sector inMali.
        Failure of the telecommunications sector to meet the needs of other sectors (in terms
        of access, quality, and price). The price of international calls remains too high,
        despite an effort to decrease prices on selected destinations (for example, the price of

                                                                    30

     a fixed-line communication to France has decreased from FCAF 1200 per minute in
     January 2003 to FCFA 450 per minute inJune 2004). Ingeneral, there i s still an acute
     need to improve services (data transmission, leased lines, Internet bandwidth) and to
     better supply other sectors of the economy.
0    Very low Intemet penetration. With only 25,000 users, just 0.24 percent o f
     inhabitants have access to the Internet. Several reasons account for this low rate,
     including the very low penetration of personal computers and the high cost of local
     access and bandwidth. Currently, 15 providers offer dial-up Internet access in Mali
     (Afribone and CEFLB are the leading providers, with a 40 percent market share). The
     launching of IKATEL's Ik@net first broadband service will most likely impact
     competitive forces on the market.

Continued support i s needed for the benefits of the liberalization to translate into
increased access to telecommunications infrastructure for the population and economic
market players. Progress is needed toward modernizing the legal and regulatory
telecommunications framework, assisting the regulator assume its responsibilities,
supporting the privatization of the incumbent operator, and promoting equitable access to
ICT. Improved access to ICT offers significant opportunities to achieve greater economic
growth and diversification and contributes to poverty reduction. Higher quality, lower
prices, and greater variety o f telecommunications services can also have a positive impact
on the growth o f other economic sectors, including the growth sectors supported in this
project. In addition, a well-functioning telecommunications sector is critical to improve
the competitiveness of Mali andfurther its integration into the global economy.

To reap these benefits and maximize the contributionof the telecommunications sector to
growth, the project aims to increase access to telecommunications andpostal services for
significantly larger numbers of households and businesses, to improve Mali's
competitiveness, and to more fully integrate Maliinto the global economy.

Manufacturing sector. Manufacturing, which accounted for about 7.7 percent of GDPin
1994, only accounts for about 3.2 percent of GDP in 2002-well                      below the average for
Sub-Saharan Africa (14.8 percent). Since the 1994 devaluation, efforts made to promote
investment in the sector have had little success. A serious hurdle to the development of
the sector i s its lower relative profitability compared with sectors such as trade or gold
mining. In spite of stiff competition coming from neighboring countries, the textile
sector now fares better. In 1998, the private sector tried to avoid the application of the
West African Monetary Union (UMOA) common external tariff because production costs
are often higher in Mali than in neighboring countries. These higher costs are mainly
causedby the relatively high age of the capital stock of enterprises and some specifically
high factor costs, such as air cargo to the United States, road transport, electricity for
industrial use, and Internet access.

Investment Climate Issues

Private sector development requires improvements in the investment climate in order to
promote a strong and diversified economic growth within the framework of a market
economy and thus help to reduce poverty levels." Any improvement in living standards
or reduction in poverty levels can only be obtained through sustained economic growth,

Strategy for Development," (Washington,Dc:World Bank, 2002).

which itself depends on improvements in productivity of labor, which in turn requires
larger investments in human and physical capital and technical progress. All these
elements are components of the investment climate. For operational purposes, the
investment climate i s defined as "the policy, institutional, and behavioral environment,
present and expected, that influences the returns, and risks, associatedwith investment.''

A series of recent indicators provides insights into the main investment climate issues in
Mali, including the Doing Business 2004 indicators and the investment climate survey
undertaken in 2004 by the World Bank. Some 200 firms in manufacturing, tourism, and
transport were visited, and the preliminary results presented below are based on a partial
sample of 108 manufacturing firms. This partial sample accounts for about 49 percent of
the existing formal firms in the sector and 31 percent o f sectoral employment (using data
producedby the 2003 census of firms).

General Investment Climate Issues

The Doing Business indicators focus on the existing legal framework in which formal
firms operate. These indicators, available for about 130 countries on a yearly basis, prove
useful in comparing the legal framework applied theoretically across regions and
countries.   Six areas of the investment climate are closely analyzed: (i)          starting a
business, (ii)hiringandfiring workers, (iii) registeringproperty, (iv) enforcing contracts,
(v) getting credit, and (vi) closingabusiness.

For Mali, the available DoingBusiness data suggest that the investment climate performs
close to the African average. On two specific elements-average          duration required to
enforce contracts and the related cost as a share of GNI-Mali      performs even better than
most countries in the region. Mali i s therefore in a paradoxical situation. Although it has
its legal framework correct from a theoretical point of view for these two key indicators,
for other indicators, Mali's performance i s often very close to that of the rest of Sub-
Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa has the worst investment climate of any region in
the world, which suggests that a proper comparator for improving Mali's investment
climate i s not Sub-Saharan Africa, but rather the best-performing countries of other
regions such as the OECD and South Asia. Simple legal changes would allow Mali to
quickly improve these indicators and its investment climate as a whole.

Below i s the assessmentof the Malian situation on each of the DoingBusiness indicators:

Business start-up. Business start-up procedures in Mali consist of two separate but
interlinked processes, namely business registration and authorization (including issuing
ministerial permits). Business regstration itself i s related to the creation o f legal entities
and receiving various registration numbers, whereas authorizations relate to permits to
operate businesses in specific sectors.      The 2004 Doing Business report evaluated
business registration procedures as worse than average, not only globally but also among
countries inSub-Saharan Africa. Indicators used inthis study point to 13 steps needed to
open the business, 42 days needed for these procedures, as well as significant costs
(187.4 percent of GNI per capita or $524) and high requirements for statutory capital
(482.3 percent of GNI per capita or $1,400). During project preparation, it was
established that business registration could be simplified to consist of only 6 steps in
the medium term. It was also confirmed that current registration procedures take
approximately 40 days and cost $390 (of which $215 are stamps and fees and the rest,

                                             32

$175, are costs for notary public services). Finally, the minimum required statutory
capital for limited liability companies appears to be $2,000, or 689.7 percent of annual
GNI per capita. The task team's findings also point to the confusion created by the
incorporation of Guichet Unique into the registration process through the obligatory
practice of issuing its authorizations to prospective businesses. Businesses currently
operating outside the sectors of retail trade and mining cannot become fully registered
without such authorization. The Guichet Unique is clearly an additional and unnecessary
step in the registration process, when its main purpose should be helping businesses
acquire the permits they need for their operations.

Upon discussion with government officials, it was proposed to undertake a three-step
reform of the registration system in Mali. The first step will relate to the issue of clear
separation of registration and issuance of sector-specific permits. In fulfilling this step,
Guichet Unique will clarify and limit its role in the process of business registration,
which will eliminate one step and three days from the process. The second step, proposed
by the government, relates to establishing a single commercial registry and shows Mali's
significant progress toward development and initial implementation. To fully implement
a single commercial registry, technical assistance will be needed for hardware, software,
and training of operators o f the new system. If successful, implementation of the new
system will further reduce the number of steps needed to register business by four,
creating true one-step registration process. This system will also significantly reduce the
time neededto register a company inMali from 40 days to 10days. Finally, the third step
relates to significantly reducing the minimum requirement for statutory capital from the
current $2,000 to $100 for limited liability companies. This step requires legislative
change, and if successful, the statutory capital requirement will decrease from 689.7
percent to 34.4 percent of GNIper capita.

Insome instances, a permit system is applied, which is referredto as "authorizations" by
the Guichet Unique but in fact i s about permits. In creating Guichet Unique, the
Government of Mali envisioned that this office would facilitate the issuing of various
permits to businesses. There is, however, one element of the operations of this office that
does relate to permits-a    collection of documents for ministerial orders. The World Bank
 mission found that there are numerous sectoral permits issued by ministries as orders.
These sectors are specified in Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers #97-293/PRM, dated
 June 27, 1997. It is not clear if any other permits for activities exist. In addition to this,
there are no explicit requirements and conditions on either issuing these permits or
 inspecting permitted activities. Finally, permits related to land use and premises are
 issued separately. The Government of Mali expresses strong interest in establishing one
 permit center on the basis of the current Guichet Unique. To achieve this undertaking,
 reform of the sector permit system in Mali must be conducted to draft explicit permit
 conditions, clarify issuing agencies, and develop processing mechanisms that can be
 based on one interface with businesses through Guichet Unique. Upon success of this
 stage, addtional permit systems can be reformed, including land, construction, premises,
 and so on.

 Although there are no benchmarks for the permit system in the 2004 Doing Business
 study, it is clear that the government must issue permits in predictable and transparent
 manner to be able to improve the business environment. It i s also important that it only
 issues permits in the areas that require state intervention.

Labor regulations. State regulations for hiring workers in Mali are quite simple if these
applicants are from the same administrative region as the employer. The employer has
only to inform tax and social security agencies about such hiring to readjust tax
payments. However, if an employee i s hired from outside the region, authorization from
the labor inspector i s required. Failure to acquire such authorization can result in a fine
ranging from $20 to $100. Such regulation limits statewide work force mobility,
especially to the capital city of Bamako. It i s also unclear on what grounds the labor
inspectorate can refuse such authorization. Therefore, it seems that the role of the labor
inspectorate in authorizations during the hiring process i s unnecessary and can be
eliminated.

Firing employees can be done in the form of downsizing or termination for
incompetence, breach of contract, or outstanding violations. The most important issues in
terms of state regulations are downsizing and firing for incompetence. In the case of
downsizing, Mali regulations prescribe usage o f collective bargainingwith clear roles for
representative delegates who can negotiate pay reductions and shorter working hours. It
i s unclear, however, how downsizing is done in companies that do not have trade unions
or are too small to use collective bargaining. Inthe case of firing for incompetence, the
labor inspector can review and certify such cases. This certification process i s voluntary
for employers but i s widely used to protect their decisions in court. Actual firing can
commence 15 days after decision i s made or after certification by the labor inspector.
Severance pay in such cases does not exceed pay for 16 additional weeks (maximum for
employees with 10 years of employment). Further research is needed into the actual role
o f labor inspectors duringthe firingprocess to identify problems or inefficiencies.

Property registration and collateral. In cases of real estate property transfers, two
separate processes are taking place: the transaction itself and property registration
(receiving title). Transaction o f property i s taxed according to Mali laws. This tax
depends on the value of property andis progressive: for property values up to $16,000, a
tax of 2 percent is levied; for property values between $16,000 and $30,000, a 5 percent
tax; for property values between $30,000 and $60,000, a 10percent tax; and for property
value exceeding $60,000, a 15 percent tax. After the transaction is completed, a title fee
of $2.50 must be paid within 7 days to register the property. All real estate property is
published in land registry books. Property registration seems to be straightforward, with
one possible exception-steep     transaction taxes in cases of property valued at more than
$30,000.

Access to Credit. Businesses can use their properties as collateral to receive credits. The
average mortgaging process costs $6 in fixed fees, 0.9 percent of loan value as tax, and
0.5-2 percent of loan value (regressive scale) paid to notaries for services. The main
problem with collateral relates to the availability of information on already mortgaged
properties. Acquiring such information increases the time needed to obtain all necessary
documents to a month. Creation of an automated national pledge registry can resolve this
issue inthe future.

Liquidation of companies.The issues related to the liquidation of companies either due
to insolvency or other reasons i s regulated by Organization for the Harmonization of
African Business Law (OHADA) agreements. The World Bank mission confirms the
2004 Doing Business assessmentthat liquidation of companies takes approximately three
years. This three-year term i s used to ensure that no liability or unsettled claims exist,

                                             34

although minimum and maximum terms are not legally set. The only problem areas
referred to liquidation intermediaries relate to the capacities of the court system to
process claims in speedy manner to avoid lines andbacklog.

Enforcement of contracts. If contract disagreements emerge, companies in Mali can
resolve them through either arbitration or the court system. In arbitration, decisions must
be reached within six months or the case is transferred to the court system. There i s no
time limit for court decisions in general, although certain court procedures are time
limited. For instance, all subpoenas must be served in 30 days. The most probable
minimumtime periodfor court decision, as reported by observers is approximately three
months. Fees for courts vary according to the amount of the dispute, ranging from $10
(for cases up to $500) to $50 (for cases between $500 and $l,OOO),     3 percent (for cases
between $1,000 and $20,000), 1.5 percent (for cases between $20,000 and $100,000), and
0.5 percent (for cases over $100,000). It seems that the main problems with contract
enforcement are similar to those for liquidating companies, namely weak capacity o f the
court system andresulting delays.

Other Investment Climate Issues: Taxation, Administradive Procedures, and Public-
PrivateDialogue

Although the Malian fiscal system implemented deep positive reforms since the mid-
1980s (introduction of VAT in 1991, harmonization of custom duties with the
introduction of a common external tariff), serious issues remain. Some 36.5 percent of
the firms consider high tax rates to be a severe or critical problem and 29 percent
consider tax administration to be a severe or critical issue. The main problems include the
following:

    Taxation i s unbalanced because a disproportionate share of the tax burden falls on a
    small formal sector. The problem i s further exacerbated by the fact that indirect
    taxation schemes still have weaknesses. Thus, value added tax (VAT) reimbursement
    mechanisms are imperfect and often imply that firms accumulate credits that are not
    always reimbursedin a timely manner.
    The Malian administration still has a weak capacity to properly manage the various
    tools of taxation. Inaddition, the information technologies infrastructure i s inadequate
    and staff are not skilled enough.
    There are no simple and clear relations between the administration and the taxpayers.
    Onthe one hand, legal documents are not disseminated widely enough and taxpayers
    can genuinely invoke their ignorance of the laws. On the other hand, however, many
    of these same taxpayers often try to evade taxes of which they do have knowledge.
    Although various administrative procedures have improved over the last few years,
    challenges remain. In particular, the Guichet Unique still faces numerous problems,
    and procedures for firm start-up and registration with the tax administration still have
    redundant steps .

Over the recent past, the dialogue between the state and the private sector has markedly
improved inMali, which is an extremely positive outcome. However, it i s still necessary
to improve the implementation and follow-up of the measures identified in their
discussions.

Infrastructure Issues
The lack of adequate access to key infrastructure is a significant issue for 15 to 34 percent
of Malian firms. Although Mali's problems are serious, they are less pervasive than in
many other African countries for which recent survey data are available. Of comparator
countries outside Africa, only China has better indicators than Mali. As shown in table
Al.4, the investment climate survey data suggest both positive andnegative indicators:


0   Output losses due to power outages or surges are lower in Mali than in many other
    African countries, as is the number of days during which power fluctuations occurred.
0   A lower share of firms hadto buildtheir own wells or buy generators inMali, which
    implies a smaller constraint inthis arearelative to other countries.
0   However, the number of days needed to obtain a telephone connection remains
    comparatively highinMali.
0   The number of days needed to obtain an electrical connection remains within the
    African average but is higher than the equivalent number in China.

Access to land for industrial use i s indicated by about a third of the firms as a serious
issue. For example, the existing industrial area at Sotuba (in Bamako District) is
congested and dilapidated with inadequate infrastructure and facilities. Pollution is a
serious problem because of inadequate waste disposal facilities. Road conditions are
poor, and the area is subject to severe flooding during the wet season. Some vacant lots
have been taken over for animal husbandry and other informal activities, and there i s no
systematic planning or management o f the zone. Although there are still vacant lots
available in the area and there are ongoing efforts to improve the drainage system, it is
unlikely that new investors would be willing to set up operations here due to the poor
environment. Expansion of this zone is unfeasible because there has been residential
development aroundthe area.

MSME Access to Finance and Business DevelopmentServices

The cost of and access to credit are perceived as the most important problems by 54.8
percent and 51.4 percent of the firms, respectively. About 80 percent of firms' investment
or working capital is financed throughretained earnings. Data suggest that a bias exists in
the access to external finance (figure A1.8).

In addition, about a third of the firms indicate that they are credit constrained (that is,
they cannot borrow as much as they wished). Thus, the larger the firm, the easier it i s to
obtain external finance. Moreover, if a firm i s foreign-owned or old-and                        therefore has
established credibility-then                    itwill have a better accessto external finance.

Out of nine active banks in Mali, seven are commercial. The availability of financial
products i s still very limited, and financial intermediation is weak. The banking sector
has been largely criticized for its conservative lending habits even though the reason i s
equally tied to the lack of bankable projects and the low quality of the regulatory
framework aimed at assisting inthe recovery o f debt. So most of the loans are on a short-
term basis. Finally, because most banking institutions are concentrated in urban areas,
people living in the rural zones must rely heavily on microfinance institutions that have
greatly expanded inrecent years. According to an IMFestimate, by the end of 2001, 342
microfinance institutions were operating in Mali. Total lending amounted to FCFA 17
billion, and the ratio of nonperforming loans to gross bank credit to the economy rose
from 18.7 percent in December 2002 to 21.6 percent at the end of June 2003. This
increase stems from delays in the repayment of trade credit. The maturity mismatch of
assets and liabilities remains an issue as banks rely largely on short-term deposits to
finance long-term loans. In addition, commercial banks lack the expertise and the
resources needed to analyze the financial situation and risk profile of MSMEs, not to
mention the high monitoring costs. The centralized credit authorization procedures of
these commercial banks prevent them fromefficiently engaging in small lending.

Apart from the financial services issues, the productivity and competitiveness of Malian
MSMEs is also constrained by the lack of market information, management capacity,
efficient production systems, marketing and product development skills, appropriate
technology, financial management and accounting skills. Building the demand for and
supply of business development services (BDS) to support the operations and strategic
development of MSMEs is critical for their sustained growth and competitiveness. The
formalMalianBDS market is very small, comprising approximately 350 firms employing
more than five people each with a turnover of more than $250,000. Past diagnostic work,
including a BDS market survey in 2003, highlights the need to improve the quality and
quantity of these services.

Onthe demand side, MSMEs make little use of BDS services, inpartbecause the supply
of such services is limited or inappropriate to meet SME needs and in part because
MSMEs feel unable to afford such services and do not trust the benefits they can derive
fromthem. Forthese reasons, a 2003 SME BDS Survey carried out by a local firm (IBC)
indicated that 87 percent of MSMEs interviewed in the service sector had never used
BDS services, nor did 79 percent in the artisan sector and 63 percent in the industrial
sector (not including agroindustry). On the supply side, BDS services are not available in
the quantity, price, or quality range required by MSMEs. Local BDS providers (which
include specialized consulting firms and individuals, NGOs, and, to a limited degree,
business associations that cater largely to micro clients) lack the necessary skills to offer
products that are appropriately tailored to M S M E needs.

This subcomponent of the project addresses the market failures that limit the ability of
MSMEs to obtain the necessary skills and business services to exploit opportunities and
overcome bottlenecks. It integrates a set of complementary and mutually reinforcing
activities to address various constraints impeding the demand for and supply of SME-
appropriate business services in Mali. The program focus will be on improvingthe supply
of BDS services and stimulating demand.

Labor Market Issues

Two specific issues related to the labor market emerge from the survey data. First, data
suggest that Mali is amongst the countries with the least educated employees in the
manufacturing sector in the sample. In addition, although nominal wages in Malian
manufacturing are relatively low (at US$78 a month), they are still higher than those of
India and some eastern African countries (table A1.9).

Conclusion

Mali largely owes its current growth to exports, especially o f gold, and a significant
inflow of foreign capital in the years following the 1994 devaluation. However, the
concentration of exports on a few primary goods and the persistence of an investment
climate with non-negligible deficiencies create risks for the future. In effect, primary
goods face a long-term decline of their terms of trade. In addition, technical progress
implies that world demand for primary commodities is about to decrease or i s already
declining. Finally, the various trade preferences granted to developing economies are
being eroded. Excessive dependence on products from the primary sector in this
environment i s therefore risky.
Deficiencies in the investment climate in Mali have at least two consequences. At the
global level, the country becomes less attractive to foreign investors, and at a national
level, it slows private sector development-both                of which adversely impact growth.

It is necessary, therefore, to quickly diversify the bases of the Malian economy so that it
can rely less on the primary sector as a source of long-term growth. The data available
suggest that the investment climate in Mali i s within the African average-                        not especially
good or especially bad compared with other African countries. On some specific
elements, it i s even better than most countries from Sub-Saharan Africa. However, it
must be kept inmindthat Africa often provides the least attractive investment climate in
the world. In this era of globalization, being within African average-or                           even being a
little bit better than that average-is             not enough.

These results suggest that several steps must be followed to quickly improve the
investment climate inMali. Mali must:

   0  Reduce the major administrative barriers, which should translate into
      improvement of the DoingBusiness indicators;

   0  Improve the quality of existing infrastructures (reduce delays in obtaining a
      telephone connection, improve the quality of electricity supply, improve waste
      removal, and improve the operations of railways and the state of the road network
      on the mainroads);

   0  Reduce the bias against small firms tryingto access credit; and

   0  Increase the level of education of the population and, if possible, set up retraining
      programsfor the current work force.

   Annex 2: Major Related ProjectsFinancedby the Bank and/or other Agencies


The proposed project i s related to three active IDA-financed projects, namely the
Financial Sector Development Project, the Transport Corridors Project, and the Rural
Electrification Project; and the forthcoming Agricultural Export Diversification and
Competitiveness Project.

1.Financial Sector DevelopmentProject (FYO1, ratedSatisfactory): The objective of the
project is to improve the soundness, performance and competitiveness of the financial
sector and enable it to support broad-based private sector growth.           This will be
accomplished by: creating a legal and regulatory environment that would support the
creation of new financial institutions and diversified financial instruments; (ii)
strengthening the microfinance network and increasing the Government's supervision
and monitoring capacities; (iii) restructuring and privatizing bank and non-bank financial
institutions that are viable; (iv) improving financial intermediation by supporting the
development of a local capital market within the framework established at the regional
level; and (v) building bridges between the operations of banks, non-bank financial
institutions, and microfinance institutions to encourage greater financial sector outreach.
All these building blocks will be essential to the success of the proposed financial
instruments to mobilize term S M E financing.

2. Transport Corridors Improvement Project (FY04, rated Satisfactory): The project
provides support to the concessioning of the railways between Dakar and Bamako, and
maintenance of road corridors to C6te d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and the northem region of
Gao. The successful outcome o f this project, translating into improved trade logistics,
will benefit to the market linkages sought for Malian products, particularly artisanal
products exports.

3. Households Energy and Universal Access Project (FYO4, rated Satisfactory): the
project provides support to the Government's efforts to increase the access of isolated
low income populations to basic energy services to help achieve economic growth and
poverty reduction targets. The project is expected to contribute to increasingproductivity
of MSMEs in rural and peri-urban areas through the use o f modern energy. Moreover,
increased access to electricity is an asset for the expansion of the rural
telecommunications network.

4. Agricultural Export Diversification and Competitiveness Project (FY06): Support to
the agriculture sector with a focus on: (i)   irrigation and value adding technologies, (ii)
improvement of agriculture supply chains, (iii)   accessto finance inthe agriculture sector,
and (iv) development of market-oriented infrastructure. This project will supplement the
proposed Growth Support Project by financing a cold storage at the Bamako airport and
contributing to capacity building in upstream segments of some of the targeted value
chains (e.g. cotton-to-textile and skin-to-leather integrated value chains).

Projects financed by other donors that are related to this one are:
    e    Support to APEP ("Agence de Promotion de 1'Entreprise PrivCe >>) by the French
         Cooperation: the focus i s put on the set-up of an information system and a
         documentation center in order to strengthen capacity and market-related
         information.

    0  USAID-funded Mali Finance: the project aims at supporting the growth agenda of
       Mali, focusing on investment promotion, access to finance, and micro-enterprise
       support (financial management training, business plan elaboration, firm
       evaluation, access to financing, monitoring and evaluation, legal and financial
       advisory services).

                           Annex 4: DetailedProject Description


The overall project objective is to stimulate private sector investment and performance
stemming from increased total factor productivity and from targeted sectoral sources of
growth. The project is designed to improve the investment climate, with a focus on
reducing the cost of doing business and fostering growth from sectors including mining,
tourism andcrafts, and telecommunications.

This project will thus assist Mali in implementing its growth agenda, underpinned by the
PRSP and the private sector strategy as spelled out in the attached letter of sector
development policies, so as to create conditions to sustain an average GDP growth rate
of at least 5 percent per year. Efforts to improve the investment climate, diversify the
economy, and attract foreign direct investment, while leveraging the potential of key
sectoral sources of growth, are critical in this regard. These elements provide the
underlying structure of the project which has four components described below.


Component 1: Investment Climate and Institutional Strengthening (US$15.92
million)

The objective of this component i s to help (i)      implement the key recommendations that
emerge from the recent investment climate assessment and improve the country's legal
and regulatory framework in key areas so as better performances are reflected in the
Doing Business indicators; and (ii)strengthen both policymaking and operational
capabilities in key sectors with a high growth contribution potential. The overall
objective is to create a business-friendly environment where private transactions will be
expedited and their costs reduced. This first component will directly affect total factor
productivity by improving the investment climate in the country by easing overall and
sector-specific business regulations and strengthen the capacity of the various
administrations to implement them. Preliminary econometric results for the fiscal year
2002fromthe MaliICA indicatethat firm-level TFP inmanufacturingcould increase by
4 percent ifthe regulatory burden imposedon firms was substantially reduced.

Activities that will be supported under this component cover two mainareas: investment
climate andinstitutional strengthening including utility regulation.

Subcomponent 1.1:Improving the Investment Climate

The following detailed activities will be carried out with a view to improving the
investment climate: (i)supporting the public-private sector consultative process,
specifically, the Presidential Investors' Council; (ii)measures aimed at improving
business registration and other Doing Business indicators; (iii)          action on corporate tax
issues; (iv) investment promotion, including support to set up and operation Mali
Invest;'2 and (v) promoting alternative commercial dispute resolution mechanisms.


  Mali Invest will be created from the merger of the the current investment promotion agency (Centre
national de Promotion des Investissements, or CNPI) and the industrial zone agency (Agence des zones
industrielles, or MI).

                                                52

Regarding the Doing Business indicators in particular, the project will assist Mali in
raising its performance. Under the proposed project, Mali i s expected to cut (i)the
number of proceduresto set up abusiness from 13 to 6, (ii) number of days from 42
                                                             the
to 8, and (iii) cost of setting up a business by 75 percent. At the same time, the
                the
project will provide support to involved institutions, particularly the commercial
registry, to improve the service to investors. Substantial improvements will also be
sought in the areas of labor market (hiring and firing workers), contract enforcement,
property registration, andMSMEfinance.

In addition to the general issues above, the project will target efforts to improve the
business environment in those sectors considered entry points in the context of this
project, particularly inthe telecommunications and miningsectors.

In the communication sector (telecommunications and postal services), the following
activities will be supported by the project so as to improve the sector-specific legal and
regulatory framework:
    0   Reviewing the existent legal and regulatory framework and proposing new
        amendmentsto fill the gaps inthe current framework andensure greater visibility
        for the investors. The exercise will particularly emphasize the licensing regime,
        tariff regime,competition regime, andthe relationship betweenthe regulator and
        policy maker to ensure increased independence, transparency, and an appeal
        regime for the decisions of the regulator.
        Proposing new amendments, legislation, or secondary legislation as deemed
        appropriate to account for new developments in ICT and the convergence of
        technology and services. Inthis context the revisedlaw needs to include Intemet-
        specific policies for IP Telephony: cross-subsidies, Internet governance on the
        allocation of IP addresses and domain names, regulation of radio broadcasting,
        and harmonization with telecommunications regulation.
    0    Amending current legal texts to create apostal regulatory function within CRT.
    0   Adopting the decrees identifiedin"Ordonnance 1999."
    0   Updatingthe legal andregulatory framework for the postal sector and monitoring
        andevaluation of the policy implementation.

Under this component, the project will also provide support to the Government in the
privatization of the incumbent operator SOTELMA through financing the fixed costs of
the investment advisor for the transaction.

In the mining sector, there is a need to address issues pertaining to legal and fiscal
aspects of investment in the sector. Moreover, in response to the need for improved
transparency and management of mining revenues, there i s a need to support efforts
aimed at maximizing the economic impact of mining.The project will then support the
following activities: (i)revising the mining code, (ii) formulating a legal framework for
small-scale mining, (iii)formulating a policy on mining revenue management, (iv)
targeting mininginvestment promotion activities, and (v) providingconsultant services.




                                            53

Subcomponent1.2: Institutional Strengthening
This subcomponent of the project will seek to (i)  strengthen the capabilities of relevant
ministries and agencies, and (ii) reinforce the capacities of specific agencies overseeing
targeted sectors (tourism and handicrafts, telecommunications and postal services, and
mining).


Ministry of Investment Promotion and SMEs and Mali Invest. Technical assistance
will be provided to the Ministry of Investment Promotion and Small and Medium
Enterprises (MIP) to organize a biannual investors' forum to implement policies
pertaining to SME development and to ensure communication about the project. The
ministry will directly overseethe project coordination unit.

Currently, responsibility for the development and management of industrial zones lies
with the AZI-SA (Agence Pour L'Ame'nagement et la Gestion des Zones Industrielles).
AZI-SA was formally established in May 2002 under the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry as a public-private partnership(Socie'te' Anonyme d'Economie Mixte) with an
initial capital of 10millionFCFA. The equity composition of MI-SA is: Government of
Mali (40 percent), collectivite's locales (20 percent) and various private sector and
professional organizations (40 percent). Since December 2002, M I - S A was placed
under the responsibility of the Ministry of Investment Promotion and SMEs (formerly
the Ministry of Investment Promotion andPrivate Sector Development).

The National Center for the Promotion of Investments (CNPI) is responsible for
investment promotion andfunctions as a single counter for the registration of investment
applications. Both AZI-SA and the CNPI are under the Ministry of Investment
Promotion and SMEs. Investment approvals are the responsibility of the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry. Approval for land applications at the industrial zone is the
responsibility of the Ministry of State Assets and Urbanization. The Government has
acknowledgedthat the roles, responsibilities, andfunctions of the three ministries, CNPI,
andAZI-SA needto berationalized and streamlined to establish a much-neededefficient
investment approval system. Inthis respect, the current investment code will be revised
to establish a new agency called Mali Invest (and the concurrent dissolution of CNPI
and AZI-SA), which will be responsible for investment promotion and approval,
planning, and regulation of industrial zones, including planning and development
approval functions. Under these new institutional arrangements, the proposed industrial
zone and other future zones will be plannedby Mali Invest but developed and managed
through public-private partnerships (through private concessions or management
contracts or other suchmodels basedon international bestpractice).


This subcomponent will support the following activities: (i)providing technical
assistance to enact a new investment code, including appropriate legislation to establish
Mali Invest; (ii)  strengthening capacity within Mali Invest in investment promotion and
facilitation,   industrial  planning,     and    regulation,   including    environmental
management/monitoring; (iii)developing social and environmental impact mitigation
plans, formulating an implementation plan for the industrial zone, and assisting in the
rolling out of the plan; and (iv) supporting the investment promotion functions and
activities of Mali Invest.

                                            54

Tourism and handicrafts sectors. The government i s keen to support the growth
tourism and handicrafts throughimprovements in quality of products and services. Inthe
tourism sector, for instance, there is a need to increase the service standards of hotels,
restaurants, tour agencies, and tourist guides and to strengthen OMATHO based on a
review of its organizational structure and operations so as to rationalize and enhance its
efficiency. Other areas requiring improvement are training in tourism development and
planning and strengthening of tourism statistical systems.
The project will support (i)  technical assistance to review the organizational structure
and operations of OMATHO, with a view to rationalizing and enhancing the efficiency
of its operations; (ii) technical assistance in strengthening mechanisms to improve the
quality and service standards in hotels, restaurants, tour agencies, and tour guides
through devising and implementing a ratingsystem; (iii)    capacity building of OMATHO
in collection, compilation, analysis, and dissemination of tourism statistics, strategy
formulation and planning, image building, and marketing; and (iv) training and
certification programs for tour guides andother travel and hospitality industry workers.

Telecommunications        sector. Technical      assistance  to the     ministry in the
telecommunications sector will be provided through first strengthening its capacity to
contribute to harmonization efforts within the region (synergies with CRT training
sessions based in Bamako and funding of additional short term external advisors who
will support the specific needs of the Ministry), and second, funding acquisition of
computing equipment and software.

The project aims at strengthening the capacity of the CRT, the regulator in the
telecommunications and postal services sector. The government agrees that a
prerequisite for attracting private investment and increasing competitiveness of the
sector is an effective regulatory entity capable of assuming its legislative mandate to
regulate    the  telecom    sector   through preparing      recommendations      for new
licenses/authorizations, solving disputes among operators and service providers, and
protecting consumer interest. Capacity building will therefore be provided to CRT to
help it perform its regulatory functions by ensuring that the institution is well structured
and appropriately staffed, by helping meet its training needs, by providing up-to-date
management information systems. Regarding postal services, as the draft postal sector
policy calls for the progressive liberalization of the postal sector, a postal regulatory
function will be entrusted to the CRT. The postal regulation will clarify the universal
service system based on the redefinition of universal service scope and obligations, its
costing, and the underlying funding mechanisms. The regulator will also support the
government through market intelligence and policy advice.

More specifically, the project will focus on implementing the following activities within
the CRT:
    0   Expanding the scope of the CRT to postal services.
    0   Strengthening the CRT staff, which currently operates with a minimal structure
        of five employees, through the recruitment of qualified staff to develop CRT's
        legal, technical, economic, and cross-discipline expertise. The project will cover
        the cost of the new staff on a decreasing basis, with the CRT financing the new
        staff from its own budget thereafter.


                                             55

    0   Funding short term external advisors to CRT as needed during the first three
        years of the project.
    0   Funding aCRT advisor for three years.
    0   Helping CRT acquire a spectrum management and monitoring system to ensure
        an efficient use of this scarce resource.
    0   Helping CRT acquire computer equipment and software.
    0   Providing staff training and studies to increase CRT expertise (for example, cost
        modeling and statistical market analysis for monitoring and evaluation).
    0   Assist CRT indeveloping postal regulatory expertise.

Mining sector. The project will provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Mining,
its Geology National Directorate, and a new agency focused on petroleum issues.
Extensive training, including in areas pertaining to mining-related negotiations, will be
providedto the miningministry staff.


Component 2: InfrastructureSupport for Growth (US$24.49 million)

This component, which will improve economy-wide and sectoral TFP by enhancing
available infrastructure, will consist of five subcomponents: (i)improving access to
serviced industrial land, (ii) improving the airport, (iii) expanding telecommunications
and postal services, (iv) strengthening infrastructure for tourism, and (v) improving
infrastructure for the miningindustry.

Subcomponent2.1: Improving Access to Serviced Industrial Land
The shortage of serviced industrial land is a major constraint for the expansion of the
manufacturing sector in general and exports inparticular. The existing industrial area in
Bamako is spread over a 300-hectare site at Sotuba. This industrial area was developed
in the 1960s and is congested, dilapidated, and polluted. Road conditions are poor, and
the area i s subject to flooding during the wet season. Livestock farming and informal
activities are interspersed with industrial activities within the area. Although there are
vacant lots still available, the infrastructure constraints and the general unattractiveness
of the area discourages investors. Further expansion of the area i s also limited by
residential development and agricultural activities. A few large industries are located at
Banankoro, around 25 kilometers from Bamako. However, this area is not zoned for
industry and i s located far from existing infrastructure, labor, and support services.
Based on the records of approved investment applications of the National Center for
Investment Promotion (CNPI), there is evidence o f interest from new domestic and
foreign investors in food and beverage production, agroprocessing, and other light
manufacturing for export to the regional market including Mauritania, Burkina Faso, and
Niger. There is also interest in other sectors such as printed fabric, sheet metal products,
vegetable oil, and cartons and packaging. Existing industries may choose to expand or
diversify their manufacturing activities and will choose to locate in a well planned and
managed industrial zone. It i s estimated that there i s potential demand for about 50
hectares of industrial land initially.

The government has identified two potential locations for the development of industrial
zones in Bamako. One i s adjacent to the Bamako International Airport at Senou on land
currently under the control of the ACroport de Mali. The other i s at Dialakorobougou,

                                              56

located near the National Route Six to Segou, about 15 kilometers from Bamako on land
under the control of a state-owned enterprise (AZI-SA). The proposal to develop an
industrial zone near the Bamako airport is part of the Airport Master Plan formulated in
1998. The government has decided to develop the airport site because of ready access,
suitable terrain and topographical conditions, and its proximity to existing infrastructure,
urban services, and labor in Bamako. There is also potential to attract industries that
would benefit from proximity to air cargo facilities such as high-value food processing,
musical instruments, ornaments, andjewelry production activities.

The government has also agreedthat the industrial zone will be developed and managed
through a public-private partnership. The 200 ha site allocated for the industrial zone
will be transferred to the airport concessionaire who inturn will develop and manage the
industrial zone either directly or through a secondary concession. The planning and
coordination of the development of the industrial zone will be the responsibility of an
Inter-ministerial Technical Committee established under the Project Steering Committee.

The project will support (i)    preparing detailed Master and Layout plans and engineering
designs for an industrial zone of up to 50 hectares (phase 1) at the site near Bamako
airport and supporting infrastructure and services; (ii)     developing primary external or
off-site infrastructure, such as access roads and street furniture, intersections, water,
telecommunications and electricity supply facilities, sewerage and wastewater treatment
and disposal facilities, including costs for preparation of tender documents andtechnical
supervision; and (iii)     developing selected on-site facilities and services in partnership
with the private sector.

Subcomponent 2.2: Bamako Airport Improvement

Bamako Airport is the primary airport in Mali and handles more than 90 percent of the
total nationalpassengertraffic (423,500 passengersand 4.6 million kgfreight in 2003).13
Bamako Airport currently serves more than 10 regional airlines and one international
airline (Air France). The major passenger traffic corridors are between Bamako and
Paris, Dakar, and Abidjan. The airport was first opened in 1974, the passenger terminal
was refurbishedin 1994, and a secondpassenger arrival terminal was completedin2002.
The existing cargo terminal, managed by a state-owned enterprise (RAGAAE), is in
poor condition, and freight security, in particular, i s a major concern. A new airport
fence was completed recently at a cost of $1.9 million to improve airport security. Even
with these recent investments, however, overall passenger and freight handling facilities
are inadequate. The priority improvements required include rehabilitating the passenger
and freight terminal buildings and facilities, improving the runway, taxiways, parking
aprons, and other ancillary facilities, and upgrading power, water supply, waste
management, andtelecommunications infrastructure.
Given the strategic importance of Bamako Airport for the growth of the tourism (and
potentially the air freight sector), the government is keen to undertake priority
improvements to the airport facilities through a favorable private concession. The
government i s actively seeking private sector participation in the improvement of the
airport infrastructure and services. However, the process of securing private participation
has not been smooth. Two recent attempts at selecting a private operator to manage and


l3Traffic figures provided by ACroport de Mali.

                                                57

re-develop the Bamako airport through a build-operate-transfer (BOT) concession have
been unsuccessful, and the government has expressed interest in seeking technical
assistance and financing support from the World Bank to re-launch the exercise to
identify a concessionaire. It is expected that the involvement of the Bank and the
availability of financing for priority improvements will not only attract credible investors
butwill also leveragesupport from other donors.
The main agenciesresponsiblefor the airport and aviation sectors are the Civil Aviation
Directorate (DNAC), the Airport Authority of Mali (ADM), and the ASECNA (Agence
pour la Skcurite de la Navigation Akrienne en Afrique et B Madagascar). The DNAC i s
primarily a regulatory authority responsible for licensing pilots and airline operators to
ensure that aviation operations are in compliance with ICAO (International Civil
Aviation Organization) security and safety standards. DNAC is part of a regional
agreement (West African Economic Monetary Union and Mauritania Civil Aviations)
signed with the ICAO (Cooperative Development of Operational Safety and Continued
Airworthiness Project, or COSCAP) to foster aviation safety and security oversight
within West Africa. DNAC is also responsible for managing the Open Skies agreement
that was signedbetween the United States and Mali. The ASECNA i s an international
organization for 15 francophone African countries that provides meteorological services,
air traffic control, ground and approachcontrol, and fire fighting services. The ADM i s a
state-owned company responsible for the daily operation of all airports in Mali. The
Government has decided to liquidate ADM and transfer the total airport operation and
management as well as assets to a selected private concessionaire/airport operator. The
government is also currently considering options for the creation of a privately owned
and operated airline to which traffic rights previously exploited by Air Mali would be
concessioned.

Institutional arrangements pertaining to safety and security will be addressed by the
Regional Air Transport Safety Project. This project, however, will provide
complementary support for the adoption of an appropriate institutional structure to
facilitate private participation through the concession-an  important factor infacilitating
the orderly growth of the air transport industry inMali.

         The project will support the following activities: (i)provision of technical
advisory services to review and update the Bamako airport master plan and designs and
conduct economic and financial feasibility analyses as required; (ii)provision of
technical advisory services to assist in the preparation, negotiations and conclusion of a
concession contract, with a private operator to develop, operate and manage in-total all
facilities and services at Bamako airport (according to international best practice, World
Bank guidelines and a competitive bidding process) and on the principle that there will
be no creation of public sector monopolies in the process (iii) for the design and
                                                                support
construction of priority facilities and ancillary infrastructure by the private
concessionnairefor the improvement of Bamako airport, and (iv) technical assistance for
the exploration of management and financing options for secondary airports.

Subcomponent2.3: Infrastructure Supportfor Sectoral Entry Points
Ruraltelecommunicationsand ICT. Rural teledensity in Mali is one of the lowest in
the world. The government recognized improving equity of access as a key priority,


                                             58

highlightingit inMali's Telecommunications Sector Policy as an important pillarfor the
success of the current national decentralization policy.


Activities to promote universal service access will support the government program to
expand the telecommunications network in rural areas by (i)      contributing seed capital in
the universal access fund, and (ii)preparing all upstream work that would allow
transparent delivery o f services. The project would provide seedcapital inthe fund in the
amount of $2.5 million to launch the programon a meaningful scale. The IDA funds will
cover an OBA scheme for a certain number of pilot projects and will provide technical
assistance for the preparation of OBA the launching and follow up and marketing of the
biddingprocess. To prepare this OBA scheme, the project will finance a study defining
(i) telecommunicationsservicesthatarepartofuniversalservice/accessobligations;
    the
(ii) prioritizationoftheservedlocalities(basedonthedevelopment areasidentified
     the
in the tourism, handcraft, mines industries and financed in this project); and (iii)          the
level of subsidies required to meet rural connection requests, based on evaluation
mechanisms identified in a preliminary study financed the project preparation facility
(PPF). The project will also finance the establishment of mechanisms of the Universal
Service Fund, that is, the modalities for the management and monitoring o f the fund the
coordination modalities between the fund manager (CRT) and the implementation
agency. The project will also leverage the recently finalized I C T strategy to pilot
multipurpose projects in selected areas, provided that an adequate legal framework i s in
place.14 Such a framework would need to allow consumer confidence in electronic data
communications, including basic provisions to support electronic transactions, and
protect privacy of information and intellectual property. In the postal sector,
infrastructure support will consist of a postal sorting center to help meet universal
service obligations ina sustainable manner.

Tourism and crafts infrastructure. The potential o f the tourism industry i s largely
constrained by a series of factors, including the lack of infrastructure or, when its
available, its poor quality. Mali has seen its hospitality industry increase rapidly, in
particular, its accommodation capacity in Bamako and a number of other important
cities, but such a supply has not yet materialized in the regions with high tourism
potential.

The project will help improve the attractiveness of the tourism sites in the Timbuktu,
Mopti, and Djenne, as well as the accommodations available there. In Timbuku and
Mopti, the project will help rehabilitate about a dozen historic monuments; in Djenne,
the support will help set up rural camping sites for visitors. It should also be noted that
improving the management of Bamako international airport i s an indirect support to the
tourism sector as well.

In the crafts subsector, support will be provided to the traditional textile center
(tissuthdque)to improve production methods and quality to meet market needs.

Mining sector infrastructure. Although gold remains the main focus of the industry,
Mali has good potential to develop other minerals, such as limestone, phosphates,


l4 national
   A         ICT strategy, prepared with the support of UNDP, was recently discussed at a national
workshop in September2004.

                                               59

diamonds, copper, and nickel. Certain of these minerals, such as limestone and quarry
materials, are basic building blocks of the value chain and can find a ready market
locally or regionally. To prevent a sharp decline in the mining sector in the medium
term, Mali needs to invest in improving productivity,          exploring new mines, and
diversifying its mineral resources. The project will support the set up and operation of
pilot demonstration units for gold and precious stones production, with a view not only
to improving productivity but also to promoting attractiveness of small-scale mining.
Moreover, building on indices provided by the mapping of geological resources, Mali
intends to invest, with the support of this project, inthe discovery of new miningsites. A
good understanding of the earth system through collection and analysis of geoscience
and environmental data i s absolutely essential to attract new investment, increase
reserves, and properly manage the sector. To that end, the Project will (i)upgrade
government services, including laboratory facilities, so that they provide assistance and
extension services for quarry, construction, and industrial materials; (ii)
                                                                          support, through
the Geology Directorate, basic mapping campaigns over selected areas as a means to
improve understanding of the geology; and (iii) prefeasibility and identification
                                                    support
studies for selected commodities and deposits. Finally, diversification efforts will focus
on plaster, construction materials, and industrial minerals (for example, alhor and
coltan).

Component 3: Financialand Non-financial Services for Innovationand
Development (US$8.83 million)

The third component of the project will affect both TF'P and the capital element of the
production function of the country. The assistance of the project to BDS targeted toward
SMEs will help improve the TFP of entire supply chains, while improved access to
finance for firms will increase the capital stock and therefore the output. Preliminary
results from the ICA suggest the persistence of a bias in the access to external finance
that strongly limits the development of SMEs in manufacturing. Although 93 percent of
the firms with more than 100 employees in Mali have access to either bank credits or
overdrafts, only 14 percent of the firms with less than 10 employees benefit from such
facilities. Under this component, the project will foster increasing the private sector's
access to finance (subcomponent 1) and providing business development services
(subcomponent 2).

Subcomponent 3.1: Access to Finance
This subcomponent will provide technical assistance to support development intended
to increase availability of term finance and other specialized products suitable for
SMEs. It will consist o f three products: (i) credit enhancement facility, (ii) trade
                                                a                                 a
finance enhancement facility, and (iii) support for the development of a potential stand-
by liquidity facility.

Credit Enhancement Facility. This innovative product, whose tentative structure i s
outlined in Figure A3.1, i s designed to help local banks to raise medium- and long-term
fundingfor SMEs financing. IDA and IFC will help mobilize a debt instrument such as a
long-term certificate deposit (Titre de CrCance Nkgociable, or TCN) to be issued in the
local or regional market by local Malian banks. This product will enable the
issuerhorrower to access local currency term debt at competitive pricing and establish
its name in the market. IFC will play a leading role in the administration of the facility

and will advise IDA on any calls on the guarantee which will require disbursement to be
made by IDA in line with the guarantee agreement to be signed with local issuingbanks.
Considering that the guaranteed obligation will have an amortization schedule, the
guaranteed amortized principal in each period will be available resources that would be
reallocated to other project components.

IFC will provide the additional guarantee needed to take the issue to market over and
above the IDA guarantee. The estimated size of the facility will be inthe range of US$15
million.The IDAfinancing, inconjunctionwith IFCfinancing, would be usedfor one or
two pilot bond offerings, providing a demonstration effect to the local market. Local
banks selected for the credit enhancement product will have to meet IFC's investment
criteria based on thorough due diligence and approval by its senior management and
board of directors. The diagram below shows how the credit enhancement facility may
work. IDA and IFC would provide a partial guarantee to enhance the credit quality of
T C N certificates to be issued by participatingbanks, thereby facilitating an enhancement
in size, tenor and pricing of the TCN. Under the envisaged arrangement, participating
banks will issue long-term, 4 - 5 years, TCN certificates to be placed with Malian and
other CFA-zone (regional) institutional investors. The proceeds from the issuance of the
TCN will be used to increase the local banks' capacity for S M E lending. In the event
that a bank i s unable to meet its TCN debt servicing obligation, i.e., the bank fails to
make scheduled coupon or principal payments to investors, the guarantee will be called
to covering aportion or all of the shortfall, upto the agreed guarantee coverage amount.

Trade Finance Enhancement Facility. A large number of the SMEs inMali are trading
companies that import a variety of goods to be sold in local market. Most of these
imports are financed on a cash basis and outside of the formal financial system because
of the limited accessibility of trade confirmation lines from international banks available
to the local Malian banks for trade finance. As a result, cash collateral requirements for
confirmation of letters o f credit by foreign banks is very high and in many instances i s
equivalent to 100 percent of the value of the goods that are being imported. In some
instances, where local banks are at the caps with overseas correspondent banks, trade
facilitation can be come more difficult.

This product, which will include capacity building, training and other technical assistance
to local banks in Mali, will complement and support the IFC's Global Trade Finance
Enhancement Facility, which i s intended to increase the confirmation lines available to
local banks by providing (up to 50 percent) guarantees to international confirming banks
thereby reducing the level of cash collateral required, and ultimately, facilitating easier
access to trade. Through the use o f the IFC guarantee, the product will also enable local
foreign banks to increase their (Mali) country exposure limits. As a result, in Mali, IDA
will acceleratethe implementation-and        benefits to local banks and private f i r m s - o f the
IFC Trade Finance Enhancement Facility. Beneficiary banks selected will have to meet
IFC's Global Trade Finance program eligibility criteria which will include both financial
and non-financial indicators. For each eligible bank, IFC will also conduct an assessment
of trade capabilities and training requirements based on which trade finance training
courses will be conducted. These courses will be procured from reputable trade finance

Stand-by Liquidity Facility. Support for this product i s designed to address a key
constraint faced by local Malian banks whereby the local banks have an opportunity to
grow term lending targeted at SMSEs but are constrained by the tenor of their key source
of funding-their   deposit book. By covering the mismatch risk through this facility, the
local banks can comfortably finance longer tenor assets using available short-term
deposits without violating the prudential requirements related to the transformation ratio.
The proposed structure is subject to approval by the regional regulatory authorities
(BCEAO andthe CommissionBancaire), who will have to accept the Stand-by Liquidity
Facility as an instrument for managing liquidity risk. This product will be developed in
conjunction with the IDA Financial Sector Development Credit inMali.

Subcomponent3.2: Business DevelopmentServices

This subcomponent would address market failures that limit the ability of MSMEs to
obtain the necessary skills and business services to exploit opportunities and overcome
bottlenecks. It integrates a set of complementary and mutually reinforcing activities to
address various constraints impeding the demand for and supply of MSME-appropriate
business services in Mali. Successful implementation of the proposed BDS
subcomponent i s expected to have many benefits. First, the benefits o f one firm's
investment in capacity building could easily "spill over" to other firms as trained
employees are hired away by competingfirms. Inthis way, a competing firm may end up
gaining substantial benefits without making a commensurate investment. Second, this
would ease the Malian MSMEs' constraint of high resource and transaction costs in the
acquisition process because the local expertise transfer mechanisms (consultants,
technical experts, trainers, and training institutions) are severely underdeveloped, and in
many cases required expertise may have to be procured from abroad. And, third, it would
help reduce the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of finding outside financing for these
types of "soft" investments.

The proposed BDS activities will address issues on both the demand andthe supply side.
On the demand side, activities will consist of support to value chains, market linkages,
and firm-level trainingkonsultancies, and to a MSME financing mentoring program. On
the supply side, the program will consist of a consultant development and accreditation
program and a dedicated micro-enterprise development program (Support and Training
Entrepreneurship Program, or STEP). Subsidy mechanisms, including a matching grant
scheme, will be used inboth cases.

The subcomponent would concentrate on developing the capacity of MSMEs, with a
particular focus on key growth sectors such as agribusiness, textile/garments, artisan
home products and accessories, tourism and tourism supplying companies, leather,
mining, andtelecommunications.

The project will help the Malian private sector in selected clusters (for example, the
textile and garment industry and the leather value chain) fashion a connective strategy to


                                            63

address collectively cluster-related issues so as to increase competiti~eness.'~      This will
also help improve quality andmarket knowledge to develop targetedproducts and market
entry strategies (for example, ability of the crafts sector to accommodate market tastes
and demands). Clusters could organize "reverse trade fairs" to bring together several
international buyers to meet loc producers and compare products that would be in high
demand.

The MSME financing mentoring program, which would comprise diagnostics, training,
and monitoring of firms getting loans from banks, will focus on (i)helping firms
understand their cash flows and improve their operations; and (ii)             provide relevant
information to banks on MSME clients so that both parties proactively manage
difficulties andrisks.

On the supply side, the consultant development and accreditation program will build
capacity of consultants at the individual, firm, and association levels through training in
various tools (such as Business Edge, M S M E toolkit) or develop training materials.
Moreover, the project will help sustain and expand STEP, which provides training,
consultancy, and technical assistance to micro-entrepreneurs. The pilot phase of the
program has already trained and deployed 10 university graduates (cadets) in four
regions; and by the end of the project, it is expected that additional cadets (most of
whom will graduate as independentBDS providers) will be trainedand able to service all
regions where there i s expressed demand (for example, in Timbuktu, Fana, Niono, and
elsewhere).

Component4: Project Coordination, Monitoring, andEvaluation (US$3.02 million)

The project will be implemented primarily by its beneficiaries, with technical support
from a project coordination unit for public-sector activities and a private contractor for
private sector activities. During project preparation, the government appointed the
National Investment Promotion Center (CNPI) to serve as project coordinator with the
support of the Financial Sector Development Project Implementation Unit for
procurement and financial management activities.' The government i s currently taking
the necessarysteps to competitively select the staff of a project coordination unit (PCU)
that will be placed under the purview of the Ministry of Investment Promotion and
SMEs. The PCU will be accountable to the project steering committee. The PCU will
oversee procurement, financial management, reporting, audits, monitoring, and
evaluation. A handful of activities, notably access to finance and business development
services, will be outsourcedto a private sector entity.

While relevant ministries and private sector organizations will retain responsibility for
technical aspects of the project, the PCU will be responsible for preparing biannual
progress reports, facilitating the mid-term progress review, ensuring adequate
monitoringand evaluation, undertakingthe impact assessment of the project, ensuring an
orderly closing of the project, and leading the preparation of the implementation
completion report.

                       Annex 6: Implementation Arrangements


The project will be implemented, under the purview of a public-private steering
committee led by the Ministry of Investment Promotion and MSMEs, by a project
coordination unit with the participation of technical ministries and relevant private sector
agencies. In light of the importance of the growth pole represented by the Bamako
airport and adjacent industrial zone, a technical committee will be established to monitor
specifically the implementation of the related set of activities provided under this
project.

Steering Committee

A steering committee composed of secretary generals of ministries involved in the
project and three private sector representatives will:
    0   Provide strategic direction and ensure that the general patterns of support are
        consistent with the project objectives;
    0   Approve annual work plan andbudget;
    0   Coordinate across government departments and relevant private sector agencies
        inrespect to multisectoralor inter-ministerialcomponents of the project;
    0   Review the quarterly progress reports and address any major problems affecting
        project implementation; and
    0   Review project implementationreports including audits.

The steering committee will be chaired by the Secretary General of the Ministry of
Investment Promotion and Small and Medium Enterprises, and consist of other core
ministries with responsibilities directly related to project activities-communications
and ICT, mining, tourism and crafts, transport, President's Office General Secretariat,
economy andfinance-plus       representatives of the private sector, including the Chamber
of Commerce, bankers' association, andmanufacturers' association). The representatives
of the private sector would primarily cover issues pertaining to investment climate,
access to finance, andenterprise skills and linkages.

Project CoordinationUnit

A project coordination unit will be set up under the Ministry of Investment Promotion
and SMEs andwill be composed of
    0   A projectcoordinator,
    0   A procurement specialist,
    0   A financial management specialist,
    0   An accountant,
    0   A civil engineer, and
    0   Anexecutive assistant.

These six individuals will be financed under IDA resources, whereas the rest o f the
support staff will be paid out of government resources.

The PCUwill serve as the administrator o f the project and will handle all administrative
matters in accordance with the Project Implementation Manual (PM). It will also ensure

                                             66

financial management and handle project disbursements, which includes the preparation
and submission of replenishment requests to IDA. The unit will be also responsible for
(i)maintainingamanagement informationsystem (MIS) for trackingprogress inall
project subcomponents, both in terms of financial performance and meeting
implementation targets, monitor the performance of all contractors under the project, and
provide quarterly reports to the steering committee and biannual reports to the Bank; and
(ii)preparing annual work programs and budgets, and if necessary, review in
consultation with IDA and the steering committee, the reallocation of resources across
the various components of the project as lessons emerge as to patterns of demand and
development impact. The PCU will contract out two sets of activities: (i)   infrastructure
activities, and (ii)
                   access to finance and business development services fund. While the
former would work under the purview of the PCU, the latter would be given autonomy
and would manage its own special account, which i s inline with best practice inthe area
of delivery of support services to the private sector.

As agreed upon during the participatory project preparation, the relevant sector
ministries will be responsible for the day-to-day administration and supervision of the
project activities within their sphere of relevance including, without limitation,
preparation of bidding documents, supervision of work, control over quality and time
schedules, and assessment of results achieved. The Borrower shall devise, in a manner
satisfactory to the Association, precise internal guidelines and procedures to ensure
smooth functioning of the various levels of project management.

Implementation of the Bamako airport growth pole activities

The development, operation andmanagement of Bamako airport will be carried out by
a private concessionaire. The specific implementation arrangements are as follows:
    0  The Project Coordination Unit will provide procurement support to appoint
       Technical consultants who will review the current Airport Master Plan design
       proposals for upgrading the airport facilities and services, revise and update the
       cost estimates and conduct detailed economic and financial feasibility analyses.
       Technical supervision of this process will be the responsibility of the Technical
       Committee and the Project Coordination Unit;
    0  The Project Coordination Unitwill also provide procurement support to appoint a
       Transaction Advisor who will assist the government in identifying the preferred
       concession arrangements based on the economic and financial feasibility
        analyses as well as design and implement the process to secure a private
        concessionaire according to intemational best practice and World Bank
        guidelines;
    0  The Government will take the necessary steps to ensure that the airport
        concessionaire takes prompt action on either directly or through a secondary
        concession, developing and managing the industrial zone; however, the airport
        concessionaire will not obliged to develop and manage the industrial zone as part
        of the concession conditions, as this i s the responsibility of Mali Invest and the
        Inter-ministerial Technical Committee.

With respect to the industrial zone, it will be developed andmanaged through a public-
private partnership. The Ministry of Investment Promotion and SMEs, through the
Technical Committee and Mali Invest, will be responsible for the implementation of the
industrial zone. The specific implementation arrangements are as follows:
    0   The Government has indicatedthat the airport concessionaire will take control of
        the 200 ha land allocated for industrial zone development. Based on this
        decision, it will be     the joint responsibility of Mali Invest, the Technical
        Committee and the Project Steering Committee to plan and coordinate the
        development of the industrial zone and ensure that the lease conditions between
        the airport concessionaire and the industrial zone developedmanager do not
        affect the competitiveness of the zone;
    0   The Project Coordination Unit will provide procurement support to appoint
        Project Management and Technical consultants who will assist the Technical
        Committee in detailed feasibility studies, design, preparation of bidding and
        contract documents and supervision of construction works for the off-site
        infrastructure works;
    0   The Project Coordination Unitwill also provide procurement support to appoint a
        Transaction Advisor who will assist the Technical Committee in identifying the
        preferred model of private-public partnership (direct lease, joint-venture or other
        concession arrangements) based on an assessment of the level of private sector
        interest, as well as design and implement the process to secure a private partner
        according to intemational best practice andWorld Bank guidelines.

           Annex 7: Financial Management and DisbursementArrangements


Summary of Financial Management Assessment

Implementing entity and staffing. The project will be managed by a project
coordination unit (PIU) set up under the Ministry of Investment Promotion and MSMEs.
The PIU will coordinate the project implementation at the national level including the
financial management. The PIU will appoint a finance officer and an accountant with
academic and professional qualifications acceptable to the Bank. Reporting to the
coordinator, they should be capable of directing and guiding the financial management
operations of the project.

Risk analysis. The overall conclusion of the Mali Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) conducted in 2002 and completed in 2003 is that "the public
finance management system i s*fairlycoherent with relatively strong budget procedures
implemented within a clear institutional setting with improving and strengthened control
measures." It goes on to add that "this reality should not hide malfunctions for which
appropriate dispositions should be taken." In essence, the CFAA shows that significant
progress has been made inthe areas of financial management. The country's own control
systems are operating more efficiently despite a few weaknesses in the supervision of
projects.

Consequently, various measuresto mitigate these risks have been agreed, and the project
risk from a financial management perspective could be moderate provided the risk-
mitigating measures are properly addressed. Therefore, financial management
arrangements are designed to ensure that funds are used for the purpose intended and
that timely information i s produced for project management and government oversight,
facilitating the compliance with IDA fiduciary requirements.

Control Risks. The main control risks, ratings, and mitigating measures are tabulated
below (table A7.1). Overall, the project risk is considered moderate.

Indicative formats for the reports are outlined in two Bank publications: (i)    quarterly
financial management reports (FMRs) in the FMR Guidelines, and (ii)           monthly and
annual reports in the Financial Accounting, Reporting and Auditing Handbook
(FARAH).

Accounting Policies and Procedures. Project accounts will be maintained on an
accurate basis, augmented with appropriate records and procedures to track
commitments and to safeguard assets. Accounting records will be maintained in FCFA.
The chart of accounts will facilitate the preparation of relevant monthly, quarterly, and
annual financial statements, including information on the following: (i)      total project
expenditures; (ii) total financial contribution from each financier and total expenditure
on each project component/activity, and (iii)  analysis of that total expenditure into civil
works, various categories of goods, training, consultants, and other procurement and
disbursement categories. Annual financial statements will be prepared in accordance
with International Accounting Standards (IASs). All accounting and control procedures
will be documented inthe manual o f procedures, a living document that will be regularly
updated.

Audit Arrangements

The IDA agreement will require the submission of audited project financial statements to
IDA within six months after year-end. Independent qualified external auditors will be
appointed on terms of reference (TORS)acceptable to IDA. A single opinion on the
audited project financial statements in compliance with International Standards on
Auditing (ISAs) will be required, including the accuracy and the propriety of
expenditures made under the SOEprocedures and the extent to which these can be relied
upon as a basis for credit disbursements. In addition to the audit reports, the external

                                             70

auditors will be expected to prepare a management letter giving observations and
comments and providing recommendations for improvements in accounting records,
systems, controls, and compliance with financial covenants inthe IDA agreement.

Disbursement Arrangements

The overall project funding will consist of IDA financing (Credit and Grant) and donor
contributions. A special account will be opened in FCFA in a commercial bank
acceptable to IDA. The Special Account will be managed by the PIU and will facilitate
payments for service andgoods in accordance with the respective contract currencies.

Interest income received on the speci'al accounts will be deposited to any other account
of borrower. Additionally, an IDA ledger loan account will be maintainedinWashington
in SDRs to keep track of drawdowns from the IDA funds. The account will show (i)     the
IDA intial deposit and replenishments into the Special Account bank (ii)direct
payments, reimbursements, or special commitments issuedby IDA, and (iii)    opening and
closing balances.

Bank Accounts. The Special Account initial advance will be made when the conditions
for credit effectiveness are met. The Bank accounts will be reconciled with bank
statements on a monthly basis and validated by the finance officer. Detailed banking
arrangements, including control procedures over all bank transactions (for example,
checks signatories, transfers, and so), will be documented inthe manual of procedures.

Special Accounts. To facilitate project implementation and reduce the volume of
withdrawal applications, the Govemment will open two special accounts (one for the
Credit and one for the Grant) in FCFA in a commercial bank on terms and conditions
acceptable to IDA. The authorized allocations will be respectively FCFA 980 billion for
the Credit and FCFA 1.6 billion for the Grant representing approximately 4 months o f
eligible expenditures. Upon effectiveness, IDA will deposit in each Special Account 50

                                             71

per cent of the authorized allocation. The balance will be made available, when the
aggregate withdrawals from the credit account plus the total amount of all outstanding
special commitments entered into by the Association shall be equal to or exceed the
equivalent of SDR 4 million for the Credit and SDR 7 million for the Grant. The Special
Accounts will be used for all payments inferior to 20% of the deposited amount, and
replenishment applications will be submitted at least once a month. Additional deposits
by IDA into the Special Accounts will be made against withdrawal applications
supported by appropriate documents. The Special Accounts will be audited annually by
external auditors acceptable to IDA, as part of the single project audit. The finance
officer will be responsible for submitting monthly replenishment applications with
appropriate supporting documents for expenditures. To the extent possible, all of IDA'S
share of expenditures should be paidthrough the special account. The special accounts
will be replenished through the submission of withdrawal applications on a monthly
basis and will include reconciled bank statements and other documents as required until
such time as the borrower may choose to convert to report-based disbursement. The
borrower may also choose to pre-finance project expenditures from its own resources
andseekreimbursement fromIDA.

Statement of Expenditures (SOEs)
Disbursements for all expenditures will be made against full documentation, except for:
(1) consultingfirms under contracts in an amount equivalent or inferior to US$lOO,OOO;
(2) individual consultants under contracts in an amount equivalent or inferior to
US$50,000; (3) works under contracts in an amount equivalent or inferior to US$
$500,000 equivalent; (4) goods under contracts in an amount equivalent or inferior to
US$ 250,000, as well as training, studies and operating costs. All supporting
documentation for SOEs will be retained at the PIU at MIP and will be made readily
accessible for review by periodic Bank supervision missions and external auditors.

Report-based disbursements

After one year of implementation, the borrower will be able to claim disbursements on
the basis of Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) subject to a financial assessment and
submission of satisfactory quarterly FMRs in the previous year. The F,Ws will integrate
financial   reporting,   procurement,      and   contract  management     with physical
implementationprogress.

Once FMR disbursements have been authorized, the Special Account advance will cover
project expenditures for six months as indicated in the initial six-month cash flow
forecast. After every subsequent quarter, the project will submit F M R s that include a
cash flow forecast for the following six- monthperiod. The cash request at the reporting
date will be the amount required for the forecast period as shown inthe approved FMRs
less the balance in the special account at the end of the quarter. Subsequent
disbursements of the IDA funds will be made inrespect of this request.

The option of disbursing the funds through direct payments from IDA on contracts
above a predetermined threshold will also be available. Withdrawal applications for such
payments will be accompanied by relevant supporting documents such as copies o f the
contract, contractors' invoices, and appropriate certifications. Detailed disbursement
procedures will be documented in the manual of procedures.

Counterpart funds and taxes. The Government of Mali will finance counterpart funds
including taxes due for local expenditures until such time as the Bank has approved
FinancingParameters for Mali.


Next Steps

Conditions for credit effectiveness. The conditions for credit effectiveness are: (i)a
finance officer and an accountant selected and appointed; (ii)    a financial management
system acceptable to the Bank installed; (iii)   special and project accounts opened with
counterpart initial deposit released; and (iv) qualified external auditors appointed. The
target date for their completion i s the end of May 2005.

Financial covenants. A financial management system, including records and accounts,
will be maintained by the PCU. Financial statements will be prepared in a format
acceptable to IDA and will be adequate to reflect in accordance with sound accounting
practices the operations, resources, and expenditures inrespect of the project.

Supervisionplan. Supervision activities will include review of quarterly FMRs, review
of annual audited financial statements and management letter, timely follow up of any
issues that arise, and participation in project supervision missions as appropriate. The
Bank F M S in charge will play a key role in monitoring the timely implementation of the
financial management arrangements.

Conclusion. The overall conclusion of the financial management assessments i s that,
providedthe following conditions are met prior to credit effectiveness, the Bank's
financial management requirements will be satisfied.

                         Annex 8: ProcurementArrangements


General

Use of the Bank Guidelines.Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out
in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRDLoans and
IDA Credits'' (May 2004), "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers" (May 2004), and the provisions stipulated in the legal
agreement. The general description of various items under different expenditure category
i s described below. For each contract to be financed by the loadcredit, the different
procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification,
estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the
borrower and the Bank project team inthe procurement plan. The procurement plan will
be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation
needs and improvements in institutional capacity. (For details of the procurement
arrangement involving international competition, see table AS.1. For thresholds for
procurement methods and prior review, see table A8.2.).

Procurement of Works. Works procured under this project will improve access to
serviced industrial land and improving Bamako international airport through large-scale
contracts that will attract foreign bidders. The project will also improve small-scale
artisan mining exploitation. The procurement will be done using the Bank's Standard
Bidding Documents (SBD) for all international competitive bidding (ICB) and national
SBD agreed with (or satisfactory to) the Bank.
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) advertised locally may be used for contracts not
exceeding US$500,000 equivalent and will be carried out with procedures acceptable to
the Bank and will ensure the following: (i)   bids are advertised in national newspapers
with wide circulation; (ii)  bid evaluation, bidder qualification, and award criteria are
specified clearly; (iii)
                       bidders are given adequate response time (minimumtwo weeks) to
prepare and submit bids; (iv) bids are awarded to the lowest evaluated bidders; (v)
eligible bidders, including foreign bidders, are not precluded from participating; and (vi)
no preference marginis granted to domestic contractors.

Civil works estimated to cost less than US$500,000 equivalent per contract may be
procured under NCB procedures. Small works estimated to cost less than US$50,000
equivalent per contract may be procured through shopping, based on price quotation
obtained from at least three contractors in response to a written invitation to qualified
contractors.

Procurementof Goods. Goods procured under this project would include: small-scale
mining extraction equipment, lab equipment for mining environmental analysis,
computer equipment, vehicles, promotional materials for tourism, frequency monitoring
and management for telecom. The procurement will be done using Bank's SBD for all
ICB and national SBD agreed with (or satisfactory to) the Bank.

NCB advertised locally may be used for contracts not exceeding US$250,000 equivalent
and will be carried out with procedures acceptable to the Bank and ensuring the
following: (i) bids are advertised in national news paper with wide circulation; (ii)  bid
evaluation, bidder qualification, and award criteria are specified clearly; (iii) are
                                                                                bidders

                                            74

given adequate response time (minimum two weeks) to prepare and submit bids; (iv)
bids are awarded to the lowest evaluated bidders; (v) eligible bidders, including foreign
bidders, are not precluded from participating; and (vi) no preference margin i s granted to
domestic suppliers.

Small quantities, such as office supplies, consumable materials, and spare parts available
off the shelve and which cannot be grouped into packages of a least US$50,000, will be
procured through shopping, basedon price quotation obtained from at least three reliable
suppliers in response to a written invitation to qualified suppliers. Office equipment cost
less than US$50,000 equivalent or less per contract and vehicles may also be procured
from the Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office (IAPSO).

Procurement of Non-consultingServices. The procurement of non-consulting services,
ifany, will be done usingbiddingdocuments agreed with (or satisfactory to) the Bank. It
is likely that in most cases, NCB will be carried out, and the same conditions as those
settled above for the procurement o f goods throughNCB procedures will apply.

Selection of Consultants. Consultant services under this project would include: (i)
monitoring,    supervision,   and project management;        (ii)setting up accounting
management system and financial and contract management; (iii)         project coordination
staff and technical advisory services for capacity buildingand support; (iv) technical and
financial audits; (v) training and workshops; and (vi) individual consultant services for
small studies and specialized advisory services (special assignments, technical
assistance). Short lists of consulting firms for services estimated to cost less than
US$100,000equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the consultant guidelines. Specific
consultant services involving any special arrangement for the use of universities,
government research institutions, and NGOs will follow special arrangements regarding
the selection of such entities.

Regarding Training, Workshops, and Study Tours, at the beginning of each year, each
beneficiary will submit their proposed staff development plans in the form of an annual
training plan for the coming year, to be reviewed by IDA. The plan would indicate the
persons or groups to be trained, the type of training to be provided, indicative learning
outcomes, the provider or location of the training, and its estimated cost. Selection of
training institutions for workshops/training should be based on a competitive process,
using the consultant's qualification methodof selection.

The standardrequest for proposal (W),       as developed by the Bank, will be used for the
selection of consultants. The project Agency will ensure widely publicized Requests for
expressions of interest (REI) for all contracts for consulting firms estimated to cost the
equivalent of US$200,000 or more, andfor all contracts for individuals estimated to cost
the equivalent of US$200,000 or more.

Operational Costs. Operational costs to be financed by the project will be procured
usingthe implementing agency's administrative procedures that have been reviewed and
found acceptable to the Bank.




                                            75

Reference to the National Procurement System. The Malian Procurement Code i s
regulated by Decree No. 95PRM (November 10, 1995) and was reviewed in 1995 and
1999 with IDA assistance. In general, the country's procurement procedures do not
conflict with the Bank's guidelines. No special permits or licenses need to be specified
inthe credit documents, becauseMalian procurement practices allow IDA procedures to
take precedence over any contrary local regulation or practice.

A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) carried out in Mali in December
1998 flagged problems in Mali's procurement practices, such as the lack of capacity
among the borrower staff, absence of SBDs at the national level, insufficient capacity of
local contractors for contract subject to ICB, and corruption. The review offered
recommendations to addressthese issues. Inaddition, an Institutional DevelopmentFund
(IDF) Grant was provided to strengthen the borrower capacity in procurement,
modernize the procurement process, and improve regulations. A CPAR update was
carried out in 2004, and its recommendations and action plan will be taken into
consideration duringproject implementation.

Assessment of the Agency's Capacity to Implement Procurement

Procurement activities will be carried out by a project implementation agency including
a procurement specialist. The staff i s currently being selected. The Project
Implementation Manual (PIM) to be prepared by the borrower prior to the effectiveness
of the credit will include a specific section on procurement, detailing procurement
procedures, SBDs, and other standard procurement documents to be used.

Since the implementing agency to implement procurement actions for the project has not
yet been created, an assessment of the capacity was not possible. However, it i s
recommended that related to the organizational structure for implementing the project,
the PIh4 outlines the interaction between the project's staff responsible for procurement
andthe ministry's relevant central unit for administration andfinance.

The issues and risks to be avoided concerning the procurement component for
implementation of the project would likely include;


    0  Znsuficient number of procurement sta8 in view of the possible increased
       number of procurement actions and the time constraints related to the kind of
       clients for this project (that is, operators from the private sector from many
       fields).
    a  Eventual insuficiency      in detailed procurement activities, such as:         (i)
       procurement planning; (ii)  preparation of bidding documents or RFPs, evaluation
       of bids or proposals, contract negotiation, and contract execution and
        supervision; and (iii)
                             procurement filing.
    0  Insuficient liaison between the procurement staff and other relevant staff in the
       project implementation unit or at the level of the central unit for adrmnistration
        and finance.

Measures to try to correct or mitigate these risks include recruitment of an adequate
number of qualified staff and implementation of intensive capacity-building activities,
including clinics on procurement and hands-on training.

                                            76

Procurement Plan

The borrower, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project implementation
that provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan was agreed upon by the
borrower andthe project team on November 16,2004 and is available at the office of the
General Secretary of the Ministry of Investment Promotion and Small and Medium
Enterprises (MIP), which is temporarily in charge of the preparation of the project
implementation. This procurement plan was finalized. Then it will also be available in
the project's databaseandinthe Bank's external website. It will be updated in agreement
with the project team annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation
needs and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

Frequency of Procurement Supervision

In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, and
regarding the possible issues about the capacity in procurement of the implementing
agency, it i s recommended to visit the field and conduct a post review of procurement
actions through a supervision mission each quarter during the first year of the project
and a supervision mission each semester thereafter.

Summary of Benefits and Costs

Base Case Results. The cost-benefit analysis of this project reflects the challenges faced in all
project evaluation in countries where the sound time series data required to calibrate the model are
not available. The simple model used to evaluate and simulate cash flows i s therefore based on
proxies derived from market assessments. The model takes into account the difficulty inquantifying
the economic benefits that result mainly from the lagged effects of the project and the indirect
relationshipbetween the support providedand the development impact.

That said, the Net PresentValue (NPV) and the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) are calculated. The
sensitivities of these results to critical assumptions are diagnosed under different scenarios to
evaluate the robustness of the project. A counterfactual case ("without project") was used to derive
the net effect by isolating performance not explainedby the project.

The cost-benefit analysis focuses on the seven main areas of interventionthat the three main project
components will encompass: tourism infrastructure, mining infrastructure, access to finance,
investment climate/institutional strengthening, BDS, telecommunications/post, and industrial zone.
For the purpose of the analysis, the airport and the crafts subcomponents are respectively factored
into the investment climate and the industrial zone components. The numeraire used are output
(proxied by foreign exchange revenues for the tourism sector) and employment income, which are
expected to increase as the result of increasedproductive investments andproductivity.

In the base case scenario, the project generates an NPV estimated at about US$39.6 million
consistent, with an internal economic rate of return of 26.1 percent (table A9.1). The project i s
expected to generatejobs as a result of increased productive activities and demand for labor in all
the sectors supported. Job creation, however, i s slowed by the relatively low capacity utilization rate
of 75 percent. In sum, an estimated 8,500 direct jobs are expected to be created. This number does
not include indirectjobs also expectedto be created inall the sectors supported.

The government fiscal position, other things being equal, i s also expected to improve. For the 12-
year forecast time frame, the project would generate US$14.0 million as the result of incremental
personal income taxes and corporate income taxes. Government revenues from land lease in the
industrial zone couldreach US$13.8million.

 Main Assumptions and Parameters (in the base case scenario). It is important to spell out the
 critical assumptions in the base case scenario because they will be tested, validated, or revised
 duringproject implementation. They will feed inthe model duringthe ex-post cost-benefit analysis
 after project closing to better reflect the true impact of the project. The monitoring and evaluation
 systemi s expectedto regularly collect all the relevant data. There are ten critical assumptionsinthis
 scenario:

      1. One thousand MSMEs will be supportedunder the BDS component. BDS are responsiveto
         the beneficiaries needs. Capacity buildingfor the beneficiary MSMEs has a lasting effect on
         their activities.

      2. For the access to finance component, it is assumed that the supported beneficiaries would
         increasetheir investmentandproductivity, which would inturn yield an increasein outputs
         at amultiple of five times the amount of support (access to financemultiplier).

      3. The estimatedin-country expenditurefor a tourist duringaperiodof eight days is US$l,OOO.
         The tourism income multiplier i s assumed to be 1.25 considering a marginal propensity to
         save of 0.2 and a marginal propensity to import of 0.6. The number of tourists in 2004 was
         100,000 andwill increaseat an averagerate of 3 percentper year.


      4. There are 200,000 people working in small-scale mining, one-third of which are indirect
         workers. The rateofjob creationinthe sector is 3 percentper year in the "with project" case
         comparedwith 1percentinthe "without project" case.


      5. For the telecom component, the output-based scheme more specifically, it i s expected that
         500 micro private operators (telephone service providers) will be supportedby the project.
         The unitcost to set up amicro operator i s US$1,600.


      6. At least 20 companies are expected in the industrial zone during project implementation,
         with an average number of 40 employees per company. The yearly cost of land lease in the
         zone i s estimated at US$25,000 per hectare. It i s assumed a job multiplier of two (for each
         directjob createdinthe zone).


 l6A financial analysis o f the industrialpark may be carried out during project implementation when more information
 on the profile of potential investors are available (following the preparation and implementation of the investment
 promotion campaign by MALI INVEST). A financial analysis for Bamako Airport may also be carried out by the
 Govemment's technical advisor prior to the selection of the concessionaire.


                                                        87

   7. Inthe base case, the increase infirms' output i s discounted by two-thirds to take into account
       the social costs of other resources in the economy that are diverted into the project from
       other activities not directly supported by the project.


   8. The average annual salary per worker i s US$1,068. The rates of job creation have been
       calculated taking into account a shadow yearly worth of output per worker of US$2700. The
       rates are discounted to take into account the relatively low capacity utilization rate of 75
       percent.

   9. Because it i s not easy to estimate ex ante the quantitative impact of institutional
       strengthening and investment climate development, it i s assumed that financial costs and
       benefits can be equated with the economic costs and benefits of the operations of assisted
       firms and institutions.

   1O.There i s a sustained government commitment to private sector development and
       diversification of the economy.

Sensitivity Analysis. Five sensitivity tests were carried out by changing values of critical variables
and parameters. The results, which show the fiscal impact as positive in all the scenarios, are
presented intable A9.3.

   1. The first test decreasesthe social cost of resourcesdiverted into the project from 66 percent
       to 50 percent; the NPV jumped to US$75.8 million with a corresponding internal rate of
       return (IRR) of 35.2 percent. About 10,300 direct jobs are created during the five-year
       lifetime of the project.

   2. The second test assumes a 75 percent social cost of resources diverted into the project, and
       the NPV considerably decreased to US$19.2 million while the IRR dropped to 19.7 percent.
       About 7,400 direct jobs are generatedduringthe five-year lifetime of the project.

   3. The thirdtest assumes a higher increase in output for each firm from 5 to 10for the MSMEs
       benefiting from the BDS; the access to finance multiplier also increases from 5 to 10. The
       results showed a NPV of US53.7 million and IRR of 30.4 percent. About 11,200 direct
       jobs are created duringthe five-year lifetimeof the project.

   4. The fourth test assumes a lower number of companies in the industrial zone, from 20 in the
       base case to 10; the results showed a NPV of US$33.4 million and IRR of 24.3 percent.
       About 7,600 directjobs are created duringthe five-year lifetime of the project.

   5. The fifth test elongates the disbursement period by two years, and the NPV decreased to
       US$29.0 million while the IRR came down to 22.7 percent. Some 6,700 direct jobs are
       created.

                                  Annex 10: Safeguard Policy Issues


The Mali Growth Support Project (GSP) aims particularly at improving the performance of the
micro, small and medium enterprise sector; enhancing the socioeconomic impact of the mining
sector; increasing access and efficiency of telecommunications; increasingeconomic opportunities
intourism andhandicrafts. Supportingsuchgrowth will strengthenthe country's economy andhave
positive significant impacts.

Because the GSP is a Category B project, the borrower was required, under World Bank safeguard
policies, to prepare, in this case, a Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA), based
on the triggering of the Environmental Assessment Policy (OP/BP 4.01). This SESA was carried
out in August 2004 by an international consulting firm, Cabinet GES-Conseil, in conjunction with
local consultants in relevant sectors covered under the project. It was conducted nationally,
following a broad consultation approach, in close collaboration with, but not limited, to the
following ministries: mines; tourism and hotel industry and associated trades; transport;
infrastructures; industries and industrial zone development; environment and natural resources;
health; and labor. Consultation also involved civil society, including NGOs at regional and local
government levels, village community representatives, and other relevant stakeholder and interest
groups.

The specific objective of the SESA study was to assess the environmental and social impacts of
current and future investment activities in the country, following national and World Bank
safeguard policies, and to propose measures to mitigate, avoid, or compensate for the negative
environmental and social impacts, including technical and social measures, institutional and legal
measures, research, and awareness building. The SESA, in addition to providing the general
framework for assessing environmental and social safeguard issues as they relate to each of the
components of the project, also identified the requirements for monitoring and enforcement of
recommended procedures, along with relevant monitoring indicators pertaining to each sector
involved. It also clearly outlined the institutional arrangements, spelling out the roles and
responsibilities of various parties involved in the mitigation and remediation action plans, from
institutional, regulatory, andtechnical points of view.

The political, legal, and institutional context of the environmental sector and the project's sectors
(private sector, mining, craft and tourism, telecommunication) presents achievements in the fields
of planning and strategic orientation documents, legislation, and regulations. Nevertheless, at the
institutional level, deficiencies are noticed in terms of capacities, coordination, and synergy during
programplanningandimplementation. The SESA report provides the framework for reinforcing the
legal andinstitutional context within which the project i s to be implemented, with aparticular focus
on the coordination and synergy that ought to take placebetweenthe various institutions andactors
involvedinthe implementation andmonitoring of the GSP.

At environmental and social levels, the private sector development component will have a highly
positive economic impact but is likely to generate negative effects as a result of land degradation
and poor management of risks related to industrial activities. If the moderate effects on
environmental and natural resources are managed well and follow the provisions in the SESA
report, then the economic and social impact of craft subcomponent i s expected to be high, at both
national and international levels, in terms of high employment rate, incomes, and valuation of local
products. Careful implementation of measures outlined in the SESA report will mitigate adequately
the risks identified so that they be very minimal. At the economic level, positive effects are
expected, mainly inrural areas.



                                                  91

As for the miningcomponent, there are significant potential negativerisks on biophysical resources
and social environment (forest and land degradation, water pollution, expropriation, population
displacement). At the same time, the miningcomponent will certainly have a very positive impact
on the national economy and local development. The negative impacts of the telecommunication
component will be rather minor relative to the expected benefits to the national economy.

The SESA includes a Strategic Framework for Environmental and Social Management of the GSP.
The framework identifies the orientation of future activities, in terms of environmental and social
management priorities at the national level, taking into account World Bank safeguard policies.

Onthe basis of national and sectorpriorities, inaccordancewith the requirements of the safeguard
policies, the strategic framework provides overall guidelines for environmentaland social
management of the GSP, concerning
    0   Environmental assessmentprocedures of each component of GSP
    0   Environmental and social managementfor the four GSP components
    0   Investment measures, as they relate, inparticular, to existing environmental problems and
        those caused by previous projects.

To optimize the management of environmental and social aspects of the GSP, the strategic
framework includes a public consultation framework, and detailed recommendations about
institutional arrangements andeven a resettlement framework.

Notwithstanding environment protectionprograms under way invarious sectors andvarious sources
of funding, table A1O.l presents the summary budget for environmental and social aspects in the
context of the GSP.

The SESA was submitted to ASPEN and has been reviewed and judged satisfactory. Clearance of
the SESA report was granted by the Regional Safeguard Coordinator and disclosure of the
document took place on November 15, 2004 in Mali and on December 28, 2004 at World Bank

                               Annex 15: Letter of DevelopmentPolicies

                                           INTRODUCTION

Mali i s a landlocked country with a relatively young population (48.9 percentunder the age of 15), and
an economy that relies essentially upon the agricultural sector. Mali has enjoyed more than a decade
of great political stability andharmonious social atmosphere.

The Government of the Republic of Mali has opted to construct a national economy basedupon free
enterprise. This i s a fundamental, and ostensibly immutable, policy choice. Indeed, since 1982, it has
undertaken to disengage the State from productive sectors, limiting itself to its essential functions of
national sovereignty, regulation, andprotection of personsandproperty.

The promotion of a dynamic and competitive private sector is thus a crucial challenge. An effective
policy must therefore be put inplaceto fulfill this mandate.

Despite efforts to improve the macro-economic situation and strengthen the institutional, regulatory,
and legal framework, Mali's private sector i s still faced with structural, financial, and organizational
problems that diminishits efficiency. Moreover, the country's volume of private investment, which i s
indispensableto economic growth and development, remainslow.

The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), in effect since 2002, constitutes the sole frame of
reference for Government interventions, as is confirmed in the Framework Letter [Zettre de cudrage]
datedOctober 23,2002 from the Presidentof the Republic to the Government.

Owing to its coherence and relevance, the PRSP has identified the private sector as the motor of
economic growth and sustainable development. One of the primary objectives of the PRSP is to
stimulate private sector developmentthrough the following interventions:

-   strengtheningof State/privatesectorcollaborative partnershipmechanisms;
-   consolidation and developmentof businesssupport infrastructures andservices;
-
- creation of a soundandefficient financial system;
    strengtheningof the institutional andregulatory foundations of markets;

-   developmentof the entrepreneurialspirit, promotion of small and mediumenterprises (SMEs), and

-   creation of the skills andbasic competenciesneededfor competitiveness;
    coordination andharmonization of programs supportedby the development partners;
-   increasedcontribution of exportsto growth.

In connection with PRSP objectives, the Government's recent General Policy Declaration of June
2004 set out the overall goal of reducing the incidence of poverty by one third, from 63.8 percent in
2001 to 47.5 percentby 2006.

The presentLetter of Private SectorDevelopment Policy aims to define the Govemment's strategic
orientations regardinginvestment promotion, improvement of production factors, andprivate sector
development.

                                      COUNTRY BACKGROUND

11.1.MACRO-ECONOMIC CONTEXT


Mali, with a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of 240 U S dollars, is among the world's poorest
countries. Its social indicators are also among the world's lowest. The country's average economic
growth, although remarkable compared to its earlier levels, is not strong enough to reduce poverty.

Mali's economy has infact experienced significant growth inreal terms over the past few years, due to
systemic reforms undertaken with the aid of the Bretton Woods institutions (i.e., the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank) and other technical and financial partners. The average economic
growth rate has stood at about 5 percent since the 1994 currency devaluation, leading to an average
annual per-capita increase in the real gross national product (GNP) of 5.6 percent from 1994to 2003,
compared to an average of 3.2 percent for sub-Saharan Africa over the same period. This is a positive
situation that puts Maliamong the three best-performing countries inthe West African franc zone.

All of the key economic sectors, and especially those geared to exports, have contributed to this
acceleration of the pace of growth.          In the agricultural sector, cotton production, which has
experienced renewed competitiveness, higher world prices, and relatively favorable rainfall, has
increased by an average of 12 percent annually, makingMali the largest cotton producer and exporter
in Africa. Rice production has also surged over the last two decades: Mali is now a net exporter of
rice to neighboring ECOWAS States, thereby improving its balance of payments. The primary sector
dominates the Malian economy, although its growth i s highly variable. The agricultural situation,
which i s subject to great climatic fluctuations, has a direct effect on GDP and a powerful influence on
other sectors.

The rapid development of the secondary sector, driven by the mining industry, boosted this sector's
contribution to GDP from 15 percent prior to the devaluation to about 24 percent in 2002. Mining
production represented over half of this sector's value added, with the rest derived mainly from civil
works and construction. Gold production and exports increased ten-fold between 1995 and 2002,
mainlydue to the opening of the Sadiola mine in 1997. Malihas thereby become Africa's thirdlargest
producer andexporter of gold, after South Africa andGhana. The value of goldexports increased from
CFAF 40 billion in 1996 to CFAF 137 billion in 1998, before reaching a record-breaking CFAF 439
billion in 2002. In2003, however, a dip in growth was observed following a drop in gold production
from 66.1 tons in 2002 to 53.6 tons in 2003, a decline o f 18.9 percent; there was also a drop in
manufacturing production, which is dominated by cotton ginning plants.            The secondary sector
experienced an 8.5 percent decline in value added in 2003, compared to an increase of 18.9 percent in
2002.

The tertiary sector, the growth o f which was previously driven by trade, i s enjoying the economic
effects of the start-up of the first private telecommunications company, IKATEL. Sector growth i s
currently dominated by the "transport and telecommunications" industry, in which performance i s
essentially linked to the rapid expansion of cellular telephony in Mali. The Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) forecasts a drop in growth in the tertiary sector, from 6.5 percent in 2004 to 6
percent in 2005. This drop in performance i s essentially a result of a decline in the trade-related
industries, in which growth will decline from 6.2 percent in 2004 to 1.9 percent in 2005, and in
"miscellaneous services", which will see growth fall from 4.4 percent in 2004 to 0.5 percent in 2005.


                                                  100

The positive trend observed in various sectors of the economy has caused a significant increase in
Mali's main exports (Le., gold, cotton, and livestock), which account for 90 percent of the country's
total export volume. This has resulted in an improvement in public revenues that has re-absorbed the
budget deficit, which fell from an average of 6.6 percent of GDP over the 1985-1993 period to 1.5
percent between 1993 and 2002. The external current accounts deficit, excluding current official
transfers, droppedfrom 10.8 percent of GDP in 1999 to 6.3 percent of GDP in 2002. The rapid growth
in exports has made it possible to restore a balance of trade surplus. One factor contributing to the
improved balance of trade has been the influx of direct foreign investment as a result o f general
policies, particularly in the mining sector. Following a sharp uptick between 1999 and 2002, the
volume of foreign direct investment has been in decline since 2003.

This economic performance reduced poverty by about 7.5 percentage points between 1996 and 2000.
There are still problem areas, however, that will require the deployment of enormous efforts in order
to improve the living conditions of the local populace.

Poverty reduction requires an annual GDP growth rate exceeding 5 percent, as well as an increase in
the value of exports. Despite the encouraging results obtained, the prospects for more vigorous growth
are thwarted by bottlenecks in all sectors, which result from inadequacies in the legal and regulatory
framework; the Administration's weak capacities and cumbersome procedures; the low level of
investment and low productivity rate; financing difficulties; and the inappropriateness or inadequacy
of infrastructures. Mali's economy, which is essentially agricultural and relatively undiversified,
remains vulnerable to unfavorable climatic conditions and exogenous shocks, particularly as regards
the terms of trade.


11.2.STATUSOF THEPRIVATESECTOR


The macro-economic reforms undertaken by the State have been accompanied by efforts to strengthen
the private sector. According to a study prepared by the Moderator, the State devoted CFAF 123.4
billion to private sector support between 1992 and 2002. These efforts increased the private sector's
share inMali's GDP andexpanded the sector significantly (between 1995 and 2002):

    The private sector, including the informal sector, employs 90 percent of the labor force;
    The private sector remains dominated by the private agricultural sector and the informal sector.
    Out of a working population estimated at 5.2 million, about 3.9 million work inthe agricultural
    sector and 1.2 millionin the informal sector;
    The formal sector is relatively insignificant in terms of jobs. Total jobs inthe formal sector were
    estimated in2002 at 21,500, of which nearly 60 percent were in agribusiness or agro-industry;
    The average annual contribution of the private agricultural sector was CFAF 778 billion
    (between 2000 and 2003), or 35 percent o f GDP at market prices. The secondary and tertiary
    sectors accounted for 21 percent and 44 percent of GDP, respectively (of which 20 percent was
    contributedby trade-related industry).
    The proportion of private enterprises rose from 70 percent to 82 percent of the total for the non-
    agricultural sector;
    the private sector's share in total industrial investment rose from 21 percent to 55 percent,
    compared to those of the mixed and public sectors, which were 40 percent and 4.7 percent,
    respectively;
    there were a total of 243 industrial enterprises in 2003, of which 229 units, or 94.2 percent of the
    industrial fabric, were inmanufacturing;

                                                  101

    Wholly private enterprises account for 91.3 percent of the 243 industrial enterprises, while 0.3
    percent are State-owned and 5.35 percent mixed enterprises;
    The District of Bamako (the capital) alone was the site of 169 (i.e., 69.9 percent) of the 243
    industrial enterprises in 2003, owing notably to the absence of industrial zones inthe regions;
    The number of private enterprises in the civil works and construction sector that received
    accreditation between 1994 and 2004 now totals 3,500;
    The number o f accredited transporters stands at 392;
    The private health care sector was comprised of 686 health care facilities as of early 2003,
    including 159 doctors' offices, 39 clinics, and 29 religiously affiliated health care facilities,
    concentrated inurban centers (50 percent inBamako, 13 percent in Sikasso, 11percent in SCgou, 9
    percent inKoulikoro and 7 percent inKayes).

The rural sector, comprising agriculture, sylviculture, livestock, and fishing, has benefited since 1992
from a national strategy to ensure its short-, medium-, and long-term development. The first Rural
Development Plan [Sche`ma Directeur du Secteur du De`veloppement Rural, SDSDR] covered the
period from 1992 to 2000, and resulted in average annual growth of 3.6 percent in the sector. The
second SDSDR (2000-2010) was adopted by the Government on January 2, 2002. An Agricultural
Competitiveness and Diversification Project is under preparation. The objective of the project i s to
help remove obstacles to the development of certain commercial agricultural production streams in
which Mali enjoys a comparative advantage and confirmed market outlets.

The non-agricultural private sector i s dominated by service firms, with a trade industry that i s
expanding more quickly than productive investment.          The non-structured (or informal) sector,
mainly comprised of trading activities and a host of "small professions" [petits me`tiers], constitutes
a virtual social safety net and provides manyjobs, but i s not accounted for in official analyses of the
private sector.

In the mining sector, apart from the small number of large mining companies, artisanal mining
accounts for a significant share of production: 3 tons of gold ore (5 percent of national production) per
year in 2002. Growth in the mining sector cannot be sustained without an expansion of the mining
inventory and support for the creation and development of small- and medium-scale mining
enterprises, in the gold sub-sector as well as in sub-sectors extracting other resources (e.g., industrial
minerals and construction materials) that are relatively abundant inMali.

The weight of the industrial sector inMali's economic structure remains low. This sector accounts for
about 11percent of GDP, and manufacturing, which has the most growth potential, accounts for about
6 percent of national wealth. This situation is due to a low rate of business creation, despite the
political stability and partial reorganization of the business environment. Of 683 projects approved
under the investment code between 1998 and 2003, 338 were in the industrial sector, and only 78 of
those, or 23 percent, were implemented. Of those that were implemented, over 50 percent involved
bakeries or pastry shops. This is partially explained by a lack of industrial zones and also by the
inadequacy of industrial strategies. The Government adopted a new industrial policy in November
2004 in order to accelerate this sector's contribution to growth.

Important reforms are underway in the area of trade in order to better organize, expand and diversify
the contribution of trade to economic growth. The IntegratedFramework for Trade-Related Technical
Assistance, now being put inplace, will serve as the frame of reference for trade-related interventions.




                                                 102

The improvement of Mali's internal and external accessibility, enhancement of transport sector
performance, greater efficiency in transport operations, and lower transport costs are important factors
in private sector development. Reformshave been undertaken inthe transport sector through transport
sector projects (TSPs), Phase 1 of which covered the 1995-2004 period, and projects to improve
transport corridors, which will cover the 2005-2008 period and constitute Phase 2 of the TSP. These
reforms will help develop infrastructures, build capacities, restructure public enterprises, and develop
the private transport sector.

Handicrafts have pride of place in the Malian economy, by virtue of their richness, their contribution
to GDP, and their capacity to generate employment. Indeed, handicrafts are estimated to employ 40
percent of the population and are thought to account for 15-20 percent o f GDP. Over the past few
years, artisanal activities have benefited from a sectoral promotion policy on the part of the State, with
the support of development partners, which has resulted in the creation of a legal and regulatory
framework and supporting institutions in the sector (e.g., a national handicrafts promotion center, the
Centre National de Promotion de I'Artisanat,or CNPA, and various professional guilds [Chambresde
Me`tiers].These efforts are to continue within the framework of an actual Master Plan for Handicrafts
Development [Sche`ma Directeur de De`veloppement de 1'Artisanat] in order to exploit the growth
potential of this sector.

With its illustrious historical heritage and wealth of geographic diversity, Malihas great potential for
tourism. The epicenter of this little-developed touristic potential consists of the regions around Mopti
andTombouctou. These regions, inwhich the World Heritage Sites of DjennC, the Dogon country and
the city of Tombouctou are located, are the premier tourist destinations in the country, which currently
receives about 100,000 tourists per year.

Efforts made over the last few years have enabled the private sector to expand andimprove the supply
of hotels and tourism services. With the help of the development partners (i.e., the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and the World Tourism Organization (WTO)),tourism development
strategies and a priority action plan have been drawn up. In this sector as well, the objective i s to
develop and implement a veritable Tourism Development Master Plan aimed at developing sustainable
tourism, with an annual influx of 300,000 tourists by 2009.

The postal and telecommunications sector is important for two reasons. With the explosion of new
information and communications technologies, it is an important source of growth, and the services
that it provides are also a key production factor for every other sector inthe economy.

Expansion of the telecommunications sector and improved access to information and communication
technologies are among the Government's              priorities, as set out in its Declaration of
Telecommunications Sector Policy adopted in June 1998 and amended in June 2000. Implementation
of the sectoral policy has ledto important sectoral reforms, including the adoption of a new regulatory
framework attractive to private investors, the creation of an autonomous and independent regulatory
 agency (the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission, CRT), and has also opened the sector to
competition, as evidenced by the emergence o f a second national operator, IKATEL. Thanks to the
introduction of competition, Mali has improved its level of access to telecommunications services,
increasing its penetration rate twelve-fold between 1995 and 2003, reaching 2.45 fixeamobile
telephone lines per 100inhabitants as of 2003. Improvements to the regulatory framework and greater
capacity on the part of the regulator and the Administration are still needed. The privatization of the
historical operator will enable it to enter into competition with the private sector. The formulation and
implementation of the National Policy on the Development of Information and Communication
                                                  103

Technologies (ICT) will reduce the "digital divide" and encourage the adoption of ICTs. Access to
telecommunications services, including ICTs, in rural areas is essential to private sector development
and to the country's economic growth.

Mali's postal sector includes, in addition to the public operator, OfJice National des Postes (OW),
various national and foreign actors (e.g., internationalcourier services, transit companies, express mail
companies, banks, travelers' transport companies, the informal sector, etc.). There is no law regulating
the postal sector in Mali. Since 1971, the public operator has adhered to the provisions of various
ordinances setting out the rules for postal operations incountries belongingto the Conference of Postal
and Telecommunications Administrations of the States of West Africa                    [Confe`rence des
Administrations des Postes et Te`le`communicationsdes Etats de Z'Afrique de 1'Ouest] (CAPTEAO).
Since its creation, ONP has hadproblems associated mainlywith the absence of a postal sector policy;
the shrinkage of its activities portfolio following the loss of responsibility for Postal Checking
Accounts [comptes chbques postaux] (CCP) and National Savings Accounts [Caisse Nationale
d'Epargne] (CNE); the precariousness of its financial situation; and the obsolescence of its
infrastructures and equipment. The postal sector reform policy undertaken by the Government i s
aimed at enabling this sector to play its rightfulrole inMali's socio-economic development.

The private sector has an increasingly important role in the health care system. Apart from the
traditional medicine system, which generally operates in the informal sector, the liberalization of the
health care professions and regulatory provisions have fostered the rapid development of the private
sector, and notably in the medical and paramedical fields.         The private exercise of health care
professions, which has been legal since 1985,is concentrated mainly in the large cities, and especially
in Bamako. The ten-year Program for Health and Social Development [Programme de`cennal de
de`veloppement du secteur de la sante`] (PRODESS) envisages further expansion of private sector
health care and improved public/private coordination.

             OBJECTIVESOFTHE PRIVATESECTORDEVELOPMENTPOLICY

The new environment of global competition, the challenge of globalization, the liberalization of
international trade and rapid technological change are exerting strong pressure on the competitiveness
of enterprises, and particularly on those involved in export. Mali i s paying a very high price for the
inadequacy o f its infrastructure and business climate, in the form o f lost opportunities for economic
growth, market expansion andjob creation, improved household incomes, and popular access to basic
service infrastructures.

Private operators, and particularly Malian exporters, must henceforth cope with increasingly short
product-development cycles, as well as with increasingly compressed market-delivery deadlines, not
to mention the ever-increasing pressure to reduce production costs and product prices. All of this,
combined with the challenge, for private operators, of remaining constantly up-to-date on information
and new technologies influences by rapid internet developments, is fundamentally changing the
business model and the way in which enterprises deal with their partners and clients throughout the
world.

Mali's private operators enjoy significant development opportunities through regional integration
(particularly through WAEMU, ECOWAS, and the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States, or CEN-
SAD), as well as advantages conferred by international agreements signed by Mali with the European
Union (e.g., the Cotonou Agreement) and the United States (e.g., the African Growth and Opportunity
Act, or AGOA). Mali i s a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The favorable macro-
economic situation and the opening of external African, European and North American markets should
                                                  104

enable the Malian private sector to derive substantial benefits interms of investment opportunities and
competitiveness.

Given the central role that the Government wishes to assign to the private sector as the motor of
development, a Ministryof Investment Promotion and Small and MediumEnterprises has been
created to give new impetus andmomentum to the private sector and to re-invent its relationship with
the public authorities, which aspire henceforth to be the facilitators andpromoters of private enterprise
andinvestment inthe country.

Inorder to increase the volume of foreign investment and ensure true private sector development, the
Government is emphasizing the following objectives:

       Improve and strengthen the State/private sector dialogue, and re-invent the relationship
       between the private sector andthe State with a view to more effective collaboration;
       Establish Mali as the sub-region's best locale for private investors, and achieve a sustainable
       increase inthe volume of productive private, national and international investment, particularly
       inkey sectors;
       Promote value-added by encouraging the establishment of competitive industries in the area of
       processing of raw materials and local products;
       Develop and diversify the sources of growth;
       Promotebusiness creation and support business development, inorder to increase the weight of
       the formal sector;
       Buildcapacities inprivate sector support entities, and develop humanresources.

                       STRATEGICTHEMES OFTHENATIONALPOLICY

The Government has identifiedfour strategic themes corresponding to the stated objectives:

1. Stimulate acoherent dynamic for private sector development

The first strategic theme of the private sector development policy is aimed at ensuring a coherent
framework for spurringa true development dynamic for the private sector. This requires strengthening
of the State/private sector dialogue and coordination of the State's sectoral policies within the
framework of a real ten-year program of private sector development.

Mali's private sector i s organized by professional spheres around 26 federated groups within the
National Council of Malian Employers [Conseil National du Patronat du Mali] (CNPM). In addition,
four consular chambers handle public interest issues arising between economic operators and the
public authorities. The private sector i s traditionally involved in many economic sectors in relation
with various ministerial departments.

Increating the Ministry of Investment Promotion and Small and MediumEnterprises, the Government
has expressed its willingness to help define, implement, and coordinate a new national, global, and
coherent policy for the promotion of investment and private sector development in Mali.




                                                  105

State/private sector collaboration will be organized within three frameworks:

-   A permanent consultative framework, the Council for Coordinationof Private Sector Development
    [Conseil de Coordination du Dkveloppementdu SecteurPrivk] (CDSP), an entity with equal
    representation ledby the Moderator of State/private sector Dialogue;
-   The annual GovernmentIPrivate Sector meeting, chaired by the President of the Republic, between
    the Government and all national components of the private sector;
-   The Presidential Investors' Council [Conseil Prksidentiel pour 2'Znvestissement] (CPI), which
    began its work in September 2004 and which includes foreign personages. Its goal i s to improve
    the investment climate inMali.

2. Modernize the investment framework andclimate

The second strategic policy theme for private sector development consists of modernizing the
investment climate as well as the legal and regulatory frameworks pertaining to the private sector.
This modernization has to do with the overall investment climate as well as with the sectoral policies
of the various ministerial departments relevant to the private sector.

The modernization of the investment climate assumes that there i s an active policy of investment
identification andpromotion, as well as efficient procedures for business creation. To this end, there i s
a need to reorganize and strengthen institutions and entities involved in investment promotion and in
the provision of business creation and development services.

Active participation on the part of the various actors, and particularly by the private sector, will be a
crucial element inthe success of the new policy.

The strengthening of the State's institutional capacities and the availability of competent human
resources are also critical factors in a modem investment environment.

3. Establishminimumgrowth-supportinginfrastructures

The third strategic theme of the private sector development policy is concerned with remedying the
dearth of physical infrastructures that are competitive andattractive to investors.

Given the accumulated delay and the extent of the resources needed, the Government has opted, on the
one hand, to construct the minimal physical and logistical infrastructure required to make economic
opportunities more visible to the private sector and, on the other, to accelerate the modernizationof the
other infrastructures crucial to the operation of minimal infrastructures (e.g., airports, feeder roads for
industrialzones, energy and telecommunications infrastructures, etc.). The new modern platforms will
be environmentally friendly and will offer efficient and competitive basic services (e.g., water,
electricity, ICT, etc.) They will be placed under private management, with the State assuming a
regulatory role through the investment promotion entity.




                                                 106

4. Promote and supportbusinessdevelopment

The fourth strategic theme of the private sector development policy i s aimed at accompanying and
     orting business develo

The availability, in adequate quantity and quality, of financial and non-financial services for
businesses, and particularly for SMEs and SMIs, i s an important factor in improving the
competitiveness of their products. Particular attention shall be paid to SMEs/SMIs in certain target
sectors with high growth potential (eg, textiles, meat, leather, handicrafts, tourism, mining,
telecommunications and postal services, etc.) The competitiveness of Malian SMEs/SMIs will be
strongly linked to improvement of the quality of their products for export and to their adherence to the
standards anddemands of international markets.

The Government embarked a few years ago upon a Financial Sector Development Program (FSDP),
the goal of which is to increase the sector's viability, efficiency and competitiveness. The
dissemination of micro-financing in Mali is aimed at providing a partial response to the problems
experienced by SME promoters in obtaining access to traditional bank credit. A national program of
micro-finance development shouldboost the performance of this sector.

There are many problems, however, related to the long-term financial requirements of enterprises. The
Government's goal i s to put in place the instruments and accompanying incentives that will cause the
banking sector to help meet those financing needs. These new instruments will be placed under
private management andwill not generate structural costs for the State.

The long-term development of financial services requires that efficient non-financial services be
available and accessible to enterprises. These non-financial services must be capable of helping banks
to better analyze and manage business-related risks (particularly for SMEs), and must also help
businesses themselves, and particularly those that have financing, to improve their management. The
Government intends to encourage the development of effective business assistance and advisory
services throughthe appropriate instruments.

                       PRIVATESECTORDEVELOPMENTPROGRAM

This private sector development program aims to modernize the overall framework of private sector
development inMali, while at the same time providing specific support to sectors identified as having
potential and in which a global, coherent and simultaneous support effort will contribute to the
attainment of the Govemment's goals in terms of economic and social growth and poverty reduction.
Sectors already benefiting from specific development programs (e.g., in agriculture, trade, energy,
etc.) financed by the development partners, will benefit from the modernization of the general
framework for private sector development.

The environmental and social impact o f the implementation of activities under the Private Sector
DevelopmentProgram will be studied and considered as an integral part of the program.

V.I. COORDINATION THE GOVERNMENT'S
                      OF                        SECTORAL POLICIES AND STRENGTHENING OF THE
GOVERNMENT/PRIVATE       SECTOR DIALOGUE

V.l.1. Coordinationwithin a ten-yearprivate sector developmentprogram

The efficacy of State intervention requires the coordination and harmonization of the various sectoral
policies relevant to the private sector. This requires the implementation of a ten-year private sector
development program.

V.1.2.Strengtheningof the Government/privatesector dialogue

The strengthening of this dialogue requires that consultative and promotional agencies be energized
and that the various meetings and events be well organized. The mainentities involved are:

- The Coordinating Council for Private Sector Development [Conseil de Coordination du

-   De`veloppementdu Secteur Prive`] (CDSP);
    The annual Government/private sector meeting, chaired by the President o f the Republic;
-   The Presidential Investors' Council (CPI);
-- The Investors' Forum;
    Annualprivatesector workshops [joume`esannueZZesdu secteurprive`].

v.2. IMPROVEMENT ANDREGULATORYFRAMEWORKAND CAPACITY BUILDING
                      OF THE LEGAL

V.2.1.Improvementof the legal and regulatorypamework and investment climate

The establishment o f new legal and regulatory frameworks relevant to the private sector, or the
improvement of existing ones, is an essential pre-requisite for improving Mali's attractiveness to
investors andfor creating an environment conducive to business development.

The modernization of the investment climate assumes systematic micro-economic and institutional
reform efforts to improve key indicators, such as:

-
--  Time andexpenserequired to create a business;
    Flexibility of the labor market;
    Registration andprotectiono f property rights;
-   Adherence to contracts and average time requiredto resolve business disputes;
-   Options and formalities involved inobtaining credit;
-   Procedures andnotice requiredfor cessation of activity.

The improvement of these indicators and the removal of the various obstacles to investment and
business development can have a significant positive impact on growth.

Apart from general reforms, sectoral policies need to be revised and adapted to the new stakes and
issues, particularly for sectors selected in connection with efforts to support sources of growth.




                                                  108

The essential reforms pertain to:

    3 Improvementandadoption of various legislativeandregulatory texts

The body of legislative and regulatory texts pertaining to investment and private sector development
will be reviewed and improved. The texts to be adopted will help improve the general business
climate, reduce bureaucratic constraints, simplify the business tax regime and customs procedures, and
will generally improve economic governance. The development of the various texts will require
numerous studies.

The maintexts pertain to:

-  The mandates and modes of operation of the various entities or frameworks for
   Government/private sector consultation (e.g., the Coordinating Council for Private Sector
   Development, the Office of the Moderator, the annual Governmendprivate sector meeting, the
   Presidential Investors' Council, etc.);
-  The institutional framework for private sector outreach andpromotion;
-  The overall investment code for Mali, which will need to be supplemented, as needed, with
    specific codes adapted to sectors deemed to have growth potential, so as to increase its
    attractiveness and optimize it interms of procedures and the time requiredfor approvals;
-  The modernization of entities involved ininvestment promotion and business support, through the
    creation of an actual investment promotion andbusiness service agency, including the provision of
    industrial zones (Mali Invest) to replace existing structures (i.e., the National Investment
    Promotion Center (CNPI) and the industrial zone development agency [Agence d'ame'nagement
    des Zones Zndustrielles] (MI-SA);
-   The single window for registration and creation of a unique identifier in order to reduce the cost

- Revision of the labor code in order to remove obstacles and constraints that hamper the flexibility
    andtime requiredto create a business;


-   of the labor market andinhibit investment or business creation;
    The customs and tax codes, in order to arrive at a business tax regime that is simpler, more
    attractive, less punitive and better suited to the new investment code;
- The modernization of judicial procedures, and particularly the establishment of alternative
    mechanisms for the resolution of business disputes through mediation and arbitration.

    3 Improvementof sectoralpolicies

The anticipated effects of an improvement of the institutional framework and investment climate
cannot be realizedunless all sectoral policies for investment promotion and private sector development
are adjusted. The overall policy must be supported, and the specificities and unique situation of each
sector taken into account. Regarding the sectors selected for simultaneous support due to their growth
potential, the reforms pertain to:

    1. Handicrafts and tourism sectors

The goal for the handicrafts sector will be to foster conditions conducive to the creation of jobs and
incomes in the sector, so that it can be a powerful tool inthe Government's poverty reduction efforts.
Regarding tourism, the reforms are aimed at increasing the number of tourist visitors from 100,000 to
300,000, and at encouraging sustainable tourism in the interest of the harmonious growth and
development of Mali's regions.
                                                    109

Inorder to achieve these sectoral objectives, the following actions arerequired:

-  Revision and improvement of the institutional and regulatory environment (and particularly the
   legal and fiscal framework) of Malian handicrafts and tourism, in order to boost their
   effectiveness;
-  Development of the Master Plan for Handicrafts and Tourism, and implementation of the planned
   interventions. The strategy and priority action plan will be precisely defined, so as to rank
   activities by priority and establish a timetable for them;
-  Improvement of the policy on tourism development and creation of frameworks for consultation
   among those involved intourism.

   2. Telecommunicationssector

The goal for this sector is to increase access to competitively-priced electronic communication
services through the establishment of a legal and institutional framework conducive to the creation and
operation of telecommunications networks and services by private operators.

Inorder to achieve these sectoral objectives, the following actions arerequired:

-  Continued improvement of the regulatory framework for telecommunications, the unifying theme
   being the identification of anything that might impede investment or the development of new
   economic opportunities related to the sector, and the modifications to the regulatory framework
   requiredto remove those obstacles;
-
-  Technical and financial support for SOTELMA'Sprivatization process;
   Formulation of a strategy for expanding access to ICTs in remote communities, and
   implementation of the necessaryinstitutional reforms.

   3. Postal sector

The objective inthe postal services sector will be to provide universal postal service to disadvantaged
population groups, as well as those living in remote areas, to improve overall performance of the
postal sector by opening the market to greater private sector participation, and to transform the public
operator (i.e., OW) into a modem, dynamic and efficient enterprise.

Inorder to achievethese sectoral objectives, the following actions arerequired:

-  Reform of the postal service geared to the definition of a sectoral policy and a re-direction of the
   postal operator in accordance with this sectoral policy (organization and regulation of the sector,
   reorganization and modernizationo f the public operator);
-  Development of a new legal and regulatory framework stipulating: the opening of the sector to
   competition and the categorization of postal services as universal services, reserved (i.e.,
   monopoly) services, and services open to competition;
-  Modification of texts to enable the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (CRT), in an
   expansion of its current mandate, to assume responsibility for regulatingthe postal sector.




                                                   110

    4. Mining sector

The promotion and diversification of the mining sector are crucial to maintaining and expanding this
sector's contribution to Mali's economic and social development and to poverty reduction. The task
will be to encourage the creation and development of small- and medium-scale mining companies
alongside the large companies, in the gold sub-sector as well as in those involving other resources
(e.g., industrial minerals and construction materials) that are abundant inMali. The miningsector, like
other sectors that produce raw materials, can only produce its full positive impact on the national
economy within the context of a coherent policy based on an enabling institutional and legislative
framework, a greater willingness to diversify, and a sustained effort at prospection and exploration.

Inorder to achieve these sectoral objectives, the following actions are required:

-   Improvement of mininglegislation and taxation in order to encourage investment and the creation
    and development of small- and medium-scale miningenterprises;
-   Development of a policy for the management and capitalization of miningrevenues;
-   Development and adoption of standards and guidelines for environmental protection.


V.2.2. Strengtheningof institutionalcapacities


Investment promotion and private sector development require improvement of the institutional, legal
and regulatory framework, as well as an efficient and effective institutional environment.

The creation of new entities needs to be supported: e.g., by the Presidential Investors' Council (CPI),
the Malian Investment Promotion Agency (Mali Invest), and the Telecommunications Regulatory
Commission (CRT), and it also requires capacity-building inthe various ministerial departments, and
particularly within the new Ministry of Investment Promotion and Small andMedium Enterprises.

The success of the overall reform inpromoting investment and private sector development depends to
a great extent upon the efficacy and positive outcome of the undertakings o f the new agency Mali
Invest. Particular support must be provided to this agency in all areas (e.g., establishment and
organization, active investment promotion, single window, private sector development, promotion of
business services, etc.).

The handicrafts and tourism sectors will be assistedin their training operations (both internal and of
private actors), and intheir communication and promotion activities. Strengthening of the capacities of
the CNPA and the Malian Office of Tourism and Hotels [Ofice Malien du Tourisme et de
l'H8teZEerie] (OMATHO) will provide them with an efficient statistical information system. Support
for a renewed program of activities of the "Tissuth2que" (a center for the promotion of traditional
textiles) will promote traditional textile crafts that use traditional production methods.

In the mining sector, capacity-building is required for entities such as the National Geology and
MiningDirectorate [Directionnationale de la ge`ologieet des mines] (DNGM)andthe agency for the
promotion of petroleum exploration [Autorite` pour la promotion de la recherche` pbtrolidre]
(AUREP).



                                                    111

Support for representative bodies in the private sector i s also needed, in order to enable them to play
their role fully.

v.3.cONSTRUCTIONOFMINIMAL GROWTH-SUPPORTINGINFRASTRUCTURES

V.3.1. Globalinfrastructures


The Government intends to ensure the availability of infrastructures that meet business installation and
expansion requirements, in Bamako as well as in each regional capital. Modern and competitive
industrial zones will be created, within which production factor costs (e.g., energy, water, telephone,
internet, etc.) will be competitive. This assumes that the Government will cover the cost of certain
large infrastructures.

Regarding Bamako, the Government has selected the area around the Bamako SCnou airport. This
zone has all the assets needed for the development of an important hub of economic growth. It has
been the subject of a master development plan that accommodates such an undertaking, and the
reserved real estate i s available. The master development plan will be updated.

The Dialakorobougou zone, previously selected to be Bamako's new industrial zone, will be converted
into real estate held in reserve for future needs. However, the technical and economic studies for
development of the Dialakorobougou zone will be carried out, as will those for the Banankoro zone,
which is also slated to become a future industrial zone.

Inconnection with the development of the economic growth hubat the Bamako SCnouairport, the
following actions are required:

         -    Creationof the industrialzone

Development of the industrial zone will occur in several phases. The first phase will cover about 50
hectares and may be extended, depending on the requirements, to over 200 hectares. The zone will be
entirely equipped with basic utilities. The Government will work closely with the public utility
companies, and particularly with the electric company Electricite' du Mali, (EDM) and the state
telephone company SOTELMA, inorder to ensure that electricity, water, and telecommunications are
available on the site of the industrial zone. It will also ensure that a water purification plant, drainage
infrastructure and an area for proximity services to businesses are built on the site of the industrial
zone. The zone will be place underprivate management within the framework o f the concession.


         -    Improvement of Bamako SCnouAirport

Development of a modem industrial zone at Bamako SCnou i s impossible unless the Bamako airport
(i.e., the international airport and freight area) is improved. Improvement of the international airport is
critical to the quality of the reception given to travelers and to the desired increase intourist numbers.
A modem freight area adapted to the requirements of importation, and especially exportation, of
Malian products i s an important element in the competitiveness of importing and exporting
enterprises. Various facilities are needed to adapt the current freight area not only to economic
demands, but also to current security standards. The equipment of a modem freight area will be
included in the development of the economic growth hub at Bamako SCnou Airport and in the

                                                    112

associated financing requests. The earlier development plan will be updated and financing will be
sought for implementation of the scenario chosen.

The placement o f the airport under concession will be facilitated by the implementation of
modernization investments. The Government's objective i s to place the Bamako airport, which is an
essential component in the future economic growth hub in Bamako, under private operation in the
form of a concession. For the other regional airports, the Government will explore appropriate
management and financing options.

V.3.2. Specific infrastructures

Global infrastructures like the industrial zones must be supplemented with the development of sector-
specific infrastructures in order to ensure better growth and accommodate the particularities and
specificities of the various sectors.

       - Handicrafts and tourism sectors

Implementation of a program of construction of modern, environmentally-friendly artisans' villages
will make it possible to showcase handicrafts. These villages are models for the development and
implantation of certain artisanal activities. Inthis connection, the following are planned:

    1.     construction of an artisans' village in Bamako for the purpose o f improvingthe accessibility
           of the artisans' center [MuisondesArtisans] and promoting handicrafts inthe capital;
   2.      construction o f five (5) artisans' villages in the cities of Kayes, Sikasso, SCgou, Mopti and
           Gao for the purpose of dispersing artisanal activities and promoting handicrafts in those
           regions, thereby preserving their technological and cultural uniqueness.

Access to energy, safe water and telecommunications services in tourist areas is an important
component in the development of tourism, as is the availability of access roads in good condition.
Interventions that contribute to this goal are to be encouraged.

Inthe areaoftourism, efforts will be made to showcasetraditional architecture andto preserve aspects
of cultural heritage of touristic interest (in close collaboration with the Ministry of Culture where
certain sites are concerned) through:

     1. restoration of certain cultural monuments andtraditional housing styles inDjennC, Mopti, and
         the Dogon country in the interest of enhancing their touristic appeal, taking into account their
         specificities (i.e., whether historic monuments, registered "world heritage" sites, etc.);
    2. development andimplementation of a sanitation program for the Dogon country;
    3. construction of eco-tourism facilities in the Gourma nature reserve, in certain sites protected
         under the Ramsar Convention, and around crocodile ponds in the communities of Borko,
         Dounapinand Amani);
    4. the study and construction of community-managed village encampments incertain sites;
    5. development of palm groves along the road linkmgDouentza, Tombouctou and Arouane.




                                                    113

        -   Telecommunicationssector

The declaration of telecommunications sector policy emphasizes the importance of accelerating access
to the country and of promoting access to telecommunications services inrural areas, in support of the
decentralization policy as well as in the interest of economic and social development. In this
connection, it has been agreed that universal access to telecommunications services will be broadened
to include access to ICTs. A Universal Access Fundhas been created. The strategy for development
of universal access may have an important impact on private sector promotion in the area of
telecommunications, as well as a role in the creation of value added and in innovation in rural areas,
thanks to the opportunities affordedby ICTs.

The Government wishes to accelerate access to ICTs in rural areas and thereby fuel a new economic
dynamic. The strategy for ICT access will be defined, as will the mechanisms for managing and
operating the fund. The Government will contribute to the construction of the pilot ICT connection
phase for 10ruralcommunities.

        -   Postal sector

Regarding the postal service, the Government plans to develop universal mail delivery through a
strategy of decentralization aimed at installing and popularizing commercial mailboxes in all
neighborhoods of the capital and inevery township inMali, as well as through a system o f zip coding
and addressing in Bamako and the major cities. The use o f new information and communication
technologies will enable the postal service to create a national electronic money transfer system
integrated with other international electronic systems, and to become a vehicle for the development of
universal ICT access inrural areas.

        -   Mining sector

Inorder to support and encourage the development of small-scale mines, the Government plansto set
uppilot demonstration units for gold and gemproduction. These units are expected to have a positive
demonstration effect on the sector, improving artisanal mines by encouraging the introduction of
mechanized and adapted equipment (preferably o f local manufacture.)


17.4.PROMOTION ANDDEVELOPMENT OF SERVICES TOSMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES


Business development, and especially that of small andmedium enterprises, i s a prerequisite for job
creation and income generation. It is one of the most effective ways to combat poverty. Ifthey are to
do this, businessesrequirebothfinancial andnon-financial services at every step of their
developmental path.

With regard to financial services to business, the Government has pledged, subsequent to the annual
meetings between the President of the Republic and all components of the private sector, to study the
feasibility of the following entities and to create them if possible:

        -   a Financial Guarantee Fundfor the Private Sector; and
        -   a National Investment Fund.


                                                  114

Inorder to ensure access to bankfinancing, particularly for SMEs, it hasbecome necessary to develop
new financial instruments and products that can mobilize medium- and long-term resources for
investment financing.

Thus, the Governmentintends to support the following instruments:

-   partial credit risk coverage facility to guarantee the repayment of long funds mobilized by
    commercial banks on capital markets through the issuance of bonds;
-   foreign trade promotionfacility, through the confirmation of letters of credit in favor o f SMEs;
-   liquidity facility to mitigate the problem of incompatibility between the short-term resources
    available from banks and the long-term investment requirements of SMEs.

These instruments should facilitate access to bank credit and encourage investment.

The low level of development of non-financial services is an obstacle to business development and
sustainability. It prevents SMEs/SMIs from taking advantage of growth opportunities. This situation
i s partially due to the low level of demand on the part of the heads of enterprises, but it is also
attributable to the inadequate quantity and quality of the services offered.

The Government wishes to take steps to remove the obstacles inhibitingboth the demand for support
services and the development of a supply of high-quality services. SMEs/SMIs in certain high-
potential production streams and key growth sectors will be helped to improve their competitiveness;
the creation of support/advisory companies and suppliers will be encouraged; and their capacities and
organization will be enhancedthrough a program of accreditation of advisory services andlicensing of
consultants. For this purpose, the Government envisages the creation of a Fundfor Business Advisory
Services, inorder to facilitate access to non-financial services for enterprises.

The actions envisaged for the development o f non-financial services are:

     -       the creation of the Fundfor Business Advisory Services;
     -       strengthening of the capacities of suppliers of business development services;
     -       identification and monitoring of SMEs/SMIs,           particularly in the case o f micro-
             entrepreneurs, and assistance informulating the request for service;
-            creation of an "electronic tool box for businesses'' comprised of tools for access to useful
             information, management assistance tools, administrative and tax forms, periodic
             declarations to the administrative services, and tools for electronic communication between
             businesses andthe Administration;
     -       promotion of innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit;
             strengthening of value chains in order to enhance the competitiveness of enterprises and
             their products.

 v.5.cOMMUNICATIONANDINFORMATION CAMPAIGNONTHESTAKESANDBENEFITS OF THEPRIVATE
SECTOR DEVELOPMENTPOLICY

The success of areform depends on the extent to which all actors and the general population buy into
the reform process.The stakes and benefits o f private sector development are relevant to all segments
of the Malian population. The role and advantages of a dynamic and effective private sector are not yet
well understood by all, however.


                                                  115

The Government intends to undertake periodic communication interventions throughout the duration
of the private sector development program, and to institute regularly-scheduled "annual enterprise
workshops", which will be forums for gathering information, meeting other stakeholders (private
sector, Administration, general population, parliamentarians, local collectivities, development
partners, banks and financial institutions, etc.) and exchange ideas with them.

Through these actions, the Government intends to inspire enthusiasm for, and acceptance of, its
policies and to promote sharing of the new opportunities and benefits expected from private sector
development.

                                       PROGRAMFINANCING

Implementation of this private sector development policy essentially based on support for the motors
of growth requires substantial financing. The Government's financing strategies rely upon:

    o acontributionfrom the State budget;
    o better utilizationof available sectoral resources;
    o arequest for IDANorldBankfinancing;
    o mobilization of funds of local, regional andinternational development banks;
    o collaboration of all national partners (both public and private) and international partners in
       order to mobilizedadditional funds for support to the motors of growth.

The Government intends to negotiate with the World Bank a project essentially devoted to
implementation of the program. Other development partners, and particularly the private sector, will
be calledupon to operate anddevelop infrastructures created under the project.

                      VII. PROGRAMMONITORINGANDEVALUATION

Program implementation will mobilize several ministerial departments, the private sector and the
development partners. It i s essential that the momentum created be maintained and that progress be
monitored by the following means:

    o establishment of a unique monitoring/evaluation system with indicators corresponding to those
       used inthe PRSP;
    o periodic national evaluation with private sector participation;
    o development of oversight and assessment mechanisms usingappropriate instruments;
    o continuous sharingof information.

Analysis of results will require the development of monitoring/evaluation criteria and progress
indicators based on a data set ranging from the macro-economic level to local databases. This
foundation, which i s crucial to the monitoring of activities and their development, will be strengthened
and made available to users and operators involved inthese matters.

Based on this wide view, indicators can then be designed to monitor trends over time, prepare
appropriate performance charts, and guidance, management, and decision-making tools.




                                                   116

                    VIII. PROGRAMGUIDANCEANDIMPLEMENTATION

The success of the program assumes the establishment of effective guidance and management
structures within the Administration and a constant flow of information to the private sector.

Inorder to ensure program monitoring and guidance, the Administration will put inplace: a steering
committee at the ministerial level, a mechanism for operational monitoring at the level of the General
Secretaries of the relevant ministerial departments, and a program management unit. Focal points
responsible for sectoral program monitoring and implementation will be put in place in the relevant
ministeria1departments.

The program will be the subject of a communiquk issued to the development partners and at the
Private/private sector meetings (Presidential Investors' Council and annual meetings with the
President of the Republic).

Program results and impacts will be the subject of public announcements and visits during the annual
enterprise workshops.

Lc Maliest unpayscontinentalA populationTclativemtntjeune (4890% de moinsde 15 ans) et ciont
I'icnnomie reposc cssentiellement sur le secteur agricolc. Tx Mali beneiicie depuis plus d'unc
dizaine d'mntes d'unt grandc stabilitd politique el d'un climat social sercin.

I,c Gouvernemtnt de la R4publiquc du Mali a uptt pour I'ddification d'unc dconomie natiunale
bm'e sur la librc cntreprise. 11 s'agit d`une option fondamcntale qui se veut idversible, En effet,
depuis 1982, il a entrepris le ddsengagemcnt de 1'Etat des secteurs productifs pour le limiter A ses
missionsessentiellesde souvcraincte, de dgdation et de prolediondes biens et des persruonnes.

La promotion d'un secteur priv6 dynamiquc et compettitif constitue donc un dffi essentiel. Pour
cela, la mise en place d'une politique efficace en        VUG  de ~pundreA cette mission devient
incontournable.

Mal@ Ics efforts &disks pour amdliorer la situation macro-Cconomique et renforcer le cadre
institutiannel, rdglementairc et juridique, ICsecteur privt malisn reste toujours confronti a des
difficultds d`ordre rtruclurel, financier et arganisationnel qui le tcndcnt moins efficace. D'autre
part, le volume des investisscments pnv& au Mali, indispensablea la croissance tconomiquc ct au
developpemcntdusecleurpriv6, demeure faible.

Le Cadre Srratkgique.dc Lutte cnntm ta Pauvretk (CSLP), opdrationnel depuis 2002, constitue le
c.adre utiquc de niference des actions du Gouvemement wmme ICconfirme d'ailleurs la Lettre de
Cadragedu Pkddentde la Republiqueau Gouvernementendate du 23 wtobre 2002.

Par sa cohdrence et sa pertinence, le CSLP a retenu le Secteur prive c o m e pivot de la croissance
hnomique et du diveloppcmcnt durable,Un des objectifsmiijeursdu CSlY cst la stimnlationdu

accroissementsignifcatif dcs principlesexportations du Mali (or, coton et behit) qui reprksenteni

hors transfcrts officiels courant, est pass4 de 10,8% du PIR en 1999 A 6,3% du PIB en 2002. La
croissancerapide des exportations a permis de retmuver unt balance commcrciale exckdentaire. Un

une crobsance importante enire 1999 ct 2002, le volume des investissements directs kangms
s'oriente ti la baissedepuis 2003.

Ces pcrformances de I'konomie ant entraht unc diminution de la pauvrctC d`cnviron 7,5 points
entre 1996 et 2000. Ccpcndant, il reste encore des mnes d'ombre qui ndcessitent dnormCinent

I,a lutte contre la pauvretC ntcessite un taw de croissancedu PIl3 supdrieur B 5% par an ct ainsi

Le premier axe strattgique de la politiquc dc: ddvcloppement du secteur privd vise h assurer un
cadre cohCrcnt d'impulainn d'une dynamique reelle de dkeloppement du secteur priv6. Cclui-ci

    investissementsau Mali.

2. Moderniser lecadre et le cllmat desInvmtissements

Le deuxitmc w e strategique de la politique de ddveloppement du secteur privti consiste i
moderniser le c h a t des inveslissementsainsi quc les cadresjuridique et rdglementaire, relatifs au
scctcur privb. Cette modemisationconccme aussi bien le climai gCnCral des investissementsquc les
politiquesscctnrielks des different5 departements ministerielsrelatives au sectcur privk.

La modernisationdu dimat des inveslisments suppose une politique active d'identificationct de
promotion des investissements ainsi que des processus pcrformants de cdation d'cntreprise. Pour
ce Eairc, il est ngcessaire de restructurer et renforcer Its institutionset stmcturts de promotion des
invcstissementset de services a la ckation et au dtveloppemcntdes enrreprjses.

Une participation active des difkcnts acteurs et particulihtmcnt du secteur priv6.est un dltmenl
essentiel de la rhssitr: de la nouvelle politiquc.

Le troisikme m e stratbgiquc de la pditique de devcloppement du swteur privC visc ii pallier
I'insuffisance dcs infrastructures physiquescompktitiveset attractivespour Lcs investisseurs.

Compte tenu du rctard accumuk et de l'ampleur des moyens nkessaires?le Gouvernement a opt6
pour d'une part la rdalisation de plate-forme minimale d`infrastructure physiquc et logistique
rendant les apportunit6s hnomiques plus Cvidentes pour le sectcur ~ T ~ v Cet, d'auue part, pour
I'wcdl6ration dc la modemisation des autres inhastructures indispensables B la perlbnnance des
infrastructures minimales (&port,        routes de desserte dcs zones industrielles, infrastructures
d'knergie et de t6ldcommunications, etc.). Le5 nouvelles plate-formes mcdernes seront
respectueuses dc I'environnement et disposeront de sewice.s dc base performants et competitifs
( e q Clectricit6, TIC, etc.). Elles seront plactcs sous gestion privhe, 1'Etat assurant le r81e de

4. Promouvairet appuyer Le dhdoppcment des entrepfisea

Le quatritme axc stratdgiquede la politique de dCveloppemmt du srscteur privdvise iiacmmpagncr
et appuyer le ddveloppent des entreprises.

 La disponibilite, en qiunlhi et en qualit&,d'un march6 des services financicrs et non financiers a
destination des entreprises, ct plus parliculierementpour les bcsoins des PMEmMIest un iltment
 important pour l'amelioralionde la compaitivite dc leursproduits. Une attention particuliere scta
p o d c aux PME/PMl de ccrtains secteurs cibles iifort potcntiei de craissance ucxtile, Viande,
 Cuir, Arkanat, Tourisme, Mines, T6lkummunications et Poste, etc.). La cnmpttitivite des

 Lx: tiouvemement a engaggd dtpuis quelques annkes un programme de dgvcloppement du secteur
 financier (PDSP) dont l'ubjcctif est de viabiliser le secteur et le rendrc plus performant et
 compktitif, La vulgarisation de !a micro-finance au Mali vise A +pondre en partie aux dif'ficutbb
d`accEs de5 promoteurs des PME au crPdit bancaire classique. Un prngrammc national de
