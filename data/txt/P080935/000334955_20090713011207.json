'to improve the investment climate,\n            with a focus on reducing the cost of doing business and on\n            fostering growth contribution from high potential sectors,\n            including mining, tourism and crafts, and\n            telecommunications'. The restructuring aims to address\n            the management weaknesses observed in the implementation of\n            the project to date and to recalibrate several project\n            components in light of changed circumstances. The\n            restructuring involves: (i) strengthening overall project\n            management structure; (ii) strengthening project financial\n            management; (iii) streamlining project monitoring and\n            evaluation; (iv) strengthening procurement processes; (v)\n            streamlining investment climate component; (vi) focusing\n            airports of Mali component on the development of a\n            public-private partnership (PPP) for airports of Mali; (vii)\n            streamlining implementation of industrial zone component;\n            (viii) strengthening implementation arrangements for tourism\n            component; (ix) expanding handicraft component; (x)\n            implementing new development of financial services\n            component; (xi) implementing enterprises support services\n            component through multi-donor fund for support services to\n            small and medium enterprises (SMEs); and (xii) streamlining\n            mining component. As a result of the restructuring, the\n            project is expected to achieve its intended development\n            outcome, as revised, to create the conditions for increased\n            private investment through investment climate reforms,\n            improved access to financial services, and the provision of\n            non-financial services to private enterprises."}, "docdt": "2009-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
