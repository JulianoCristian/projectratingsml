                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In July 2010, the progress towards meeting the Project Development Objective is rated moderately satisfactory ­ as it was in Juneof 2010 - due to the insufficient progress towards
                         meeting the project development objectives, which are reflected in the slow disbursement rate.

                         Overall, this project has mixed results. On the one hand, this project has several remarkable achievements (i.e. theprivatization of Sotelma). On the other hand, the Project has not
                         yet been able to effectively complete the reforms in key areas, such as: (a) investment code and (b) industrial zones. This is effectively slowing disbursement, since the
                         implementation of core project investment activities is subject to GoM instating adequate regulatory frameworks.
