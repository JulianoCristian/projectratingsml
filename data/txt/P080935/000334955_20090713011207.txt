                                  RESTRUCTURING
                                         OFTHE
                       MALI-GROWTHSUPPORT PROJECT

                                   PROJECTPAPER


I. INTRODUCTORYSTATEMENT

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to introduce the
following changes in the Mali Growth Support Project (the Project), Credit No. 4033-
MLIandGrant No. H145-MLI (Project IDP080935), andaccompanying amendmentsto
the project's legal documents, in response to the Government o f Mali's request dated
June 12,2009.

2.      The rationale for the proposed restructuring is that project implementation has
lagged due to a combination o f factors, including weaknesses in project management,
delays in developing the legal and regulatory framework required to support certain
infrastructure investments, and changed circumstances onthe ground.

3.      The proposed restructuring aims to address the management weaknesses observed
inthe implementationofthe projectto date andto recalibrate several project components
inlight ofchanged circumstances.

4.      The restructuring involves: (i)strengthening overall project management
structure; (ii)strengthening project financial management; (iii)streamlining project
monitoring and evaluation; (iv) strengthening procurement processes; (v) streamlining
investment climate component; (vi) focusing Airports of Mali component on the
development o f a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) for Airports o f Mali; (vii)
streamlining implementation o f industrial zone component; (viii) strengthening
implementation arrangements for tourism component; (ix) expanding handicraft
component; (x) implementing new development o f financial services component; (xi)
implementing enterprises support services component through multi-donor fund for
support services to SMEs; and (xii) streamlining miningcomponent.

5.      Because these changes involve modifications inthe project development objective
(PDO), performance indicators, project management structure and funding allocation
among components, we are requesting the Board's approval. The Development Financing
Agreement (DFA) dated April 18,2005 as amended on October 20,2005 and on June 25,
2008 will be further amendedaccordingly to reflect these changes.

6.      As a result of the restructuring, the Project is expected to achieve its intended
development outcome, as revised, to create the conditions for increased private
investment through investment climate reforms, improved access to financial services,
and the provision o f non-financial services to private enterprises.

11.     BACKGROUND,RESTRUCTURINGRATIONALE AND STRATEGY

Project background

7.     The Credit and the Grant were approvedby the Board on February 15,2005 inan
amount of SDR 12.6 million (US$19.5 million equivalent) and SDR 23.0 million
(US$35.5 million equivalent) respectively, totaling a financing of SDR 35.6 million
(US$55.0 million equivalent). The Project became effective on September 30,2005.

8.     The InternationalFinanceCorporation (IFC) is contributing to the Project through
the provision of a back-up facility for a Portfolio Partial Credit Guarantee Facility
supportedunder the financial sector development component of the Project.

9.     The Agence Franqaise de De`veluppement (AFD) has committed Euro 1.4 million
(SDR 1.3 million) to co-fund the multi-donor Enterprise Support Services Fund (ESSF)
together with IDA (SDR 1.6 million) (See Component 8, p.8). The European
Commission has indicated that it could inthe htureco-fund the ESSFtogether with AFD
and IDA.

10.    The original Project Development Objective (PDO) was "to improve the
investment climate, with a focus on reducing the cost of doing business and on fostering
growth contribution from high potential sectors, including mining, tourism and crafts, and
telecommunications" (See Development Financing Agreement (DFA), Schedule 2, p.19,
dated April 18, 2005). (The PDO stated in the Project Appraisal document (PAD) was
"the overall project objective i s to stimulate private sector investment and performance
by increasing total factor productivity and targeting sectoral sources of growth. The
project is designed to improve the investment climate, with a focus on reducing the cost
of doing business and fostering growth in sectors including mining, tourism and crafts,
andtelecommunications"; See PAD, SectionB2, p.6, dated January 21,2005).

11.    The Project was originally structured around three components: (i)investment
climate and institutional strengthening (SDR 10.4 million); (ii)  infrastructure support for
growth (SDR 15.9 million); and (iii)    financial and non-financial services for innovation
and development (SDR 5.7 million). The remainder supported the Project Coordination
Unit (PCU) (SDR 1.9 million) and contingencies (SDR 1.7 million). The Project's sub-
components as designed in2005 are listed inTable 1below:

                                             - 3 -

12.     Operationally, the Government has distinguished nine components implemented
by line ministries. These are (i)  investment climate; (ii) Airports o f Mali; (iii)industrial
zone; (iv) telecommunications; (v) tourism; (vi) handicraft; (vii) development o f financial
services; (viii) enterprise support services; and (ix) mining. Inthe context o f the proposed
restructuring, this functional classification has been formalized (See Annex 6). The
Project remains complex interms o f scope, reflecting Government's strong commitment
to advance in each of these nine components with IDA support. However, the Project i s
greatly simplified in terms of management by aligning each component with the
appropriate line ministry, and by simplifying several components as indicated below.
Within each line ministry, a high-level civil servant serves as focal point to support the
implementation o f the corresponding component(s).

13.     The implementation o f Project activities is coordinated by a Project Coordination
Unit (PCU) under the Ministry of Industry, Investments and Commerce (MIIC).                A
Project Steering Committee (PSC) provides overall guidance and monitoring o f Project
implementation.

Implementationprogress

14.     The Project is currently rated moderately unsatisfactory (MU). Overall progress
inachieving the original PDO couldnot beassessedbecausethe related impact indicators
could not be measured reliably and attribution was problematic. The implementation o f
specific Project sub-components has been uneven, with some key output indicators not
yet attained.

                                             - 4 -


15.     Nevertheless, some o f the original sub-components, such as telecommunications,
non-financial and financial support to SMEs, have beenimplemented satisfactorily. Inthe
telecommunications sector, the new Telecommunications Regulatory Authority has been
established and the privatization of SOTELMA, the parastatal telecommunications
company, is being finalized. In the area o f non-financial support to SMEs, the STEP
program has provided technical assistance services to 720 micro-enterprises, and the
institutionalframework for the multi-donor ESSF has beenapproved by the Government.
However, the ESSSF and Association are not legally established yet and needto be made
operational.    In the area of financial support to SMEs, the privatization of the
International Bank o f Mali has been successfully completed, and the Portfolio Partial
Credit Guarantee Facility and associated technical assistance have been launched with
two private banks.

16.     The investment climate improvement and mining sub-components started slowly
but have picked up speed recently. Inthe area of investment climate improvement, the
Investment Promotion Agency of Mali and the One-Stop Shop (Guichet Unique) for
investors have been recently established. In the area o f mining the Government has
recently elaborated a well-structured strategy for the development o f the sector focusing
on diversification, research, development of small mines, and transparency in financial
flows inthe sector.

17.     The industrial zone infrastructure sub-component has been delayed due to lack of
progress indeveloping the legal and regulatory framework for industrial zones.

18.     In the tourism sub-component, the rehabilitation of historic sites and the
enhancement o f touristic trails under the Project have not been carried out due to a focus
on promotional activities.

19.     Finally, the rehabilitation o f the existing passenger terminal at Bamako-Senou
airport under the Project is no longer needed because a new passenger terminal i s being
built instead with funding from the MillenniumChallenge Corporation (MCC).

20.     Project implementation has beenhampered by several factors:

                The Project Steering Committee (PSC) has met at infrequent intervals and
                has failed to exercise effective management o f this complex project. Until
                recently, the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was led by transient acting
                project coordinators, resulting in weak leadership and suboptimal use of
                PCUresources.

                The Project monitoring and evaluation system is overly complex and its
                implementation i s problematic. The PDO cannot be measured. Among the
                31performance indicators, 13 have not been updated or have beenupdated
                only intermittently, and 10 do not have a reference value.

                                             - 5 -


        e       Project financial management has been hampered by the fact that
                counterpart funds are managed by MIIC and were not allocated to the
                Project Special Account managed by the PCU. Although the DFA
                amendment processed on October 6, 2005, removed the Borrower's
                obligation to provide counterpart funding to the Project, over the 2006-
                2008 period, the Government provided counterpart funds to the Project
                through the MIIC in a cumulative amount o f SDR 1.4 million. In March
                2009, the Mid-TermReview o f the Project carried out an in-depthanalysis
                of the use o f counterpart funds over the 2006-2008 period. The review
                found that a number o f counterpart-funded expenditures were outside o f
                the Project's scope and were therefore ineligible. In total, ineligible
                expenditures amounted to 27 percent of counterpart-funded expenditures
                in 2006, 29 percent in 2007, and 12 percent in 2008, adding up to SDR
                292,000 worth o f ineligible expenditures over the three-year period,
                meaning that these expenditures were for goods and services that were not
                within the general scope of the Project, but had been included as
                counterpart funding to the Project.

        e       Procurement capacity remains weak, in particular in the line ministries,
                resulting in difficulties in the implementation of procurement processes
                and procedures.

Restructuringstrategy

21.     The Mali Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework (GPRSF), adopted
by the Government in 2006, is structured around the objectives of achieving rapid
private-sector-led growth and stronger public sector performance. The Government
considers that the Project is critical to achieve the first objective o f the GPRSF. In
particular, the Project contributes to remove key impediments to private-sector-led
growth, including through improving key infrastructures (telecommunications, airport,
industrial zone) and improving the overall investment climate, by (i)strengthening
sector-specific legal and regulatory framework in mining, tourism, handicrafts, and
telecommunications; (ii)   strengthening investment promotion; and (iii)  developing non-
financial and financial services to small andmedium enterprises (SMEs).

22.     Given the critical importance o f the Project to help achieve the objectives o f the
GPRSF, the Government and the Bank have jointly undertaken a thorough assessment of
the causes underlying the slow implementation o f the Project over the past years. The
Mid-Term Review o f the Project conducted in March 2009 concluded that Project
implementation suffered from a combination o f weaknesses in Project management,
delays in implementing the legal, regulatory and institutional reforms required to
undertake key infrastructure investments, and changes in circumstances on the ground,
requiringarestructuringofthe Project.

                                             - 6 -


23.      Inlight of this assessment, the Government and the Bank agreed to implement a
restructuring strategy built on two fundamental pillars: (i)strengthening o f Project
management; and (ii)    reorientationo f specific Project components.

24.      The first pillar of the restructuring strategy encompasses all major Project
management dimensions, including overall management and coordination, monitoring
and evaluation, financial management, and procurement (See Section VI for a detailed
description of the measures taken by the Government to improve Project management).
The secondpillar of the strategy comprises: (i)    refocusing o f certain components to core
activities (investment climate, tourism, mining); (ii)    streamlining o f implementation of
one component (industrial zone); (iii)expansion o f one component (handicrafts); (iv)
implementation o f a new component (development o f financial services); (v) cancellation
of one sub-component funded by another donor (rehabilitation o f existing passenger
terminal at Bamako-Senou airport);          and (vi) continuation of two components
(telecommunications and enterprises support services through a new fbnding mechanism)
(See Section I11for a detailed description o f changes inProject components and resource
allocation).

R i s k s

25.      Indesigning this restructuring strategy, the Government and the Bank identified
five main risk factors. The first risk is policy risk. This arises mainly from possible
resistance to private sector participation in the management of the airport, and from
possible resistance of AZI-Mali to abandon its monopoly as sole developer o f industrial
zones. The second risk i s management risk. This arises from possible continued
weaknesses in key project management functions, in particular in the coordination
between MIIC and the Project CoordinationUnit (PCU), and inthe coordination between
MIIC and the line ministries. The third risk i s performance control risk, mainly continued
weakness in Project monitoring and evaluation. The fourth risk i s fiduciary risk, mainly
continued deficiencies inthe management o f counterpart expenditures and weaknesses in
procurement processes in line ministries. The fifth risk is implementation risk, mainly
continued dispersion o f efforts by line ministries among an overly large number o f
activities within each sub-component, and possible delays in the implementation o f the
Business Development Services (BDS) component resulting from the establishment o f
the ESSF andAssociation. A detailed descriptionofthe mitigationmeasures taken by the
Government and IDAto address these risks is presented in Section VI below.

111.     PROPOSEDCHANGES

         Change in Project Development Objective (PDO) and Performance
         Indicators

26.      The results framework has beenchanged with three objectives inmind:

         e      Focus on performance indicators that are directly observable and
                attributable;

                                           - 7 -



       e        Reduce the number o f performance indicators; and

       e        Ensureownership ofperformance indicators by line ministries.

27.    The revised PDO is to "create the conditions for increased private investment
through investment climate reforms, improved financial services and the provision of
non-financial services to private enterprises".    The outcome indicators supporting the
PDO are: (i) days taken to approve a new investmentare reduced from 45 to 15 days; (ii)
bank credit to SMEs increases to 30% of total loans and advances; and (iii) jobs are
                                                                              500
created through firms supported by the ESSF.

28.    The revised PDO has been formulated with the objective to link the development
outcome o f the Project to its contribution to the Mali GPRSF. The outcome indicators
have been selected (i)   because they constitute the most meaningful and attributable
measureso f overall project success; and (ii)becausethey are directly measurable.

29.    The project performance indicators have been cut from 31 to 14 by taking out
indicators that cannot be readily measured or attributed.

30.    The revised PDO and Outcome Indicators are presented in Annexl, and the
revisedArrangements for Results MonitoringinAnnex 2.

       ChangeinResultsFramework

31.    The newProject Results Framework is presented inAnnex 3.

       Change inProjectComponentsand ResourcesAllocation

32.    Changeshave beenmade inProject components as followed.

33.    Component 1 InvestmentClimate. The investmentclimate sub-component has
                       -
been streamlined to focus on priority activities including (i)strengthening the legal and
regulatory framework for private investments through the preparation o f an investment
code, in line with best international practice; (ii)supporting the establishment and
strengthening of capacity of the Investment Promotion Agency o f Mali (API - Mali),
including the implementation and management o f the One-Stop-Shop for investors
(Guichet Unique); (iii) supporting the coordinating activities o f the Presidential Council
of Investments(CPI); and (iv) supporting the establishment and implementation o f the
Business and Commercial Credit Registry.

34.     Component 2 - Airports of Mali. During Project implementation, the
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) provided a grant of US$ 90 million to the
Government o f Mali to expand and rehabilitate runways and taxiways and to build a new
passenger terminal at Bamako-Senou airport.        As a result, the rehabilitation of the
existing passenger terminal is no longer needed and has been dropped from the Project.

                                            - 8 -


The component will therefore focus entirely on supporting the development and
implementation of a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) for Airports o f Mali. The
preparation and implementation o f a PPP for Airports o f Mali i s a condition for the
funding of infrastructure investments at Bamako-Senou airport by MCC.

35.      Component 3 - Industrial Zone. The implementation o f this component has
been streamlined to focus on two activities: (i)preparing the legal and regulatory
framework for the establishment and development o f industrial zones; and (ii)    supporting
infrastructureinvestmentsfor the establishment o f the industrial zone o f Bamako-Senou.

36.      Component 4 - Telecommunications.The telecommunications component will
support the continuation of already planned activities: (i)improving the legal and
regulatory framework for the telecommunications             sector;   (ii)developing the
telecommunications sector through (a) provision o f support for the privatizationand post-
privatization o f SOTELMA; (b) provision o f frequency spectrum management and
control equipment, computer equipment             and software;     (c)  strengthening the
Telecommunication Regulatory Authority (CRT)'s operational and regulatory capacities;
(d) carrying out training and dissemination activities; and (iii) supporting the expansion
o f the telecommunications network inrural areas.

37.      Component 5 -Tourism. The implementation ofthe tourism component will be
strengthened through the provision o f assistance by the World Tourism Organization to
the Office o f Tourism of Mali (OMATHO) inorder to support the implementation o f the
tourism development strategy of Mali. The component will support the continuation of
already planned activities: (i) supporting the implementation o f priority activities under
the Government's Tourism Development Strategy for Mali, including promotion o f
tourism activities and development o f statistics and impact studies related to tourism; and
(ii) supporting the rehabilitation of cultural monuments and investmentsin campgrounds
and touristic trails.

38.      Component 6 - Handicraft. The handicraft component will support the
continuation o f already planned activities: (i)rehabilitating the weaving workshop
(Tissutheque)facilities; (ii)promoting handicraft export activities through the preparation
o f legal and regulatory framework for handicraft marketing activities; (iii)   provision o f
technical assistance for the establishment o f Groupe d'Interet Economique (GIE) to
market large-scale handicraft production; and (iv) carrying out promotion activities o f the
CentreNational de Promotion de 1'Artisanat.

39.      Component 7 - Development of Financial Services. This component will
support: (i)  provision o f technical assistance for the privatization o f the BIM and the
restructuring o f BHM; (ii)  supporting the development o f electronic payment system, in
particular through the development of mobile banking; (iii)  strengthening the supervision
mechanisms of micro-finance institutions; (iv) provision o f technical assistance for the
preparation o f legal and regulatory framework for the establishment o f an asset
management corporation for the recovery o f bank loans; (v) strengthening the capacities
of commercial banks to provide medium and long-term financing for small and medium

enterprises through: (i) provision by the Government of first-loss credit coverage on
                                   the
portfolios o f small and medium enterprise andor microfinance institution loans
originated and held by participating banks through Risk Sharing Facilities to be
established by the International Finance Corporation and such participating banks,
pursuant to which the International Finance Corporation, as facility agent acting on

risk coverage on apari passu basis with each participatingbank; and (ii) provisionof the
technical advisory services and training to participating banks in relation to small and
mediumenterprises and/or microfinance institutionlending.

40.        Component8 Enterprises Support Services. This component will support the
                                 -
continuation of already planned activities: (i)supporting the establishment o f the
Enterprise Support Services Fund (ESSF) to strengthen business development services
(BDS) through the provision of ESSF/BDS grants and technical assistance, including
training, advisory services, and business advisory services to: (a) small and medium
enterprises with a particular focus on sectors with high potential for growth such as
tourism, craft, leather and textile products, mining and telecom in order to improve their
competitiveness; (b) business development service providersto improve their services to
small and medium enterprises, including (i)support for the preparation and
implementation o f an accreditation program for consultants; and (ii)carrying out
activities designed to improve the targeting o f business development services to micro-
enterprises.

41.        Component9 -Mining. This component has been streamlined and will focus on
four key activities: (i)         carrying out studies on the diversification o f non-gold mining; (ii)
provisiono f technical assistance inthe area o f miningresearch; (iii)           developing small and
medium-scale mining activities; and (iv) supporting the improvement in transparency o f

42.     As a result of the redesign o f the Project, the cost table was revised as follows
(See Table 2 above): (i)   a reduction o f SDR 3.2 million in the airport component as a
result o f the cancellation o f the renovation o f the passenger terminal at Bamako-Senou
airport; (ii)a reduction o f SDR 2.5 million as a result o f the streamlining o f the
investment in the industrial zone; (iii) increase o f SDR 2.9 million to support new
                                          an
activities under the financial sector development component; (iv) an increase of SDR 1.O
millionto support the expansion of the handicraft component; and (v) an increase of SDR
800 thousand to support the implementation o f the Commerce and Credit Registry under
the investment climate improvementcomponent.

43.     In addition, as part of the fiduciary risk mitigation strategy discussed later in
Chapter IV asking the Government to eliminate ineligible expenditures o f counterpart
funds in the Project accounts and to stop providing counterpart funds to the Project
starting June 10, 2009, the total cost o f the Project has been reduced by about SDR 5.4
million. This has been absorbed entirely by an equivalent reduction in unallocated
expenditures.The reallocation of Project costs among individual components is shown in
Table 1.

44.     The proposed reallocation of IDA Credit 4033 MLI is shown in Annex 4. The
proposed reallocation o f IDA Grant H 145 i s shown in Annex 5. The proposed
reallocations are economically viable. The detailed budget projections by component and
by financial category are presented inAnnex 6.

45.     The closing date for the Project will be changed from September 30, 2011 to
September 30, 2012 to provide enough time to complete the Project development
objectives and activities.

IV.     ANALYSIS

46.     Project appraisal. The proposed changes do not alter the original economic,
financial, technical, institutional or social aspects o f the project as appraised, with the
exception o f the establishment of the Enterprise Support Services Fund (ESSF) to
channel grant technical assistance to SMEs. Successful completion o f the appraisal o f the
ESSFwill be a condition for disbursementofthis Project component.

47.     Environmentaland social safeguards. The Project i s classified as Category B.The
proposed changes do not require any changes inenvironmental and social safeguards.

48.     Exceptions to Bank policies. The proposed changes do not require exceptions to
Bank policies. The proposed restructuring therefore does not require a new-appraisal o f
the entire Projectto ensure that it meets World Bank policies, but only a partial appraisal
o fthe BDSESSF component.

49.     The implementation arrangements have been simplified and the arrangements are
satisfactory.

V.      EXPECTEDOUTCOMES

50.    As mentioned above, the PDO has been reformulated so that it expresses the
contribution o f the project to the Mali GPRSF. The related outcome indicators have been
redefined so that they are directly observable and attributable.

51.    M&Eunder the Project is expected to be considerably strengthened as a result of
three key actions: .(i) reduction in the number o f performance indicators; (ii)
                         sharp
ensuringthat each KPI is more easily measurable; and (iii)    designation of high-levelcivil
servants responsible for the follow-up and regular updating o f these indicators in the
relevant line ministries.

VI.    BENEFITSAND RISKS

52.    Benefits. The proposed restructuring would not alter the types o f benefits (direct
and indirect) anticipated inthe originalproject document.

53.    Risks and mitigating measures. The main risks to the success of the restructured
project are policy, governance and implementation risks.

54.    To mitigate the policy risk, the Government will integrate critical decisions
pertaining to private sector participation inthe management of Airports o f Mali and to the
effective removal o f the monopoly o f AZI-Mali over the development o f industrial zones
inits PovertyReductionPolicy Framework. These keypolicy decisions will be supported
inthe framework offuture Poverty ReductionSupport Credits (PRSCs).

55.    To mitigate the governance risk, the Government has decided to undertake a
profoundreorganization of Project management.

56.    First, the Government is taking decisive steps to strengthen overall Project
management:

       e        Ithas appointed apermanent Project Coordinator, who is a high-levelcivil
                servant formally attached to the PCU on a full-time basis;

       e        It is updating the Project ImplementationPlan to reflect the restructuring
                o f the Project, in particular a new Project Implementation Framework
                betweenMIIC and the PCU;

       e       It is establishing Technical Implementation Agreements for each project
                component between the MIIC (through the PCU) and concerned line
               ministries.

57.    Second, the Government is taking practical steps to strengthen project monitoring
and evaluation:

                                          - 12-


       a       It has established a streamlined Results Framework for the project based
               on a reduced set o f readily observable and attributable performance
               indicators;

       a       It has designated the focal points within each line ministry as the persons
               responsible for following up o f the performance indicators for each project
               component.

58.    Third, the Government is taking decisive steps to strengthen project financial
management:

       a       Itwill agree with IDA to update the existing 18-months procurement plan
               for each project component, to reflect the procurement operations under
               the project during that period; the agreed procurement plans will be
               updated each 6 months; in addition, the Government will implement the
               recommended action plan to strengthen procurement capacity in the
              project executing agencies;

       a       IDA requested the Government to eliminate expenditures against
               counterpart funds that are considered ineligible by IDA from the Project
               accounts and to stop providing counterpart funds to the project starting
               June 10, 2009 inline with the DFA as amended in October 20, 2005. The
               Government agreed with IDA'Srequest, and indicated that it will include
               inits national budget the additional operating costs such as the salaries of
              the Project Coordinator and support staff, social contributions and other
              taxes related to the staff. Although these expenses are not included in the
              resources o f the Project and delays in their mobilization may hamper the
              implementation of the Project, this risk is considered minimal in light of
              the Government's strong commitment to the successful implementation of
              the Project. The Project ImplementationPlanwill reflectthese changes;

       a      IDA has alerted in a letter dated June 22, 2009, the Government to the
              potential fiduciary risk linked with the ineligible expenditures against
              counterpart funds, and has invited the Government to carry out a
              procurement review o f these ineligible expenditures.

       a      It will update the Project Commitment and Disbursement Table (PCDT)
              by project component, financial category and funding source (IDA credit,
              IDA grant and counterpart funds) on a monthly basis and communicate to
              the PCDT to IDA. The Project Implementation Plan will reflect these
              changes.

59.    Fourth, the Government fully supports the Independent Procurement Review
(IPR) that will be conducted by an independent auditor in the summer o f 2009 and is
ready to implement its recommendations.

                                              - 1 3 -


60.      To mitigate the implementation risk, the Government has decided to focus each
component on priority activities on which the PCU and the line ministries will
concentrate their efforts. This i s the case inparticular o f the preparation o f the Investment
Code, the implementation o f the PPP for Airports o f Mali, the development and adoption
o f the legal and regulatory framework for industrial zones, the development and adoption
o f the legal and regulatory framework for telecoms, key investments to support the
development o f tourism and handicrafts, the implementation o f the BDSESSF, the
continued implementation o f portfolio partial credit guarantees for SMEs, and the
development and adoption o f the legal and regulatory framework for mining.

61,      All the changes resulting from the restructuring will be integrated inthe Project
Implementation Manual. Agreement between the Government and IDA on the revised
Project Implementation Manual and the updated procurement plan will be conditions o f
effectiveness o f the restructured Project.

62.      The establishment of the ESSF, ESSF subsidiary agreement and ESSFBDS
manual will constitute disbursement conditions of ESSF/BDS grants.
