The\n            project objectives were to: (a) assist the country and PBDAC\n            to modernize and expand the agricultural storage\n            infrastructure; (b) improve the handling of agricultural\n            inputs, grains, and animal feed through appropriate\n            mechanization and the training of storage personnel in order\n            to: (i) reduce physical losses; (ii) minimize quality\n            deterioration of the products handled; (iii) improve\n            efficiency in the transportation of fertilizers and animal\n            feeds; and (iv) reduce product handling and storage costs;\n            and (c) assist the country to plan appropriate\n            infrastructure for the bulk storage and distribution of\n            imported feed grains at selected port and inland locations.\n            Overall, the outcome of the project, in terms of its\n            development objectives, has been unsatisfactory, following\n            input trade liberalization in Egypt. The experience under\n            this project shows that: (a) The main lesson learned is the\n            high risk of failure associated with financing facilities\n            owned and operated by public sector institutions; (b)\n            Financing of agricultural storage, processing, and similar\n            infrastructure in the public sector should be undertaken\n            only where there is market failure; and (c) Project\n            restructuring should have been more far-reaching, and should\n            have included all activities for which commitments have not\n            been made."}, "docdt": "1996-05-28T14:17:05Z"}
