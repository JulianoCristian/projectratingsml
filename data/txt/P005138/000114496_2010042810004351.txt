                       Re:  Loan 3071-EGT (Agricultural Storage
                            Project) Amendment
Dear Sir:
     We refer to the request dated May 28, 1990, and subsequent
discussions with the Chairman of the Principal Bank for Development
and Agricultural Credit, to increase the authorized allocation for
the Special Account. Taking into account the needs of the project,
we are pleased to inform you that we agree to increase the existing
allocation of $3 million to $5 million. Therefore, we propose to
amend paragraph l(c) of Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement to read as
follows:
     " (c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount
     equivalent to $5,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account
     and deposited into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph
     3(a) of this Schedule. "
     Please indicate your agreement to the foregoing by signing and
dating the form of confirmation on the attached copy of this letter
and returning it to us.
                                   Very truly yours,
                                   INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
