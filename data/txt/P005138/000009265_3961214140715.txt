﻿IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
AGRICULTURAL STORAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 3071 - EGT)
PREFACE
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report of the Agricultural Storage Project in
Egypt, for which Loan 3071-EGT in the amount of US$40 million was approved on May 25,
1989 and became effective on April 30, 1991. Project effectiveness was delayed because of
administrative and parliamentary ratification procedures. The project was implemented by the
Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit (PBDAC).
2.    The Government's economic reform and structural adjustment program and agricultural
inputs trade liberalization policies had a major impact on project objectives, scope, and
sustainability. Consequently, the project was restructured and downsized in October 1993, when
the loan was reduced to US$18.5 million. Further cancellations reduced the loan to US$12.9
million. The project closed on the original date of December 31, 1995. Total disbursement at
closing was US$9.2 million; and the remaining undisbursed balance of US$3.7 million was
canceled. The last disbursement was made on November 9, 1995.
3.    The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) was prepared by the MN2NE Division of
the Bank. Preparation of the ICR is based on material in the project files, data provided by
PBDAC, a field visit to Egypt in December 1995, and discussions with the project
implementation unit and officials of PBDAC and the Ministry of International Cooperation.
4.    The ICR was prepared by Youssef Fuleihan, of the Natural Resources, Water and
Environment Division (MN2NE) of the Middle East and North Africa Region, and Rouchdy
Saleh of the Cairo Resident Mission (MN2EG). The ICR was reviewed by Salah Darghouth,
Division Chief. PBDAC commented on the draft ICR, and its comments were taken into
consideration to the extent possible.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
AGRICULTURAL STORAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 3071-EGT)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION
1.    The Agricultural Storage Project is the 15th project supported by the World Bank Group in
the agriculture and irrigation/drainage sectors since 1980, and the fifth Bank-supported project with
the Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit (PBDAC), the implementing agency.
It was preceded by two lines of credit for agro-industry, and two agricultural development projects;
currently, the Bank supports the ongoing Agricultural Modernization Project (Ln. 3719-EGT and
Cr. 2585-EGT).
2.    The rationale for the Bank Group's involvement in the agriculture sector was to increase
productivity and raise farm income, as part of its strategy to reduce poverty, which is highest in
rural areas. This has taken the form of removing the physical constraints to production and
improving efficiency, particularly in drainage and irrigation; credit lines to the private sector; and
technology transfer and institutional capacity building. Agricultural development led to higher
demand for production inputs, but the provision of storage infrastructure facilities lagged behind
physical improvements. The project was expected to reduce losses and damage to, and improve the
efficiency of, agricultural input storage and distribution.
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.    The project objectives were to:
(a)   assist the country and PBDAC to modernize and expand the agricultural storage
infrastructure;
(b)   improve the handling of agricultural inputs, grains, and animal feed through
appropriate mechanization and the training of storage personnel in order to: (i)
reduce physical losses; (ii) minimize quality deterioration of the products handled;
(iii) improve efficiency in the transportation of fertilizers and animal feeds; and (iv)
reduce product handling and storage costs; and
(c)   assist the country to plan appropriate infrastructure for the bulk storage and
distribution of imported feed grains at selected port and inland locations.


﻿Evaluation Summary                                                             iii
4.     In support of these objectives, the project was to provide:
(a)   the construction of 888 warehouses having nearly 0.9 million tons of covered
storage capacity for agricultural products and inputs;
(b)   the repair and rehabilitation of existing warehouses (500,000 tons of storage
capacity);
(c)   the procurement of 300 conveyor belts to mechanize the storage and handling of
fertilizers and grains, and reduce loss and damage (for both existing and new
warehouses);
(d)   the construction of a bulk handling and storage facility for 60,000 tons of imported
corn/grains; and
(e)   institutional capacity building of PBDAC.
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
5.    At appraisal in November, 1988, the storage infrastructure for agricultural inputs in Egypt
was inadequate. From a national perspective, there existed a recognized need for expanding
covered storage capacity. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) estimated the gap to be around 0.9
million tons of grains and fertilizers. However, there was little willingness by the private sector to
invest in this field because fertilizer was sold by PBDAC at subsidized prices, and there were
restrictions on corn trade. On the other hand, PBDAC operated an extensive storage infrastructure
consisting of 541 "shounas" (open storage spaces), 326 warehouses, and 4300 mandubias or retail
outlets (mostly rented). Hence, the Government of Egypt decided to invest in storage infrastructure
to avoid heavy storage and handling losses.
6.    Beginning in 1987, the Egyptian policy environment was undergoing gradual liberalization,
as part of the Government's Economic Reform and Structural Adjustment Program (ERSAP). The
agriculture sector spearheaded the economic reform program, which included removal of crop
delivery quotas, price liberalization, removal of input subsidies, liberalization of trade and
marketing of crops and inputs, sale of reclaimed public lands, and liberalization of land tenure laws.
When fertilizer subsidies were removed in 1993, and input trade was liberalized, the response of
the private sector was much stronger than anticipated by the Bank and the Borrower, as it took over
corn imports and distribution entirely, and accounted for about 80-85% of fertilizer distribution.
7.    This policy change had a major impact on project development objectives, scope, and
sustainability, as PBDAC lost its monopolistic position in the distribution of corn and fertilizers.
As a result, the project was restructured in October 1993 and downsized to adapt to the new policy
environment. Subsequent cancellations reduced the loan from US$40.0 million to US$12.9


﻿iv                                                              Evaluation Summary
million; US$9.2 million was actually disbursed, and the undisbursed balance of US$3.7 million
was canceled.
8.    Under the restructured project, the construction of warehouses was drastically reduced;
rehabilitation limited to those warehouses in urgent need of repair; the number of conveyor belts
reduced by 25%; weigh bridges (truck scales) were reduced and eventually canceled; and the grain
bulk storage and distribution facility was canceled.
9.    Construction of warehouses was down-sized from 888 to 110 units in the restructured
project. A total of 87 warehouses were actually built, all in Sharkiya Governorate, and three
warehouses are partially completed. Of the planned rehabilitation of 176 warehouses, 53
warehouses, in addition to 90 small stores, have been rehabilitated. PBDAC plans to rehabilitate
the remaining warehouses over three years from the closing date.
10.   The procurement of conveyor belts was reduced by 25%. Nearly all mobile conveyor belts
are not yet in use for various reasons (uncompleted electrical connections, and low demand for
storage facilities). The provision of 44 truck scales was reduced and eventually canceled.
11.   To relieve port congestion in the handling of imported corn, the project provided for the
construction of a 60,000 ton grain bulk storage and distribution facility at or near a port. Following
input trade liberalization, PBDAC canceled the construction of this facility, and compensated the
consultant for preparing designs for the proposed facility.
12.   A 1993 USAID-financed study on the divestiture of PBDAC's input trade showed that: (a)
the available storage capacities far exceed the volume of market demand estimated as less than 25%
of total capacity; and (b) the unutilized storage capacities were not financially viable under the new
policy environment, and should be reduced. Based on the findings of the study, PBDAC
considered several options, including the release of storage facilities, a management contract to
operate the facilities, leasing to the private sector, or joint ventures. PBDAC pursued two options:
establishing joint ventures with private investors, including banks and PBDAC storage staff as an
incentive for them to leave the institution (three small companies were actually set up for this
purpose); and it released about 250,000 m2 of storage space. PBDAC's policy in this regard,
however, has evolved since then, and current policy calls for the release of rented space capacity.
13.   Due to reported shortages and steep increases in prices of fertilizers, Government in mid-
1995 gave PBDAC a temporary mandate for the distribution of all local production of fertilizers.
As a result, total capacity utilization in December 1995 rose above 30%.


﻿Evaluation Summary                                                                v
PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
14.   Following the implementation of the Government's economic reform program and input
trade liberalization (para. 6), the project became unsustainable. The bulk of input trade is now
handled by the private sector; private traders usually buy small quantities of fertilizers or grains,
have a high turnover ratio, and need only small storage areas. As a result, storage capacity
utilization and revenues fell; hence the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) is negative and has not
been estimated.
15.   Overall, the outcome of the project, in terms of its development objectives, has been
unsatisfactory, following input trade liberalization in Egypt.
KEY LESSONS LEARNED
16.   The experience under this project shows that:
(a)   The main lesson learned is the high risk of failure associated with financing
facilities owned and operated by public sector institutions. The risk becomes reality
during a period of economic liberalization, which opens up competition by the
private sector;
(b)   Financing of agricultural storage, processing, and similar infrastructure in the public
sector should be undertaken only where there is market failure. Even if such
facilities are financed, it is advisable to build in features in the project for their
eventual privatization according to a time-bound plan; and
(c)   Project restructuring should have been more far-reaching, and should have included
all activities for which commitments have not been made.


﻿IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
AGRICULTURAL STORAGE PROJECT
(Loan 3071-EGT)
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Background
1.1         During the last three decades, Egypt has become increasingly dependent on imports of
agricultural and food commodities, but the country's capacity for storage, handling, and distribution
of local production and imports of agricultural commodities and inputs lagged behind its needs. The
Agricultural Storage Project was designed to modernize and expand agricultural storage
infrastructure for grains/feed and fertilizers, improve handling methods and save excessive product
storage losses, save the foreign exchange which would have to be expended to replace commodity
losses, and improve the quality of outputs and inputs. The Principal Bank for Development and
Agricultural Credit (PBDAC) was the implementing agency. Earlier loans to PBDAC provided lines
of credit and technical assistance to improve agricultural productivity and modernize and expand
processing and marketing of agricultural produce by small and medium scale private enterprises, and
to improve institutional capacity (Agroindustries Project, Cr.988-EGT, Second Agroindustries
Project, Ln.2243-EGT, Agricultural Development Project, Cr.830-EGT, and Second Agricultural
Development Project, Ln.2561-EGT). These loans and credits have been satisfactorily completed,
although not without problems. An on-going project (Agricultural Modernization Project, Ln.3719-
EGT and Cr. 2585-EGT) would increase agricultural productivity through on-lending, technical farm
packages, and improving organization and staff capability of PBDAC.
1.2         At appraisal in November, 1988, the storage infrastructure for agricultural inputs in
Egypt was inadequate. From a national perspective, there existed a recognized need for expanding
covered storage capacity. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) estimated the gap in covered storage to
be around 0.9 million tons for grains and fertilizers. However, there was little willingness by the
private sector to invest in this field because fertilizer was sold by PBDAC at subsidized prices, and
there were restrictions on corn trade. On the other hand, PBDAC operated an extensive storage
infrastructure consisting of 541 "shounas" (open storage spaces), 326 warehouses, and 4300
mandubias or retail outlets (mostly rented). Hence, the Government of Egypt decided to invest in
storage infrastructure to avoid heavy storage and handling losses.
1.3         Beginning in 1987, the Egyptian policy environment was undergoing gradual
liberalization, as part of the Government's Economic Reform and Structural Adjustment Program
(ERSAP). The agriculture sector spearheaded the economic reform program, which included
removal of crop delivery quotas, price liberalization, removal of input subsidies, liberalization of


﻿2                                                       Agricultural Storage Project
trade and marketing of crops and inputs, sale of reclaimed public lands, and liberalization of land
tenure laws. When fertilizer subsidies were removed in 1993, and input trade was liberalized, the
response of the private sector was much stronger than anticipated by the Bank and the Borrower, as it
took over corn imports and distribution entirely, and accounted for about 80-85% of fertilizer
distribution (para 1.8).
B. Project Objectives and Components
1.4          Objective. The main project objectives were to:
(a)    assist in modernizing and expanding the agricultural storage infrastructure;
(b)    improve the handling of agricultural inputs, grains, and animal feed through
appropriate mechanization and the training of storage management and
operating personnel in order to: (i) reduce physical losses which were
estimated at $33.0 million annually; (ii) minimize quality deterioration of the
products handled; (iii) improve efficiency in the transportation of fertilizers
and animal feeds; and (iv) reduce product handling and storage costs; and
(c)    assist the country to plan appropriate infrastructure for the bulk storage and
distribution of imported feed grains at selected port and inland locations.
1.5          Components. In support of these objectives, the project was to provide:
(a)    the construction of 888 warehouses having nearly 0.9 million tons of covered
storage capacity for agricultural products and inputs;
(b)    the repair and rehabilitation of existing warehouses (0.5 million tons of
storage capacity);
(c)    the procurement of 300 conveyor belts to mechanize the storage and handling
of fertilizers and grains, and reduce loss and damage;
(d)    the construction of a bulk handling and storage facility for 60,000 tons of
imported corn/grains;
(e)    the hiring of engineering consultants;
(f)    the upgrading of technical and management skills of PBDAC staff through
training and study tours; and


﻿Agricultural Storage Project                                                      3
(g)   a study on the importation, handling, storage and distribution of imported feed
grains to develop an investment proposal for additional storage infrastructure
(financed through the Technical Assistance Credit 1 162-EGT).
1.6          The total project cost was estimated at appraisal at US$103.1 million, of which the
loan was US$ 40.0 million. The balance was to be financed from PBDAC's resources.
C. Implementation and Factors Affecting the Project
1.7          The project experienced lengthy start-up delays. It was signed nearly one year after
Board approval, and it took another year for effectiveness.
1.8          As a result of input trade liberalization, PBDAC lost its monopolistic position in the
import and/or distribution of corn and fertilizers, its market share eventually fell to 15-20% of local
fertilizer distribution, and corn was entirely imported by the private sector. This policy change had a
major impact on project objectives and sustainability, and there was a clear need for project
restructuring. Concurrently, a USAID-financed study on input trade by PBDAC, carried out in 1993,
recommended divestiture of some storage facilities (para 1.19). Consequently, the project was
restructured in October 1993, when its scope, costs, and financing were significantly downsized to
adapt to the new policy environment. Subsequent cancellations reduced the Bank loan from US$40.0
to US$12.9 million (US$9.2 million actually disbursed), and the balance of US$3.7 million was
canceled.
1.9          Under the restructured project, the construction of warehouses was drastically
reduced; rehabilitation limited to those warehouses in urgent need of repair; the number of conveyor
belts reduced by 25%; weigh bridges (truck scales) were reduced and eventually canceled; the grain
bulk storage and distribution facility was canceled; and the training component was canceled in view
of PBDAC's intent to divest input trade, and reluctance to borrow for this activity. Details are given
in the paragraphs below.
1.10         Construction of Warehouses: Construction of warehouses was down-sized from 888
to 109 warehouses under the restructured project. A total of 87 warehouses were actually built, all in
the Sharkiya Governorate. The quality of new warehouses is very good. In addition, 22 warehouses
were to be built by a contractor, who defaulted on his obligations. Consequently, PBDAC enforced
penalty payments, recalled the performance bond, and sued the contractor. PBDAC plans to finish
three partially completed warehouses when a settlement is reached.


﻿4                                                       Agricultural Storage Project
1.11         Considering the change in project scope, the default of the contractor had an
unintended positive aspect, since it avoided the construction of unneeded additional capacity, and
resulted in cost savings for the Government.
1.12         Rehabilitation of Existing Warehouses:  PBDAC's revised plan called for the
rehabilitation of 176 warehouses. So far, 53 warehouses, in addition to 90 small stores, have been
rehabilitated. With some exceptions, the quality of rehabilitation is in general satisfactory. PBDAC
plans to rehabilitate the remaining warehouses over three years.
1.13         Equipment: (a) Conveyor Belts: Procurement was reduced by 25%, and 225 portable
conveyor belts and their spare parts were delivered and distributed to PBDAC and the regional Banks
for Development and Agricultural Credit (BDACs) in 18 Governorates; and staff were trained by the
supplier in their proper use and maintenance. All belts and spare parts have been tested and approved
by a committee of three PBDAC mechanical engineers who received special training to operate the
equipment. Nearly all mobile conveyor belts are not yet in use for various reasons (low demand, and
uncompleted electrical connections). (b) Weigh Bridges: The provision of 44 weigh bridges or truck
scales, as envisaged at project appraisal, to be located at various "shounas"' to improve inventory
control, was to be financed by Government; at restructuring, and to reduce the foreign exchange
burden on PBDAC, the Bank agreed to finance 20 truck scales at an estimated cost of US$ 2.5
million. However, this component was later canceled.
1.14         Grain Bulk Storage and Distribution Facility: At appraisal, PBDAC was importing
about 1.5 million tons of corn annually. The SAR envisaged the construction of additional storage
infrastructure at a later stage at inland locations and other facilities at receiving ports. The decision to
build these facilities was to be based on a feasibility study. To relieve port congestion in the handling
of imported corn, the project provided for the construction of a 60,000 ton grain bulk storage and
distribution facility at or near a port. A consulting firm prepared the designs for this facility, selected
inside the Port Said harbor. Following Government's decision to liberalize the import of feed grains,
PBDAC canceled the construction of this facility, and compensated the consultant.
1.15         Studies: A consultant carried out a study, financed through the Technical Assistance
Project, Cr. 1 162-EGT, on grain imports, storage, and distribution to assess total and regional demand
for grain storage, and to develop an investment proposal in this regard. The study was of mediocre
quality, and in view of the increasing role of the private sector in input trade, the study had very
limited use.
1.16         Training: The project had the ambitious goal of providing training and study tours to
over 6000 participants (including 5000 distributors), to improve the managerial and/or technical
"Shounas" are mostly open air storage sites.

capabilities of the storage personnel in the different branches of PBDAC and its affiliated BDACs,
and to train distributors. However, this component was canceled at restructuring in line with
PBDAC's declared policy to divest input trade, and its reluctance to use borrowed funds for training.
1.17         Engineering Consultants: The project provided for consultants to assist in the design
and supervision of civil works related to the construction of warehouses, and the preparation of
design and tender documents, evaluation of bids and inspection of equipment (with the assistance of
PBDAC); and to assist PBDAC in designing and building a 60,000 grain storage and distribution
facility (para. 1.14). PBDAC hired local consultants for the construction of warehouses, and
international consultants for the design and supervision of construction of the grain bulk storage and
distribution facility. The local consultants also assisted PBDAC in the preparation of tender
documents for equipment; during the preparation of the ICR, it was found out that the local
consultants for equipment did not have the prior clearance of the Bank.
1.18         Divestiture of Input Trade: Data provided by PBDAC give the §ross grain and
2
fertilizer storage area at 4.912 million m , and the net storage area, at 4.500 million m , 60% of which
is owned by PBDAC. About 25% of the net storage area is covered storage space (warehouses and
stores), most of which is owned by PBDAC. Following economic reforms, and the removal of
fertilizer subsidies in 1993, storage capacity utilization fell drastically, as the private sector handled
all of the feed grain trade and the bulk of fertilizer distribution. However, farmers complained of
fertilizer shortages and high prices, particularly in remote areas.
1.19         A 1993 USAID-financed study on the divestiture of PBDAC's input trade' showed
that: (a) the available storage capacities far exceed the volume of market demand estimated as less
than 25% of total capacity; and (b) the unutilized storage capacities were not financially viable under
the new policy environment, and should be reduced. Based on the findings of the study, PBDAC
considered several divestiture options, including the release of storage facilities, a management
contract to operate the facilities, leasing to the private sector, or joint ventures. PBDAC pursued two
options: establishing joint ventures with private investors, including banks and PBDAC storage staff
as an incentive for them to leave the institution (three small companies were actually set up for this
purpose); and it released about 250,000 m2 of storage space. PBDAC's policy in this regard,
however, has evolved since then, due to its increasing role in input distribution (para 1.20), and
current policy calls for the release of rented space.
The covenant in the Project Agreement sates that PBDAC shall furnish to the Bank the findings of the study, and exchange
views with the Bank on measures and a timetable for implementation of the selected option.

1.20          Due to reported shortages and steep increases in prices of fertilizers, Government in
mid-1995 gave PBDAC a temporary mandate for the distribution of all local production of
fertilizers . As a result, total capacity utilization in December 1995 rose above 30%.
D. Project Sustainability
1.21          The Government's economic reform program and input trade liberalization (para. 1.8)
had a direct and significant impact on the project's development objectives and sustainability. The
bulk of input trade is now handled by the private sector. Private traders usually buy small quantities
of fertilizers or grains, have a high turnover ratio, and hence need only small storage areas.
1.22          Overall, the project, even at its reduced scale, is not sustainable in Egypt's new
liberalized policy environment. However, rehabilitated warehouses, with little investment costs, and
new warehouses in high demand urban areas could eventually be sold or leased.
1.23          Project costs (US$22.4 million) have been accompanied by loss of revenues as a
result of the economic reform program; hence, the economic and financial rates of return for the
project are negative and have not been estimated.
E. Bank Performance
1.24          The Bank's performance in     project design  and  implementation  had   some
shortcomings.
1.25          The appraisal team anticipated to some extent the impact on the project objectives of
ERSAP, by adopting a modular design for warehouses (1000 tons each) to make them more
appealing for sale or lease to the private sector. However, the team did not anticipate the full extent
of the impact, underestimated the response of the private sector to input trade liberalization, and
overestimated private demand for warehouse storage facilities.
1.26          The Bank expressed concern over the procurement of 300 conveyor belts in one batch,
and recommended splitting procurement for the following reasons: evaluating quality and
performance and size of belts, ensuring that proper electrical and other connections have been made,
and assessing the demand for storage facilities and hence conveyor belts. PBDAC management
argued that: PBDAC's needs exceeded 300 conveyor belts, not only for new warehouses but also for
existing warehouses and storage facilities; mobile generators would be used where needed; timely
1/ PBDAC informed the mission that farmers use about 6.0 million tons of nitrogenous fertilizers annually, of which 4.5 million
tons are domestic production. The balance of nitrogenous and other fertilizers (phosphate and potassium) is imported by the
private sector.


﻿Agricultural Storage Project                                                    7
delivery was essential for the mechanization of warehouses; and there were scale economies in bulk
procurement. Upon the Bank's request, PBDAC agreed to reduce procurement by 25%.
1.27         In view of the continuing role of PBDAC in input trade, it would have been prudent to
keep the training component, but scale it down drastically.
1.28         During implementation, the Bank and PBDAC acted responsively to the changing
policy environment in Egypt but with delay, restructured the project, and reduced the loan from
US$40.0 million to US$18.5 million, and subsequently to US$12.9 million (32.3% of the original
loan), of which US$9.2 million has been disbursed. In retrospect, the project should have been
restructured earlier, possibly after effectiveness.
F. Borrower's Performance
1.29         Due to administrative and parliamentary ratification procedures, and issues related to
the role of the public sector during a period of structural adjustment, loan effectiveness was delayed
by 23 months from Board approval.
1.30         PBDAC's management was responsive, although with delay, in assessing the impact
of the new policy environment on project objectives and scope, as reflected by its policy at
restructuring, to drastically downsize the project, and to cancel additional amounts thereafter.
1.31         PBDAC originally planned to divest about one-half of total storage capacity by the
end of 1995. Actual divestiture has fallen well below target (para 1.19). PBDAC's policy has
changed since then, in view of its recent mandate in input distribution; and the current plan calls for
the divestiture of rented facilities only, mostly shounas.
1.32         So far, most warehouses have not been mechanized. PBDAC plans to keep about 100
conveyor belts, and to sell the rest. In order to accelerate the sale of the unneeded conveyor belts,
PBDAC started to implement the following action plan: (a) agreement with the local partner of the
supplier for the sale of conveyor belts on a commission basis, and to modify the belts to meet
customers' needs; (b) participation in exhibits and advertising in the local media; and (c) financing the
sale of mobile belts to buyers. So far only one set has been sold, and PBDAC recently informed the
Bank that it is negotiating the sale of up to 50 conveyor belts to a sugar factory. PBDAC needs to
intensify efforts, reduce sale prices of conveyor belts, increase incentives, and appoint private agents
to encourage sales. Although storage and maintenance procedures for conveyor belts have improved
somewhat, they remain inadequate and need to be improved in order to protect the equipment against
dust and rust until they are sold or used.

1.33         PBDAC appointed the project steering committee, the project executive director/
coordinator, and key staff in a timely manner. However, the project had four directors during
implementation.  PBDAC's overall performance in dealing with consultants, contractors, and
suppliers was satisfactory. When two contractors for the construction of warehouses experienced
delays, PBDAC served them legal notice; as a result, one contractor complied with the terms of the
contract, but with delays; and PBDAC recalled the performance bond and sued the other contractor.
Also, an agreement has been reached with the supplier to reduce the procurement of conveyor belts
by 25%. When the bulk grain storage and distribution facility was canceled, PBDAC reached an
amicable settlement with the consultant hired for the design and supervision of construction of the
facility.
1.34         Compliance with covenants was generally satisfactory, but with delays, and there was
partial compliance with some covenants: (a) Audit Reports: PBDAC initially did not include the
local expenditures with project accounts; but has subsequently done so. Project accounts have been
submitted but with delays. The FY94 project accounts (in Arabic) have been submitted; these
accounts have been accepted by the Central Audit Organization (CAO), but a separate audit report
has not been issued. The FY95 project accounts are being reviewed by CAO, and the audit report
was to be provided to the Bank by March 31, 1996. (b) Progress Reports: PBDAC submitted
progress reports but not on a regular basis and with delay. (c) Pesticide and Fertilizer Handling:
Pesticide and fertilizer storage procedures are in general adequate (fertilizers should be stored away
from walls), but protective gear is needed to provide better protection for workers.
G. Assessment of Outcome
1.35         Overall, the outcome of the project, in terms of its development objectives, has been
unsatisfactory following the liberalization of input trade. In terms of utilization of funds, around 23%
of the original loan amount (or US$9.2 million), was disbursed, and the balance canceled.
1.36         Project effectiveness was delayed by 23 months. The project was restructured and
several components were either canceled or downsized (para. 1.8). Capacity utilization of storage
facilities is low, and PBDAC has a temporary mandate for the distribution of local fertilizers. The
majority of the new warehouses has not been put in use so far. The mechanization of fertilizer and
grain storage and handling has not been introduced, and efforts are underway to sell unneeded
equipment.
H. Future Operations
1.37         Following input trade liberalization, the private sector now accounts for the bulk of
agricultural input trade and agribusiness-related activities. The Bank should not finance grain and


﻿Agricultural Storage Project                                                       9
fertilizer storage facilities (warehouses, grain silos, etc.) by public sector agencies, unless there is
market failure.
I. Key Lessons Learned
1.38         The experience under this project shows that:
(a)    The main lesson learned is the high risk of failure associated with financing
facilities owned and operated by public sector institutions. The risk becomes
reality during a period of economic liberalization, which opens up
competition by the private sector;
(b)    Financing of agricultural storage, processing, and similar infrastructure in the
public sector should be undertaken only where there is market failure. Even
if such facilities are financed, it is advisable to build in features in the project
for their eventual privatization according to a time-bound plan; and
(c)    Project restructuring should have been more far-reaching, and should have
included all activities for which commitments have not been made.

Table 9: Economic Costs and Benefits
The project's economic rate of return (ERR) was estimated at appraisal to be 22.0%. Project incremental
benefits so far are negative due to the impact of Government's structural adjustment program on project objectives
and the low rate of capacity utilization. The ERR is negative and hence has not been estimated.
