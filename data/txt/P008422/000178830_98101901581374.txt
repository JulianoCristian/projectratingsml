SUMMARY
i.        The National Investment Bank for Industrial Development S.A. (NIBID)
was formed in 1963 by the Nati-onal Bank of Greece (NBG) and a number of for-
eign banks. IFC became a shareholder in 1965, and presently holds 7% of
NIBID's paid-up share capital. The Bank has made two loans to NIBID total-
ling US$ 32.5 million.
ii.       Greek economic growth, averaging 8% per annum in the 1960 to 1968
period slowed down in 1967-68. Economic counter-measures by the Government
were successful and GNP grew at about 8% per annum in 1968 and 1970. This
growth was fuelled by a significant increase in private fixed investment,
particularly in the construction sector. Despite a good export performance
the balance of payments deficit increased from $ 360 million in 1969 to $ 420
million in 1970. The manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 20% of
GDP, has experienced an impressive growth in the last few years but is still
a long ways from achieving competitiveness vis-a-vis European production.
Greece continues to stimulate modernization by progressive elimination of
restriction on imports required by its associate status with EEC and by
fiscal incentives to encourage foreign investment in Greece.
ili.      NIBID is recognized by its clients and other financial institu-
tions as progressive and helpful; its management is capable and energetic.
Although the professional staff is competent and experienced, some strength-
ening of economic analysis is still desirable. NIBID is also seeking to
improve Arthur D. Little Ilellas' penetration in the Greek Market, mainly in
seeking ways to reduce the cost of its studies in order to increase its ef-
fectiveness with smaller enterprises.
iv.       As of December 31, 1970, a total of 193 loans and equity opera-
tions had been approved by NIBID, amounting to US$ 105.6 million equivalent.
-IBID's business reached its highest level in 1970.  Its approvals during
the year, totalling Dr 1,157.4 million (US$ 38.6 million equivalent) ex-
ceeded the aggregate approvals during NIBID's first five years (1964-1968)
and were 44% higher than the approvals of 1969. During the first eight
months of 1971, loans and investments in the amount of Drs 730 million
($24.3 million) were approved or were submitted to the Executive Committee.
1971's total approvals are likely to exceed Dr 1,300 million (over US$ 90
million).
v.        NIBID's total assets, at December 31, 1970, stood at about US$
68.8 million equivalent. The quality of its loan and equity portfolio is
good. NIBID's available resources totalling US$ 120 million equivalent
were nearly exhausted by June 30, 1971, leaving only $ 5 million of un-
committed resources. Further drachma funds will be obtained from the present
sources (National Bank of Greece and Bank of Greece), and, also, from
local debenture and share issues. NIBID is negotiating with its European
shareholders foreign exchange loans for an amount of about $ 10-15 million.
NIBID has achieved only a moderate level of profitability, and the keys
to improving it are increasing leverage and increasing its equity operations.



- iv -
vi.       NIBID must increase its borrowing capacity.  To this end, NIBID
is negotiating with its shareholders an increase of its share capital by
50% and plans to sell in the Greek market non-voting shares and bonds with
conversion features. A higher debt/equity limitation is needed and justi-
fied given NIBID's performances and experience, and it is recommended that
the ratio be increased to 7:1.
vii.      NIBID requires Dr 3,040 million (US$ 101.3 million equivalent) to
finance its operations, on approval basis to June 30, 1973. Half of this is
a foreign exchange requirement. Given NIBID's traditional sources and its
plans of increasing its share capital and issuing bonds, a gap of US$ 40
million remains which will be partially covered by loans from its European
Shareholders. NIBID remains a suitable and creditworthy borrower for Bank
funds, and it is recommended that a Bank loan of US$ 25 million be extended
to NIBID to help meet its foreign exchange and resource gaps through mid 1973.
The proposed loan should be made on terms applied generally to recent loans
to development finance companies.  NIBID should be limited to an overall
debt/equity ratio of 7:1. The free limit regime applying to NIBID's second
loan from the Bank should also apply to the proposed third.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The National Investment Bank for Industrial Development (NIBID)
was established in 1963 by the National Bank of Greece and ten foreign
banks. In 1965 the company's share capiltal was increased and several new
foreign banks, and IFC, became shareholders. NIBID has already had two Bank
loans: $12.5 million in March 1968 and $20 million in November 1970. Back-
ground data on NIBID's history and development can be found in the appraisal
repSrts relating to the two previous loans.  This report focuses on develop-
ments since the previous Bank loan was made. A detailed review of the econ-
omy of Greece can be found in Report titled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Greece" dated May 13, 1971.
II. NIBID'S ENVIRONMENT
Overall Economic Performance of Greece
2.01      Economically, Greece has enjoyed, in 1969 and 1970, two good years.
GDP grew at about 8% per annum in this period (at constant prices) and this
was achieved without significant pressure on prices. This growth was fuelled
by a significant increase in private fixed investment particularly in the
construction sector. Growth in this sector resulted from an expansionary
credit policy and other measures to stimulate construction activity.
2.02      There has been no dramatic shiEt in the composition of GDP by sec-
tor in the past few years although the manufacturing sector has been more
dynamic than agriculture or services. Manufacturing now accounts for about
20% of GDP, as does agriculture. Progress has been made in increasing ex-
ports of manufactures; in 1970 they totalled $227 million, double the 1968
level. After two years of serious decline in 1967 and 1968, tourism has re-
bounded and tourism receipts in 1970 were about $194 million, or 33% higher
than the earlier peak reached in 1966.
2.03      One potentially vulnerable area is the balance of payments.  While
export performance has been good, imports have accelerated and Greece's cur-
rent account deficit increased from about $360 million in 1969 to $420 mil-
lion in 1970.  This has just about been covered by capital inflows, which
have recovered since the second half of 1969, although the credits extended
to Greece in recent years has tended to be rather short-term, thereby in-
creasing the near-term debt service requirements of the country. At the end
of 1970, foreign exchange reserves were equivalent to about 2 months' imports.
2.04      Gross domestic investment is noDw about 27% of GDP; gross national
saving is about 20% of GDP. The capacity of the banking system to finance
investment has continued to expand. Deposits have increased from Dr 68 bil-
lion at the end of 1968 to about Dr 101 billion at the end of 1970, i.e. an
increase of 20% per annum. The largest percentage increase was in time de-
posits although these still represented only 17% of total bank deposits.



-2-
Manufacturing Sector
2.05      As noted above, manufacturing accounts for about 20% of GDP.  It
has, in the past two decades, doubled its relative contribution to national
output. Manufacturing output increased by about 6% in 1968, and by 9% in
1969 and 1970. The manufacturing sector in Greece is overwhelmingly private
sector controlled although the state does own a few industrial enterprises,
largely through the Hellenic Industrial Development Bank's portfolio (HID3
is a Government-owned financing institution - see para 2.17).
2.06      Manufacturing investment (gross) data are incomplete but the esti-
mate for 1968 was about $230 million. In 1970, this increased to about $300
million. This investment was more diffuse than that which occurred in pre-
vious years, i.e. investment in the 1964-67 period was dominated by a few
very large projects in metal refining and petro-chemicals, while there have
not been any such giant projects implemented in the last 2-3 years.
2.07      Concurrently with the overall growth of manufacturing, the sector
has experienced some internal restructuring as basic metallurgical, non-
metallic mineral, chemical and oil industries grew substantially faster
than consumer good type industries. This reflects of course the earlier
heavy investments in these sectors as noted above.
2.08      Although manufacturing growth has been impressive this sector still
a long ways from achieving competitiveness vis a vis European production.
Greece continues to stimulate change and modernization in the manufacturing
sector through two basic poleicies. First, the agreement with the EEC that
requires progressive elimination of quantitative, administrative, and tariff
restrictions on imports of manufactured goods from the EEC by 1984, continues,
albeit over a considerable time span, to reduce the high protective walls
previously built up for Greek industry. Second, the Government attempts
through fiscal incentives, to encourage foreign investment in Greece, par-
ticularly in joint venture enterprises. This approach is sensible.
2.09      In this connectioa, NIBID has been playing a useful role in sev-
eral respects. First, NIBID has been active in encouraging Greek firms to
seek financial and technical involvement of foreign firms. This is a nat-
ural role for NIBID, an internationally owned institution. Second, in some
cases, from the foreign investor's perspective, NIBID represents a desired
partner in joint ventures because of its independent status as a Greek-
foreign financing institution, and this helps to facilitate such operations.
Third, through its promotlon of the consulting company, ADL Hellas (para.
4.05), it has sought to increase the availability to Greek industry of tech-
nical, organizational and administrative know-how.
2.10      While it is hard to obtain data that define precisely the pace of
private foreign investment in the Greek manufacturing sector in the last two
or three years, balance of payments data indicate a distinct recovery from
the decline that occurred in 1967. Private long-term net capital inflows
into Greece (this excludes suppliers credits and commercial bank financing)



- 3 -
went from about $100 million in 1968 to about $140 million in 1970. Only
part of this has gone into the manufacturingt sector but the aggregate data
indicates that private capital flows to Greece last year were up signifi-
cantly.
2.11      With respect to protection, Greek firms today still enjoy a signi-
ficant advantage over imports. First, there are a number of items on re-
stricted import lists. In accordance with Greece's EEC Agreement, the licens-
ing of imports from EEC countries will have to cease by the end of 1974, but
this will still remain a protective device for non-EEC products. Second, 2-4
month advance deposits are required on a wide range of imports. The deposits
range up to, and in some cases exceed, the cif cost of the imports. This
deposit system is also being dismantled on manufactured goods, as per the EEC
Agreement, and in this case Greece is extending the changes to all GATT coun-
tries. Third, tariffs on many items are still high as indicated by the ratios
(1970) of duty collected to taxed imports amounting 27% on food, 95% on bev-
erages and tobacco, 50% on soap products, 50% on synthetic fabrics, 40% on
cotton fabrics, 40% on appliances, etc.
2.12      Concerning exports, the share of manufactured exports to total ex-
ports has increased from 18% in 1967 to 40% in 1970. Much of the increase in
exports relates to four items: textiles (cotton, mainly), aluminum, nickel
and steel plates. These items accounted for about 60% of total manufactured
exports of $227 million in 1970. This represents about 34% of total manu-
facturing output in Greece. Government pol:Lcies to stimulate exports are
complex in detail but in substance they amolnt to a cash subsidy of 15-25%
on f.o.b. prices, depending on the proportion of a firm's output that is ex-
ported. The availability of such subsidies has been a significant factor in
increasing exports of manufactured products.
Financial Environment
2.13      NIBID works in a financial communLty that is dominated by two Greek
banks, one of which, the National Bank of Greece (NBG), is its parent 1/.
Five foreign banks now operate in Greece although they are relative newcomers
and control only a small proportion of banking assets. There is one other
investment bank (the Investment Bank of Greece - IGG, sponsored by the NBG's
main competitor, the Commercial Bank of Greece - CBG), and the large and im-
portant Government-owned Hellenic Industrial Development Bank (HIDB). To-
gether these five institutions are responsible for the bulk of internal re-
sources mobilized for industrial development.
1/   NBG's ownership is widespread and in its day-to-day operations it op-
erates in most respects as a private commercial bank. However, the
Government is the largest single shareholder (10% of the total) and it
controls the selection oa the bank's Governor. NBG's assets total
abouit two-thirds of tommercial banking assets in Greece; hence, Govern-
ment has a definite xnterest ta seeing that NBG follows official policy
rather closely.



- 4 -
2.14      Comercial Banks.  The NBG and the CBG remain the traditional
private sector 1/ financiers of manufacturing in Greece. They remain
active in making medium- and long-term loans to industry. In fact, Bank
of Greece regulations require them to lend 15% of their deposits for in-
dustrial credits with final maturities of 5 years or longer. Moreover,
their equity holdings in industry are substantial, although in the last
years their net equity holdings in private enterprises increased only Dr
200 million. Resources available to the banks for lending have increased
markedly in the last two years as deposits increased from Dr 49 billion at
the end of 1968 to Dr 74 billion at the end of 1970. Liquid funds have
increased from 16% of total liabilities in 1967 to 24% at the end of 1970.
For the last three or four years, about half of the total loans made by
commercial banks went into industry and mining. About 16% of these loans
were in the form of long-term loans; outstanding term loans to this sector
were Dr 4.7 billion at the end of 1970. This understates the actual levels
of long-term funds as much of the short-term money lent to industry is on
the basis of renewable overdrafts.
2.15      Investment Banks.  Total commercial bank credits to industry in-
creased by about Dr 4 billion during 1970. This reflects their dominant
role. Nevertheless, both of the large Greek commercial banks continue to
lend to their associated investment companies, through which they have chan-
nelled substantial resources for industrial credit. In the case of NIBID,
its outstanding loans to industry increased by about Dr 0.7 billion in 1970
while the comparable figure for IBG was Dr 0.2 billion. The combined in-
crease represented about 25% of the increase of industrial loans outstand-
ing during the year by the investment banks' parents. The rationale for
.creating these companies, given the fact that much of their financing
could in principle be handled by their parent organization, was: (a) to
create institutions that could be more specialized and perhaps more dynamic
and flexible than the parents, (b) to develop institutions capable of tap-
ping sources of both domestic and foreign loan capital that commercial banks
could not reach and (c) to have institutions with close ties to foreign fi-
nancial institutions.
2.16      Of the two investment banks NIBID is the less closely controlled
by its parent (NBG holds 55% of NIBID's shares while CBG holds 85% of IBG's
shares), the larger and more rapidly growing. NIBID's total assets are
about Dr 2.1 billion as opposed to Dr 0.8 billion for the IBG. Also NIBID
approved loans of Dr 1.2 billion in 1970 as compared with Dr 0.35 billion
by IBG. When both banks started, they were highly dependent on their re-
spective parents for channelling funds and business to them. Of the two,
NIBID has been the more successful at carving out an independent life for
itself. However, both banks are active, aggressive financing enterprises
and the element of competition between them is healthy.
1/   Greece's central bank is the Bank of Greece.



2.17      Hellenic Industrial Development Bank.  Next to the NBG and CGB,
the Government owned HIDB is the largest term financing institution in Greece.
Its outstanding loans to industry have increased rapidly in the past four
years and in 1970 the increase was Dr 0.8 billion. During the last two years
HIDB has approved loans totalling Dr 7.5 billion, 30% for industry, 20% for
tourism and 50% for shipping.
2.18      HIDB is more than a lender.  First, it is the instrument through
which the Government seeks to attract foreign investment to Greece. In
this connection, HIDB maintains offices in New York and Cologne. Second,
it is responsible for the establishment of industrial estates. Third, it
conducts surveys and prepares pre-feasibility studies in industry and
industry-related and mining activities. Fourth, it has been, together
with the Government controlled Mortgage Bank, the mechanism used to finance
tourism projects on subsidized terms (18-20 year loans at 8%, with 4-5
year grace periods at reduced interest rates, such loans amounting to up
to 80% of capital costs). Fifth, on occasion it acts as an entrepreneur in
starting new industrial enterprises. Its total equity portfolio totals Dr
2.1 billion in respect of 29 companies, 11 of which HIDB owns or controls.
2.19      Other Sources of Funds.  There are no other substantial institu-
tional sources of capital for industry in Greece. Life insurance is not
common in the country; hence little capital is mobilized through this mech-
anism. The non-life insurance business is dominated by commercial bank-
controlled companies, whose reserves only total about Dr 1.1 billion. Pri-
vate pension funds also exist on a very small scale in Greece.
2.20      Similarly, the new issues market has not been a substantial fac-
tor in mobilizing capital. In the last three years there have only been
seven companies added to the Athens Stock Exchange listing. Bona fide
public offers of common stock are rare. Most listings are made by firms
for tax reasons; listed companies are subject to a 30% corporate tax rate
as opposed to 38% for non-listed companies. Corporate bond issues have
also been negligible in the past two years. The Government has issued
development bonds at the rate of about Dr 2 billion per annum (these
currently yield about 7.7% in a market maintained by the Bank of Greece).
The only private bond issue in the last two years was one in 1969 for Dr
100 million (10 years, coupon rate of 7%) by the Investment Bank of Greece.
This bond now yields about 7.9%, but the Commercial Bank of Greece has to
support the price by buying in the market.
2.21      With respect to shares, trading over the Exchange declined slight-
ly from Dr 1.6 billion in 1969 to Dr 1.4 billion in 1970. Bank shares ac-
count for more than 60% of the turnover. Of the 70 odd shares listed, only
15 are traded to any significant extent. The price index for bank shares
has increased five times since the end of 1968; the industrial index has in-
creased 2.5 times. While it is difficult to obtain from listed companies'
annual reports very clear statements of profits, the price of most traded
shares are high multiples of estimated earnings, and current dividend yields
on traded shares are now in the 1%-3% range. The reasons for the increased
investor interest in common shares are not entirely clear. The liquidity in



- 6 -
the market may have resulted in some increased interest in shares. Also
changes in the taxation of dividends favorable to investors, have also had
an impact on stimulating interest in the market. However, the result has
been that with substantial liquid funds chasing few available shares, share
price increases have been inordinate.
2.22      In summary, it is clear that the savings/financing practices in
Greece have changed little. The overwhelming institutional means of saving
is through the banking system and thus the banks are still the major sources
of finance for industry.
2.23      Inter-Institutional Relationships.  There is considerable competi-
tion among the three investment banks. Eighteen months ago HIDB had a con-
siderable advantage in its terms as it was charging 1%-2% less interest than
the other banks. It has since increased its rates to about the level charged
by the other banks, and thus, in this respect, the investment banks compete
on equal terms. While NIBID and IBG rarely finance the same project, NIBID
and HIDB, particularly in 1970, financed a number of projects together and
cooperation between the two institutions was increasing. HIDB has recently
changed management and it is too early to predict how this will affect the
cooperation between these two institutions.
Cost of Credit
2.24      The interest rate structure in Greece is determined by the Cur-
rency Committee. During the last 2 years both deposit and lending rates
have been below those prevailing in European markets. This has come about
not only from an official policy to keep rates low but also because of the
relatively liquid condition of the banking system. The basic bank lending
rate for industrial term loans is set at 8.5%. In addition, the investment
banks may add profit participation clauses up to an effective increment of
1.5% of interest. However, NIBID has in fact been only able to charge 8.5%
for the past year or so given the borrowers' market for credit that
has prevailed. Commercial banks are allowed to charge 11% on domestic and
import trade credits. On the other hand, reserve requirements against trade
credits are much higher than long-term for industry, exports or handicrafts,
and this tends to nullify the advantages of the higher income from trade
credits. Interest paid on savings and two years time deposits range from
5% to 7%. Two year deposits in foreign exchange earn 8%. Also tourism in-
vestment loans obtain preference the form of partial Government guarantees
and reduced interest during grace periods, specified at no more than five
years and no less than three years. Banks do not find these favorable terms
suitable and thus most tourism loans are provided out of the resources of
governmental institutions.

III. RESOURCE MOBILIZATION BY NIBID
Borrowings
3.01      Although NIBID has borrowed funds of about $107 million equivalent,
it has not yet been in a position to tap, to any significant extent, private
capital markets either in Greece or abroad. A start was made in this direc-
tion last year, however, and in the coming two years NIBID is making definite
plans for raising capital both locally and in foreign exchange.  There are
two basic reasons why NIBID has not been in a favorable position for mobiliz-
ing private capital in the market. Firsit, as noted in paragraph 2.24, the
cost of long-term credit in Greece has been lower the last two years, than
the cost of similar funds in most capitaL market centers. Given, the limits
on NIBID's relending rates in the Greek market, NIBID simply could not raise
resources in Europe or the U.S. without assuming a substantial negative
spread. Second, in Greece, while there is a bond market, it is dominated
by Government issues and the yields have been such that even though NIBID
could conceivably sell bonds, it would have to pay a rate that would leave
it little or no spread.
3.02      NIBID's first market borrowing was undertaken last year in Europe
when it raised $2.2 million equivalent in Euro-Dollars from five of its
European shareholders. The cost of this money is 1% above the London Euro-
Dollar rate. Originally the cost was 9-1/2%; currently it is 6-3/4%. These
funds are repayable over five years including one year of grace.
3.03      Given the above circumstances NIBID has depended on three lenders:
the National Bank of Greece, the Bank of Greece and the World Bank. The
National Bank has lent to NIBID because NIBID was established as its term-
financing instrument. Moreover, its loans to NIBID qualify for the Bank of
Greece term lending requirements noted in paragraph 2.14. The Bank of Greece
has lent to NIBID because of NIBID's success in raising long-term foreign
exchange resources and also because the Bank of Greece thinks that NIBID's
allocation of resources is soundly based.
3.04      A detailed statement of NIBID's borrowings is given in Annex 1.
NIBID has raised about Dr 400 million in equity, about Dr 1 billion from
NBG, Dr 1.2 billion in loans from the Bank of Greece, and Dr 1 billion
equivalent in foreign exchange loans. This totals about Dr 3.6 billion
($120 million equivalent).
3.05      The third Dr 300 million Bank of Greece loan was negotiated on
the basis that it was to be subordinate to other loans and that it would
rank pari passu with share capital in the event of liquidation.  This sub-
ordination is contingent however, on legislation being passed. NIBID is
now drawing on this loan but the subordination question is still open. Al-
though the Bank of Greece has stated that the legislation will be passed,
there are some doubts concerning this. rhis has implications for NIBID's
debt/equity ratio, which will be discussed in paras. 6.15-6.16.



-8-
3.06      At the project level, NIBID's assistance of course only covers
a portion of total project costs. Historically, NIBID's share of finan-
cing of the total capital costs of assisted projects is about one-third.
Consequently, the funds mobilized by NIBID to date have or will be used
in financing projects with total capital costs of over $350 million.
Resource Position
3.07      Local currency loans are drawn down in tranches by NIBID as
needed. As of March 31, 1971, the full amount of the first and second
loans from NBG and Bank of Greece, Dr 33.5 million under NBG current ac-
count and Dr 150 million under the third Bank of Greece loan had been drawn.
The current account with NBG was arranged by NIBID for purposes of manag-
ing its current position more economically. As of June 30, 1971, NIBID
needed to raise Dr 13 million to cover local currency commitments. It had
uncommitted foreign exchange resources of Dr 161 million equivalent.
IV. RESOURCE ALLOCATION BY NIBID
O1perations
4.01      A summary of NIBID's operations is given in Annexes 2-3.  From
NIBID's creation in early 1964 to the end of 1970, a total of 193 loans
and equity operations (involving 150 borrowers) have been approved, amount-
ing to Dr 3,170 million (US$105.6 million equivalent). 1969 approvals ac-
count for 25% of this total, and 1970 approvals for 37%.  NIBID's approvals
during 1970, totalling Dr 1.157 million (US$38.6 million equivalent), ex-
ceeded aggregate approvals during NIBID's first five years, 1964-1968, and
were 44% higher than the approvals of 1969. During the first eight months
of 1971, loans and invest3nents in the amount of Drs 730 million ($24.3
million) were approved or were submitted to the Executive Committee. Taking
into account projects under study, 1971 total approvals are likely to exceed
Dr 1,300 million (over US$90 million).
Appraisals
4.02      The quality of NIBID's appraisals remains, in most respects, satis-
factory. Applicants' projects are carefully reviewed to assure financial
viability. As the financial statements published by borrowers are quite
often inaccurate, inquiries are made directly into the books of the appli-
cants, in order to get reliable historical data. Unfortunately, the finan-
cial structure of Greek industry is, generally speaking, weak (i.e. high
debt/equity ratios), due to the fact that they are often family enterprises
with owners who are reluctant to sell shares to outsiders and also because,
for the time being at least, the banking sector is liquid and credit is
relatively easy. Being obliged to compete, NIBID cannot be too adamant on
the financial structure of its borrowers; it has to be flexible in its re-
quirements. However, NIBID is generally very conservative when making fi-
nancial forecasts and its portfolio is, as a result, sound. (See para. 5.13).



- 9 -
4.03      NIBID has not been as effective in appraising the competitive
aspects of projects financed. At the tirme the second Bank loan was negoti-
ated, it was the Bank's judgment that NIBID should focus more explicitiy on
these questions because, although Greece was (i) committed to declining
tariffs on EEC exports of manufactured goods and (ii) was trying to en-
courage exports, there was still a large number of Greek manufacturers
that would enjoy considerable protection for some time to come.  However,
NIBID has encountered difficulties in this area. First information on
int-;national prices is difficult to ascertain for many products. NIBID
tries to gather data from such sources as E.E.C. publications, its consult-
ing associate, ADL Hellas, Stanford Research Institute (which provides data
on a yearly fee basis), NBG, etc., with variable success, but this problem
remains an important obstacle. Second, as NIBID is profit-oriented and
competing for the extension of its activ:ity, NIBID must first focus on the
financial aspects of projects. NIBID's management is, however, aware of
the importance of this point, and the new Industrial Data Unit in NIBID,
created a year ago, provides some help on this to the project analysts.
It should also be pointed out that, whenever the Bank has raised competi-
tiveness questions on the projects sent to it by NIBID, such questions have
been answered or resolved satisfactorily.
4.04      The technological aspect of most of the projects financed by
NIBID is adequately handled by NIBID's two engineers. One is specialized
in civil engineering, and the other in machinery and equipment. Their
work is primarily oriented toward evaluating the adequacy and reasonable-
ness of capital costs but they are also competent for advising on machinery
selection for projects in the traditionaL fields of Greek manufactures.
4.05      NIBID has, no doubt rightly, concluded that it is not feasible
for it to develop a highly specialized engineering staff. One of its
objectives in establishing the ADL (Hellas) consulting firm (a joint venture -
30% NIBID and 70% Arthur D. Little Inc.) was to be able to turn to the
international expertise of the foreign partner for help on technical and
other questions relating to its projects. Unfortunately, ADL Helias has
not been of a great help to NIBID up to now, due to its relatively high
fees, and the difficulty to pass these fees on to borrowers. During 1970,
ADL collaboration was secured on only four projects. There are still some
projects that are beyond the technical scope of NIBID's staff, or which do
not have a highly reliable technical partner, but which are not covered by
the ADL Hellas organization and NIBID is exploring ways of reducing the
costs of ADL Hellas' services for such cLients.
4.06      Procurement.  As noted above, one of the functions of NIBID's
engineers is to check on the capital costL and procuremaat aspects of
prospects. With respect to construction costs, NIBID requires drawings
and estimates from all applicants. NIBIID evaluates the building plans and
from its own experience is in a good position to know whether projected



- 10 -
building costs are reasonable and whether the contractors selected are
competent to do the job. With respect to procurement of machinery, NIBID
requires borrowers to submit proforma invoices for its perusal. In most
cases NIBID's borrowers already have experience with machinery in the line
of work they are pursuing (in 1970, 48 of the 60 manufacturing projects
financed by NIBID were expansions or relocations of existing facilities)
and thus have, on the basis of their experience and technical requirements,
shopped abroad for equipment. In four of the 12 new manufacturing projects
financed by NIBID in 1970 (finance provided by NIBID totalling Dr 185 mil-
lion), there was substantial private direct foreign investment by large,
well known international investors and equipment selection was made on the
basis of the technical specifications of these foreign firms. Consequently,
conditions are such that there are adequate safeguards to insure appropriate
selection of equipment for NIBID financed projects on the basis of cost and
technology.
4.07      Other Aspects.  NIBID is presently equipped with a staff of 14
loan officers, organized into two sections with industry specialization,
out of which 6 have been with NIBID for less than one year. These 6 are
working as assistants to the senior officers. The new staff are expected
to be able to handle projects by themselves within 1-2 years. With this
staff, completion of appraisals takes an average of one month per two-man
team. Rejections occur mainly during the early stages of appraisal, thanks
to the extensive experience of the two division leaders, which allows them
to express their opinion early in the process. The Resident Executive Com-
mittee (which approves projects between Dr 10 million and Dr 20 million)
and the Executive Committee (projects over Dr 20 million) have never re-
jected any projects bearing a positive recommendation of the General Man-
ager. Prior to presentation to these Committees for formal approval, ap-
praisals are submitted to a Loan Committee consisting of NIBID's senior
officers and of Mr. Koutsoumaris, who used to head the Planning Bureau in
Greece and is currently employed by the Greek Association of Manufacturers.
(NIBID employs him part-time). This procedure works efficiently but has
resulted in somewhat abreviated written appraisal reports, as many details
are given orally during Loan Committee meetings. This is one reason why
some appraisal reports sent to the Bank have generated questions.
Prolect Supervision
4.08      The Follow-Up Department has 4 officers.  The Department Chief,
a former NBG officer and subsequently a senior loan officer in NIBID, is
experienced.  In 1970, 30 extensive reports and 15 short reports were made
on NIBID's clients. Extensive reports cover the main items of the borrower's
situation such as financial and commercial results, but they also give a
diagnosis of the difficulties the borrower may face.  These reports are very
valuable for follow-up purposes and also are useful on occasion for generating
new lending operations. Short follow-up reports simply contain an analysis
of the client's last financial statements. It has not yet been possible
to pay a visit each year to each customer. Up to now, the priorities for
such visits and the nature of the report to be written have been determined
jointly with the Operations Department, in order to at least cover customers



- 11 -
for whom NIBID suspects that problems may arise.  The management is confident
that by 1972 it will be possible to make at least one report each year for
each client.
4.09      Disbursement.  Concerning disbursement procedures, NIBID supplies
to the Bank the final invoices, shipping documents, etc., required for dis-
bursing Bank funds. This often proves very difficult as borrowers are
reluctant to assemble all the relevant documents after they have received
the equipment and NIBID has to send its own personnel to its borrowers to
do this. In its loan agreements with sub-borrowers NIBID establishes the
principles of disbursement against progress and a lag between the input of
sponsors' funds and NIBID funds. The project officer responsible for the
appraisal of a given project also exercises primary responsibility for
checking on disbursements. On civil works, control is exercised primarily
by personal physical checks of progress by NIBID staff. On equipment, NIBID
either requires evidence that the equipment is in the port or has actually
been installed. On rare occasions advanee payments are made to borrowers;
all such transactions require the approval of the General Manager. Final
disbursement always requires inspection of the plant and the borrower's
books, by NIBID staff. There have not been any cases where funds have been
used for other than the purposes expressed in NIBID's loan agreements and
the system as presently operated is adequate.
Features of NIBID Operations
4.10      Size.  Details on the nature oE NIBID's recent lending activities
are given in Annex 2. The average size of NIBID's operations is summarized
in the table below.
1964-67    1968    1969    1970    Total
-------------in Dr million-----------)
Average size                 13.7     21.8    17.3    16.3    16.4
Loans under Dr 16 million
As % of total number    76%        50%      70%     73%      70%
As % of total amount    34%        16%      34%     30%      30%
NIBID's policy statement (Annex 4) restricts the maximum exposure in a
single enterprise to 20% of net worth, and for this purpose the Greek
Government subordinated loan was included in net worth. As this loan does
not yet rank pari-passu with the share capital, several loans exceed the
current limit, which was Dr 70 million at the end of 1970. (i.e.: General
Cement Dr 141 million, Aluminium de Grece Dr 136 million, VOMVYX Dr 105
million).  If this loan becomes subordinated by the end of 1971, the maxi-
mum exposure limit will be Dr 160 million. If it is not subordinated, the
limit will only be Dr 100 million by the end of 1971 and Dr 120 million by
the end of 1972 and two operations (General Cement and Aluminium de Grece)
will exceed this limit. While these loans are substantially beyond the
maximum exposure limit, they are granted to very strong, creditworthy
companies and NIBID is not at excessive risk.



- 12 -
4.11      Other Features.  During the three years, 1968-1970, 94% of NIBID's
approvals were straight-fonrard loans, most of them for 10 year terms (the
legal maximum) with interest at 8.5%. The basic interest rate permitted
for investment Bank funds is 8.5%, plus a profit tied increments up to 1.5%,
to bring total yield to 10%. However, as noted previously, long-term lend-
ing in Greece has become more competitive since 1968, and only 10 loans out
of 46 in 1969, and 12 out of 71 in 1970, gave NIBID the right to this addi-
tional return, and for those that did, the increment was only 0.5%. In ad-
dition to straight loans, NIBID has also made ten debenture loans, five with
conversion features. Up to now, NIBID has exercised its conversion rights
in two cases, and the shares acquired amount to Dr 8.6 million.
4.12      The geographical distribution of NIBID's financing is shown by
the map in Annex 5. Fifty four percent of NIBID's financing has been for
projects in the Athens-Piraeus area. While this area continues to dominate
the Greek industrial scene, the financial incentives to locate elsewhere
are beginning to attract industrialists to other localities. NIBID's three
largest operations (Aluminum de Grece, Goodyear Hellas and Hellenic Owens
Glass) are all located outside Athens.
NIBID's Economic Impact
4.13      The environment in which NIBID operates is critical to an
understanding of its role and of its contribution to the growth of real
income. First, industry has grown to become a substantial part of GDP
(30%). Second, this growth has, until recently, been based on highly
protected and relatively inefficient enterprises. Third, Greece has started
on a new course and has, under the Treaty of Athens, adopted the discipline
of achieving free trade in the European Economic Community by 1974 for some
industrial products and by 1984 for all industrial products. Fourth, achiev-
ing these goals calls for modernizing and upgrading the industrial sector.
Fifth, this must be accomplished in the context of a serious shortage of
skilled labor and managerial talent. Consequently, the task at hand in the
industrial sector is not simply to create new jobs; perhaps more important
at this stage is to make industrial enterprises more efficient, thereby
enabling them to face up to market competition and to enter European markets.
If this challenge of increasing productivity is not met, the consequences
for Greek industrial workers (accounting for 25% of non-agricultural employ-
ment), and indeed for the wiole economy, will be serious.
4.14      As a result, NIBID's projects are heavily weighted toward the
expansion and modernization of existing Greek enterprises, often with
the additional input of foreign investment and know-how. Thus, in 1970
for example, NIBID approved loans of $39 million. These involved total
capital costs of about $100 million. The incremental annual sales re-
sulting from this investment will be about $110 million. The new direct
employment of these projects is about 2,500, resulting in a high invest-
ment of $39,000 per worker. However, almost all of these projects are
based on the need to reduce production costs and sales prices. The proj-
ects approved by NIBID in 1970 are expected to result in increased sales
of about Dr 3 billion, of which roughily 15% is expected to be for export
markets. It is imperative that this process continue.



- 13 -
4.15      Equity Operations.  Since its 03tablishment, in 1964, NIBID ap-
proved 15 equity operations in 13 companies for a total of Dr 172 million
representing 5.5% of its overall approval1s.  1970 approvals amounted to
Dr 98.5 million. The participation in twu companies, Titan Cement and
Aluminum de Grece, of an outstanding ato'  of Dr 95 million, account for
57% of the total equity portfolio. The largest equity investment in a
single company was Dr 55 million and the smallest Dr 1 million. The rela-
tively low volume of equity operations is in part explained by a disinclina-
tion of closely controlled family companies to accept outside shareholders.
On NIBID's part also, there has been relictance to invest in equity in
family held firms where minority shareholders run heavy risks.  But, NIBID
actively continues to seek opportunities for prudent equity investments.
V. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Board and Executive Committee
5.01      There has been no change in NI'BID's ownership (Annex 6).  NBG holds
55% of the shares; the balance is held by 13 foreign banks and IFC. Follow-
ing a recent new shareholder's Agreement (Para 5.08), the composition of
NIBID's Board of Directors has been amended on June 30, 1971. (Annex 7).
Since the establishment of NIBID, the Governor of NBG has been Chairman of
NIBID's Board. The present Chairman is Mr. Christos Achis, who replaced
Mr. Cominos as Governor of NBG in January 1971. Mr. Harold F. Linder is
IFC's representative.
5.02      Full Board meetings are held tNice a year and normally deal with
general matters. The responsibilities of the Board, as far as project
approvals are concerned, have been delegated to an Executive Committee
consisting of 6 members plus NIBID's Managing Director, without vote. Com-
position of the Executive Committee is given in Annex 7. Three members with
vote are elected by NBG, and the other three by the foreign shareholders.
The IFC Director is a permanent member. The Executive Committee, which has
been meeting in Athens about twice each year, has, in turn, delegated to
its members resident in Greece the authority to approve investments between
Dr 10 million and Dr 20 million. Projects requiring an amount exceeding
this limit are circulated to the Executive Committee by mail for approval.
The Managing Director may approve projects under Dr 10 million.
5.03      The bulk of the review by the full Executive Committee is still
done by mail, and the foreign members circulate among themselves comments
or questions raised on projects. The Board receives a quarterly report
covering all operations approved, projects under consideration, new ap-
plications, cancelled proposals and a statem,ent of NIBID's financial con-
dition. These reports are also sent to the Bank.
Management and Staff
5.04      NIBID's Managing Director, Mr. Georges Gondicas, continues as the
operating head of the con.anv. He is capable and experienced and has been
the motive force behind .gLiWs development.  He has been able to maintain
a satisfactory working relationship witb NBG as well as with other persons
of standing in the financial coammunity and in industrial circles in Greece.



- 14 -
5.05      Of NIBID's 37 professional staff, 15 are in the Operations
Department which has the primary responsibility for the evaluation and
negotiation of investments and loans. Projects are allocated to the two
Groups within this department according to industrial sectors, each having
built up a certain expertise on a specific range of industries. They
receive some help from the new Industrial Data Unit, which is in charge
of collecting statistics and studies from specialized foreign institutes,
and which is to carry out general industry studies. NIBID has hired, as
an adviser to run this unit, a man with both an economic background and
industrial experience. He advises NIBID on general questions and also
deals with the problems of competitiveness of NIBID's clients and other
general economic qtuestions. The follow-up department consists now of 4
-jrofessionals.  The main problem; for this department was NIBID's management
nclination to use it as additional manpower for appraisal business.  For
legal matters NIBID's counsel is assisted by four lawyers. Almost all of
NMBID's legal work is done in-house.  NIBID's technical Advisor is assisted
by another full-time engineer, who deals with civil work.  All in all, NIBID's
staff has developed favorably both in magnitude and competence. Turnover is
low and NIBID's employees exhibit an unusual degree of dedication to their
work, and to NIBID. An organization list is given in Annex 8.
5.06      As NIBID has experienced rapid growth in its business and staff,
it is now faced with some problems of procedures and coordination. Up to
now there are few written instructions on operational procedures.  Similarly,
some aspects of NIBID's organizational set-up are unclear. The only link
between departments is the General Manager, who has to coordinate all ac-
tivities. Mr. Gondicas considers this to be one of NIBID's main current
problems and he intends to improve internal coordination, in order to free
h4m further from the day-to-day business. Nevertheless, NIBID is still
small enough so that internal coordination is relatively easy. The internal
reporting system, for example, is quite simple, but it is adequate to keep
k.y people informed of what they need to know about the status of operations.
Borrowers' Attitudes Toward NIBID
5.07      NIBID's approach to financing problems has been recognized by
its clients, and other financial institutions, as progressive and helpful,
despite the fact that its criteria sometimes are strict by comparison with
traditional Greek financing habits. NIBID's management and staff are rec-
ognized as capable and business-oriented. Although NIBID continues to have
close relationships with NBC, it is now recognized as an important entity
in its own right. NIBID's strengthening position is confirmed by its in-
creasing share of industrial financing in Greece and also by the number of
second or third loans given to clients.

Shareholder's Agreement
5.08      The First Shareholders' Agreement, which governs such things as
the composition of the Board, voting requirements, etc., expired July 1971.
A Consultative Shareholders Meeting was held in Athens, on April 5-6, 1971,
in order to discuss the revision of this Agreement. Agreement was reached,
and a new Shareholders' Agreement has been formally adopted. Concurrently,
certain changes in NIBID's Articles of Association were agreed. The main
features of the new Shareholders' Agreement are:
a.   The Board consists of 20 members (formerly 18), of which 11,
including the Managing Director, are appointed by NBG.
b.   A vote of 70% (i.e. 14 out of 19, since the Managing Director
will not vote on this question) of the Board is required to
hire or discharge the Managing Director.
c.   A vote of 70% of the shareholders will be required for impor-
tant matters such as to allow a merger, to increase or de-
crease voting shares to sell bonds, etc.
d.   The Executive Committee has 6 members, three nominated by
NBG, 1 by IFC, 1 by the American shareholders and 1 by the
European shareholders.
e.   The Board will delegate all its powers, to the extent per-
mitted by law, to the Executive Committee. In case of a tie
vote in the Committee the matter goes to the Board, where 14
out of 20 votes are required for passage.
f.   Concerning the Articles of Association, although the Chairman
"exercises the highest executive authority in the Bank and
supervises its operations in general", the Managing Director's
authority will be derived from the Board rather than by delega-
tion from the Chairman. The Managing Director is the "principal
operating officer", who "directs the bank's operations, super-
vises and controls their conduct ... and appoints and dismisses
the bank's employees'.
5.09     lWhile there is a somewhat greater recognition of the rights of
the majority shareholder in the new Agreement relative to the First Agree-
ment, the minority continues to be well protected. In addition, the
Managing Director's position and independence are strengthened.
Income, Expenses and Profitability
5.10      Income statements for NIBID's first seven years, 1964-1970, are
given in Annex 9. Earnings before provisions and tax have increased about
75% in the three years between 1968 and 1970, and were equivalent to 14%
of the share capital in 1970, compared with 10% in 1969 and 8% in 1968.
Under the Greek tax law, investment banks are allowed to set aside each



- 16 -
year an amount of up to 2% of average portfolio for a provision against
possible losses. This is a tax deductible item. To reduce its tax lia-
bility, NIBID has charged the full amount of this provision against income
since 1965, but claims, with justification, the amount exceeds a prudent
requirement for possible losses. In order to derive actual net profits,
the annual provision for doubtful loans and investments has been calculated
in the Annexes in such a way that the year-end cumulative total provision
is equal to 2% of the year-end portfolio, the remaining portion being con-
sidered earnings and charged as an appropriation of profit. On this basis,
NIBID's net profits for 1969 and 1970 were Dr 21.4 million and Dr 25.9 mil-
lion respectively. The returns on net worth were 6.4% in 1969 and 7.5% in
1970, and returns on share capital were 7.2% in 1969 and 8.6% in 1970. The
rather low returns were due to the fact that NIBID operates on a narrow
spread and leverage is still relatively low.
5.11      The average yield from NIBID's loan portfolio is approximately
8.5%. The return on its equity portfolio was approximately 3.3% in 1970.
NIBID's borrowed funds, at the end of 1970, cost an average of 5.4%.
Administrative costs have fallen in relation to average total assets (from
1.2% in 1965 to 0.8% in 1970). NIBID operates, therefore, on a gross
spread of only about 3% and its profitability cannot yet be considered
attractive. NIBID's paid its first dividend of 2% in 1968 out of 1967
earnings. A 3% dividend was paid in 1969 against 1968 earnings and a 4%
dividend in 1970 against 1969 earnings. The dividend rate was 5% for 1970.
The pay-out ratio was 42% in 1968, 38% in 1969 and 59% in 1970. NIBID pays
little or no corporate tax; distributed profits are subject to tax in the
hands of the recipients and provisions are tax free. Some notes on NIBID's
tax position and its 1970 year-end accounts are given in Annex 10.
Financial Position
5.12      Balance Sheets from NIBID's operations since 1964 are given in
Annex 11. During 1970, NIBID's loan and equity portfolio grew by 73%,
compared with the increase of 63% in 1969 and 25% in 1968. The disburse-
ment rate, in 1970, was 98% of commitments and 79% of net approvals,
compared with 98% and 61% in 1969. Total disbursements under the first
IBRD loan amounted to $10.6 million and $10.1 million for the second as
of August 31, 1971. The ratio of total long-term borrowing to net worth
at the end of 1970 was 4.2:1 as against a 5:1 limit specified in the last
Bank Loan Agreement. As the Greek Government loan is not yet subordinated,
the amount drawn down by NIBID is included in long-term borrowing. NIBID's
liquid funds, which decreased by Dr 60 million in 1970, are mostly invested
in 6%, tax free, Treasury Bills.
5.13      Quality of Loan Portfolio.  Principal and interest in arrears
(over 30 days) at December 31, 1970, aggregated approximately Dr 9.9 mil-
lion. They relate to 16 loans whose outstanding principal amounts to
Dr 126 million, corresponding to 7% of loan portfolio. A total amount of
Dr 2.7 million from nine deliquent borrowers had been collected during the
first two months of 1971. Among the 16 borrowers in arrears as of December
31, 1970, only five (outstanding principal of Dr 62.6 million or 3.5% of



- 17 -
portfolio) are experiencing real financial difficulties. Two are hotels
in Rhodes, which had a very poor tourist season in 1968, but for which the
present situation is much better; they will be able to meet their obliga-
tions with some moderate rescheduling of payments. The figure is somewhat
higher on August 31, 1971: Dr 9.6 million of principal and Dr 2.1 million
of interests in arrears over 30 days, but 45% of principal in arrears relates
to a brewery for which NIBID has very good securities. NIBID is watching each
case closely and, since all loans are well secured by mortgages, there
are no projects in arrears in which NIBID seems likely to suffer any losses.
In the circumstance, NIBID's loan portfolico can be characterized as sound;
provisions of Dr 35 million are adequate. No adverse changes affected
NIBID's loan portfolio up to June 30, 1971.
5.14      Quality of Equity Portfolio.  A statement of NIBID's equity
portfolio is given in Annex 12. As of December 31, 1970, this equity
portfolio consists of shares of 13 companies; its acquisition value was
Dr 167 million (less Dr 19 million not yet disbursed). Two investments,
Titan Cement and Aluminium de Grece, respectively Dr 39.5 million and
Dr 55.5 million, account for 57% of the total portfolio.  The shares of
two companies, ETKA Rayon Manufacturing Co., and Keramiki-Cedit Ceramics
Co. were partially acquired as a result of NIBID's exercising conversion
rights. Nine of the thirteen companies have been profitable and, of
those, seven have been distributing dividends. Two companies are just
starting up or are under construction and two others are not yet profitable.
NIBID's share in the 1969 profits of companies in which it holds shares
amounted to Dr 34.1 million, which means that the overall cost of the equity
portfolio (Dr 167 million) is 4.9 times NIBID's share of net earnings.
Two shares (Titan Cement and ETMA) are quoited on the Athens Stock Exchange;
their market value, calculated at average price for the fifteen days pre-
ceding December 31, 1970 amounted to Dr 143.3 million as against an
acquisition value of Dr 47.8 million. Although NIBID is arranging to
seLl some of these shares, the thinness of the market indicates that this
must be done with restraint, in order not to drive prices down.
5.15      Dividends received by NIBID in 1970 amounted to Dr 3.6 million,
which represents 5.6% of the acquisition price of the 1969 year-end port-
folio. At December 31, 1970 the aggregated market value, for quoted stocks,
and book value, for unquoted stock, of NIBID's equity portfolio was approx-
imately 161% of acquisition price. The general quality of the equity port-
folio is good. Dividend yields on it are still low, and profits are likely
to come more through sales of shares than through dividend payments.
VI. NIBID'S FUTURE OPERATIONS
Proj ected Operations
6.01      As noted in paragraph 2.06, gross manufacturing investment in
1970 is estimated to be about $275 million equivalent. NIBID's disburse-
ments to the manufacturing sector in 1970 were about $30 million equivalent,
4.e. NIBID's share of the total was about 10%. Given the period of expan-



- 18 -
sionary activity Greece is enjoying, it is estimated conservatively that
manufacturing investment should increase at over 10% p.a. for at least
the coming two years. Consequently, it is not unreasonable to forecast
that NIBID's operations should, both on an approval basis and on a dis-
bursement basis, grow at about this rate, assuming NIBID can raise the
required resources.
6.02      The level of operations forecast by NIBID on the above basis, is
given in Annex 13; it is summarized below (Dr millions):
1970    1971    1972    1973    1974    1975
(Actual)
Total approvals  1,157   1,300   1,450   1,600   1,750   1,900
Increase over
previous year    43%   11.4%       11%      10%      9%       8%
The percentage increase is conservative if compared with the previous
years (43% in 1970 and 54% in 1969).  Given the impressive increase of
NIBID's business so far, the prospects for continued expansion of industry
and tourism in Greece, and a sizeable pipeline of active projects, NIBID's
targets are realistic.
6.03      As to the composition of future business between equity and loan
approvals, NIBID hopes that equity operations will become more important
as Greece's industrial base and capital market grow and expand. In absolute
terms, NIBID expects its equity approvals to be at an annual level of about
Dr 100 million a year.
6.04      Foreign Exchange Component.  Slightly more than 50% of the cost
of the projects financed is to foreign procurement. As there is no great
change forecast for the structure of new Greek industry to be established,
this proportion is likely to hold true for the next few years. Assuming
that the breakdown between local and foreign currency financing by NIBID
should be in the same proportion as that of the similar breakdown for the
total capital costs of projects financed, NIBID's foreign exchange needs
would be 50% of total approvals. In fact, given the convertibility of the
Drachma for capital goods import by industrial investors, NIBID's local
currency funds are often converted by borrowers into foreign exchange to
finance capital goods imports. In others words, while it is useful to
try to estimate NIBID's foreign exchange gap, the over-riding question
is really NIBID's overall capital gap.
Projected Financing
6.05      As stated above, NIBID's resource position as of December 31, 1970,
shows uncommitted domestic resources of Dr 247 million and uncommitted foreign
exchange resources of Dr 237 million, i.e. a total of Dr 484 million. With
internal cash generation up to the end of June 1971 of Dr 27 million, the



- 19 -
total available, Dr 511 million, has been enough to cover, on an approval
basis, NIBID's needs up through June 30, 1971. Approvals in the last half
of the year are likely to be much higher than in the first half, which would
confirm to actual experience in earlier years. For the following two years,
up to June 30, 1973, approvals will amount to Dr 3,040 million.
6.06      In broad terms, therefore, NIBID is looking for about $100 mil-
lion in new funds over the next two years, a very ambitious target. NIBID
realizes that it cannot depend on its traditional creditors (NBG, Bank of
Greece, World Bank) for funds of this magnitude. It also realizes that
an enlarged equity base is needed for its rapidly expanding indebtedness.
Finally, it is clear that in present market conditions a straight bond
issue by NIBID would yield no positive spretad and might in fact entail
losses.  Given these constraints, NIBID's proposed strategy is as follows:
a.   A 50% increase in share capital by existing shareholders.  This
would yield Dr 150 million (see para 6.10).
b.   Small issues to the public in 1971 and 1972 of non-voting,
probably participating preferred, stock. This would be listed
and thus a market would be established in non-voting NIBID
stock. NIBID thinks that, given its developing equity protfolio,
its general prospects, and the state of the Greek market, such
issues would be successful. The terms of the issues have yet
to be finally set. Over the two-year period, the estimated
issues would total Dr 65 million..
C.   Following b, NIBID would issue bonds, partially convertible
into non-voting stock. It is hoped that the conversion
feature would reduce the coupon rate to a level where NIBID
could earn a spread of 1.5%-2%. Commencing in 1972, NIBID
estimates that these issues could raise about Dr 300 million
up to June 1973.
d.   Internal cash generation will nel: about Dr 150 million over
this period.
6.07      This is NIBID's strategy for starting directly to tap the local
capital market for funds. It is a creative plan. It hinges on the attrac-
tiveness of NIBID shares to local investors. This in turn ultimately rests
on future earnings, discussed below.
6.08      The above resources total Dr 665 million, leaving a balance of
Dr 2,375 million. NIBID hopes to cover th:Ls partially by borrowings of
about Dr 300 million p.a. from NBG and a l:lke amount from the Bank of
Greece.  This would reduce the gap to about Dr 1,175 million or in round
figures to $40 million equivalent.



- 20 -
6.09      NIBID would like to raise this $40 million abroad.  Indeed, its
ability to mobilize resources from the Bank of Greece is related, at least
notionally, to the amount of long-term foreign exchange it can mobilize.
To this end, NIBID has entered into discussions for a loan from a group
of European banks. Preliminary indications are that this loan would be
for 7-10 years, would be untied, and would cost NIBID close to 8%. NIBID
is discussing with the Bank of Greece arrangements whereby Bank of Greece
loans could be made at an interest rate that, when averaged with these
European funds, would result in an average cost to NIBID for the combined
funds of about 6.5%. NIBID is also seeking foreign exchange risk coverage
from the Bank of Greece on such funds. The amount being discussed is $10-
$15 million. The latter figure would reduce NIBID's ultimate gap to $25
million equivalent; the former would leave a gap of $30 million equivalent.
All things considered, a Bank loan of $25 million is appropriate. This
magnitude of Bank lending would amount to about 25% of NIBID's total re-
source needs and would be well within the gross foreign exchange component
of NIBID's lending. This loan would be used over a 2 years period ending
June 30, 1973, at which time NIBID would require additional funding.
Capital Increase
6.10      In order to meet its need of resources and to support its in-
creased indebtedness, NIBID, as noted above, is planning a capital increase.
The general proposition was first raised during the Executive Committee of
November 1970, and NIBID formulated its proposal on June 19, 1971. NIBID
requests its shareholders to participate in a 50% capital increase, through
a rights issue at par of preferred non-voting shares. These shares would
entitle their holders to a 6% first dividend which would be increased to
equal the dividend paid out to the common shares, if the latter exceeds 6%.
The issue will be paid in two stages, the first taking place by the end of
1971, and the second six months later.
6.11      The reason for non-voting shares is to give some additional
liquidity to existing shareholders. While under the new Shareholders Agree-
ment the restrictions on the sale of voting shares are less than they used
to be, there are still restrictions on sales to insure that any new owner
of voting shares is acceptable to the majority of the existing shareholders.
Because of this, and because NIBID hopes to see a market develop for its
non-voting stock, the foreign shareholders felt that any increase in their
investment in NIBID shares should be in as marketable, and therefore liquid,
a form as possible, i.e. non-voting stock.
6.12      According to a decision of the Currency Committee dated June 3,
1971, the foreign holders of the proposed issue will enjoy the following
privileges:
a.   free transferability of dividends up to 12% each year on the
capital to be invested.



- 21 -
b.   free transferability, after not letss than three years from the
date of importation of funds, of the proceeds from the sales
of the new shares, together with capital gains, at a rate of
20% p.a. of the total investment. This allows the foreign
shareholders to repatriate their investment and the capital
gains over a period of eight yearsi. I/
Projected Capital Structure
6.13      Projected balance sheets through 1975 are shown in Annex 11.  As
a result of the projected business, total assets, which increased 60% in
1970, will increase 50% in 1971, 30% in 1972, and 25% in 1973. At that
time NIBID's assets will have reached US$180 million equivalent. The
development of NIBID's debt/equity relationships are shown in the following
table. "'A" shows the ratio of all long-term debt to equity, the latter
including excess provisions. This shows the real leverage of NIBID. "B"
shows the ratio of senior debt to all subordinated debt and equity. This
shows the actual exposure of senior creditors. "C" shows the ratio as
presently defined in the Loan Agreement, i.e., equity include the maturities
of the subordinated loans that fall beyond the last maturity of the
proposed Bank loan. (About 50% of the Dr 300 million subordinated loan
qualifies as "equity" on this basis in view of the fact that sub-loans
will probably have a maturity of no more than 10 years.)
1970    1971    1972    1973    1974    1975
A.  All debt to equity       4.6:1   5.2:1   6.0:1   7.0:1   7.6:1   7.8:1
B. Senior debt to equity
plus all junior debt   3.0:1   2.9:1   3.7:1   4.5:1   5.2:1   5.6:1
C.  Present Bank definition 3.0:1   3.8:1   4.6:1   5.5:1   6.2:1   6.5:1
6.14      As noted earlier, the subordination of the Bank of Greece Dr 300
million loan is not yet effective, although the Governor of the Bank of
Greece has given assurances that these provisions will be finalized. NIBID's
management reported that, while there was no problem about subordinating
the loan to other creditors, the delays have arisen over making the loan
rank pari passu with share capital.
6.15      The alternatives for approaching the debt/equity covenant are:
a.   To take into account the fact that, under the Bank's present
practice of not including in the borrowing base the subordi-
nated loan maturities due prior to the last maturity of
Bank loans, all of NIBID's subordinated loan would suddenly be
1/   Under normal regulations, capital gain; are not transferable without
special permission, and capital can only be exported at the rate of
10% p.a.



- 22 -
ineligible for inclusion in the borrowing base in two years'
time. This would suggest that what NIBID and the Bank should
now focus on is the total debt/equity ratio (line "A" above),
thereby avoiding a potential problem two years from now when
NIBID might either have to reduce its debt or take action to
increase equity above what its already ambitious plans on this
score provide for, in order to remain within the agreed ratio.
b.   To say that, in terms of the Bank's exposure or risk, sub-
ordination to other debt would be adequate to qualify this
loan for inclusion in the borrowing base. This is satisfac-
tory from the financial risk point of view of senior creditors.
Line "B" above denotes this position, assuming all the Dr 300
million subordinated loan is included in the borrowing base.
C.   To continue with the present definition of "debt" and "equity",
i.e. to insist that inclusion of any part of the subordinated
loan in NIBID's borrowing base requires not only that it be
subordinate to senior debt but also that it rank pari passu
xwith share capital. This is consistent with the Bank's past
approach with NIBID. This corresponds to line "C" above.
6.16      Alternative a is the most farseeing approach, irrespective of
Government's final action on the subordinated loan. Even if the original
degree of subordination intended for the Bank of Greece loan is achieved,
attention must be given now to the real leverage position 2-3 years hence
in order to avoid a situation where NIBID would be asked to reduce actual
leverage when the point is reached where none of the subordinated loan
qualifies as "equity". As to the ratio, a total debt/equity ratio of
7.0:1 is not excessive given NIBID's performance and portfolio quality.
First, provisions more than amply cover possible losses. NIBID has not had
any write-offs to date and its loans are well secured. Second, its equity
portfolio contains substantial hidden reserves. Third fixed interest charges
throughout the forecast period are covered by projected income 1.4-1.5 times.
Earnings before provision and taxes plus projected loan collections cover
principal repayment obligations 1.4 times during the forecast period and
the liquidity of the institution remains fairly strong. From the Bank's
narrow point of view as a creditor, the real exposure in a liquidation
situation would not be the 7:1 ratio but the ratio of senior debt to junior
resources, which will be 4.5:1 at the point the total debt/equity position
is 7:1.
Projected Earnings
6.17      Forecast income statements are given in Annex 9; they indicate
a moderate increase in profitability. Net profits on average net worth
in 1973 will be 10.2% (equivalent to 12.4% on paid-in share capital). The
same ratios in 1970 were 7.4% and 8.6% respectively. It is likely that
the forecast earnings are under-stated in that the average yield fore-
cast on NIBID's equity portfolio is only 4%. This is about one half of



- 23 -
the projected gross income on assets employed. While it is exceedingly
difficult to forecast equity yields (dividends and capital gains), NIBID
will soon reach the point where its equity portfolio should perform, on
average, better than its loan portfolio. If an adjustment were made to
reflect an 8% equity yield for example, the net return in 1973 would be
12.4% on average net worth and 15% on share capital. Administrative costs
are forecast to increase 20% p.a., which is reasonable. As a proportion
of average total assets they decline from 0.9% (1970) to 0.5% (1973). In-
terest costs as a percentage of average assets will increase from 4.6%
(1970) to almost 6% in 1973 as the amount of borrowed funds, and their
cost, increase. All of these statements reflect an adjustment of NIBID's
provisions (see para. 5.11). Dividends are forecast at 6% p.a. This re-
sults in about a 50% payout of earnings.
6.18      The keys to NIBID improving its return on equity are:  (i) in-
creasing leverage and (ii) the returns it is able to get on its equity
acquisitions. While the forecasts show an improving profit position, the
picture is for a moderate return on net worth, i.e. about 12.5% in 1973.
If NIBID is able to continue to increase its portfolio of profitable
equities, the results could be better.
Other Aspects of NIBID's Future Operations
6.19      Mutual Fund.  Several years ago NIBID commissioned a study on the
Greek capital market. From this study emerged the idea of establishing
mutual funds or unit trusts, open- or closed-end, in Greece. Subsequently,
NIBID invited an international financial institution, that had experience
in this field, to prepare a proposal for the establishment of a mutual fund,
including draft legislation for such a fund. This legislation has now
been passed and although there are no firm proposals on this at present,
NIBID is having discussions with potential partners about such an opera-
tion. If NIBID does embark on this project, care will be taken to insure
that NIBID's relationship is arms-length with the fund in order to elimi-
nate potential conflicts of interest. The major hurdle such a fund would
encounter would be securing an adequate supply of acceptable equity in-
vestments.
6.20      Shipping  NIBID has made a few shipping loans, but these have
been rare. Given the expansion of ship building and ship conversion
activity in Greece, NIBID is giving some thought to how it might play a
role in mobilizing resources to finance the construction and purchase of
ships.  This is at present an idea to which NIBID's management is giving
seriouE thought.

VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      NIBID continues to be a creditworthy borrower.  It has further
strengthened its capabilities since the last Bank loan was approved. It
is on the verge of broadening its resource base by attempting to tap
local and foreign private capital markets. NIBID could effectively utilize
$25 million in Bank funds to help cover its operations in the two-year pe-
riod June 30, 1971 to June 30, 1973.
7.02      Under the last loan, NIBID's free limit was Dr 15 million
($500,000) irrespective of the proportion of Bank funds involved in a
project. The aggregate free limit was 25% of the loan. In view of the
continued interest in strengthening NIBID's analysis of the competitive
aspects of the projects financed, it is recommended that this free limit
be retained for the proposed loan.
7.03      Concerning the debt limitation to be observed by NIBID, it is
recommended that NIBID be limited to an overall debt/equity ratio of
7:1. "Debt" would include all of NIBID's borrowings with an original
maturity of one year or more. "Equity" would be adjusted, as is now the
case, to include excess provisions for losses, that have been made for
tax reasons.
7.04      The proposed loan should be limited to direct foreign exchange
procurement and should, in other respects, conform to the normal conditions
applied to DFC loans, including the standard commitment charges. As the
Bank of Greece will continue to cover the exchange risk for NIBID on its
indebtedness to the Bank, it was agreed in negotiations that NIBID would
repay the proposed loan according to a fixed schedule. Given the fairly
narrow range of maturities NIBID extends on its loans, a fixed amortization
schedule has been established that would mirrors quite realistically the
actual composite repayment of funds by subborrowers involved, namely over
ten years including a grace period of two years which conforms to NIBID's
actual experience.

finance for the establishment of new productive enterprises as
well as for the modernization and expansion of existing ones,
all in the private sector.
(2) Development of the capital market in Greece, by underwriting
and distributing issues of shares and bonds and by distribut-
ing its own investments when they mature.
(3) Facilitating contracts and joint ventures of Greek and
foreign enterpreneurs to Dromote the participation of foreign

TI. Scope and Nature of Operation
A.   Eligible Enterprises and Projects
(1) Financing is made available only for orojects which will
contribute to the economic growth of the country.
(2)  Financing is restricted to Drivate enterprises.  The exist-
ence of a minority governmental or semi-governmental uartici-
pation will not necessarily preclude an enterprise from being
assisted by the Sank provided such oarticination does not
result in effective control of such enterprise.
(3)  Financing will be provided for the establishment of new enter-
nrises, as well as for the expansion and improvement of exist-
inri ones.

3.   Investment Policy
(1)  Projects of the enterprises requesting financing will be
considered on the basis of their economic, technical and
financial merits and on the soundness of the management.
(2)  Projects to be financed will refer to needs of capital for
fixed assets and working capital of a permanent nature.
The Sank will not finance working capital by means of short-
term loans.
(3)  The 3ank -orovides finance according to the suitability of
each project in the form of:
(a) direct long-term or medium-term loans with a duration
not less that 5 years;
(b)  loans participating in profits and loans with equity
features;
(c) direct equity investments;
(d) guarantees;
(e) underwriting of opublic issues.
(L) In examining projects the B5ank will consider whether the
size of its financing constitutes a reasonable nroDortion
of- the total financing requirement of the project and
whether the f'orm of the financing from all sources will
result in a sound capita-L structure of the enterprise.
(5)  Since the '3ank is a finanicial institution, its object is to
finance productive enterprises, not to manage them.  However,
when the 3ank considers it necessary, it may be represented
in the _oard of Directors of the enterDrise :oncerned.
(6)  The Bank is not seeking a controlling interest with any
enterprise it finances but will leave the management and
control in the hands of -the entrepreneurs, except in
special circumstances as those connected with an under-
writing or the necessity of safe-guarding and in-vestment
already made.
C.   Develooment of the Canital Market
(1)  The Bank will try to rotate its investment oortfolio to a
reasonable extent.
Aiming at the develop,ment of the capital market in GTreece
and as a means of broadening direc-t oarticipation of private
savings in economic development the Bank will underwrite and
distrioute issues of shares and bonds nf its ^Lients end sell
its owwn investments wholly or certain oercentages of it, to



ATI]NEX 4
- 30 -                       Page 3
other Drivate investors whenever it can do so on satisfactory
terms, having due regard not only to its own interest but also
to the interest of other participants in the investment sold, as
well as to the steady and sound growth of the Stock Exchange.
(2)  The Sank, in its endeavor to exnand the domestic caDital market,
will promote public Darticipation in investment through the
issuing of its own bonds.
III. Other Assistance to the Enterprises
(1) The operation of the 3ank will not be limited exclusively to
the granting of financial assistance. It will also advise its
clients, when necessary, on the solution of their economic and
financial problems, thus increasing its contribution to the
Greek economy and safeguarding recovery of its own investments.
(2)  In connection with the above, the Sank will supply technical,
financial and organizational assistance to enterDrises of any
nature for the establishment, organization and operation
thereof.
I7. Financial Prudence
A.   Security for Loans and Guarantees
(1) The 3ank, in making financings through loans or guarantees,
will, where necessary, seek adequate security or guarantees.
However, recognizing the limitations of conventional security
as a safeguard in industrial investment and recognizing also
that the prestige of the 3ank and its shareholders are bound
up in the success of the venture, the Sank will place primary
emphasis in reaching its judgments, not on the adequacy of the
security available, but on the prospective Drofitability of the
enterprise to cover repayments and making profits.
3.   Diversification of Risks - Limits
(1) Financing will be diversified as far as possible regarding the
types of industries and their ownership.
(2) Commitments for equity participation to any single enterorise
will be limited to a sum not exceeding 20- of the 3ank's share
capital and surplus accounts.  Total commitments to any single
enterprise will not exceed 20% of the Bank's share capital and
surplus accounts. For the purpose of this paragraph, the
Dr 300,000,000 3ank of Greece loan to NIBID subordinated to
other debts and ranking pari-passu with the 9ank's equity shall
be deemed to be part of the Sank's share capital.
(3) Overall equity investments of the 3ank will be limited to 100'-,
of its unimpaired equity (paid-in capital and surplus accounts).



ANNEX 4
- 31 -                      PageL
(4) In case that, by incurring external debt, the 3ank must assume
a foreign exchange risk, it will pass the risk on to its ultimate
borrowers or find other suitable means to cover it.
C.   3orrowing by the Bank
(1)  The 3ank, whenever it considers it necessary to broaden its own
facilities for operations, will accept term deposits or obtain
funds locally or abroad by the issue of bond loans and by enter-
ing into loan agreements. In this connection, the Bank will
follow a prudent policy as far as debt acquisition is concerned.
Total debt will not exceed five times the amount of the 3ank's
capital and surplus accounts (including reserve provisions for
bad debts exceeding 2;o of portfolio). For the purpose of this
paragraph the maturities of the Dr 300,000,000 Rank of Greece
loan to the 3ank, subordinated to other debts and ranking pai-
nassu with the Bank's equity, that mature after the last
maturity of any loan obtained by the Bank from the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, shall be deemed to be
part of the Bank's capital.
(2) The Bank will arrange its borrowings so as to maintain proDer
relationship between the duration of its liabilities and the
duration of its assets, in order to safeguard its liquidity.
D.   Profitability of Operations
(1) Operating costs of the Bank will be left to a minimum consistent
with its purpose and the scope of its operations.
(2) The Sank will levy charges for its financings and services suf-
ficient to earn profits which yield a satisfactory return on its
investment and will provide for reserves consistent with sound
financial practice.
In providing assistance to enterprises requiring advice in the
formation, execution and operation of their projects, the Bank may
charge its customers with the cost of such services.
E.   Reserves and Dividend Policy
(1)  In determining its dividends the 3ank will give precedence to
the establishment of adeiquate reserves, following a prudent
reserve policy.
h. Audit
(1) The accounting supervision of the Bank's operations will be the
resnonsibility of the official Auditors appointed at the Ordinary
General Meeting.  The arnual audit of the Bank's accounts will be
made by qualified and independent auditors.



ANNEX 4
-32 -                        Page
J.  Procedures and Organization
(1) The Bank will endeavor to have an efficient and balanced internal
organization and staff which should be adequate to make the nec-
essary appraisal of investment proposals, to assist its clients
in the formulation and conduct of their projects and to follow
closely the operations of the enterprises it finances, in order
thereby to safeguard its own investments and to protect the
interest of outside investors.
(2) When it is more economical to do so, the Bank will use the
services of outside organizations rather than build up an expen-
sive staff of specialists and technical personnel.
(3)  The General Manager will prepare periodically for its Board of
Directors brief reports covering the progress of the 3ank's ac-
tivities and its financial position.

Tax Position of NITID
Corporate Tax
1.        Corporate income in Greece is taxed at one level only.  Conse-
quently, dividends, when distributed, are taxed only in the hands of the re-
cipients and are not subject to corporate tax. NIIBID is accordingly liable
to income tax on income retained after distribution of dividends. This is
taxed at a rate of 35% plus a 15% surtax on income in favor of the Agricul-
tural Insurance Institution, making a total rate of 40.25,O.  Dividend income
is subject to 38, withholding tax (30% on listed securities). Straight bond
loan interest is subject to 25% withholding tax. The amounts withheld are
taken as a tax credit.
Taxable Income
2.        Under the law 396/68, investment banks are allowed to set aside
each year an amount of up to 2% of average portfolio for a provision against
possible losses, a tax deductible item.
3.        Under the law 1h8/67, an amount equivalent to the face value of
stock dividends received during the year can be credited to a soecial reserve
called "Special Reserve Law 148/67". The same amount is charged to the stock
portfolio on the asset side of the balance sheet. These stock dividends are
not considered as income, do not appear in the arofit and loss account, and
are not taXable, if credited to this reserve.
4.        Under the law 232/69, capital gains from the sale of stocks, in-
cluded in the profit and loss account, are exempted from taxation if allocated
to the above reserve. Eventual capital losses are to be written off against
the same reserve. Capital gains may later be distributed as cash dividends or
bonus shares, but these di5tributions are then subject to withholding tax. If
a bonus issue is distributed out of "free" reserves, that have been taxed, it
is not taxable.
5.        Interest received from deposits in commercial banks, Greek Govern-
ment Treasury 3ills, Government loans and "3746' bonds (debentures) are tax
free. When part of a compTany's income is tax free the proportion of the total
operating costs which cnn be charged against the taxable income is determined
by the Droportion of taxable to tax free income.
O.        To date, with the benefit of the above deductions, N.I3ID has not
incurred a tax liability. However, on the basis of Droportional allocation
of expenses, 1Y65 to 1967 income would have been subject to about Dr 3.8
million tax. NI3ID has made a submission to the tax authorities indicating
that for 1965 to 1967 most of its expenses incurred were in the generation
of its taxable income, and therefore should be allowed as a deduction from
that income. A favorable ruling has been given by the Court, but the final
decision is still pending an official audit of NI3ID. Notwithstanding, a
provision was set up in 1967 to cover this risk.



ANNEX 10
- 39                       Page 2
Turnover Tax and Stamp Duty
7.        Gross income is subject to turnover tax at 3.6% and stamp duty at
1.2%. Interest from Treasury Bills and U137h6: bonds are, however, exempt
from these levies. Both turnover tax and stamp duty on interest on NIBID's
loans are passed on to its clients and are not indicated in NI3IDfs earnings
statement, but oni income on bond loans, bank deposits, dividends, fees and
commission, NI3ID bears the taxes.
Export Rebate
8.        Interest equivalent to 0.5$  of loans outstanding (excluding bond
loans and I3RD-financed loans) goes to the Exoort Subsidy Fund.
