implementation of the\n            Government's and the Mexican Fertilizer Company's\n            (FERTIMEX) five-year program to put the fertilizer subsector\n            on a sound competitive basis and eliminate Government\n            subsidies. The project aims to achieve this through a series\n            of reforms of the policy framework and the implementation of\n            supporting rationalization investments. Major policy reforms\n            involve significant price adjustments of inputs and outputs,\n            closure of uneconomic plants, liberalization of distribution\n            and imports, setting up a better organizational structure in\n            the sector, financial restructuring of FERTIMEX and the\n            carrying out of a program of economically viable\n            investments. These objectives will be achieved through Bank\n            financing of three components with a total loan amount of\n            US$265 million. These imports include fertilizers and\n            fertilizer raw materials and other imports in support of\n            policy reforms; (b) rationalization investments of the\n            production and distribution infrastructure in support of\n            policy reforms; and (c) technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1988-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
