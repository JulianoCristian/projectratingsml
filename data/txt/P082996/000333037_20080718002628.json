follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and  Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the experience\n            of PFPSAL provides a number of insights that speak to four\n            distinct issues: (i) the critical role of country\n            leadership; (ii) the importance of bundling knowledge and\n            lending in Banks operations; (iii) the appropriate balance\n            of the Bank's focus on supporting design and\n            implementation of a program; and (iv) the specifics of\n            programs in crisis situations. A High degree of up-front\n            political leadership, ownership of the strategy, and the\n            program by the key ministries in the government, and\n            consensus behind the program were important preconditions\n            for the successful adoption and implementation of reforms\n            especially in the case of public sector reforms. The link\n            between lack of public finance transparency and financial\n            sector vulnerability was key for the success of the program.\n            This underscores the usefulness of designing PFPSAL as a\n            multi-sector program. At the same time, as the experience\n            with the differing pace of implementation of the two\n            components under PFPSAL III shows, separation into different\n            programs may be called for at some point in time. In a\n            much-improved environment waiting for an appropriate timing\n            for the privatization of state banks has probably resulted\n            in greater revenues than anticipated or that will have been\n            achieved in faster sales. The increased interest in the\n            Turkish banking sector was most unexpected only two or three\n            years before partly because at the depth of the crisis it is\n            easy to underestimate the extent of the recovery. Therefore,\n            a broader conclusion could be that, On designing a program\n            in the midst of a crisis, flexibility is particularly\n            important regarding policy measures that may have widely\n            differing outcomes under different states of the economy."}, "docdt": "2008-03-17T00:00:00Z"}
