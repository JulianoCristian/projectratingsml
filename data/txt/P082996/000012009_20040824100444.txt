                                     public sector reform priorities while ensuring that social

                                     targeted. K e y reform priorities in the financial sector include:
                                     (i)strengthening theregulatoryframework forbanking(ii)
                                     building institutional capacity at the Banking Regulation and
                                     Supervision Agency (BRSA) and Saving Deposit Insurance

                                     (iv) improving the corporate insolvency regime. Key reform
                                     priorities in the public sector include: (i)deepening o f
                                     structural fiscal policies in support o f sustainable fiscal
                                     adjustment, (ii) implementing public expenditure management
                                     (PEM) reforms covering budget planning and execution,

                             better targeting o f social protection.

Benefits:                    The principal benefits o f the Loan will derive from: (i)
                             supporting the Government's efforts to create conditions for
                             sustained growth and macroeconomic stability, (ii)ensuring
                             adequate     social expenditure and better targeted social
                             protection, (iii)restoring confidence in the banking system and
                             positioning the sector for accession to the European Union

                             effective government in line with EU directives                and
                             international best practice.

Risks:                       Turkey has embarked o n an impressive financial and public
                             sector reform agenda in the post-2001 crisis period. Although
                             significant progress has been achieved in implementing the
                             core reform agenda, Turkey's financial and public sector
                             reform program still entails significant risks, but these continue
                             to be outweighed by the benefits o f the reforms and the risks o f
                             not proceeding. Sustained implementation o f these reforms is
                             necessary to overcome the risks to the program. The major,
                             domestic along with extemal, risk factors include possible (a)
                             policy slippages that would impact public debt sustainability,
                             (b) external vulnerability, (c) spillover from global liquidity
                             tightening, (d) EU decision short o f expectations and (e)
                             banking sector problems. All o f these factors pose a risk to the
                             macroeconomic        stability    through    weakening     market
                             confidence. Sustainability o f the public debt, which is critical
                             to   macroeconomic       stability,  will hinge on      continued
                             implementation o f strong macroeconomic policies               and
                             structural reform policies. High debt rollover ratios mean that
                             a slide in the credibility attached to the government's reform
                             implementation program will put the economy on a high
                             interest   rate-accelerating     inflation-poor  growth    spiral,
                             adversely affecting the vulnerable public debt dynamics. The
                             active support o f the Bank is instrumental in providing
                             credibility to the Government program and, thereby, mitigating
                             these risks. Sustained implementation o f the reform program is
                             also necessary to maintain market confidence. The Bank's
                             assistance strategy for financial and public sector reform
                             incorporates significant mitigation measures; however, until
                             the reforms are fully implemented, Turkey will remain
                             vulnerable to a range o f exogenous shocks.

Schedule o f Disbursements:  US$SOO million-including        a 1 percent fee to be paid to the
                            IBRD (see footnote in page 1 o f the Loan Summary)-

                                ADJUSTMENT LOAN (PFPSAL 111)
                                 TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY

                                   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 1.      The proposed US$1 billion Third Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment
Loan (PFPSAL 111) to the Republic o f Turkey will continue the Bank's support for the
Government's multi-year financial and public sector program. This program aims to ensure
continued confidence in the banking system, correct the underlying structural problems in the
public sector, and ensure adequate funding o f critical social programs. The PFPSAL I11will be
disbursed intwo equal tranches. It follows on the U S $ l 1billion single tranche PFPSAL and the
                                                           .
US$1.35 billion three tranche PFPSAL I1approved in April 2002. The first US$450 million
tranche of PFPSAL I1was disbursed in August 2002. However, disbursement o f the remaining
tranches was delayed by a slowdown in reform implementation during the run-up to early
legislative elections in November 2002 and establishment o f the new Government.                The
undisbursed amounts under PFPSAL I1were cancelled inJune 2003, at the authorities' request.

2.      PFPSAL I11Loan Terms. While PFPSAL I1was partially on standard terms and partially
on SSAL terms, the Bank has agreed to prepare PFPSAL I11on standard IBRDterms.

3.      Partial Front-end Fee Waiver. The Government has requested a partial waiver o f the
front-end fee on the proposed PFPSAL I11inconsideration o f the fee already paid on PFPSAL 11.
A total o f US$534 million on SSAL terms (Loan No. 4657 TU) and US$366 million on IBRD
terms (Loan No. 4656 TU) remained undisbursed under the second and third tranches of
PFPSAL 11. As the US$366 million undisbursed under the PFPSAL II loan on standard IBRD
terms (Loan No. 4656 TU) is being folded into the new programmatic operation, US$3,660,000
o f the front-end fee o f PFPSAL I11would be waived.        While some new elements have been
added to the financial and public sector reform program supported by PFPSAL I11 and the
phasing o f other actions has changed, the continuity o f the program provides justification for the
waiver request.

4.      PFPSAL I11Program. The backbone o f the structural conditionality for PFPSAL I11
consists of the outstanding conditions for PFPSAL I1second and third tranche. A number o f the
PFPSAL I1conditions have already been met. The remaining outstanding conditions have been
incorporated into the Board presentation and second tranche conditions for PFPSAL 111. In the
key areas o f the program where there have been potential problems, new conditionality has been
added.    These include: (i)  implementation o f the direct income support (DIS) program for
farmers, (ii)maintenance o f BRSA's independence and support for its institutional development,
(iii)completion o f actions to prepare Vakif Bank for privatization, and (iii)  elimination o f the
system o f earmarked revenues and expenditures left in place after closure o f the budgetary and
extra-budgetary funds. In several other areas, PFPSAL I11goes beyond the agenda set under
PFPSAL 11, for example a comprehensive new banking law will be enacted under the program
and new benchmarks were set under the tax strategy and public employment program. The
timing o f second tranche release will depend on the actual fulfillment o f the agreed conditions.
Macro-economic outcomes under PFPSAL I11 will be monitored against key indicators on a

                                               - 11-



short-term basis. These indicators have been determined on the basis o f the macro-framework
agreed with the IMF.

5.       Linkto the CAS. PFPSALI11is inthe highcase lending scenario o fthe CAS discussed
by the Executive Directors on November 6, 2003 (Report No. 26756 TU). There has been
sufficient progress made inthe areas where the high case triggers apply within the current CAS
(Table 12).

6.       IMFProgram. The IMF's Boardo fDirectors approved inFebruary2002 a new Stand-by
Arrangement for Turkey covering the 2002-04 period, bringing total IMF commitments for the
program to over US$30 billion since December 1999. The Stand-by i s being implemented in
close cooperation with,the Bank. The seventh IMF program review was completed in April
2004. The prior actions, performance criteria and structural benchmarks for the seventh review
are fully consistent with the proposedPFPSAL 111.

7.      Risks. Turkey has embarked on an impressive financial and public sector reform agenda
inthe post-2001 crisis period. Although significant progress has been achieved inimplementing
the core reform agenda, Turkey's financial and public sector reform program still entails
significant risks, but these continue to be outweighed by the benefits o f the reforms and the risks
o f not proceeding. Sustained implementation o f these reforms is necessary to overcome the risks
to the program. The major, domestic along with external, risk factors include possible (a) policy
slippages that would impact public debt sustainability, (b) external vulnerability, (c) spillover
from global liquidity tightening, (d) EUdecision short o f expectations and the (e) banking sector
problems. All o f these factors pose a risk to the macroeconomic stability through weakening
market confidence.      Sustainability o f the public debt, which is critical to macroeconomic
stability, will hinge on continued implementation o f strong macroeconomic policies and
structural reform policies. High debt rollover ratios mean that a slide in the credibility attached
to the government's reform implementation program will put the economy on a high interest
rate-accelerating inflation-poor growth spiral, adversely affecting the vulnerable public debt
dynamics. The active support o f the Bank is instrumental in providing credibility to the
Government program and, thereby, mitigating these risks.       Sustained implementation o f the
reform program is also necessary to maintain market confidence. The Bank's assistance strategy
for financial and public sector reform incorporates significant mitigation measures; however,
untilthe reforms are fully implemented, Turkey will remain vulnerable to a range o f exogenous
shocks.

                                    I. INTRODUCTION

A.      Loan and ProgramSummary

8.      This program document proposes a Third Programmatic Financial and Public Sector
Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL 111) to the Republic o f Turkey for US$1 billion to continue the
Bank's support for the Government's multi-year financial and public sector program.           The
program of structural reforms is aimed at preserving the current stability achieved after the 2001
crisis, promoting economic growth, and ensuring that social programs are adequately funded and
increasingly better targeted.

9.      The proposed loan (US$1 billion) will be in U S Dollar Single Currency on standard
IBRDterms. The loanwill be disbursed intwo tranches. The first US$500 milliontranche will
be disbursed immediately upon effectiveness and the second tranche o f US$500 million upon
fulfillment of the second tranche release conditions and as long as overall progress with the
program is also satisfactory.

10.     The proposed PFPSAL I11is the third in a series o f programmatic loans since 2001 in
support o f the Government's comprehensive reform o f the financial and public sectors. Under
the PFPSAL program, the World Bank (WB) intends to disburse a total o f US$2.55 billion in
adjustment lending to meet Turkey's external and budgetary financing requirements to support
the Government's short and medium-term reform goals inthe financial and public sectors, and to
help protect critical social spending. The PFPSAL I11follows on the first PFPSAL o f US$1.1
billion approved in July 2001 (US$700 million on standard IBRD terms and US$400 million on
Special Structural Adjustment Loan-SSAI-terms)         and disbursed in a single tranche in July
2001. The three-tranche Second Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan
(PFPSAL 11) o f US$1.35 billion (US$550 million on standard IBRD terms and US$800 million
on SSAL terms) was approved in April 2002. The first US$450 million tranche o f PFPSAL I1
was disbursed upon effectiveness in August 2002. However, disbursement o f the remaining
tranches o f PFPSAL I1was delayed by a slowdown in implementation of the economic reform
program during the run-up to early legislative elections held in November 2002 and
establishment of the new Government. Further delays resulted from external developments in
the region, notably in Iraq. The undisbursed amounts under PFPSAL I1were cancelled in June
2003 at the authorities' request.

11.     Bank support for sustained implementation o f reform inthe financial andpublic sectors is
continuing under the high-case scenario described in the CAS (Country Assistance Strategy) for
FY 04-06 discussed by the Board on November 6, 2003. The PFPSAL I11operation is included
in the US$4.5 billion high-case scenario o f the new CAS for FY 04-06.         Bank support for
sustained implementation o f reform in the financial and public sectors is planned to continue
under the high-case scenario through three follow-up operations: two programmatic public sector
adjustment loans (PPSAL and PPSAL 11) and a programmatic financial sector adjustment loan
(PFSAL).

B.        RecentEconomicDevelopments

12.       The Turkish economy continues to grow at a fast pace. Economic growth reached 5.9
percent in 2003 following 7.9 percent growth in 2002. The major contributing factor to the
favourable growth outcome in 2003, because o f its weight in the national accounts, was private
consumption growth. However, showing much faster rates o f growth was private sector capital
formation.    This augurs well for sustaining growth with capacity utilization levels reaching
historic highs. Exports continued to play an important role in the recovery. The current account
deficit widened to almost 3 percent o f GNP, but was easily financed by short-term capital
inflows, public sector borrowing abroad and reverse currency substitution. Inflation fell to 18.4
percent in 2003, and the latest data suggest that inflation is falling towards the important single
digit level for the first time since the 1970s.

 13.     Employment declined in 2003 following public and private sector restructurings, which
together with three years o f decline in real wages, helped preserve competitiveness in spite o f
 strong currency appreciation. Aggregate unemployment remained stable at around 10percent but
this was helped by a temporary shrinkage in the labor force. Inurban areas unemployment rate
 approached 15 percent and unemployment o f educated youth rose above 30 percent at the end o f
2003. With a trend increase in the labor force at least 1.8 percent per year, further reforms are
needed to strengthenjob-creation.

 14.     Strong fiscal performance has been the cornerstone o f the economic program. Fiscal
 gains were significant in 2003, and the primary surplus rose from 4 percent o f GNP in 2002 to
 over 6 percent o f GNP in 2003, close to the programmed 6.5 percent target. Nevertheless, the
overall fiscal deficit remained considerable at 9.9 percent o f GNP. Although the 2004 budget
passed inDecember was consistent with the 6.5 percent primary surplus target, a sizeable fiscal
gap quickly emerged. The government announced above inflation increases in minimum wages
and it also cut contribution rates for social security to reduce the additional costs to employers. In
addition, the government increased pensions by 21percent, well above the inflation target. These
initiatives, together with revenue shortfalls relative to the Budget, created a financing gap o f
close to 1.7 percent o f GNP. The Government introduced a fiscal package inMarch to close the
fiscal gap. This package has two main components: a supplementary budget and revenue
measures. The supplementary budget passed in March cuts discretionary expenditures by 13
percent across all ministries. The government also introduced measures to increase tax revenues
by adjusting excises o fpetroleum, alcohol, tobacco, and natural gas. While the Government has
demonstrated a willingness to undertake action to meet the fiscal target, good public expenditure
management and delivery o f services to citizens will require less reliance on ad hoc, short-term
measures and a focus on sustainable fiscal adjustment.

 15.     Monetary policy followed a policy o f implicit inflation targeting, with the Central Bank
(CBT) occasionally intervening in the foreign exchange market to dampen what was deemed to
be excessive fluctuation in the exchange rate. The decline in inflation, which was aided by the
strength o f the TL, led to a commensurate decline ininterest rates from a nominal 60 percent in
the first quarter o f 2003, to about 25 percent early in2004.

16.      On the external front, despite appreciation o f the Turkish Lira, rising productivity and
declining labour costs helped to sustain extemal competitiveness and export growth. Exports
grew sharply in 2003. Textile and vehicle exports were best performing sectors. One
encouraging sign is the growing importance o f new export markets. Iraq has already become a
large export market for Turkey, and there was strong growth in exports to China, Russia and
Central and Eastern European countries. Imports also grew rapidly, with oil, increasedimports o f
machinery and equipment, and rising demand for imported consumption goods being major
contributors. Intermediate and capital goods accounted for 86 percent o f the increase in imports
between 2002 and 2003. Consumption goods also rose sharply in the second half o f 2003 and
continued in early 2004.       Much o f the increase in consumption goods imports is driven by
automobile imports which benefited from a temporary tax credit on automobile purchases
introduced in August 2003.       Tourism receipts were maintained in 2003 despite the Istanbul
bombings and uncertainty from the Iraq war. The current account deficit increased to 3 percent
o f GNP in 2003. Continued market confidence has spurred an improvement in capital inflows,

although green field investment has remained low. These inflows easily financed the current
account deficit and allowed the sharp increase in intemational foreign exchange reserves to
US$33 billion, equivalent to 5 months o f goods and services imports.

17.      The combination o f strong real and financial market performance had a favourable
impact on the public debt burden. The net public debt to GNP ratio has fallen sharply in2002-03
from its end-2001 peak o f 93.9 percent o f GNP. Helped by declining real interest rates, strong
fiscal  performance, the recovery o f economic growth, and above all, by the continued
appreciation o f the real exchange rate, Turkey's net public sector debt is estimated to have fallen
to about 70 percent o f GNP at end-2003. The decline would have been larger without the
issuance o f new debt (of TL 6.8 quadrillion) for the takeover o f failing Imar Bank in July 2003.
With capital flows increasing and growing appetite for Turkish government paper, Treasury had
no problem servicing the debt. Nevertheless, the highrollover rate, 88 percent in2003, indicates
the continued dependence on market sentiment and thus vulnerability to extemal developments.

18.      The recent deterioration in global financial indicators in early M a y 2004 combined with
the higher than expected current account deficit figures have led to a sharp weakening in

                                                    - 5 -


 domestic financial indicators. While the Turkish Lira (TL) depreciated about 14 percent takingit
to a level it was inlate 2002, the stock market plunged by 18 percent albeit from an all time high
 level and the benchmark Treasury bond rate reached a high o f 30 percent by mid-May from 22
percent levels in early April. Turkey's Eurobond spreads widened by over 200 basis points to
 525 basis points during the same period. The excess volatility in FX market was curbed in some
 degree by the Central Bank's intervention. It appears that some relative stability has been
 achieved in domestic financial markets. These recent developments have underlined Turkey's
 exposure to shocks from the extemal environment. While the depreciation o f the TL is an
 adjusting factor to the deteriorating current account balance, it is also likely to affect inflationary
 expectations and domestic interest rates. Higher domestic interest rates, in tum, would influence
together with the impact of the TL's depreciation, the overall fiscal deficit and economic activity.
 Spill over from global liquidity tightening and rising spreads are likely to increase the cost o f
 extemal borrowing. Such developments, if persistent, could disrupt the virtuous cycle that the
 economy has experienced over the last year and a half.

C.        Medium-term Macroeconomic Framework'

 19.      Sustaining the momentum o f the ongoing recovery and the confidence o f markets
continue to be the challenges facing policy makers. Under stable domestic and intemational
conditions, Turkey would repeat, even improve on last year's macroeconomic performance in
2004. Inflation is running below projections. Carry over from last year's strong increase in
industrial output and a normal harvest in agriculture sector this year should deliver the growth
target. On the demand side, confidence indicators are strengthening and lower interest rates are
providing stimulus to private investment and consumption. Despite strong domestic demand, the
inflation target o f 12 percent remains within reach. As Turkey sustains and deepens reform
beyond 2004, it will build on the recovery inboth private consumption and investment to sustain
economic growth at a projected 5 percent o f GDP annually (Table 3).

20.       The interest rate path will be critical to the success o f the program. Interest rates affect
the growth prospects, increase the debt burden and also make fiscal adjustment more difficult
and hence less credible. The authorities are deploying fiscal and monetary policies aimed at
bringing interest rates down. The disinflation process that supports real interest reduction has
continued through the first quarter o f 2004. Further declines will have to be underpinned by
growing market credibility. As confidence consolidates and government crowding out is
reduced, real interest rates are projected to decline in2004-06 period. The favorable effect on the
macroeconomic outlook will work through several channels. First, it would directly stimulate
consumption and investment. Second, it would improve the debt sustainability picture, thereby
facilitating fiscal adjustment while increasing the credibility o f the reform program. Third, as
confidence in the policy framework grows, risk margins would decrease and foreign and
domestic investment would rise.




* The projections presentedinthis section are made by the World Bank and are based on policy assumptions that are
yet to be confimedby the authorities.

                                              - 6 -


 21.     The Government has reiterated its determination to adhere to the primary surplus target
 o f 6.5 percent o f GNP in 2004. A set o f fiscal measures including an across-the-board cut in
 discretionary expenditure was introduced inearly 2004 to close the fiscal gap and to ensure fiscal
 sustainability (see para. 14). This across-the-board cut has a negative impact on the public
 investment program. The sizeable cut in govemment investment in 2004 follows a decline in
public investment in 2003 and i s not conducive to sustainable growth. In addition to a focus on
reaching the primary surplus target the quality o f fiscal adjustment is also important. A
 centerpiece o f the reform program will be continued fiscal consolidation accompanied by better
targeting o f Government spending towards investment and targeted social protection and away
 from the wage bill, subsidies and untargeted social interventions (see section I11 for further
discussion o ffiscal reforms).

22.      There has been progress in reducing the net public debt to GNP ratio in 2002 and 2003.
The ratio is projected to fall to 66 percent at the end of 2004. The projections for the key
macroeconomic parameters, including growth, interest rates, exchange rates and the primary
surplus, imply a further steady decline in the public debt to GNP ratio, falling below 60 percent
in2006.

23.      The extemal position will strengthen markedly with the overall balance improving from
virtual equilibrium in 2004 to a surplus o f US$4.6 billion in 2006, notwithstanding the end of
IMF financial support and Turkey making significant IMF repurchases, rising from US$1.7
billion in2003 to US$11.6 billionin2006. The current account deficit will decline from US$9.1
billion in 2004 to 7.5 billion in 2005 and 2006 while the capital account will improve from net
inflows o f US$9.2 billion in 2004 to US$12.1 billion in 2006. As the real exchange rate i s
projected to depreciate gradually and foreign demand to recover, exports are projected to surge
from US$60.4 billion in 2004 to US$73.1 billion in 2006. Strong consumption and investment
recovery shouId boost imports by a similar amount from US$77.2 billionto US$90.4 billion over
the same period. FDIis conservatively projected to increase from an average o f US$0.9 billion
over 2002 to 2004 to US$2.2 billionin2006.

24.      Medium-termprojections suggest that sustained implementation o f economic reform is
necessary for Turkey to attain macroeconomic stability and growth. Under these projections, the
economy i s expected to grow about 5 percent annually in the 2005-06 period. Specific factors
underlying stability and sustained growth include: (a) greater confidence in the policy
framework, (b) improved macroeconomic stability and declining real interest rates-which
would stimulate private investment and consumption demand, (c)                  stronger exports
performance-which       would permit faster import and output growth, and (d) higher extemal
inflows, including larger FDI. Under this scenario, fiscal adjustment would yield a permanent
reduction inthe public sector borrowing requirement from about 10percent o f GNP in2003 to 5
percent o f GNP in 2006. This will underpin the projected stabilization o f the net public debt
stock to GNP ratio below 60 percent o f GNP by 2006. The programmed fiscal adjustment would
also support the projected decline ininflation to single digitsby 2005.

D.      The StructuralReformAgenda

25.     The Government's program emphasizes the critical role o f structural reforms. Policy
continuity i s essential to maintain the stability achieved after the 2001 crisis and to preserve the
growth and macroeconomic performance o f the last three years. The first reform priority is to
accelerate banking reform-to consolidate the renewed trust in the sector and to preclude the
possibility o f a systemic crisis. The program emphasis has now moved from crisis management
to broad base financial sector development. The second priority area i s the comprehensive
reform o f the public sector to address the underlying structural causes o f Turkey's
macroeconomic instability, ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability,                and increase the
transparency and efficiency o f public expenditure management.             The third priority area i s
continuation o f vital reforms in the agriculture, energy and telecommunications sectors to
improve the climate for private investment inan effort to raise productivity, growth and incomes.
Many o fthe latter reforms also have a structural fiscal dimension.

26.     Turkey needs comprehensive financial and public sector reforms to break definitively
with its history o f inadequate transparency, public deficits, inflation and financial instability. A
quick retrospective highlights the structural weaknesses in both the public and financial sectors
which contributed to macroeconomic instability and created the pre-conditions for the 2001
crisis. Chronic public sector deficits led to the buildup o f debt and rapid expansion o f the
banking sector, which greatly outpaced the capacity o f the regulatory framework.
Macroeconomic distortions arising from fiscal imbalance created incentives for the banksto take
on excessive risk which was not curtailed by adequate regulation and enforcement. The
absence o f ample, accurate and timely fiscal information-particularly      the reliance on off-budget
funds and quasi-fiscal obligations including the so-called "duty losses" o f the state banks-
reinforced political and institutional obstacles to structural change and sustainable fiscal
adjustment.      Unhealthy interactions between inadequate fiscal and financial transparency
compounded the risks to the economy and helped ensure the buildup o f a major systemic crisis
following earlier cycles o f crisis and aborted stabilization efforts throughout the 1990s. After
undertaking urgent financial restructuring to address the impact o f the November 2000 and
February 2001 crises on the banks, the authorities are making progress in correcting the
underlyingweaknesses in the financial sector. In parallel, institutional and policy reforms are

                                                - 8 -


being deepened to address systemic problems inthe public sector, together with further structural
measures to gradually underpin the fiscal adjustment.        These reforms complement on-going
actions to improve the climate for private investment and promote growth. Rebuildinginvestor
confidence and sustaining economic growth depend critically on the Government's ability to
maintain the momentum o f reforms to address the structural roots o f Turkey's chronic financial
instability.

E.      Social and Poverty Impact of the Reform Program

27.     The recovery has yet to translate into welfare gains for the average citizen. The Bank
prepared an interim Poverty Update in 2002 based on a household survey during the summer o f
2001 which confirmed an increased risk o f poverty and vulnerability following the 2001
financial crisis. The survey questionnaire on consumption and income was applied to 4,200
households. There were 120 in depth case studies o f survey respondents.        The Study (Report
No. 24185-TU) built on the analysis o f the Poverty Assessment completed in 2000 (Turkey:
Economic Reforms, Living Standards and Social Welfare Study - Report No. 20029-TU) and
compared the results with the last nationwide household survey in 1994, taking due account o f
the problems comparing data taken from two very different surveys. The major effect has been
an increase in poverty in the urban areas o f Turkey. Extreme poverty in all o f Turkey has not
changed, and remains at low levels, but inequality remains unchanged at quite high levels. A
relatively large share (nearly one-fifth) o f the urban population had consumption below nutrition
standards, and qualitative evidence indicates that poverty has worsened in rural areas as well.
The poor include: (i)  families with children, particularly families with many children, (ii)
                                                                                            single
elderly females living alone, (iii) widoweddivorced mothers with children (small group), (iv)
families with children in disadvantaged regions: Southem and Eastern Anatolia reflect high
levels o f poverty incidence and severity, and (v) families with children in gecekondu housing.
The poor have been particularly impacted by a reduction in seasonal and informal employment
opportunities inthe urbanized areas, and some men are returning to their rural villages because
they cannot earn enough inthe cities to cover their subsistence. The primary coping strategy o f
the poor has beento reduce consumption, particularly the quantity and quality o f food consumed,
but there are also indications that the poor may have to cut back on education expenses and
withdraw children from school. The poor rely strongly on networks o f extended family, friends,
neighbors, and hemgeri (people o f same place o f origin), but these networks are strained by the
macroeconomic shocks experienced in 1999 (recession and earthquake) and 2001 (economic
crisis).

28.     A new nationwide representative household survey was completed in2002 and the data
are being used by the State Institute o f Statistics (SIS) and WB to prepare a Joint Poverty
Assessment Report (JPAR), expected to be completed in December 2004. Using a revised
methodology, the JPAR determined that less than one percent o f the Turkish population was
extremely poor in 2002 (with consumption below a 2,100 calorie per person average food
basket), but many more are poor (below a poverty line including both food and necessary non-
food spending); some 27 percent o f the population.        The difference between the very low
extreme poverty rate and the relatively highoverall poverty rate reflect two factors inTurkey: (i)
social solidarity; and (ii)the high levels o f inequality.     Social solidarity mechanisms were
described in the Poverty Update (World Bank 2002) whereby households help each other to

                                               - 9 -



ensure that the poorest families have enough food, but this inter-household assistance i s not
enough to lift families out o f poverty. Overall poverty is relatively high for a middle-income
country, reflectingthe highlevel o f inequality inconsumption and income inTurkey.

29.     Comparisons over time require caution since the sources o f data and the methodologyhas
changed. Using a consistent methodology and poverty line suggests that poverty has declined
only slightly since 1987, reflecting the impact o f financial crises in 1994 and 2001 and the 1999
earthquake, and the persistent inequality which has kept Turkey from "growing" its way out o f
poverty. I t does appear that urban poverty lessened between 2001 and 2002 as the economy
recovered from the 2001 crisis, but the 2001 data are not fully comparable to the 2002 data.

30.     The PFPSAL program will produce important social benefits interms o f restored growth,
job creation and reduced economic vulnerability. Nonetheless, structural reforms entail short-
term social costs which the Government i s working to mitigate. Employment reduction in the
public sector is aparticularly sensitive area. A key element o f the public employment program is
to address the over-employment in the state economic enterprises. At end 2001/early 2002,
approximately 15,000 workers were retired, notified o f their retirement, laid off or converted to
private contract status. Inaddition most o f the unfilledpositions in State Economic Enterprises
(SEEs) were eliminated. An assessment of SEE redundancies was conducted. It indicated that
there were about 46,000 redundant positions in the SEE system as o f January 2002. A majority
of these redundancies were eliminated as o f mid-March 2004 and many o f the SEEswere infact
able to reduce the number o f their workers by more than the figure determined through the
redundancy assessment carried out in 2002. The overall attrition from SEEs between February
2002 and mid-March 2004 reached over 59,000. These workers are eligible for pensions and
other social insurance benefits. In addition to these standard benefits, workers laid off from
SEEs inthe portfolio o fthe Privatization Administration (PA) benefit from special compensation
under the privatization law. All formal sector workers can benefit from the new unemployment
insurance system launched in mid-2000, once they meet the minimum contribution history
requirement o f 18 months.

31.     The Government has acknowledged some problems with targeted social spending
outcomes in2002 and 2003 and it is determined to address these problems inthe 2004 budget in
order to ensure strengthened social protection for all o f Turkey's citizens, inparticular poor and
vulnerable groups. Benchmarks for public spending on health, education and social protection,
as shares o f GNP were agreed with the Bank under the first PFPSAL (Table 4).                These
benchmarks have been set at a level above the averages for the 1998-2000 period, reflecting the
policy decision to ensure adequate expenditure on social priorities. The estimated outcome for
total social spending as a share o f GNP is in the range o f 18.2 percent o f GNP,well above the
PFPSAL benchmark o f 14.5 percent, in large part due to the unplanned increase in social
security expenditure. Under the 2004 revisedbudget, the overall social spending as a percent o f
GNP is expected to be even higher than in2003, at about 19.3 percent. However, the education
spendingis likely to fall slightlybelow the PFPSALbenchmark o f4.25 percent, due to the fiscal
measures requiringexpenditure cuts to attain the end-year primary surplus target.

32.       Expenditure o n targeted social assistance in GNP terms is budgeted to increase in 2004.
The Government intends to increase the spending for the SSF to over 0.3 percent o f GNP (0.37
percent o f GNP or TL 1.527 quadrillion) inclusive o f the transfer from the budget carried over
from 2003. The D I S payments increased to 0.64 percent of GNP (TL 2.25 quadrillion) in2003.
In2004budget, an allocation ofTL 2.6 quadrillion will cover the remaining 2003 DIS liabilities
and the second installment o f D I S compensation payments for diesel h e l . The Government is
targeting to disburse at least TL 275 trillion this year under the 2004 D I S program and will make
efforts to increase disbursement at least to TL 400 trillion. Additional resources will be
transferred to the D I S program by the Ministry o f Finance and Treasury to achieve this target.
The authorities finalized the agricultural policy paper which includes adequate provisions for
D I S as well as other agriculture support instruments. This policy paper will form the basis for
the new agricultural framework law which will be enacted before the end of 2004.

33.       The Bank and the Government reached agreement on the content of the Agriculture
Framework Law. This was achieved following substantial discussions o f the agricultural policy

paper by the Ministry o f Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA),SPO, and Treasury. Key issues
include:



           0  H o w DIS will be phased down - beginning in 2006, DIS will not be granted to
              high value crop areas (under greenhouses, fruits and other perennial crops, and
              vegetables) and to farmers who participate in the agricultural conservation
              program (known as CATAK). Combined, these exclusions are expected to cover
              about 20 percent o f the cultivated area. The DIS payment rate will be held
              constant at 160 million TL/ ha (the current level). With projected registered area
              inthe National Registry of Farmers rising from the current level o f 17.0 million
              ha to a maximum o f about 18.5 million ha (a final maximum 85 percent
              registration rate for all cultivated area), DIS payments would be made on roughly
              14.5 million ha and total 2.3 quadrillion TL annually in2006-2010. Depending on
              the growth o f GDP and whether the agricultural transfer budget reaches its
              targeted level o f 1.0 percent o f GDP (currently the level is at 0.85 percent o f
              GDP), the DIS share inagricultural transfers would range between 44 percent and
              52 percent. So it was agreed by the Bank and the Government representatives
              that a 45 percent share o f DIS in agricultural transfers is a prudent and reasonable
              target.

           0  Justification for an increased share for premium payments - given structural
              problems in the maize sector related to fanners' inability to dry and store maize
              (grown currently on 500,000           hectares),  the Bank and the government
              representatives agreed that rural development grants targeted at this problem
              during the 2006-2010 period will be the most effective policy in improving the
              efficiency o f the maize market and reducing the very sharp price reductions for
              maize at harvest time.     However, since improvements to the maize market is
              expected to take some years, a maize deficiency payment would be introduced to
             boost the incomes o f producers o f maize. It was also agreed that irrigation water
             metering and increased water tariffs could boost maize production in South
              Eastern Anatolia (where maize competes with cotton), and that in the Western
             Black Sea area, current hazelnut policy and the alternative crops program could
              achieve substantial shifts out o f hazelnut into maize production. These medium
             term measures are expected to be the greatest contributing factors to the
             expansion o f maize area. With the addition o f a deficiency payment for maize,
             the expected share o f deficiency payments in the agricultural transfer budget
             would rise to 12-14percent.


          0  Why and how livestock support is supposed to increase. Animal husbandry
             (particularly cattle and sheep raising) has been a declining sector, particularly in
             the eastern half o f the country. A number o f problems persist such as low quality
             but expensive breeding stock, small herds, poor feed, difficult commercialization
             of live animals, and poorly arranged logistics for transportation o f slaughtered
             carcasses and butchered meat to the main demand centers within the country.
             Thus, the Government is focused on increasing support to the livestock sector

                                               - 12-


                through existing measures and introducing a number o f new measures to address
                these problems. Some are price-based, while others take the form o f increased
                investment subsidies. These measures were explained convincingly to the Bank
                by the Government and are expected to reach a share o f 11-14 percent of
                agricultural transfers over 2006-2010. Thus, a target share for the instrument
                "Livestock Support" o f 12 percent o f agricultural transfers was agreed by the
                Bank, noting that additional funds for promoting investment in the livestock
                sector are available under the "Rural Development Grants" instrument. This
                would assure that enough investment support would be available to the livestock
                sector to reach the goals set out inthe Agricultural PolicyPaper.

 34.       The Agriculture Framework Law also covering the DIS i s expected to be enacted by
December 2004. One o f the objectives o f the Law i s to institutionalize the DIS program and fix
the key principles (non-distortionary, per-hectare payment) and milestones (issuance o f annual
decree, farmer registrationperiod, payment period, etc.) for the annual program cycle. Equally
important, the Law will signal to farmers the Government's intention to maintain the DIS and
other tools to be available for the period 2006-2010 as the key farmer support mechanisms. An
important goal i s to prevent hrther slippage in funding which would hurt the safety net for
farmers andpotentiallyundermine support for the agriculture reform program.

35.      Additional institutional and structural reforms to address the chronic overruns in the
social security system are slated to be prepared in 2004. Correcting fiscal imbalances will be
part o f a broader reform o f the social protection system that includes pensions, health insurance,
social assistance, unemployment insurance and labor markets. The institutional reforms are
expected to include merging the three existing pension institutions into one organization and
transfer the health insurance and social assistance programs to separate institutions. The
objectives o f the structural reforms will be: (i)ensuring the medium-termsolvency o f the social
security system while extending the formal social protection system so that it eventually covers
the entire population and (ii) improving the functioning o f the labor market to encourage formal
job creation. In2004, the authorities planto submit draft laws to Parliament to reform the social
protection system in a manner consistent with these objectives. The Bank will support these
reforms through the proposed PPSAL Iinthe CAS.

36.     The measures taken and planned by the Government would be sufficient to address past
slippages and would provide adequate social spendingin2004. However, satisfactory outcomes
will depend on sustained political will to implement the commitments made, including the
Agriculture Framework Law. Actual social spending in 2004 will be monitored during the
supervision o f PFPSAL 111. The Government has stated its willingness to take further measures
should actual social spending fall short of the budgeted targets during the course o f 2004.
Significant deviations from the program benchmarks will be discussed and appropriate corrective
actions will be taken as neededprior to release o f the second tranche o f the Loan. Furthermore,
the reforms being considered under the PPSAL are critical for consolidating Turkey's ongoing
fiscal adjustment in a sustainable manner, while also improving the coverage and quality o f
Turkey's social protection system.

              11.    TURKEY'S FINANCIAL SECTORREFORMPROGRAM

A.       Introduction

37.      In the aftermath of the November 2000 and February 2001 banking crises, the
Government is committed to accelerating and widening the scope o f its financial sector reform
efforts to consolidate confidence inthe banking system andplace it on a sustainable path towards
competitiveness at the international level and EU accession. The experience in other crisis
countries has shown that banking crises resolution takes time. Accordingly, the Government
structured its financial sector reform program in two phases, with the first focussing primarily
on implementation of urgent banking system reform and restructuring efforts, and the second
phase on the medium term broad based financial sector development agenda. The first phase
was virtually completed with World Bank support under PFPSAL and PFPSAL 11.
Implementation o f the second phase has now began with support o f PFPSAL 111.

38.      The current phase o f the program will (i) Turkey's legal and regulatory fiamework
                                                   bring
for banking up to Basel/EU and intemational best practice standards and ensure effective
enforcement o f all regulations, (ii)restructure the state banks inorder to privatize them, and (iii)
improve creditor rights and the regime for corporate insolvency. The program will include
reforming non-bank financial intermediaries and capital markets at a later stage.

B.       RecentDevelopmentsin the Banking Sector

39.      The Turkish banking sector consists o f 51 banks (Table 5). Of these, 37 are deposit
taking banks and the remaining 14 are investment and development banks which do not take
deposits. Of the deposit taking banks, three belong to the state, two (formerly privately owned)
are under the SDIF, 18 are privately Turkish-owned and 14 are foreign owned.

40.      The country's banks co-exist with approximately 68 insurance companies, 130 securities
trading companies, 306 investment funds, and 210 factoring and leasing companies (several
deposit taking and investment and development banks also hold leasing licenses). There are also
several hitherto unregulated private pension schemes, including schemes run by the banks and
insurance companies for their own staff.       The majority of financial institutions are part o f
financial conglomerates which inmost cases have a main commercial bank and other subsidiary
NBFIs.

41.      Even though the NBFI sector is growing, its size and economic significance are still
rather small in comparison to the banking sector which accounts for over 85 percent o f the
financial system assets. Consequently, the government's policy program still focuses on the
banking system.

42.          The banking industry is comparatively concentrated and the state banks represent an
important share of the sector (Table 5). The four largest domestic private banks account for 41
percent of total assets and the three deposit

43.        Incomparison to countries o f similar
per capita income, Turkey's banking system
is large as a percentage o f GDP (68 percent),                      AOther

but it is exceptionally small when measured
by the ratio of claims on the private sector to
GDP, which i s only 16 percent (Figure 1).
One factor contributing to the comparatively
l o w amounts of credit to the private sector is                  0               25                  50             75           100

44.        In real terms, the banking system                 350                                 ~     - _     _    _         --   -

credit to the private sector showed almost no                           -Credit    to the private sector

real growth (Figure 2). One reason for the
slow growth is that government securities
have been increasingly held directly by the                     1
public, including about TL 15 quadrillion in
money market mutual funds2.

45.        After a decade o f high inflation,
volatile interest rates, and high ex post real
interest rates, the market i s stabilizing as
inflation and real interest rates have declined rapidly. While this bodes well for the economic
future o f Turkey, it creates some immediate adjustment challenges for its banking system. Inthe


  Banks offer automatic transfer between money market hnds and demand deposits, so that retail customers can
maintain a current account with almost zero value.

                                                - 1 5 -


 previous economic environment banks were able to earn highspreads between Treasury billrates
 and deposits, reducing the need to focus on core banking services. As the market has stabilized,
 the spread between Treasury bills and deposits has declined dramatically. Until recently banks
 were able to offset declining spreads by increasing trading activity, but the flattening yield curve
 makes it unlikelythat this can continue.

 46.    To compete in the new environment, both private and state banks must learn to make
 money the "old fashioned way" by developing strong deposit andor lending franchises. Banks
 will need to improve their networks to facilitate convenient access for consumers to their deposit
 funds through technology and strategically placed branches.           They will need to develop
 consumer lending products such as credit cards and overdraft facilities through buildingeffective
 payments networks.      They will originate loans for consumer durables and mortgages by
 developing business relationships with retailers and real estate agents. The strategy for business
 customers is likely to be similar. Banks will need to develop hrther deposit relations with
 customers in order to evaluate their financial viability as loan customers. This will require a full
range o f payments services for businesses as well as payroll services for the employees of these
businesses. Providingthese services will require state o f the art technology platforms.


 C.     Strengtheningthe Regulatory Framework for Banking

47.     The emphasis o f the Government's banking sector reform during the 1990s was
developing a basic legal and regulatory infrastructure to facilitate entry to increase competition
and sector growth. This policy caused a rapid expansion o f banking system assets (see figure 1).
Notwithstanding the 1994-95 banking crisis, total system assets tripled from US$51.9 billion in
 1994 to US$155.2 billion in 2000. The rapid growth o f the sector outpaced the regulations,
enforcement capacity, and the sector's risk management capabilities in place at the time. One
result was the proliferation o f connected lending and concentration o f exposures inrelated risks.
Lenient loan loss provisioning (LLP) rules and enforcement allowed banks to understate credit
risks. Large foreign exchange (FX) open positions and asset/liability mismatches also created
foreign currency and interest ratehiquidity risks inaddition to credit risks.

48.     Excessive banking risks, an unstable macroeconomic environment, and political
uncertainty combined to cause banking crises in November 2000 and February 2001. Investors
liquidated TL positions and fled to the U S Dollar, interest rates peaked at 6,200 percent, and with
a rapid depletion of the CBT's foreign currency reserves, the authorities were forced to float the
Lira leading to a sharp depreciation.         The system's capital position was eroded by the
combination o f losses from (i)   interest rate fluctuations, (ii)devaluation, and (iii)loan defaults
due to corporate sector distress.

49.     Inresponse to the crisis, the authorities undertook urgent reforms, including(i)   amending
prudential regulations for loan loss provisions, connected lending and FX exposures, (ii)
strengthening o f the, at the time, new bank supervision entity BRSA; (iii)         restructuring the
private banking sector by intervening insolvent private banks and undertaking their resolution
through sales, mergers and closures; and (iv) initiating the reform of the state banks by closing
down the insolvent Emlak Bank, and implementing financial and governance restructuring o f
Ziraat and Halk banks, as well as attempting to sell Vakif Bank (VB).

 50.     Under PFPSAL 11, the authorities enacted appropriate, yet mostly ad hoc, regulatory
measures. They also focused on enforcing compliance which has been proceeding adequately.
 Measures introduced then and enforced since include connected exposure regulatory limits,
which began to come down inJanuary 2003 and will decline stepwise every year untilthey reach
 full compliance with the applicable EU Directive in 2006. In addition, enforcement of FX
 exposure regulations has been stepped up, REP0 transactions have been brought on balance
 sheet, and most obstacles to transformation o f financial-industrial groups into separate financial
 and corporate conglomerates have been removed. The authorities are committed to continued
 implementation o f these policies.

 51.     The authorities are now consolidating the current stability o f the sector by drafting a new
banking law fully consistent with European Union principles which will be enacted in early
 2005. By moving away from promulgating ad hoc rules and taking a comprehensive approach,
 Turkey will finally bring its banking regulation in line with international best practice. Box 1
presents the main elements o f this major structural reform.


D.       Strengtheningthe Capacity of the BRSA and the SDIF

 52.    Better banking supervision and regulatory enforcement were core elements o f the
program supported by PFPSAL I1and will continue to be supported under PFPSAL 111. Progress
instrengthening the operational capacity ofBRSA began inJune 2001when the BRSA's Board
adopted an Institutional Development Plan (BIDP) covering a wide range o f institutional
priorities. The BRSA has achieved substantial progress in implementing the BIDP. On March
 16, 2004, the BRSA's Board changed the organizational structure o f the agency with the
objective o f better adapting to emerging challenges and changing priorities.               A second
Institutional Development Plan was adopted by the Board. This second plan requires, among
other things, the preparation of a strategy based on each department's operational plans and work
flows.

53.     Key SDIF strategic issues have been solved or are inthe process o f being solved through
the draft new banking act, includingthe (i)    governance o f the SDIF and (ii)  clarifying further the
responsibilities and attributions o f the BRSA and the SDIF. Regarding the first issue, new
legislation (Law No. 5020) was enacted on December 26,2003 which stipulates the separation o f
BRSA (regulation and supervision) and SDIF (deposit insurance, bank resolution, and asset
management) in order to enhance the asset recovery process. The new banking act will provide
for more coordination and better exchange o f information between the two entities as well as
empowering the SDIF to issue regulations on matters necessary to enable it to carry out its
responsibilities.

54.     The Board of the SDIF adopted an institutional development plan in August 2003.
Implementation o f this plan has led to a more effective organizational structure with clearly
separated line o f responsibilities for bank resolution, liquidation, asset disposition, administration
of deposit insurance scheme, and supporting functions such as legal, human resources and
information technology (meeting a second tranche condition for PFPSAL 11).

E.       State Bank Restructuring and Privatization

 55.     The program supported by PFPSAL 111will ensure that the state banks will not undertake
quasi-fiscal activities again, that these banks will continue to operate under commercial
principles, and that they will be promptly and sufficiently restructuredinorder to be privatized as
 soon as possible, taking market conditions into account.

 56.     Turkey entered the crisis with four state banks: Emlak (public housing construction),
Halk (lending to small businesses and artisans), Ziraat (agricultural finance) and Vakif. Emlak's
banking license was revoked after all its banking liabilities and performing bank assets were
mergedwith Ziraat. The large duty losses accumulated on the balance sheets o f both Ziraat and
Halk have beenreplaced with non-marketable government securities. Their governance has been
strengthened with the appointment o f a new independent professional Joint Board for the two
banks with a mandate to manage these banks in accordance with commercial principles and all
prudential guidelines under the banking lawh-egulations issued by the BRSA.                  Senior
management has been changed; credit systems strengthened; and significant operational
restructuring undertaken which resulted in the closure o f 820 branches, staff reduction o f more
than 30,000 as o f end 2003, and a change in status o f bank staff to that o f private sector
employees. At present both banks are operating under legislation (Law. No. 4603) which
provides them with their own financial and administrative authority and which prevents them
from being assigned duties without advance payment by the general budget. As o f 2003, sworn
bank auditors began certifying every six months that their lending procedures inthe state banks
are based on commercial principles. The overall result is that both banks are profitable, albeit
from trading in government securities rather than lending activities and from a large amount o f
equity intheir balance sheet.

57.      The authorities are ready to move to the second phase o f the reform on state banks;
namely, the development o f a market based strategic direction for each o f the banks that will lead
to their privatization. The challenges, however, are many. Ziraat and Halk together hold a 32
percent market share o f the deposit market but only an 8 percent share o f the loan market. Both
banks have a large portfolio o f non-marketable securities that must be reduced prior to
privatization in a manner that ensures stability in the market for government. And the Turkish
bankingmarket is inthe process o fundergoing a dramatic change as detailed above.

58.     In order to meet this challenge the authorities have engaged a strategic advisor to
formulate a restructuring strategy to allow the privatization o f these state banks. The advisor has
already begun working.       Its work will entail three steps. The first, pre-privatization, will
involve a significant amount o f benchmarking and analysis designed to develop and implement a
viable market based business strategy for each institution. Recommendations will include all
necessary balance sheet and operational restructuring.         The second step will consist of
developing an appropriate privatization strategy that is accepted by the Government, and the
third and final phase will consist of all actions required to accomplish the privatization itself.
The Council o f Ministers will adopt a privatization strategy for both banks in 2004. Inaddition,
their Board will implement the restructuring actions recommended by the strategic advisor in
2004 and the restructured two banks will be offered for sale to the private sector as soon as the
market conditions are appropriate per the advise o f privatization advisors that will be engaged at
a later stage for this purpose.

                                              - 20 -


 59.    Finally, VB was offered for sale inJune 2002 but the tender offer did not result inviable
bids. This bank is controlled by the State through the Directorate General o f Foundations (DGF)
because 75 percent o f shares belong to thousands o f foundations, a majority o f which have
 ceased to function and have no identifiable authorized representatives.        It was necessary,
therefore, to pass legislation to give the government's DGF the authority to exercise shareholder
voting rights on behalf o f the foundations. Consequently, the DGF represents 75 percent o f
 shares and is, therefore, able to appoint VB management. The remaining 25 percent o f VB
 shares belong to the VB employee pension fund (EPF). This ownership structure may have
 contributed to the outcome o f the 2002 tender offer.

 60.    In order to pursue the program's state bank agenda with respect to VB, the authorities
have hired consultants with adequate experience and qualifications to carry out a due diligence of
VB to confirm that the bank has been managed appropriately. Further, the Council o fMinisters
will adopt in2004 a strategy to bring about private sector control o f VB and this strategy will be
implemented expeditiously.

F.      ExecutionandBankruptcyAct

61.     The program appreciates that a better functioning banking sector requires a legal
framework that addresses creditor rights, formalhformal corporate insolvency and restructuring
systems to allow for improved credit risk management practices. An Execution and Bankruptcy
Act (EBA) that conforms with international best practice would assist in increasing private
sector's access to credit and facilitating that productive assets in the economy be allocated to
their most efficient uses.

62.     In December 2003, amendments to the Execution and Bankruptcy Act (EBA) were
enacted to introduce pre-packaged options and to complement earlier amendments enacted in
July 2003 (meeting a second tranche condition for PFPSAL 11). The regulations for the amended
EBAwere publishedinApril 2004 andwill be implemented effectiveIy.

G.      Resolutionof ProblemBanks andFailedBanks

63.     In the.aftermath of the November 2000 and February 2001 crises, the capital base of
nearly all o f the domestic private banks weakened substantially. Banks' capital deficits ranged
from temporary non-compliance with the 8 percent minimum capital adequacy ratio (CAR)
requirement to deep insolvency. The deep recession in the second half o f 2001, coupled with
high interest rates and exchange rate depreciation, caused widespread corporate and financial
sector distress, causing a steep increase in the level o f Non-Performing Loans (NpLs) to risky
levels.

64.    The authorities approached the crisis with the following sequence: (i)  full recognition o f
NPLs and capital losses as the first step, (ii) restructuring and ownership/management
                                                 capital
changedadjustments as a result o f new capital holdings as a second step, and (iii)corporate debt
restructuring to be undertaken by healthy banks as a third step. A public solvency support
scheme to assist in the re-capitalization o f private banks was implemented through a "private
bank re-capitalization law" which became effective on January 31, 2002. Subsequent to this law,
further regulations were issued by the BRSA regarding (i)the norms for portfolio audits to be

                                                -21 -


 carried out inthe private banks by the external auditors to determine the correct levels o f NPLs,
 and (ii) procedures for implementation of the re-capitalization program.
         the

 65.    In May 2002, the BRSA completed a three-stage audit process for all banks and
 corrective actions were completed by August 2002 (meeting a second tranche condition for
 PFPSAL 11) with the objective o f solving the situation o f problem and failed banks (meeting a
 second tranche condition for PFPSAL 11). A number o f banks that had fallen below the
 minimumCAR level were re-capitalized from private sources. VB received a subordinated loan
 from the SDIF to meet the minimum CAR requirement. Presently only two banks remain with
 SDIF (Bayindir and Pamuk). Liquidationproceedings for Imar have been initiated. Liquidation
proceedings for Ticaret are continuing, although these have been interrupted from time to time
by legal actions. Pamuk bankwas re-offered for sale inApril 2003 but the authorities have now
 decided to integrate it with Halk Bank.        Bayindir's status as a "bridge bank" to place the
permanent assets of failed banks. Its eventual liquidation will be decided in the future once its
mission is completed.

 66.    The failure o f Imar Bank in mid-2003 was a serious setback. The bank, owned by the
Uzan Group, saw its license revoked by the BRSA in July 2003. A subsequent investigation
found that the bank: (i)   vastly understated its deposits-a true total o f US$5.5 billion in contrast
to the balance sheet figure o f US$550 million; (ii)  hadpaid only a fraction o f its withholding tax
obligations; and (iii) had sold some US$500 million in T-bills that it had never owned and was
not licensed to sell. The Government announced a payment plan for individual depositors in
November 2003 which will create a burden on the Treasury totalling some 2.2 percent o f GNP.

H.      ProgramContinuityand WB Support

67.     PFPSAL I11will provide continued support to the government's financial sector reform
program. It supports the outstanding objectives sought under the second and third tranches o f
PFPSAL I1as well as new important policy actions. On the subject o f banking regulation where
new issues have appeared, relevant conditionality was added to ensure that a banking law fully
consistent with European Union principles is enacted. The authorities are committed to fully
enforce the regulations under the new banking act. The capacity and independence o f the BRSA
andthe SDIF will continue to be strengthened. The effective resolution o f probledfailed banks
and the completion o f all related PFPSAL I1conditions, after the Loan had been cancelled, attest
to the authorities commitment to enforcing banking regulations and strengthening the regulatory
agencies.

68.     In the one area where implementation o f the program had been delayed, namely the
privatization o f Vakif Bank, corrective actions have been introduced in order to ascertain the
situation o f the bank, resolve its ownership issues, and adopt a privatization strategy to be
implemented expeditiously The program to be supported under PFPSAL I11goes beyond the
state bank agenda o f PFPSAL 11. New and more ambitious benchmarks aimed at the
privatization o f the two larger state banks Ziraat and Halk have been introduced.

69.    Box 2 illustrates that PFPSAL I11supports to a more robust overall bankingsector reform
program than the one left pending with the cancellation o f the second and third tranches o f
PFPSAL 11.

                    111.     TURKEY'S PUBLIC SECTOR REFORMPROGRAM

 A.      Introduction

 70.     Turkey's ongoing public sector reform program aims to underpin sustained fiscal
 adjustment and create the conditions for transparent and effective govemment. In combination
with the financial sector reform program described in Section 11, the public sector reform
program addresses the underlying structural factors that led to the 2001 crisis, thereby trying to
 ensure that these conditions do not recur in the future. Inparticular, the program aims to break
the vicious circle o f inadequate public sector financial management leading to ever increasing
public indebtedness that fuels financial sector weakness through dependency on high retum
govemment securities which intum inflates the public debt burden.

71.      The program focuses on three critical areas, each o f which has a medium-term
dimension:

     0   Implement structural fiscal policies to ensure permanent fiscal adjustment;
     0   Launch a medium-term program o f policy and institutional reforms to improve the
         transparency and efficiency o fPEMincludingaction to:
         0    Improve budget preparation and execution, policy formulation, and the operational
             performance o f public agencies,
         0   Upgrade public accounting, procurement and audit standards to ensure financial
              accountability, and
         0   Ensure prudent public liability management; and
     0   Initiate broad based institutional reforms to improve the quality o f public sector
         governance.

72.      The underlying problems with the structure and management of the public sector have
been analyzed in detail in the 2000 and 2003 Country Economic Memorandums (CEMs),                              and
2001 Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PER). Table 6 shows that Turkey's public
sector is large relative to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
comparators such as Spain and Portugal, and that public spending has greatly exceeded available
 resource^.^ Countries like Germany and Italy, with comparably high levels o f expenditure,
sustain this with much greater revenue effort and therefore runmuch smaller deficits. Central to
this problem is extensive govemment intervention throughout the economy and an under
performing system o f public sector management. The first dimension o f the problem is being
addressed through the on-going structural reforms to the social security system, to modemize
agriculture support policies, deregulate energy and telecommunications sectors and implement
privatization. The second dimension arises from the long neglect o f the need to modernize the
procedures and institutions which govem decision-making and resource allocation in the public


  Including a monetary correction for nominal interest payments would reduce the general govemment deficit for
Turkey inTable 6 to about 3 percent of GDP in 1999. However, this does not include duty losses o fthe state banks
(estimated at about 6 percent o f GDP in 1999 after monetary correction) or the losses o f the SEE sector. The
operational deficit for the public sector as a whole is estimated to have exceeded 12 percent o f GDP in 1999.

                                                                  - 24 -



sector. The impact o f many years o f weak fiscal discipline and poor expenditure management is
also reflected in the composition o f public expenditure. The share o f public spendingon interest
payments and wages and salaries in Turkey varies greatly from almost all o f its OECD
counterparts. This difference i s inconsistent with the objectives o f sustained economic growth
andequity.

73.        The need for structural and institutional reforms is now widely acknowledged by the
government and civil society institutions. In response, the new Government has articulated a
second stream o f public sector reform which proposes both a major restructuring of central
government public administration and far reaching reassignment o f responsibilities across levels
o f government to achieve greater decentralization and stronger accountability for public sector
performance. These reforms are now articulated inthe form o f draft legislation before Parliament
which are likely to be enacted later in 2004. The new Government has also deepened the scope
o f public sector reforms through passage o f the Public Financial Management and Control
(PFMC) Law that was approved by Parliament inDecember 2003. This government has used the
opportunity to revise the core public finance legislation to establish a modern and more
ambitious framework and institutions for public finance management inTurkey.

74.        Coordinating the public sector reform agenda is a significant challenge, particularly inthe
context o f the wider scope o f reform under the two streams, namely public finance management

                                                                    - 25 -


and public administration, and the need to ensure effective sequencing o f the two groups. Under
the previous coalition government, the attempt to ensure coordination through the use o f steering
committees were not particularly effective. Under the current government, there is stronger high
level political commitment to public sector reform as well as more effective intra-governmental
coordination. Therefore the prospects for effective implementation and monitoring o f the public
sector reforms, including the PFPSAL I11agenda, are much better.                                     More detailed information
on the status o f the public sector reform program and expected follow-up actions is presented in
the paragraphs below.

B.        Structural Fiscal Policies

75.       Fiscal adiustment. Strong fiscal performance has been the comerstone o f the economic
program inthe last few years. Fiscal gains were significant in2003, and the primary surplus rose
from 4 percent o f GNP in 2002 to over 6 percent o f GNP in 2003, close to the programmed 6.5
percent target. Although the 2004 budgetpassed inDecember was consistent with the 6.5 percent
primary surplus target, a sizeable gap quickly emerged. The government announced above
inflation increase in minimum wages and it also cut contribution rates for social security to
reduce the additional costs to employers. Inaddition, the government increased pensions by 21
percent, well above the inflation target. These initiatives together with revenue shortfalls relative
to the budget, created a financing gap o f close to 1.7 percent o f GNP. The government
introduced a fiscal package in March 2004 to close the fiscal gap. The Government is
implementing additional measures to meet the primary surplus target o f 6.5 percent o f GNP for
the consolidated public sector-of which 5 percent o f GNP for the central government-set                                         in
the revisedbudget for 2004 (Table 7).

76.       The 2004 fiscal package has two main components: original budget measures and
supplementary budget measures (Box 3).                                To meet the 2004 primary surplus target, the
authorities took a set o f measures inDecember 2003 within the context o f original 2004 budget.
The special communication and transaction taxes as well as surcharge on income taxes have been

                                                       - 26 -


extended for one more year. Motor vehicle taxes were adjusted upward to compensate the
reimbursement of 2003 payments for additional car tax (ruled unconstitutional). In addition,
savings also came from cuts in investment programs, lower value-added tax (VAT) rebates for
pensioners, and by eliminating vacancies when public sector workers leave their positions. The
special appropriation4 has been eliminated. The second set o f measures were introduced with the
supplementary budget in March. The supplementary budget law cuts discretionary spending by
 13 percent across all ministries. The govemment also introduced measures to increase tax
revenues by adjusting excises ofpetroleum products, alcohol and tobacco.

77.      The 2004 fiscal package, total fiscal measures inthe range o f 3.8 percent o f GNP,relies
again heavily o n revenue measures (Box 3). This is of concem given that revenue increases since
the fiscal adjustment began in 2000 have tended to be offset by increases in non-interest
expenditures in subsequent years. Of particular concem i s the sizeable cut in public investment
(3.5 percent of GNP planned compared to 4.3 percent spent o n average over the 2000-02 period).
The development needs of Turkey's young and growing population are such that a larger share
o f public resources will need to be devoted to public investment over the medium term. Another
concem relates to the very large number o f relatively small expenditure measures in the package
which will require rigorous implementation to avoid shortfalls. Efforts to tighten wage policy-
including moderate civil service salary increases, no backward indexation, and limits on the
growth o f the overall public worker wage bill-are             a key element of the fiscal package. Here,
the outcome will hinge o n agreement with the trade unions. Overall, it remains clear that deeper

 Special appropriation is a mechanism o f converting earmarked revenues into appropriation duringthe year.

                                                       - 27 -


and more permanent structural fiscal measures will be needed in order to sustain a high quality
fiscal adjustment including continued implementation o f the tax strategy and public employment
program discussed below. These structural measures will complete and build on the results
achieved so far, including in the areas o f social security reform, energy reform, and reform o f
agriculture support policies under the ERL program. Most o f the elements o f the 2004 fiscal
package have been introduced by the Government in the context o f the 7thReview o f the IMF
Stand-by Arrangement. The Government i s committed to take additional action, if needed to
meet the primary surplus target.

                                         Box 4: Tax Strategy Priorities

Tax Policy
     Simplify and consolidate the indirect tax structure with a VAT with a standard rate and two low rates (1 percent
     for agriculture and 8 percent for other basic consumption goods). Introduce a unifiedspecial consumption tax
     (SCT) that will consolidate the current range o f excise and specific taxes into a single tax charged on a limited
     range of luxury goods. A threshold will be established for obligatory filing o f VAT returns. Earmarking o f
     revenues will be abolished and all revenues from earmarked taxes will be brought into the budget.
     Simplify and consolidate the direct tax regime in line with OECD standards and international best practice.
     Convert tax rebate for wage earners into a tax credit to simplify administration and reduce tax burden on low
     income wage earners. Minimize tax exemptions and exceptions.
0    Harmonize real effective tax rates across all types o f financial instruments and maturities.
     Phase in the full indexation o f the corporate and business income taxes (real interest deduction to replace
     nominal interest deduction). Reduce the scope o f investment incentives, consolidate into a single investment
     allowance rate across sectors and geographic regions, and gradually eliminate withholding tax on these
     allowances. Make the incentive system more transparent and automatic.
0    Overhaul the tax regime for free trade zones. Terminate the corporate tax and payroll tax exemptions. Provide
     reduced corporate tax rate only on condition that separate subsidiaries are established and inward trading i s
     below 15 percent o f sales.
     Adjust taxation offinancial leasing inline with internationally generally accepted accounting practices.

Tax Administration
     Reorganize the General Directorate o f Revenues (GDR) to introduce functional structure in line with OECD
     practice.
     Revise payment scheme for managers and key technical staff and design a bonus and incentive system which
     allows more competitive total remuneration for these positions.
     Upgrade the tax policy department within the MOF.
     Strengthen tax audit management capacity within the MOF by establishing an audit coordination unit and
     upgrade the role o f the audit department in the GDR. Prepare a coordinated annual auditing plan. Develop
     databases for tax audit planning and the use o f information from the taxpayer identification number (TIN)
     system for effective auditing. Design a more comprehensive audit strategy for large taxpayer and improve
     knowledge and database on large taxpayers and their business transactions.
     Develop a strategy for taxpayer services and improvements inrelations between taxpayers and the GDR.
    Upgrade internal audit function for the tax administration reporting directly to the head o f GDR.
     Design and implement program to reduce tax arrears.
    Upgrade the management information systems throughout the GDR.



78.      Tax strategy. A medium-term strategy for improvingthe tax system inTurkey i s inplace
based on a review carried out jointly with the Government (Box 4). The overarching objective
o f the strategy is to improve the stability, transparency and equity o f the tax system through
measures to minimize tax distortions, broaden the tax base and improve the efficiency of tax
administration. This will allow an equivalent amount o f revenue to be raised at lower marginal

                                                - 28 -


tax rates thereby promoting economic growth. The strategy builds on the 1998 tax reform and
 draws on earlier analysis o f the tax system including work carried out under the Bank's Public
 Financial Management Project (PFMP). Earlier studies o f the tax system by the IMF and WB
 and o f the investment environment by FIAS (Foreign Investment Advisory Service) signaled
 concems about the complexity and lack o f transparency o f Turkey's tax system which has been
 exacerbated by tax policy instability coupled with high and unstable inflation rates.          The
proliferation o f special and additional taxes and surcharges as a result o f urgent pressures to
reduce the fiscal deficit contributed to the complexity and instability. Partial inflation indexation
in combination with differential nominal tax rates and investment incentives across financial
instruments distorted real effective tax rates across financial instruments and real business
investments. Investors have identified bureaucratic red tape, delays in processing applications
for licenses or investment allowances and VAT refund claims, and corruption as additional
negative factors affecting investment andbusiness operations.

 79.    Implementation o f the tax strategy is progressing reasonably well. Onthe tax policy side,
a unified SCT to consolidate a range o f excise and specific taxes into a single tax charged on a
limited range o f luxury goods was enacted in June 2002. Implementing circulars for the SCT
law were published in July and the tax came into effect in August 2002. Earmarking o f SCT
revenues was eliminated, with effect from the 2003 budget, through a government decree issued
inJanuary 2003. In April 2003, the Parliament enacted the first legislative package under the
direct tax reform designed to simplify and consolidate the direct tax regime in line with OECD
standards and intemational best practice. This legislation: (i)     harmonizes tax rates on income
from financial investments at the declaration stage, (ii)   simplifies and harmonizes the system o f
investment incentives, (iii)  reforms the system of income tax credits, and (iv) simplifies taxation
o f corporate earnings and dividends.        K e y provisions o f the legislation became effective
immediately and the remaining articles became effective inJanuary 2004.

80.     Subsequently, a second package o f direct tax reform legislation was enacted in January
2004 to minimize geographical,            sectoral,  and other investment incentives-including
rationalizing the benefits in Free Trade Zones.        The Government is strongly committed to
address the problem of taxation o f unrecorded income and has prepared secondary legislation to
require that all large financial transactions take place through the banking system.

81.     The strategy also tackles tax administration issues encompassing institutional
improvements, automation, transparency, compliance, taxpayer services and tax audit.            It is
designed to align Turkey progressively with best practice in other OECD countries.
Implementation o f the tax administration reforms has proceeded somewhat more slowly than
originally envisaged, in large part due to the elections. In a positive step, the audit coordination
committee has been established and a coordinated audit plan for 2003 has been prepared and
implemented. Resources have been included inthe 2004 budget to enhance the audit capacity o f
the GDR. Effective implementation o fthe audit planwill help discourage future tax evasion, but
broader efforts and organizational changes will be required to bring tax administration up to
intemational norms. The functional reorganization o f GDR will be completed by end-2004 as
agreed with the Bank and this structure will be extended to local level. The GDR will be
transformed into a semi-autonomous body within the Ministry o f Finance its Head directly
reporting to the Minister. Tax policy unit will be transferred to the Ministry o f Finance. The
functional reorganization will reorient the GDR from a structure based on administration o f

                                                 - 29 -


 individual taxes to one based on the core functions o f tax administration including taxpayer
 registration, taxpayer services, collections, audit, legal, information technology, and human
 resources (HR).

 82.      Public employment. The comprehensive public employment program initiated under
 PFPSAL i s beginning to generate results. The program i s part o f the longer-term strategy to
modernize the public sector, ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability, and free up resources for
private investmentandjob creation. This strategy includes action to: (i)      withdraw the state from
 direct involvement in productive activities through the restructuring and privatization of SEEs
 and reform of agriculture support policies, (ii)    contain and then gradually eliminate the deficits
 o f the SSIs, (iii)curtail the scope o f the government's contingent liabilities through the
introduction o f an energy market and transparent guidelines for financial and project guarantees
under the new public debt management law, (iv) restructure central govemment agencies and
decentralize additional functions to provincial and local governments incoordination with efforts
to improve governance and financial accountability at the local level, and (v) implement a
comprehensive public employment program, including retrenchment o f SEE employment.
While reducing SEE employment is always difficult and entails social costs, the fiscal
adjustment it supports will reduce crowding out and promote the strategically important
objective of private sector investment and job creation, particularly for Turkey's youth.
Rationalizing SEE employment will also ease the chronic pressure for public sector price
increasesand help pave the way for acceleratedprivatization.

83.      As part o f a broader programof structural measuresbeingundertaken on the expenditure
side, the public sector employment policy has become more comprehensive in 2002 and 2003
and was maintained and strengthened in 2004. The policies for 2004 include: (i)            a cap on the
total number o f civil servants in the central and local government-the       ceiling on new hiring in
the consolidated budget has been set at 40,000; and (ii)limit on replacement hiringinthe SEEs
                                                             a
equal to 10 percent o f attrition and no replacement hiringfor budget-financed SEEs. A quarterly
monitoring system has been established in 2002 which provides a clear picture o f public
employment across the general government for the first time in Turkey (Table 8).                  The
employment figures o fthe consolidated budget agencies, SEEs, local administrations, state banks
and social security institutions are being monitored by a committee chaired by Ministry of
Finance. The employment monitoring mechanism has been extended to all municipalities and
special provincial administrations through circulars published in February and July 2002, and
data has been collected to establish a baseline for end-2001. The quarterly public employment
reports will continue to beprepared andprovided to the Bank in2004.

84.      A key element of the public employment program is to address the over-employment in
the state economic enterprises. At end 2001/early 2002, approximately 15,000 workers were
retired, notified o f their retirement, laid off or converted to private contract status, following the
lifting o f restrictions on the ability o f managers to require public sector workers over 50 years of
age to retire.      In addition, most of the unfilled positions in SEEs were eliminated. The
Government conducted an assessment o f SEE redundancies which indicated 45,800 redundant
positions in the SEE system as of January 2002.            A majority of these redundancies were
eliminated as o f mid-March 2004 and many o f the SEEs were in fact able to reduce the number
o f their workers by more than the figure determined through the redundancy assessment carried

                                                                    - 30 -



out in 2002. The overall attrition from SEESbetweenFebruary 2002 and mid-March 2004 has
reachedto over 59,000.

C.         PublicExpenditureManagement

85.       The key elements of Turkey's multi-year strategy for PEM reform were laid out in the
Strategic Framework for Public Expenditure Management Reform in 2001.                                                    The strategic

                                               - 3 1 -


framework was annexed to the Letter o f Development Policy (LDP) for the first PFPSAL and
remains the basis for the PEM reforms under the PFPSALprogram. The framework i s structured
into three priority areas in support o f core objectives for better PEM, commonly referred to in
international practice as levels 1-3: strengthening aggregate discipline (level l),       building
capacity for policy formulation (level 2), and improving the performance of public agencies
(level 3). The three priorities for PEMreform are to:

0   Reform the processes for budget preparation and execution. This involves steps to: (i)
    improve the transparency and comprehensiveness o f the budget in line with international
    standards, (ii)strengthen the credibility o f the budget preparation process, (iii) capacity
                                                                                     build
    for policy formulation at all levels o f government, and (iv) realize concrete improvements in
    the operational performance o f line ministries and agencies through a progressive shift to
    performance-oriented budgeting.
0   Upgrade public accounting, procurement and audit hnctions to ensure adequate financial
    accountability.    This encompasses legal changes to introduce international fiduciary
    standards, as well as institutional changes to build capacity to implement the new standards
    and shift from formalistic ex ante controlto effective ex post monitoring.
0   Ensure prudent public liability management. This involves legal measures to establish clear
    lines o f borrowing authority and transparent reporting o f public liabilities, as well as
    institutionalmeasures to buildup the capacity for modem fiscal risk management.

86.     The Public Financial Management and Control (PFMC) Law. The PFMC Law, enacted
by the Parliament inDecember 2003, forms the cornerstone of the legal framework for modem
PEMinTurkey. The PFMC law replaces the Public Accounting Law of 1927 (Law No. 1050).
It introduces modern public management principles by clarifying accountability of public
officials, by delegating managerial responsibility and by putting inplace an internal control and
audit framework that i s compatible with EU and international practice. The new PFMC law,
which addresses a number o f weaknesses o f the existing system: (i)incorporates a
comprehensive definition o f public revenue and expenditure encompassing the general
government, (ii)  provides the MOF with clear legal authority to issue budget classification,
accounting and reporting standards for all government agencies, (iii)    introduces a medium term
approach to strategic planning and budget preparation that will apply to all parts o f the central
government, (iv) provides a clear definition o f accountability of ministers and heads o f public
administrations as well as key officials for financial management and performance relative to
policy goals, (v) delegates financial control and internal audit responsibilities to spending
agencies inline with EU standards, (vi) strengthens government accountabilityby extending the
scope and mandate o f external audit by the Turkish Courts of Accounts (TCA) to the entire
general government. The government i s currently preparing secondary legislation and
regulations necessary for implementation o f the provisions of the law. While many aspects o f
this law are expected to be implemented from January 2005, others will be implemented
gradually over the period 2005-07.

BudgetReform

87.     Inline with the government's strategy to achieve comprehensive budget framework, that
supports sound fiscal management, a number o f steps have been taken to improve the

                                               - 32 -



classification and reporting o f fiscal activity o f the general government and to integrate extra-
budgetary items into the budget.

88.     Budget classification. Until recently, Turkey lacked the functional classification of
government expenditure that is recommended by the IMF's Manual on Government Financial
Statistics (GFS) and which i s essential for policy analysis o f expenditure. Introduction o f the
new GFS has improved budget transparency by allowing for a comprehensive and consistent
presentation o f the budget across all general government agencies with a complete functional
breakdown of expenditure.        The GFS classification, including the ten sector functional
classification has been applied in the 2004 Budget for consolidated budget agencies. The
expansion o f the GFS to the rest o f central government will be implementedinthe 2006 budget.
Current plans are also to expand the GFS to the rest o f general government, i.e.socia1 security
institutions and the local administrations, by the 2006 budget. Turkey now has the full
complement o f internationally standard budget classification.

89.     Budgetary and EBFs. All budgetary funds, with the exception o f the Support Price
Stabilization Fund (DFIF) linked to the reform o f the agriculture sales cooperative unions
(ASCUS), and all but five extra budgetary funds (EBFs) (Social Solidarity Fund, Defense Fund,
Promotion and Publicity Fund, SDIF, and Privatization Fund) were eliminated by legislation in
2000 and 2001. Despite formal closure o f the funds, the system o f earmarked revenues and
expenditures associatedwith them has remained largely inplace. This has been done by keeping
open the accounts o f the closed funds and using the mechanism o f special appropriations
whereby earmarked revenues to these accounts are written as special appropriations for the
spending agencies concerned during the course o f the year. To meet the initial objectives o f
improved fiscal control, transparency, accountability and comprehensiveness o f the budget, the
Government intends to terminate the use o f the special appropriations mechanism, close the
accounts linked to the closed funds and incorporate their earmarked revenues into the general
revenuebase. This will be accomplished through legislationwhich is expected to be enacted by
end-June 2004. For the remaining EBFs (excluding the SDIF for which measures are being
taken under the financial sector reform program), the following measures have been incorporated
into the PFMC law: (i)   incorporation o f EBF budgets inthe budget o f the related administration
submitted to Parliament for approval; (ii)   inclusion o f the remaining EBFs under the internal
control and audit regime as well as extemal audit by the TCA; and (iii)      monthly reporting o f
EBFoperations on aconsolidated basis with the central government.

90.     Rationalization and reform o f revolving funds which represent another form o f off-
budget activity, is progressing. Through consolidation by agency, the numbero f revolving funds
was reduced from about 2,650 inmid-2001 to about 1,400 by end-March 2002. The PFMC Law
confirms  the government's intention to eliminate all revolving fund revenues within general
government by end-2007. Untiltheir elimination, revolving fund revenues and expenditures will
be incorporated into the budget o f each government agency and reported in the budget
submission to Parliament.

91.     Budget preparation. Relative to the situation prior to 2001, the government has made
steady improvements in the budget preparation process over the past few years with better
central guidance to budget preparation by line ministries. The framework for these actions was
established under the PFPSAL by a HighPlanning Council (HPC) decision issued in June 2001

                                                                      - 33 -


to accompany the Prime Minister's Budget Call. The HPC decision provided a macro-fiscal
 framework for 2002 budget preparation and established indicative ceilings for both the recurrent
 and investment budgets for ministries and line agencies based on an indexation formula applied
to the actual budget allocations that each ministry and line agency received in2001. As a further
 step, the Prime Minister's Budget Call for the 2003 and 2004 budgets included individually
 specified indicative ceilings for each ministry and line agency, based on the experience with the
2002 budget preparation process. The PFMC law now proposes a significant upgrading o f
budget preparation through the adoption o f a formal medium term approach to budgeting which
is widely followed in other OECD countries. Under this approach, budget preparation will be
based on a medium term economic program to be endorsed by the Council o f Ministers and a
medium term fiscal strategy that will be reviewed and ratified by the High Planning Council.
The political commitment to a medium term fiscal strategy is expected to reinforce fiscal
discipline and management and provide the basis for improved strategic allocation o f budgetary
resources to priorities.                    This approach is expected to be introduced in the 2006 budget
preparation cycle which will commence in mid-2005.                                         The government expects to receive
technical guidance and support for this new approach from the Ministry o f Finance o f the
Netherlands and is currently negotiatingthe project agreement for this support.

92.         Public Investment Program (PIP). Inline with commitments under the program, the 2002
PIP cut the average completion time to 8.5 years, a 32 percent reduction from the 12.5 year
average completion time in 2001 (adjusted for the higher than expected devaluation and
inflation). Overall, 353 individual projects and 649 subprojects were dropped from the PIP and
the rationalization reduced the total cost o f the PIP by TL 36.9 quadrillion. This rationalization
was based on a Public Investment Review (PR) carried out by SPO in 2001 with support from
the Bank. An action plan for further rationalization o f the PIP in 2003-04 prepared by SPO was
adopted by the HPC in October 2002.                                  The plan includes quantitative targets for further

                                                      - 34 -



reductions in average project completion time o f at least 3 percent per year starting from the 8.5
year baseline established in 2002.            It also outlines steps to strengthen the role o f formal
costhenefit analysis in the project approval process and establish a framework for project
monitoring and evaluation.         An assessment prepared by SPO in May 2003 confirmed the
reduction in the average project completion time in the 2002 PIP and indicated a hrther
reduction inthe average completion time to an estimated 7.6 years in the 2003 PIP along with a
continued reduction in the number o f projects (Table 9)5. Following the budgetary cut in the
context o f fiscal measures required to meet the end-year primary surplus target, the Government
expects a transitory increase in the average completion time to 8.6 years in 2004 due to reduced
investment program allocation. In order to contain this increase and reduce the average project
completion time further, the Government plans to revise the action plan prepared in 2002 and
strengthenthe implementation o f the new plan.

93.     Policy formulation.      The 2001 PER noted that the institutional processes for policy
formulation and management, both in ministries and at the level o f the Council o f Ministers,
were weak and had been neglected due to the highturnover o f governments. It is important both
to ensure that the capacity o f ministries and departments to propose policy in line with strategic
objectives is strengthened and also to establish a more disciplined process for policy decision
making by the Council o f Ministers. The PFMC law underlines the need for such institutional
and capacity strengthening by requiring the fiscal implications o f new policies to be estimated
and for decisions to be made consistent with the medium term fiscal strategy.

94.    The Government has made progress with regard to building the capacity for strategic
planning and policy formulation in public agencies. The PFMC law requires ministries to
undertake a strategic planning exercise in order to clarify policy goals and performance
objectives and to prepare budget requests. The draft Public Administration Framework law
which is before Parliament proposes the administrative restructuring and processes to support
such functions. The SPO has issued guidelines for strategic planning by key line ministries and
departments including guidelines for costing policies. In July 2003, the High Planning Council
issued a decision announcing the launch o f the strategic planning initiative on a pilot basis in
eight agencies representing various parts o f general government (Table 10). With guidance and
support from SPO, the eight agencies are expected to finalize their strategic plans during 2004
with a view to reflecting these plans in the 2005 Budget. Based on the experiences o f these


 The number o fnew projects were reduced to 1032 in2003 from 1234 in2001.

                                                - 35 -


 pilots a phased program to expand strategic planning to the rest o f govemment will be prepared
 and implemented.

 95.      Until recently there has not been adequate attention given to the need to strengthen the
 capacity for policy management at the center o f government. This will be critical to the success
 o f the medium term approach to budget management. Good practice examples can be studied
 from across the OECD and other well functioning governments to derive a design that i s
 appropriate for the Turkish institutional context. The restructuring o f government required under
 the PAF law will provide a good opportunity to implement the necessary arrangements to
 support effective decision makingby the Council o f Ministers and the HighPlanning Council.

 96.      Operational performance. Under the original PEM strategy, the government introduced
 in 2002 a pilot program on improving operational performance in specific projects in six
 agencies that was designed to draw lessons for understanding the reIationship between strategic
planning and goal setting, budgetary predictability, financial management and operational
performance. The Ministry o f Finance is evaluating the experience o f this pilot to date and will
prepare an interim report inthis regard. Since performance improvements require time to bear
 fruit, it will be necessary to continue this initiative over some more years in order to draw real
 lessons regardingthe conditions necessary for better public sector performance.

 97.      A number o f reasons, includingthe desire o f the new government to initiate performance
improvements in government, prompted a broader effort to institute performance oriented
management starting from 2005. As noted earlier, the new PFMC law proposes a fundamentally
new framework for public management that includes strategic agency level planning and
performance related budgeting in government. By clarifying accountability of heads o f public
administrations, requiring spending agencies to define their performance goals and requiring the
submission o f accountability reports for performance, the new framework highlights the focus on
performance.      In order to enable achievement o f goals the framework proposes delegating
managerial and financial authority while ensuring that it is backstoppedby an adequate system o f
internal control and audit.     In this respect, the law proposes an ambitious expansion of the
original reform program. The government has been advised by the Bank and other agencies to
consider a phased approach to these reforms since they are complex and management intensive.
Its implementation is a long term challenge but the government is currently considering the
introduction o f key enabling steps.

98.      InJuly 2003, the HighPlanning Council selected eight general govemment agencies,
including a provincial and a municipal administration, to be part o f a pilot initiative to introduce
strategic planning and performance related budgeting and management in government (Table
10). The SPO and the MOF have been providing guidance to the eight agencies with a view to
completing their strategic plans by June 2004 and to prepare their 2005 budgets on that basis.
Carehl design, pragmatic adjustments and managerial follow-through will be important for the
successfil implementation o f these reforms.

99.      Future budget reforms. The core priorities o f the budget reform-particularly    the level 1
reforms in support o f greater comprehensiveness and transparency-will         be accomplished by
2006 based on ongoing reforms. The emphasis, as indicated by the discussion above on medium
term budgeting and performance oriented management, is now shifting to level 2 and level 3

                                              - 36 -


 issues in support o f improved public service delivery.     The new public finance framework
 established by the PFMC law defines an ambitious and comprehensive agenda for reform
 implementation over the next 3-5 years. Commencing in 2005, the government will be engaged
 in implementation o f the new decentralized internal financial control system with the
 appointment o f financial controllers and internal auditors in line ministries. Preparations to
develop the necessary secondary legislation and guidelines are underway during 2004 with
technical assistance from the French Ministry o f Finance under an EU-supported "twinning"
project.   Similarly, the government has sought technical assistance from the Netherlands
Ministry o f Finance with regard to preparations for the introduction o f a medium term approach
to budgeting and performance basedmanagement.

FinancialAccountabilitv

 100.   Modernization o f Turkey's system o f public financial accountability in line with
international standards is an urgent PEM priority. As detailed in the August 2001 Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), some o f the basic buildingblocks appear to be in
place: an established legal framework; reliable, albeit fragmented, accounting processes; regular
reporting o f financial results; an apparently independent Supreme Audit Institution (SAI), the
TCA, which reports to Parliament; a relatively open system o f accountability and plenty o f
skilled personnel. However, deeper analysis reveals significant problems and lack o f systemic
coherence. Complex institutional relationships, multiple sources o f public funds, heavy emphasis
on ex ante controls and inadequate reporting to the legislature reduce transparency and weaken
financial management. The accounting law which governs public sector accounting dates from
1927, and procurement legislation has not kept up with evolving international standards. Similar
to the budget, the audit system is fragmented with many bodies besides the T C A carrying out
activities analogous to external inspection and audit.

101.    Accounting. Inthe last few years, Turkey has made systematic and conscious efforts to
reform the public accounting system. This began with the introduction of an automated on-line
accounting system, called Say2000i,in more than 1500 accountancies spread across the country.
A commendable aspect o f the automated accounting system is that it was developed completely
by MOF in-house IT department without outside technical and financial assistance. Under this
internet based system, the MOF's central accounting database contains data on all individual
transactions wherever they occur in the system. Recording o f every transaction in a secure
information system, automated internal controls, and real time recording capacity are among the
main benefits derived from the automated system. The system is capable o f producing periodic
financial statements without any delay and thus provide the decision makers with up-to-date
financial information.

102.    The initiative to introduce modified accrual accounting in line with the new GFS (2001)
requirements is makingprogress. However, this exercise has turned out to be quite complex and
will take more time to complete than initially envisaged under the PFPSAL program. A policy
paper on accrual accounting prepared by MOF was published inNovember 2002. The MOF has
also prepared a regulation referring to accounting policies and principles, and containing
framework accounting standards and a framework chart o f accounts. Beginning 2004, the
accounting system has begun capturing acquisition o f new assets and creation o f liabilities.
However, valuation o f existing assets (including heritage assets) andthe depreciation policies are

                                              - 37 -



yet to be worked out. Based in part on the experiences from the pilots, the timetable for the
rolling out modified accrual system has been revised and is now as follows: .(i)          introduce
modified accrual accounting in consolidated budget entities in 2004, (ii)      begin introduction of
modified-accrual basis in entities outside the consolidated budget in 2005. The government
accounting standards board to be established, as required under the PFMC law, will be
responsible for transforming the framework standards included in the accounting regulation into
full-fledged accounting standards over time.

 103.    Procurement. Turkey has moved decisively to upgrade its public procurement legislation
and practices in line with international standards. The new public procurement law was enacted
in January 2002 and subsequently amended inJune 2002. The new law is based on the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model and moves Turkey inthe
direction o f compliance with EU standards. The law covers all goods, works, and services-
with the exception o f military contracts-and     encompasses both budgetary and non-budgetary
procurement. It is applicable to central and local government agencies, as well as SEEs. The
law establishes thresholds above which foreign bidders cannot be restricted and a domestic
preference o f 15 percent can be applied.         The new law also stipulates the qualification
requirements (including technical and financial criteria) for contractors which will supersede the
existing contractor certificate system. The independent Public Procurement Board and Agency
(PPA) established under the law to oversee public procurement and ensure enforcement o f the
new procurement standards is fully operational. The Bank is providing technical assistance to
the PPA under an Institutional Development Fund(IDF) grant and the EUis also providing grant
assistance. The secondary legislation required under the Law has been issued by the PPA.
Although the new Government initially considered delaying implementation of the law or
amending key provisions, inthe end, the new procurement standards came into force on January
1, 2003 as scheduled. InJuly 2003, a set o f further amendments was enacted which authorized
limitedprocurement by SEEs under commercial practices. InApril 2004, further amendment was
made to exempt from the law certain categories o f procurement transactions conduced by the
Privatization Administration (PA), resolve difficulties experienced bythe PA inconducting those
transactions; procurement transactions o f a commercial nature undertaken by Turkish Airlines
were also exempted by the same amendment. New procurement legislation for SEEs in the
public utilities sectors consistent with the relevant EU directive is now being prepared. These
initiatives are being closely coordinated with the Bank.

104.     Auditing.    Effective financial accountability requires extensive modernization o f
Turkey's public audit system. The objectives o f reforms in the external audit are: (a) to extend
the mandate o f Turkish Court o f Accounts (TCA) to the entire general government; (b) to end
TCA's involvement in budget execution; and (c) to transform T C A into an effective supreme
audit institution operating in accordance with recognized international standards. These
objectives have been facilitated by enactment of the PFMC law. With regard to external audit,
the PFMC law clarifies the roles and responsibilities o f the line agencies, the MOF and the TCA,
and establishes a principle o f accountability which extends to the heads o f public
administrations. It also requires T C A to focus on ex-post financial and performance audit. With
regard to the transformation o f TCA, the law: (a) includes all consolidated budget agencies under
TCA's annual audit as required by the Constitution, includingthe Presidency and Parliament; (b)
subjects TCA's own accounts to external audit with reports submitted to the Parliament; and (c)

                                               - 38 -



expands the scope o f TCA audits to cover the entire general government agencies and
institutionswith a transition period.

 105.   As with any major institutional reform, the transformation o f TCA into a modem
Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) must be carefully designed to build consensus with the public
administration. A key objective o f the transition period in the PFMC law i s to provide time for
this consensus to be established and for the TCA to reform itself. The TCA will use this
transition period to undertake internal reforms to align its institutional structure with
international standards for SAIs, to upgrade its audit capabilities, and to reach consensuswith the
other government audit bodies on implementation o f the reform. A draft action plan for the
TCA's internal reform has been prepared and will be improved, including through a peer review
byauditors from other European SAIs. The actionplanwill encompassthe definition of an audit
regime for entities such as autonomous bodies which precludes the application of TCA's judicial
process to the officials concerned. I t will also address the role o f other existing audit institutions
in the transformation of TCA into a full SAI. Among these institutions the Prime Ministry's
HighAudit Boardwhich currently audits the social security institutions andthe SEES.

106.    The Government is also drafting a new TCA law inline with the external audit structure
underthe PFMC Law. The proposedamendments will significantly alter the existing TCA law in
several respects. First, the amendments envisage a further extension o f TCA's mandate to cover
the general government institutions and also the State Owned Enterprises and to certain other
bodies which use public funds or provide public services. Second, the draft law defines
performance and financial audit together with compliance audit as the types o f audit to be
performedby the TCA. The proposed amendments will have a profound impact on the working
of the TCA by enhancing the emphasis on audit work from the current focus on compliance
audits andjudicial work. The new legislationwill be submittedto Parliament by December 2004.

PublicLiabilitVManagement

107.    Efforts to improve public liability management under the PEM reform strategy focus on
strengthening debt management and containing the spread of contingent liabilities.                These
actions complement the energy reforms supported by the ERL that are tackling a key source o f
contingent liabilities in the form o f government guaranteed Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT)
contracts, as well as the banking reforms under the PFPSAL program that address the buildup o f
quasi-fiscal and contingent liabilities inthe banking system which triggered the February crisis.
Measures to strengthen public liability management will address other important sources o f
contingent liabilities and quasi-fiscal losses, including those arising from take-or-pay contracts
for natural gas imports, non-energy BOT projects, and guarantees to municipal and local
governments. Table 11presents information on the guaranteeportfolio o fthe Treasury.

108.    The new Law on Public Finance and Debt Management, enacted in March 2002, has
established the foundation for a comprehensive risk management framework in Turkey. The
new Law: (i)confirmed that the Treasury is the single borrowing authority for the central
government; (ii)created a more prudent and transparent framework for the management of
government guarantees; and (iii)      established a risk account in the budget, starting with the 2003
Budget, to cover the expected fiscal cost o f called guarantees and unexpected losses from other
fiscal risks.     In accordance with the law, more .stringent regulations for the issuance of
government guarantees and for borrowing by SEESwere issued inApril 2002. The Treasury has
established a new "Middle Office" for public liability and risk management. The circular on
establishment o f the middle office and a Public Debt Committee to set policy within the
Treasury, originally published in September 2002, was reissued in January 2003 with a strong
emphasis on the risk control function o f the middle office. The new institutional structure for

                                                       - 40 -


public liability management i s now in place and fully operational. Furthermore, the Middle
Office has launched monthly fiscal risk monitoring notes for the Treasury Management, and
since April 2003 publishes quarterly Public Debt Management Reports covering risks coming
from both its direct debt and contingent liabilities.                 A review o f the government guarantee
portfolio was completed in June 2003, providing a preliminary valuation o f the guarantee
portfolio. The Middle Office updates this valuation on a quarterly basis. Starting from January
2004 it has also been implementing strategic risk benchmarks and medium-term borrowing
scenarios to manage the portfolio o f direct govemment debt.

109.     The Government aims to continue strengthening its capacity in public liability
management. To this end, the Government formulated a two-year capacity-building program
supported by a grant from the WB's IDF in the amount o f US$320,000. Within the context o f
this IDF program, consultants are being identified to assist the Treasury's Middle Office in
examining the best international practices in debt and risk management, in strengthening its
financial and fiscal risk management practices, and in formulating optimal institutional
arrangements for managing the govemment liability portfolios.

D.       PublicSector Governance

110.     Actions to improve public sector govemance aim to reduce political influence over
economic management and upgrade the quality and effectiveness o f Turkey's public sector.
This agenda includes the preparation and implementation o f a national anti-comption strategy as
well as the launch o f a comprehensive civil service reform. These actions complement and are
integratedwith the structural fiscal reforms andPEMreforms discussed earlier.

 111.   Anti-corruption strategy.      A national strategy to enhance transparency and good
 governance in the public sector was published in March 2002 under the slogan "A Transparent
 and Clean Turkey: Together Hand in Hand". The objective o f the strategy is to provide a
 comprehensive framework for improving governance and reducing political influence over the
 economy which establishes clear priorities and benchmarks, and empowers and energizes public
 opinion to fight corruption. Priorities under the national anti-comption strategy are summarized
 inBox 5. The new Government is strongly committed to improve public sector governance in
 Turkey. The basic structure and actions o f this strategy has been reflected in the recent Urgent
 Action Plan (UAP) o f the Government. The Government is undertaking efforts to improve
public awareness about good governance and is counting on the active contribution o f national
non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The Government is committed to implementation o f
 the UAP which is in line with the framework set out in the national strategy. The ministerial
 committee for enhancing transparency and improving good governance was established inMarch
2003. The committee will steer relevant actions o f both the UAP and national strategy in this
reform area. The responsibility for implementation o f each action is clearly specified in the
UAP. The ministerial committee will prepare regular implementation reports for the national
 strategy within the context o f the UAP. Among a comprehensive set of substantive actions was
the enactment o f the L a w on "Freedom o f Information for Citizens" in October 2003. The
Government recognizes that this law provides an important new basis for enabling citizens to
monitor the performance of public sector. Legislation establishing a code o f conduct for civil
servants i s expected to be passed by end-July.       The Government is counting on the active
involvement o f national NGOs to improve public awareness about good governance. One o f the
major national NGOs, Foundation for Economic and Social Studies (TESEV), has completed
two diagnostic surveys co-sponsored by the Bank on corruption covering households and the
business community respectively. Work on a third survey covering civil servants was delayed
bythe local elections.

 112.   Civil service reform. Sustained improvements in public governance will hinge in large
part on effective reform o f the civil service. Indeed, civil service reform features prominently in
the national anti-corruption strategy and features in the UAP. Civil service reform is vital to
raising the quality o f public services and ensuring the quality o f the fiscal adjustment.     The
Government has already initiated work on a norm cadre system to establish benchmarks for
staffing in public agencies which is now operational within the MONE. There is widespread
acknowledgement that a more complete, medium-term approach is needed in order to adapt the
civil service to the changing role o f government in Turkey and to internalize the on-going
reforms to PEM. Inaddition to questions about the size and composition o f the civil service in a
changing Turkey, the reform will need to address issues such as distorted salary incentives,
career development requirements and inadequate operational budgets in most agencies.
Preparations for the functional review were initiated inmid-2002, but then delayed by the run-up
to elections. The functional review has now been re-launched under the responsibility o f SPO
and the report will be submitted to the Government in July 2004. The Government is cognizant
o f the potential impact o f the measures in the Public Administration Framework Law on the
implementation o fboth civil service reform and the results o f the functional reviews. It intends to
examine carefully how these processes can effectively be aligned with one another, without
slowing down the process o f implementation.

       9 PFPSAL 11: Under the tax strategy, Special Consumption Tax was introduced and the first direct
          tax reform package was enacted to harmonize personal and corporate income tax regimes. Public
          employment monitoring system became fully functional. Under the SEE redundancy program,
          28,000 redundancies out o f the 45,800 identified had been eliminated.

       9 PFPSAL 111:Functional reorganization of the GeneralDirectorate of Revenues will be completed
          by end-2004 and this structure will start to be extended to the local level. A majority of the SEE
          redundancies were eliminated as o f mid-March 2004 and many o f the SEEs were in fact able to
          reduce the number o f their workers by more than the determined redundancy figure. The overall
          attrition from SEEs betweenFebruary 2002 and mid-March 2004 has reachedto over 59,000.


0PublicExpenditureManagement
       9 PFPSAL11:Thepilotprogramfor the GFSbasedbudgetclassification was underway. Inthe 2002
          budget, most extra-budgetary funds and all but one budgetary funds were closed, although the
          special accounts linked to many o f these funds remained inplace. The Government rationalized the
          Public Investment Program significantly, cutting the average completion time by 32 percent in2002
          to 8.5 years. The average completion time was further reduced in 2003 to an estimated 7.6 years.
          The say2000i automated accounting system for consolidated budget agencies went on-line in
          January 2002. The new modified accrual chart o f accounts was being piloted within consolidated
          budget agencies. The new public procurement agency became operational and the new public
          procurement law went into effect in January 2003 as planned. Law on Public Finance and Debt
          Management was enacted followed by secondary legislationto tight government guarantees. A new
          Debt Management office was established.

       9 PFPSAL 111: The PFMC Law was enacted in December 2003, which incorporates modern
          principles o f public management and addresses a number o f weaknesses inthe current system (see
          para. 86). The government is currently preparing secondary legislation and regulations necessary for
          implementation o f the provisions o f the law. Legislation to terminate the special appropriations
          mechanism close the accounts linked to the closed funds and incorporate their earmarked revenues
          into the general revenue base has been submittedto the Council o f Ministers inM a y 2004. The PIP
          rationalization action plan will be revised and strengthened in 2004 to reduce the average project
          completion time. The new accounting regulation for general government in compliance with GFS
          requirements was published inthe official gazette o n November 19, 2003. Government Accounting
          Standards Board will be established by December 2004. A satisfactory new TCA law clearly
          defining the scope and types o f audits, in conformity with the PFMC law, will be submitted to
         Parliament.


0PublicSector Governance
      >  PFPSAL 11: A national strategy to enhance transparency and good governance in the public sector
         was published in March 2002 whose main elements are reflected in the Urgent Action Plan (UAP)
         o f the new Government. The ministerial committee for enhancing transparency and improving good
         governance was established in March 2003. Work on civil service reform was revitalized under the
         UAP. The draft functional review was preparedby SPO.

      9 PFPSAL 111: The Law on "Freedom of Information for Citizens" was enacted in October 2003.
         Legislation establishng a code o f conduct for civil servants will be passed by end-July 2004. The
         final functional review report will be submitted to the government inJuly 2004.

113.     PFPSAL I11will provide continued support to the government's program. Under the
proposed PFPSAL 111, implementation o f the public sector reform program will be deepened
considerably, completing and going beyond the agenda set under PFPSAL 11. The PFMC Law,
enacted by the Parliament in December 2003, forms the cornerstone o f the legal framework for
modern public expenditure management in Turkey. With the legal framework in place, reform
implementation is expected to accelerate prior to release o f the second tranche o f PFPSAL 111.
Inthe structural fiscal reform area, functional reorganizationofthe GDR, implementation ofthe
comprehensive public employment program, enactment o f satisfactory EBF law are all expected
to be completed by the end o f 2004. In parallel, the Ministry o f Finance will prepare the
performance budgeting guidelines and the Government Accounting Standards Board will be
established. A new T C A law clearly defining the scope and types o f audits, in conformity with
the PFMC law will be submitted to the Parliament. Finally, an initial set o f legislation is
expected to be adopted in line with the national anti-comption strategy and preparation of the
civil service reform strategy is scheduled to be completed by the end o f the year.      Box 6
illustrates the key actions completed under PFPSAL I1prior to cancellation o f the second and

115.    The CAS envisions a high-case lending program of US$4.5 billion and a low case
lending of US$1.3 billion. Under the high case lending program, IBRD debt outstanding and
disbursed(DOD) would increase to about US$8 billionin2006. This would represent about 7.4
percent o f the IBRD portfolio, up fkom 3.0 percent in 2000. Financial markets perceive Turkey
as a risky country, as seen in the premium on Turkish dollar Eurobonds over LIBOR.
Additionally, Turkey has a high external debt burden, with a debt service ratio inthe 40 percent
range. Debt service to preferred creditors as a share o f external public debt service i s expected to
reach about 40 percent, while IBRD debt service as a percentage o f exports o f goods and
services will remainmodest, at 1.2 percent in2006.

116.    Turkey's financial and public sector reform program meets all criteria for programmatic
lending.6 The proposed PFPSAL I11 and follow-up programmatic loans would continue to
support the Government's medium-term reform program which emphasizes structural, policy
and institutionalreforms inthe financial and public sectors.

117.    Building on the progress achieved under PFPSAL and PFPSAL 11, the PFPSAL 111
program will help Turkey achieve sustainable poverty reduction through macroeconomic
stability and growth. The program is articulated in detail in the attached Letter of Development
Policy (LDP) (Annex IV). The actions taken prior to Board presentation o f PFPSAL 111and
those expected to be taken prior to release o f the second tranche o f the loan are specified in the
policy matrix (Annex V). The program i s supported by extensive economic sector work.

 Reforms implemented under the program are helping to maintain the confidence earned by the
 new government which has demonstrated its determination to resolve the pending structural
 weaknesses which caused significant instability inthe past.


 B.      The Bank'sFinancialSector AssistanceStrategy

 118.    The Bank's assistance to Turkey in the financial sector i s aimed at assisting the
 authorities incontinuing the reform of the sector. The ultimate result beingpursued is a safe and
 sound financial sector that will not constitute a source o f macroeconomic risk and which will
 increasingly finance the investments required for the economy to grow.

 119.    The first phase o f financial sector reform following the 2001 banking crisis focused on
 urgent priorities including bringing the regulatory and institutional framework o f the banking
 sector closer to international best practice, restructuring and cleaning up the private banks, and
the financial and operational restructuring o fthe state banks.

 120.    A degree o f stability has been achieved inthe banking sector, and the emphasis is now on
consolidation and sustainability of the remaining reforms required to develop the sector. The
next phase o f reform, supported under PFPSAL 111, focuses primarily on making the banking act
 fully consistent with EU principles and strengthening and increasing the independence o f the
Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) and the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund
(SDIF), privatization o f the state banks, sales o f non performing assets held by the SDIF, and
improving the EBA.

 121.    The Bank's strategy is based on the notion that development o f a broader and deeper
financial sector i s essential for sustained financial stability and economic growth. This will be
essential to improve real sector access to a wider range o f modem financial products and
services; to improve access to finance for a broad range o f economic agents, including SMEs,
micro-enterprises and low income earners; andto reduce the systemic risks inthe financial sector
through diversification. Completion o f the reform agenda in the banking sector is key for the
ongoing process o f economic recovery.

 122.    This Bank's support for financial sector reform started under the F S A L and continued
with the PFPSAL Iand I1 and the proposed PFPSAL 111. Two subsequent Programmatic
Financial Sector Adjustment Loans (PFSAL Iand 11) are planned, the first falling in the current
CAS period. The reform program supported by this sequence o f loans have and will strengthen
the foundation for an efficient and healthy banking system that could be competitive in quality
and performance at the international level; reduce its vulnerability to external shocks; and
position Turkey's banking system for EU accession. PFPSAL 111, as the two previous Loans,
focuses on: (i)  the legal and regulatory framework for banking; (ii) privatization o f state-
                                                                         the
owned banks; and (iii)creditor rights and corporate restructuring.        PFSAL Iwill assist in
completing this agenda and in regulatory issues related to capital markets, insurance and other
non-bank financial institutions. During this CAS period, the Bank will also prepare a SME
Finance Loan which will provide financing for investments required for increasing access to
investment capital by SMEs. These investments will trigger rapid harvesting o f the benefits that
will follow the policyreforms supported under PFPSAL I11andPFSAL.

                                             - 4 1-

123.    The Bank's assistance has been and will continue to be closely coordinated with
International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Bank
has taken the lead with respect to the reform o f the legal framework and regulations for bank
supervision, the institutional development o f the regulatory bodies, and the reforms required to
restructure and improve the governance o f the state banks leading to their ultimate privatization
as well as the sector work on non-bank financial institutions. The IFC strategy focuses on: (i)
assisting the authorities with the sale o f intervened banks, as appropriate, and o f the non-
perfonning loans o f these banks; (ii) working with mid-sized banks to strengthen their balance
sheets and to use them as a platform in the consolidation process; (iii)    continuing with efforts
aimed at institution building and the introduction o f new products. The IMF has taken the lead
inassessing the soundness ofthe banking system andwhere there has beenan immediate macro-
fiscal impact such as the re-capitalization of the state banks, the closing o f insolvent banks, and
the private bank re-capitalization scheme.

 C.     The Bank's Public Sector Assistance Strategy

 124.   The Bank's public sector assistance strategy is based on a carefully sequenced series of
 lending operations backed by extensive economic and sector work and other non-lending
 services,   Drawing a lesson from experience, the current assistance strategy exploits the
 advantages o f the programmatic approach to support a comprehensive medium-term program to
modernize the public sector for which political support has been obtained in advance from the
highest levels o f government. The emphasis inthe early stages of the program has beenon the
preparation o f medium-term strategies underpinned by economic sector work in the critical
reform areas (including PEM, taxation, public employment, and anti-corruption).                 The
articulation o f these strategies and the involvement o f high-level steering committees in their
formulation and implementationhas helpedbuildboth intemal consensus as well as the political
and bureaucratic muscle needed to ensure effective implementation. Elements of the Bank's
strategy o f lending andnon-lending assistanceinthe public sector are presented inFigure 4.

 125.   ERL - 2000. The first phase of the reform was supported by the ERL. It involved
measures to underpin the initial fiscal adjustment in 1999-2000, and a first round o f budget
reforms including closure of two groups o f budgetary EBFs inDecember 1999 and March 2001.
The ERL program also encompasses implementation o f the structural reform agenda for social
security, energy, agriculture and telecommunications which helps underpinthe fiscal adjustment
and contain the growth o f quasi-fiscal and contingent liabilities. The analyticalbasis for the ERL
program was provided in large part by the CEM on Structural Reforms for Sustainable Growth
(September 2000) which confirmed the public deficit as the core source o f macroeconomic
instability inTurkey and detailed reforms insupport o f fiscal adjustment and growth.

126.    PFPSAL - 2001. The second phase o f the public sector reform was initiated by work on
the PER which provided an in-depth diagnosis o f the operational and institutional problems
confrontingpublic sector management and outlined a strategic framework for PEM reform. The
PEIRwas complemented by due diligence economic and sector work inthe form o f the Country
Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) and Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) which reviewed the status of financial accountability in Turkey and developed
recommendations for reform. This analytical work provided much o f the analytical framework
for the first PFPSAL approved in July 2001. The first PFPSAL focused on establishing the
strategy for a full-scale public sector reform program including the strategic framework for PEM
reform developed inthe PEIR, a strategy for deeper structural fiscal reforms centered on tax and
public employment policy, and the preparation o f a national anti-comption strategy. Inaddition
to economic and sector work, the Bank supported this effort through two international
conferences designed to increase public awareness and expose Turkey to international
experience andbest practice.

127.    PFPSAL I1 2002. The PFPSAL I1initiated the shift from design o f the public sector
                      -
reform strategy to reform implementation, particularly improvements to the legal framework and
a first phase o f institution building. Milestones under the PFPSAL I1program included: (i)
rationalization o f the PIP, (ii)
                               enactment o fthe new public procurement law and establishment o f
the PPA, (iii) enactment o f the public debt management law and creation o f the middle office for
debt and risk management inthe Treasury, and (iv) preparation of the PFMC Law which is the
cornerstone for modernizationo f fiscal management inTurkey.

128.    PFPSAL I11 - 2004. Under the proposed PFPSAL 111, implementation o f the public
sector reform program will be deepened considerably, completing and going beyond the agenda
set under PFPSAL 11. The PFMC Law, enacted by the Parliament inDecember 2003, forms the
comerstone o f the legal framework for modem public expenditure management inTurkey. With
the legal framework inplace, reform implementation i s expected to accelerate prior to release o f
the second tranche of PFPSAL 111. Inthe structural fiscal reform area, functional reorganization
o f the GDR, implementation o f the comprehensive public employment program, enactment o f
satisfactory EBF law are all expected to be completed by the end o f 2004.              In parallel, the
Ministry of Finance will prepare the performance budgeting guidelines and the Government
Accounting Standards Board will be established. A new T C A law clearly defining the scope and
types o f audits, in conformity with the PFMC law is submitted to the Parliament. Finally, an
initial set o f legislation i s expectedto be adopted inline with the national anti-corruption strategy
and preparation o f the civil service reform is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.

129.    PPSAL Iand I1- 2004-06. The assistance strategy going forward envisages two PPSALs
under the CAS to support continued implementation o f the public sector reform agenda. The
PPSAL Ienvisages to support a          " four pillar'' comprehensive, efficient, inclusive and modem
social security system. The four pillars are: (a) unified pension system, (b) universal health
insurance, (c) modem labor market and employment services system, and (d) efficient social
assistance and social services system. The PPSAL Imay also include support for the completion
o f PFPSAL reforms. Buildingupon the seminal Public Administration Law, the PPSAL I1will
support the recently initiated public administration reform. Reforms to local government will be
another area for consideration drawing on the analysis and recommendations o f the Municipal
Sector Review completed in 2002. The PPSALs will also be grounded on the analysis in the
C E M focused on economic recovery and medium-term growth completed in2003.

D.     Program Triggers and Outcome Indicators

130.   The Bank is supporting Turkey's financial and public sector reform program through a
series o f Programmatic Adjustment Loans. The triggers for the proposed PPSAL and PFSAL
operations to follow on PFPSAL 3 are presented in Table 13 together with indicative
benchmarks for PPSAL I1and PFSAL I1and the outcome indicators for the program as a whole.
The indicative benchmarks for PPSAL I1and PFSAL I1will be transformed into triggers at the
time of Board presentation of PPSAL and PFSAL, respectively, taking into account actual
developments on the ground. Establishing triggers helps in evaluating implementationprogress
andthe appropriate timing for eachfuture programmatic loan inthe series.

                                   V.      THE PROPOSEDLOAN

A.       PFPSALI11Objectives and Description

 131.    The main objective o f PFPSAL I11 i s to support implementation during 2004 o f the
 Government's financial and public sector reform priorities and ensuring that social programs are
 adequately funded and increasingly better targeted. K e y reform priorities in the financial sector
 include: (i)strengthening the regulatory framework for banking; (ii)building institutional
capacity at the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) and Saving Deposits
Insurance Fund (SDIF), (iii)resolving problem and failed banks, (iv) restructuring and
privatizing state banks, and (v) improving the corporate insolvency regime.            Key reform
priorities in the public sector include: (i)deepening o f structural fiscal policies in support o f
 sustainable fiscal adjustment, (ii)   implementing public expenditure management (PEM) reforms
covering budget planning and execution,               financial accountability, and public liability
management, and (iii)      strengthening public sector governance including implementation o f the
national anti-corruption strategy and preparation o f civil service reform. Priorities for social
spending include: (i)   adequate expenditure for health, education and social protection inthe 2004
budget and (ii)   better targeting o f social protection.

 132.    The proposed PFPSAL I11o f US$1 billion on standard IBRD terms is the third loan in
support o f the Government's multi-year financial and public sector reform program. It follows
on the first PFPSAL o f US$1.1 billion approved in July 2001 (US$700 million on standard
IBRD terms and US$400 million on SSAL terms) and the PFPSAL I1 o f US$1.35 billion
approved inApril 2002 (US$550 million on standardIBRD terms and US$SOOmillion on SSAL
terms).   As with the first PFPSAL and PFPSAL 11, the PFPSAL I11 operation will provide
budgetary support to help the Government defray the costs o f implementing its reform agenda
while continuing to fund critical social programs. The subsequent programmatic operations in
the financial and public sectors planned under the CAS will support the sustained effort by the
Government inthe next few years.

133.     The Bank agreed with the authorities to prepare PFPSAL I11on standard IBRD terms,
while PFPSAL I1was partially on standard terms and partially on SSAL terms. The early
elections and subsequent establishment o f the new Government, coupled with external
developments including the war in Iraq, led to delays in the realization o f the Bank's high-case
assistance program. The second and third tranches o f PFPSAL I1were cancelled at the request
of the authorities.       The preparation o f PFPSAL I11 supported the new Government's
determination to take full ownership o f the financial and public sector reform program and make
a strong public commitment to the program's objectives. It also facilitated the fine-tuning o f the
program in line with the Government's policy priorities and the required adjustment o f the
timetable for particular program benchmarks in accordance with actual developments over the
past year.

134.     Partial front-end fee waiver. The Government has requested a partial waiver o f the front-
end fee on the proposed PFPSAL I11in consideration o f the fee already paid on PFPSAL 11. The
front-end fee for PFPSAL I1amounted to US$13,500,000 paid to the Bank by Turkey from the
first tranche disbursement o f US$450,000,000 on August 15, 2002. A total o f US$534 million

                                              - 54 -


 on SSAL terms (Loan No. 4657 TU) and US$366 million on IBRD terms (Loan No. 4656 TU)
 remained undisbursed under the second and third tranches o f PFPSAL 11. As the US$366
 million undisbursed under the PFPSAL I1loan on standard IBpDterms (Loan No. 4656 TU) is
 being folded into the new programmatic operation, US$3,660,000            o f the front-end fee o f
 PFPSAL 111would be waived. This amount is equivalent to the front-end fee already paid for the
 second and third tranches o f the loan on IBRD terms under PFPSAL I1which were cancelled
 (Loan No. 4656 TU). While new elements have been added to the financial and public sector
 reform program supported by PFPSAL I11and the phasing o f some actions was modified, the
 continuity o f the program has been maintained, providing justification for the Government's
 waiver request.


 B.      LessonsLearnedfromPFPSAL andPFPSALI1

 135.    The combination o f financial and public sector reforms under the PFPSAL operations
proved useful in supporting Turkey's program to respond to the 2001 crisis. This combination
provided important synergies, most importantly ensuring consistency between fiscal adjustment
 and the financing requirements o f the front-loaded bank restructuring program. The results in
 terms o f economic recovery, disinflation and debt sustainability have been impressive.

 136.    The programmatic approach allowed for a reasonable degree o f adaptability to unfolding
events on the ground while maintaining overall coherence and direction o f the reforms. The
 single tranche PFPSAL provided substantial up-front support in the critical period immediately
following the February 2001 crisis, while the multi-tranche structure of PFPSAL I1provided the
necessary flexibility for the Bank to calibrate its financial support in accordance with actual
implementation o f specific reform measures. As the emphasis o f the Government's program is
shifting from crisis recovery to sustaining growth over the medium term, the Bank is planning to
shift to separate programmatic public sector adjustment loans (PPSALs) and programmatic
financial  sector adjustment loans (PFSALs) under the current CAS. This shift will allow the
Bank's assistance program to take account o f the differing implementation requirements for the
public and financial sector reform programs, including supplementary technical assistance and
related investment financing.

 137.    Events inTurkey and elsewhere have shown that the programmatic approach is subject to
political change, and that flexibility is needed to adjust to the priorities and timetable o f a new
government.     While the run-up to the November 2002 elections resulted in implementation
delays, the PFPSAL I1program provided the new Government with an established framework
for core financial and public sector reforms. The new Government demonstrated its commitment
to the program by adopting the April 2003 roadmap. However, the Iraq war and other internal
and external developments led to further implementation delays which required adjustments in
the timing and design o f key conditionality under the program. Upon the Government's request,
the remaining tranches o f PFPSAL I1(a mix o f SSAL and IBRD terms) were cancelled in June
2003 and work began o n PFPSAL I11 (fully on IBRD terms).             As PFPSAL I11preparation
progressed, the Government continued to articulate its reform strategy, particularly with regard
to the DIS and financial sector reform. This resulted inextended negotiations o f PFPSAL I11and
led to improvements in the conditionality that reflect stronger ownership and conditions better
calibrated to recent events.

                                              - 55 -



138.    Nonetheless, this flexibility indeed allowed continuity o f the program as PFPSAL I11
encompasses the key outstanding objectives foreseen under the second and third tranches of
PFPSAL 11, including further progress o n the state bank agenda, as well as additional
conditionality in areas where implementation under PFPSAL I1ran into delays. The renewed
Government commitment to program implementation was highlighted by passage o f the PFMC
law in mid-December. Sustained implementation of the public and financial sector reforms over
the medium term is a priority for the new C A S under the planned PPSALs and PFSAL.

C.      BenefitsandRisks

139.    Benefits.   The principal benefits of the PFPSAL I11 Loan will be to: (i)support the
Government's efforts to create the conditions for sustained growth and macroeconomic stability,
(ii)ensure adequate social expenditure and better targeted social protection, (iii)restore
confidence in the banking system, (iv) strengthen the foundation for an efficient and sound
bankingsystem which can be competitive inquality and performance at the international level,
(v) reduce the vulnerability o f the bankingsystem and enhance its capacity to withstand external
shocks and thereby reduce systemic failure risk, (vi) position Turkey's banking sector for
accession to the EU by aligning the prudential regime with applicable EU banking sector
directives, (vii) improve the sustainability and quality of the fiscal adjustment needed to achieve
macroeconomic stability, (viii) lay the foundation for durable improvements to PEM and fiscal
transparency in line with international standards, and (ix) raise the quality of public sector
governance.

140.    Risks and mitigating measures. Turkey has embarked on an impressive financial and
public sector reform agenda in the post-2001 crisis period. Although significant progress has
been achieved in implementing the core reform agenda, Turkey's financial and public sector
reform programstill entails significant risks, but these continue to be outweighed by the benefits
of the reforms and the risks of not proceeding.     Sustained implementation o f these reforms is
necessary to overcome the risks to the program. The major, domestic along with external, risk
factors include:

              policy slippages that would impact public debt sustainability,
          0   external vulnerability,
          0   spillover from global liquiditytightening,
              EUdecision short ofexpectations,
          0   banking sector weaknesses.

141.    All ofthese factors pose a risk to the macroeconomic stability throughweakening market
confidence. Sustainability of the public debt, which is critical to macroeconomic stability, will
hinge on continued implementation of strong macroeconomic policies and structural reform
policies.   High debt rollover ratios mean that a slide in the credibility attached to the
government's reform implementation program will put the economy on a high interest rate-
accelerating inflation-poor growth spiral, adversely affecting the vulnerable public debt
dynamics. The active support of the Bank is instrumental in providing credibility to the
Govemment program and, thereby, mitigating these risks.           Sustained implementation o f the

                                                 - 5 6 -


reform program is also necessary to maintain market confidence. The Bank's assistance strategy
for financial and public sector reform incorporates significant mitigation measures; however,
untilthe reforms are fully implemented, Turkey will remain vulnerable to a range o f exogenous
shocks.

 142.      Reformprogress has mitigated a number o fmacroeconomic risk factors, but the economy
remains vulnerable.          The floating exchange rate regime introduced in 2001 has increased the
economy's ability to absorb shocks. Systemic risks in the banking sector are being addressed,
the state banks have been re-capitalized, and the open foreign exchange position o f the banking
sector has moved close to balance.            Central bank independence and the newly established
regulatory bodies for banking, energy, telecommunications and public procurement are helping
to de-politicize economic management in line with intemational and EU norms.               Structural
reforms since 1999 have helped shift the primary fiscal balance from deficit to surplus and the
legal framework for better fiscal management is being gradually put inplace. Stronger economic
and fiscal management, coupled with steadily improving financial accountability and oversight,
will assist sound program implementation and reduce the risk o fbacktracking. Nevertheless, the
problems o f Turkey's banking sector and public finances will take time to resolve, and the
country will remain vulnerable to intemal and extemal shocks over the medium term. The
effectiveness o f the floating exchange rate as an adjustor will be limited for some time to come
bythe large public debt a substantial share o fwhich is inforeign currency.

143.      Public debt sustainabilitv. Under the program baseline, the net public debt to GNP ratio,
which has fallen from a high o f 94 percent in 2001 to 79 percent in 2002 and to 70 percent in
2003, is projected to fall further to 66 percent at the end o f 2004 (see Table 14). Extendingthe
programmed trends for the key macroeconomic parameters, including growth, interest rates,
exchange rate and the primary surplus, results in a further steady decline in the public debt to
GNP ratio, reaching below 60 percent levels in 2006.             Realizing this outcome hinges on
sustained growth, continuous fiscal adjustment (a primary surplus o f 6.5 percent o f GNP) and
stable exchange rates. While the strong Lira has underpinned the fall in inflation and decline in

                                              - 57 -


the public debt to GNP ratio, the extent o f the exchange rate appreciation and current account
deficit that have accompanied growth in economic activity, has generated additional sources o f
macroeconomic risk.

 144.   A sensitivity analysis o f the public debt dynamics demonstrates the central role o f
credible policies to build confidence and deepen the fiscal adjustment. The level and structure o f
Turkey's public debt leave the Treasury's borrowing program vulnerable to a potential loss o f
market confidence. The short average maturity o f the domestic debt leads to high monthly
rollover requirements. Foreign exchange exposure is another important determinant. Turkey's
crisis response program has featured debt swaps by the Treasury to eliminate the excess open FX
position of the banks, together with increased FX and FX-linked borrowing. As a result, the
share o f FX andFX-linked debt inthe total public debt stock has risen sharply. Moreover, a high
proportion o f the domestic debt is in floating rate notes which increases exposure to interest rate
movements. Finally, a very substantial share o f Turkey's public debt is to preferred creditors.

 145.   To illustrate the risks, a low-case scenario can be formulated where the political will to
strengthen the fiscal program falters and the primary surplus does not exceed 4 percent o f GNP.
As a result, real interest rates could be in the 20 percent range, i.e., well above the projected
program path. The recovery would be expected to falter under the burden o f sustained highreal
interest rates with growth falling to 2 percent per year.      A slowdown in the recovery and
deterioration in the public debt dynamics could lead to renewed capital account outflows and
exchange rate instability which would exacerbate the impact on the debt burden. Under these
conditions, the public debt burdencould begin to rise and debt to GNP increases to unsustainable
levels.   This analysis underscores the critical need for the Government to strengthen its
commitment to its reform implementation, by means necessary for the international (and
domestic) investors to have renewed confidence inthe program.

146.    External financing. Turkey faces a serious external financing challenge over the medium-
term which relates to both the magnitude and the composition o f this financing. Annual gross
financing requirements although declining from US$26 billion in 2004 will remain large at
US$19 billion by 2006 (Table 15). Moreover, a change in the composition o f financing from
public sector to private sector and from short to longer term would be beneficial. Turkey needs to
generate enough capital inflows to: (a) finance a moderate current account deficit o f between
US$8 billion to US$9.5 billion linked to sustained recovery, (b) service sizeable long term loan
repayments including net repurchases from the IMF set to increase from US$2.9 billion in 2004
to US$11.6 billion in2006, and (d) keep short-term debt inflows at supportable levels. Increased
FDI is, therefore, key to successfully meeting this challenge without adding to the already
considerable external debt burden. Given its location, size, and expected EU accession, Turkey
could attract a multiple o f the US$1.6 billion projected for 2004. Recent history, including the
2001 crisis aftermath, indicates the responsiveness o f Turkey's current account to shocks,
although at a significant cost to growth. Moreover, the improving level o f Central Bank gross
reserves (nearly US$33.6 billion as of early May) could provide some additional cushion in case
of a severe external shock. Naturally, the scope for a reserve draw-down is limited and could
raise investor concerns about the longer-term external payments picture. The stock o f external
debt reached US$143 billion by the end o f 2003, equal to about 61 percent o f GNP, o f which
about US$23.5 billion in IMF credit. Looking ahead, the extent to which Turkish banks and
enterprises will be able to roll over their external obligations and attract new financing on

                                                                       - 58 -


 favourable terms will remain an important determinant for the program. The reliance on private
 capital inflows will increase in 2005-06 when Turkey will face annual repayments to the IMF
 averaging US$9.6 billion.

147.       External factors. In early 2004, the fears o f overheating in the U S economy and
expectations o f an interest rate increase by the U S Federal Reserve earlier than originally
envisaged has started to put pressure on the emerging market economies including Turkey. As
o f early May, the EMBIspread for Turkey haswidened to above 500 basis points from 200 basis
points in early April. Inaddition, the market participants are increasingly looking for an anchor
for the economic program beyond 2004. The lack o f clear prospects for receiving a date from
EU in December 2004 to start accession negotiations is also a risk to the fragile market
sentiment. Prospects o f EU accession can serve as a powerfbl anchor for the program. A

                                                   - 59 -


negative decision by the EU in December can be expected to cause some reactions in financial
markets. A mitigating factor will be ifthe authorities move forcefully on a program o f structural
reforms in 2004 that will substitute for the EU anchor. In any event, geo-political events since
September 11, 2001 have provided markets with some comfort that Turkey will have support
from the international community regardless o f the EUdecision.

 148.     Bankina Sector. A stress test was conducted to assess the impact on the banking sector
o f a purely hypothetical and, at this point, unlikely macroeconomic shock. The stress test
simulated the impact o f a simultaneous increase in interest rates o f 30 percentage points, an
increase in NPLs o f 20 percent, and 15 percent depreciation o f the Lira. The simulation
measured the losses or gains incurred directly as a result o f the banks' on and o f f balance sheet
positions.

149.      The main result o f the analysis is that the solvency o f the system i s robust and only
somewhat sensitive to such scenario as the resulting aggregate capital adequacy ratio (CAR)
would remain at 15 percent which is about twice the regulatory requirements. Interest risk and
credit risk are the main contributors to the hypothetical reduction inbanking sector capital. Net
open foreign positions are very small for all banks outside SDIF, so the system i s not directly
exposed to exchange rate shocks.

150.      While there could be some individual bank failures under this scenario, such failures are
unlikely to cause a systemic crisis because the inter-bank credit market in Turkey is small at
about 3.5 percent o f total banking sector assets. Also, Turkish banks are highly liquid due to
their large holdings o f Government debt securities, andunless the individualbank failure leads to
a disruption o f that market, which is unlikely, the system will not experience liquidityproblems.

D.        Conditions for Board Presentation and Release of the Second Tranche'

151.      The proposed PFPSAL I11will be disbursed in two equal tranches. The actions listed
below are conditions for Board presentation and second tranche release as noted. The backbone
of the structural conditionality for PFPSAL I11 consists of the outstanding conditions for
PFPSAL I1second and third tranches. A number o f the conditions for release of the second and
thirdtranches o fPFPSAL I1have already beenmet. The remaining outstanding conditions have
been incorporated into the Board presentation and second tranche conditions for PFPSAL 111. In
the key areas o f the program where there have been problems, new conditionality has been
added. These areas include: (i)    implementation o f the DISprogram for farmers, (ii)            maintenance
o f BRSA's independence and support for its institutional development, (iii)                completion o f all
necessary actions to prepare VB for privatization, and (iii)elimination o f the system o f
earmarked revenues and expenditures left in place after closure o f most budgetary funds and
EBFs. In several other areas, PFPSAL I11goes beyond the agenda set under PFPSAL 11, for
example, new benchmarks for 2004 are being set under the tax strategy and public employment
program. operational and financial autonomy o f BRSA, and privatization o f VB-new

conditionality has been added. For the second tranche of PFPSAL 111, the core conditions are
included in the legal agreement.       The timing o f tranche release will depend on the actual

management reporting systems for the Deposit Account under the loan.               The Treasury will
maintain records o f all transactions under the loan in accordance with sound accounting
practices. The Government will submit to the Bank a monthly receipts and payments account
showing the transactions on the Deposit Account, starting with the receipt o f the first tranche o f
Bank funds and ending when the final tranche o f loan funds has been received and the balance
on the Deposit Account has been reduced to nil. The Borrower shall: (a) have the Deposit
Account audited in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, (b) furnish to the Bank as soon as available but in
any case not later thanfour months after the date o fthe Bank's request for such audit, a certified
copy o f the report o f such audit by said auditors o f such scope and in such detail as the Bank
shall have required, and (c) furnish to the Bank such other information concerning the Deposit
Account and the audit thereof as the Bank shall have reasonably requested. The audit will be
camed out at intervals agreed with the Bank, calculated from the date the first tranche o f loan
funds is paid into the Deposit Account, with suitable adjustments o f timing depending on the
funds left inthe Deposit Account at any point in time. The terms of reference for the audit will
be agreed between the Bank and the Borrower. Audits would end once the final tranche o f loan
funds has been received and all funds have been transferred from the Deposit Account. In
addition to the above, the Bank may request that its own staff (or a specialist contractor working
on its behalf) carry out special reviews o f the Deposit Account. If, after deposit into the Deposit
Account, the proceeds o f this loan are used for ineligible purposes, the Bank will require the
Borrower to either: (i)  return that amount to the account for use for eligible purposes, or (ii)
refimdthe amount directly to the Bank.

corruption strategy in the context o f the UAP. Disbursement arrangements for PFPSAL I11will
follow Bank practice for adjustment loans. Upon notification by the Bank o f loan effectiveness,

purchases. The closing date for the Loan will be June 30,2005.

Mr.JamesD.Wolfensohn
President
The World Bank
Washington D C 20433
U.S.A.


Dear Mr.Wolfensohn:

 1.      Our Government is determined to continue implementing its program o f economic
reform.    Following our successful efforts to stabilize the economy, we are implementing
structural reforms to preserve the current stability, promote economic growth, and create
employment. Our structural reform priorities are contained inthe Urgent Action Plan adopted by
the Council o f Ministers in December 2002. These priorities largely coincide with the actions
we are undertaking under our Financial and Public Sector Reform Program, implementation o f
which suffered some delays during the run up to the early elections o f November 2002 and the
formation o f the new Government.

2.      We have now implemented some o f the previously pending actions and are ready to
move ahead with the rest o f the Program. On this basis, we request World Bank support for our
Program by approving a Third Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan
(PFPSAL 111) for an amount o f US$1 billion on standard IBRD terms for Turkey and to be
disbursed in two equal tranches. We firmly believe that the reforms detailed in this Letter o f
Development Policy merit full support from the World Bank and the international community.

3.      We also request a waiver o f the 1percent front-end fee on the part o f the front-end fee for
PFPSAL 3 corresponding to the US$366,000,000 amount on standard IBRD terms which was
cancelled under PFPSAL I1(Loan No. 4656-TU). The rationale for this partial waiver request is
that: (a) the US$366 million un-disbursed under the PFPSAL I1loan on standard IBRD terms
(Loan No. 4656 TU) would be folded into the proposed PFPSAL I11and (b) the continuity o f the
financial and public sector reform program is and will be maintained as we are hlly committed
to meeting the objectives o f the Financial and Public Sector Reform Program in accordance with
the timetable presented below.

I. MacroeconomicFrameworkandSocialExpenditure

4.      Macroeconomic outcomes for 2003 show continued recovery from the crisis o f 2001.
Growth was stronger than expected, 5.9 percent for 2003, above the target o f 5 percent and

                                                                                       Annex I V
                                                                                     Page2 of 14


 following 7.9 percent growth in 2002. Inflation (CPI) fell to 18.4 percent in 2003, below target
 for the second year running. The floating exchange rate regime was successfully maintained and
 an important degree o f exchange rate stability was achieved. The current account registered a
 deficit o f US$6.6 billion (2.9 percent o f GNP) below the expected level for 2003, with surging
 imports overshadowing strong export performance.         By the end o f 2003, interest rates on
 government securities had fallen to the low 20s compared with peaks during 2001 crisis o f well
 over 100 percent. Gross international reserves o f the Central Bank were about US$35 billion at
 the end o f the year, above programmed levels. The positive impacts o f exchange rate stability,
 lower interest rates and higher growth improved the public debt dynamics with the stock o f net
 public debt estimated to have fallen from 91 percent o f GNP at the end o f 2001 to about 71
percent at the end of 2003, below projections at the beginning of the year. The primary surplus
 for 2003 was above 6.0 percent, the highest ever, andjust short ofthe target o f 6.5 percent.

 5.      In order to sustain the economic recovery, deepen the disinflation process and further
 improve debt sustainability, we will continue strong macroeconomic policies in 2004. We are
 confident that we will meet our end-year target o f 5 percent real GNP growth. Based on the low
base for private consumption and steadily increasing capacity utilization rates inprivate industry,
we expect the growth to be driven by private fixed investment and consumpti.on. Maintaining
consumer and investor confidence will be the most crucial factor in fostering final domestic
demand. W e believe the strong disinflationary trend in 2003 will continue in 2004 and we will
meet the 12 percent end-year inflation target On the fiscal front, buildingup on the 2003 fiscal
performance, we aim to achieve a public sector primary surplus of 6.5 percent o f GNP. Iffuture
developments point to significant changes in the macroeconomic framework or in financing
prospects, w e stand ready to (a) revise the program's macroeconomic projections and (b) adopt,
on a timely basis, additional measures necessary to safeguard our program objectives.

6.      We are determined to ensure strengthened social protection for all o f our citizens, in
particular poor and vulnerable groups. The estimated outcome for total social spending in 2003
as a share of GNP is inthe range o f 18.2 percent o f GNP, well above the PFPSAL benchmark of
 14.5 percent, in large part due to the unplanned increase in social security expenditure. In2004,
the overall social spending as a percent o f GNP is expected to be even higher than in 2003, at
about 19.3 percent. However, the education spending is likely to fall slightly below the PFPSAL
benchmark o f 4.25 percent, due to the fiscal measures requiring expenditure cuts to attain the
end-year primary surplus target.

7.      Expenditure on targeted social assistance in GNP terms is budgeted to increase in 2004.
We intend to increase the spending for the Social Solidarity Fund to over 0.3 percent o f GNP
inclusive o f the transfer from the budget carried over from 2003. The Direct Income Support
(DIS) payments to farmers increased to 0.64 percent o f GNP (TL 2.25 quadrillion) in 2003. In
2004 budget, an allocation o f TL 2.6 quadrillion will cover the remaining 2003 DIS liabilities
and the second installment o f DIS compensation payments for diesel fuel. Our Government
intends to disburse at least TL 275 trillion this year under the 2004 DIS program and will make
every effort to increase disbursement at least to TL 400 trillion. Additional resources will be
transferred to the DIS program by the Ministry o f Finance (MOF) and Treasury to achieve this
target. We have completed an agricultural policy paper which includes adequate provisions for

                                                                                        Annex I V
                                                                                      Page 3 of 14


 DIS as well as other agriculture support instruments. This policy paper will form the basis for
 the new agricultural fiamework law which will be enacted before end-2004.

 11.      Banking Sector Reform Program

 8.       The banking sector has been one o f the sources o f economic instability in repeated
 occasions. Most recently, banking sector imbalances contributed significantly to the
macroeconomic crisis o f February 2001. We are determined to prevent the repetition of systemic
 crises and aim at having a safe and sound private banking sector operating under appropriate
regulations and market principles.

 9.      Meeting these goals requires our decisive intervention in areas that include refining our
regulation and supervision o f banks, privatizing state banks, and improving the legal and
 institutional environment for financial transactions. Inview o f the complexity o f these issues we
have established a realistic policy program. Our immediate policy targets are to (a) consolidate
the current stability o f the sector by ensuring that a banking law fully consistent with European
Union principles is in place and its regulations are fully enforced by regulatory bodies with
sufficient capacity and independence, (b) ensure that state banks will not undertake quasi-fiscal
activities again by requiring these banks to operate on commercial principles while undertaking a
rapid restructuring process aimed at privatizing them as soon as feasible, and (c) assist banking
sector development by improving its legal framework on areas related to creditor rights,
formalhnformal corporate insolvency and restructuring systems in order to facilitate credit risk
management practices.

 10.     To put our policy priorities in perspective, it is necessary to recount the measures we
implemented following the crisis o f February 2001. Our efforts have been successful inrestoring
confidence in the banking system and preventing the state banks from accumulating hrther
operational and duty losses.

Regulatory and Supervisory Framework

11.      We are enforcing and will continue to enforce key regulations in line with international
standards. Inorder to reduce the high degree o f connected lending and equity exposures within
financial and industrial groups, the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA)
introduced time-bound exposure reduction targets for non-compliant banks, and will continue to
actively monitor compliance with these targets. Enforcement actions include restructuring o f
financial-industrial groups into separate financial and industrial holding companies where
prudent and necessary. Inorder to achieve full compliance with the applicable EUDirectives by
January 2006, lower limits have been in force since December 1999 and are being decreased
yearly thereafter. At the moment, there are no banks that violate the BRSA's excess connected
exposure limits. The BRSA will continue to closely monitor continued compliance with the
lower limits.

12.      BRSA amended the Loan Loss Provisioning (LLP) rules to require up-to-date loan loss
classification and provisioning by banks. The LLP include the concept o f fair value o f collateral
to facilitate restructuring o f loans. The new LLP will continue to be rigorously enforced in order
to maintain robust Capital Adequacy Ratios (CAR) in the banking sector. BRSA is also strictly

                                                                                      Annex IV
                                                                                   Page 4 of 14


 enforcing regulations on Foreign Exchange (FX) exposures o fbanks (including indirect exposure
through structured finance products) in coordination with the Central Bank o f Turkey and
through onsite examination o f Turkish banks' subsidiaries and branches abroad. In addition,
BRSA required banks to bring REPOs on to their balance sheet as collateralized finance
transactions.   Furthermore, a number o f regulations have been put into force on issues like
capital adequacy, risk management, accounting standards, independent auditing, mergers and
acquisitions, and cooperation agreements with foreign supervisory authorities.

 13.     On March 16, 2004, BRSA Board changed the organizational structure o f the Agency
with the objective o f strengthening BRSA and ensuring its operational effectiveness. To address
several priority areas, a time-bound Institutional Development Plan was adopted by the Board.
This plan requires, among other things, the preparation o f a strategy based on each department's
own operational plans and work flows. Actions to strengthen the Saving Deposits Insurance
Fund (SDIF), another pillar o f our prudential system, have also been undertaken. Its Board
approved a strategic plan with clearly assigned implementation responsibilities to: (a) put in
place a more effective organizational structure, with clearly separated line responsibilities for
bank resolution, asset management, administration o f deposit guarantees, and supporting
functions such as legal advise and information technology; (b) set performance targets for the
bank resolution and asset management functions; (c) envisage the sufficient quantities of
qualified staff and (d) build a centralized and highquality management information system.

14.     Several key strategic SDIF issues are being solved including (a) governance o f SDIF; (b)
transition to a limited deposit guarantee scheme and removal o f the current blanket guarantee as
o f July 5, 2004; and (c) development o f a long term financial sustainability strategy for the
deposit insurance fund that takes into account operating budget and performance plans.

15.     The re-capitalization process of the banking sector has been completed. Banks that were
not in compliance with the minimum CAR levels were able to comply with this requirement by
capital injections from private sources and subordinated loans from SDIF. W e have either sold,
revoked the licenses, or liquidated Ekspress, Demir, Sumer, Site, Taris, Eti, Iktisat, Kent,
Toprak, EGS, and Imar banks. Pamuk Bank was intervened and taken over by SDIF and,
following a failed sales effort in 2003, it will be integrated with Halk Bank. The resolution o f
SDIF banks involved a carve-outs o f selected assets and deposits, leaving parts o f their balance
sheet with the SDIF.      The SDIF auctioned o f f US$2.9 billion o f SDIF bank liabilities and
matching assets to private banks and transferred the residual assets and liabilities to Ziraat and
Halk (US$2.4 billion o f FX liabilities and assets) and Bayindirbank, the bank used as bridge for
the resolution o f assets in intervened banks. All remaining non performing assets were
transferred to the Collections Department o f the SDIF.

16.     There is still room for improving our regulatory framework and supervisory capacity.
Thus, we are working in drafting a new set o f comprehensive amendments to the banking law.
We will submit to the Council o fMinisters these amendments inJune 2004. They will, inter alia:
(a) delineate the functions o f and regulate the collaboration between BRSA and SDIF as well as
secure the institutional independence o f each o f these institutions and (b) enhance SDIF's
collection and enforcement powers. Our commitment is that by the end o f 2004, we will have in
place an improved Banking Act consistent with all EU principles and that will secure and

                                                                                       Annex IV
                                                                                     Page 5 of 14


strengthen the institutional, financial, operational, and regulatory independence o f BRSA and
SDIF. By then all the regulations under the Act will be fully enforced by regulatory bodies with
sufficient capacity and independence. To complement this new regulatory and supervisory
framework we will continue implementing strategic and institutional development plans for
BRSA and SDIF.

StateBank Reform

 17.     We are determined to ensure the state banks will not undertake quasi-fiscal activities
again. These banks are operating under commercial principles and will continue to do so. We
are developing and will implement in 2004 and early 2005 an ambitious restructuring plan in
order to ultimately privatize the state banks as soon as feasible but taking market conditions into
account.

 18.     Vakif Bank (VB) i s controlled by the State through the Directorate General o f
Foundations (DGF). This situation resulted from the fact that 75 percent o f shares belong to
thousands o f foundations. Since the majority o f these foundations have ceased to function and
have no identifiable authorized representatives, a law was passedto give the government's DGF
the authority to exercise shareholder voting rights on behalf o f the foundations. Consequently,
the DGF represents 75 percent o f shares and is, therefore, able to appoint VB management. The
remaining 25 percent o f VB shares belong to the VB employee pensionf h d (EPF).

19.     We are resolute in our objective that banks should not be controlled by the state. To
pursue our agenda, we have made the decision to hire consultants with adequate experience and
qualifications to carry out a due diligence o f VB to confirm that the bank has been managed
appropriately.   The process o f selecting consultants to carry out the due diligence will be
completed inMay 2004. By the end o f 2004, the Council o f Ministers will adopt a strategy to
bring about private sector control of VB as soon as market conditions permit. We will
implement expeditiously the strategy adopted bythe Council o fMinisters.

20.     Ziraat and Halk banks. We are committed to privatize these banks and have restructured
them substantially. We have closed more than 800 branches and reduced staff numbers by more
than 30,000 inbothbanks. They are now lendingon creditworthiness criteria and on commercial
terms and this will remain the case in the future. The Government will continue to refrain from
interfering inthe management and decisions o f these banks. A strategic advisor to formulate a
restructuring strategy to allow the privatizationo f these state banks has already begunworking.

21.     The Council o f Ministers will adopt by the end o f 2004 a privatization strategy for both
banks that will be implemented as soon as feasible in terms o f market conditions. Inaddition,
their Board will implement the restructuring actions recommended by the strategic advisor in
2004. We will offer the restructured two banks for sale thereafter to the private sector as soon as
the market conditions are appropriate as per the advise ofprivatization advisors.

ExecutionandBankruptcyAct

22.     A better functioning banking sector requires a legal framework that address creditor
rights, formalhformal corporate insolvency and restructuring systems to allow for improved

                                                                                      Annex I V
                                                                                     Page 6 of 14


credit risk management practices. An Execution and Bankruptcy Act (EBA) that conforms with
international best practice is a pre-condition for increasing private sector's access to credit and
 for the productive assets inthe economy to be allocated to their most efficient uses.

23.      In December 2003, amendments to the Execution and Bankruptcy Act (EBA) were
 enacted to introduce pre-packaged options and to complement earlier amendments enacted in
July 2003. The regulations for the amended EBA were published in April 2004 and will be
implemented effectively.

111.     Public Sector Reform Program

24.      Our public sector reform program aims to achieve permanent fiscal adjustment and
establish the foundation for more transparent and effective government. The program comprises
three core pillars each o f which has a medium-term dimension. The first pillar involves structural
fiscal policy reforms to underpin the fiscal adjustment required for overcoming the crisis and to
ensure that this adjustment is sustainable over the medium term. The second pillar of the public
sector reform program comprises institutional and policy reforms to improve public expenditure
management (PEM) based on the multi-year Strategic Framework prepared in line with the
recommendations of the Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) carried out jointly
with the World Bank. The thirdpillar of the public sector reform program involves broad based
institutional reforms to improve the quality of public sector governance. This includes a
systematic approach to combating corruption as well as civil service reform.

Structural Fiscal Policies

25.      Structural fiscal policies encompass the package of fiscal measures to underpin the fiscal
program, a medium-term strategy to improve the tax system, andstructural expenditure measures
including more comprehensive public employment policies.          Fiscal gains were significant in
2003, and the primary surplus rose from 4 percent of GNP in 2002 to over 6 percent of GNP in
2003. The 6.5 percent of GNP public sector primary surplus target for 2004 remains a corner-
stone of our program. The recent minimum wage and pension increases-motivated               by our
concerns for the most vulnerable segments of the society-created        challenges for this year's
target, as have weaker-than-anticipated revenues.     To address this slippage and underpin the
2004 budget, we have announced a new fiscal package for 2004 totaling 1.7 percent of GNP.
While the 2004 fiscal package increases the emphasis o n expenditure reductions, the
Government has been obliged to resort to additional revenue measures as well. W e acknowledge
that deeper structural measures on both the revenue and expenditure sides will be needed to
underpin the fiscal program over the medium term.

26.     Tax Strategy. Our Government i s moving forward with the medium-term tax strategy
adopted in January 2002. A unified Special Consumption Tax (SCT) to consolidate a range o f
excise and specific taxes into a single tax charged on a limited range of luxury goods was
enacted in June 2002. Implementing circulars for the SCT law were published in July and the
tax came into effect in August 2002. Earmarking of SCT revenues was eliminated, with effect
from the 2003 budget, through a government decree issued in January 2003. InApril 2003, the
Parliament approved the first legislative package under the direct tax reform designed to simplify

                                                                                             Annex IV
                                                                                           Page 7 of 14


and consolidate the direct tax regime in line with OECD standards and international best
practice. This legislation: (a) harmonizes tax rates on income from financial investments at the
declaration stage; (b) simplifies and harmonizes the system o f investment incentives; (c) reforms
the system o f income tax credits, and (d) simplifies taxation o f corporate earnings and dividends.
Key provisions o f the legislation became effective immediately and the remaining articles
became effective in January 2004.          Subsequently, we further rationalized direct taxation by
enacting a second package o f direct tax reform legislation in January 2004, which progressively
transforms free trade zones into export processing zones in line with international best practice,
and targets regional incentives at employment generation inlower income regions.

27.      Onthe tax administration side, steps have beentaken to strengthen tax audit management
capacity within the MOF by establishing an audit coordination unit. A coordinated audit plan for
2003 was prepared and implemented. We will complete the functional reorganization of the
General Directorate o f Revenues (GDR) by end-2004 and will start to extend this structure to the
local level. Drawing on OECD experience, and maintaining the accountability o f the GDR to the
Ministero fFinance, we will transform the GDR into a semi-autonomous body within the MOF,
its Head directly reporting to the Minister. Tax policy unit will be transferred to the MOF.

28.      Public Employment. As part o f a broader program o f structural measures being
undertaken on the expenditure side, the public sector employment policy has become more
comprehensive in2002 and 2003 and was maintained and strengthened in2004. The policies for
2004 include: (a) a cap on the total number o f civil servants in the central and local
govemment-the       ceiling on new hiringinthe consolidated budget has been set at 40,000; and (b)
a limit on replacement hiring in the SEEs equal to 10 percent o f attrition and no replacement
hiring for budget-financed SEEs.         A system o f quarterly monitoring for public employment
across the general government has been established in 2002. The employment figures o f the
consolidated budget agencies, SEEs, local administrations, state banks and social security
institutions are being monitored by a committee chaired by MOF. The quarterly public
employment reports will continue to be prepared.

29.     A key element o f the public employment program is to address the over-employment in
the state economic enterprises. At end 2001/early 2002, approximately 15,000 workers were
retired, notified o f their retirement, laid o f f or converted to private contract status, following the
liftingo frestrictions on the ability o fmanagers to require public sector workers over 50 years of
age to retire. Inaddition most o f the unfilled positions in SEEs were eliminated. We conducted
an assessment o f SEE redundancies which indicated 45,800 redundant positions in the SEE
system as of January 2002. A majority o f these redundancies were eliminated as o f mid-March
2004 and many o f the SEEs were in fact able to reduce the number o f their workers by more
than the figure determined through the redundancy assessment carried out in 2002. The overall
attrition from SEEs between February 2002 and mid-March 2004 has reached to over 59,000.

PublicExpenditureManagement

30.     The multi-year strategy for reforming public expenditure management envisages: (a)
putting in place a comprehensive revenue and expenditure framework to guide fiscal
management, (b) reforming the processes and institutional arrangements for budget preparation

                                                                                       Annex IV
                                                                                     Page 8 of 14


and execution to ensure that strategic planning and policy priorities would guide resource
allocation, (c) upgrading public accounting, reporting, procurement and external audit functions
to strengthen financial accountability in government inline with international standards; and (d)
legal measures and institution building to ensure prudent public liability management.            In
undertaking these reforms and in revising the legislation, our government has launched a far-
reaching reform which goes well beyond the initial strategy in a number of key respects. In
particular, the drafting o f the PFMC law was seen as an opportunity to introduce modem public
management principles by clarifying accountability o f public officials, by delegating managerial
responsibility and by putting inplace an intemal control and audit framework that i s compatible
with EUandinternationalpractice.

31.     The PFMC Law. The PFMC Law enacted in December 2003 undertook a long due
overhaul o f public finance legislation in Turkey and replaces the Public Accounting Law o f
1927. The new PFMC law incorporates modem principles o f public management and addresses
a number o fweaknesses o f the existing system: (a) it incorporates a comprehensive definition o f
public revenue and expenditure encompassing the general government sector (b) it provides the
MOF with clear legal authority to issue budget classification, accounting and reporting standards
for all general government agencies, (c) it proposes a medium term approach to strategic
planning and budget preparation that will apply to all parts o f the central government, (d) it
provides a clear definition o f accountability o f ministers and heads o f public administrations as
well as key officials for financial management and performance relative to policy goals, (e) it
delegates financial control and internal audit responsibilities to spending agencies, in line with
EUstandards, (f) it strengthens government accountability by extending the scope and mandate
o f external audit by the Turkish Court o fAccounts to the whole o f general govemment.

32.     Our government is currently preparing secondary legislation and regulations necessary
for implementationo f the provisions o f the PFMC law. Many aspects o f this law are expected to
be implementedfrom January 2005 while others will be implementedover the period2005-07.

BudgetReform

33.     In line with our strategy to achieve a comprehensive budget framework that supports
sound fiscal management, a number o f steps have been taken to improve the classification and
reporting o f fiscal activity o f the general government and to integrate extra- budgetaryitems into
the budget.

34.     Budget Classification.         Until recently, the budget system lacked the functional
classification o f government expenditures that i s recommended by the IMF's Manual on
Government Financial Statistics (GFS) and which i s essential for policy analysis o f expenditure.
This situation has been addressed by the government's adoption o f functional budget
classification in line with the GFS 2001 and by the parallel amendment o f the chart o f accounts
for all entities forming part o f the general government. The GFS classification, including the 10
sector hnctional classification, has been applied in the 2004 budget for general and annexed
budgets. The expansion o f the GFS to the rest o f central government (regulatory, supervisory and
other public agencies) will be implementedinthe 2006 budget. Current plans are to also expand
the GFS to the rest o f general government, i.e. social security institutions and the local

                                                                                    Annex I V
                                                                                  Page 9 of 14


administrations, by the 2006 budget. Turkey now has the full complement o f intemationally
standard budget classification (functional, administrative and economic classification) while
program level information on the budget is also available.

35.      Integrating Off-Budget Activities into the Budget. All budgetary funds, with the
exception o f the Support Price Stabilization Fund(DFIF) linked to the reform o f the agriculture
sales cooperative unions (ASCUS), and all but five EBFs (Social Solidarity Fund, Defense Fund,
Promotion and Publicity Fund, SDIF, and Privatization Fund) were eliminated by legislation in
2000 and 2001. Despite formal closure o f the funds, the system o f earmarked revenues and
expenditures associated with them has remained largely inplace. This has been done by keeping
open the accounts o f the closed funds and using the mechanism o f special appropriations
whereby earmarked revenues to these accounts are written as special appropriations for the
spending agencies concerned during the course o f the year. To meet the initial objectives o f
improved fiscal control, transparency, accountability and comprehensiveness o f the budget, our
Government intends to terminate the use o f the special appropriations mechanism, close the
accounts linked to the closed funds and incorporate their earmarked revenues into the general
revenue base. This will be accomplished through legislation which i s expected to be enacted by
end-June 2004. For the remaining EBFs (excluding the SDIF for which measures are being
taken under the financial sector reform program), the following measures have been incorporated
into the PFMC law: (a) incorporation o f EBF budgets in the budget o f the related administration
submitted to Parliament for approval; (b) inclusion o f the remaining EBFs under the intemal
control and audit regime as well as external audit by the TCA; and (c) monthly reporting o f EBF
operations on a consolidated basis with the central government.

36.      Other Budget Reforms.          Rationalization and reform o f the revolving funds is
progressing. Through consolidation by agency, the number of revolving funds was reduced from
about 2,650 in mid-2001 to about 1,400 by M a y 2004.            The PFMC law indicates the
government's intention to eliminate all revolving funds within general government by end-2007.
Untiltheir elimination, revolving fund revenues and expenditures will be incorporated into the
budget o feach general government agency and reported inthe budget submission to Parliament.

37.      Other actions to improve the scope o f relevant information conveyed to Parliament are
ongoing. As was done for the 2004 budget, presentation o f the 2005 budget to the Parliament
will be supplemented with the submission o f the accounts and financial outlook for the
contingent liabilities o f the Treasury, the remaining extra budgetary funds, the social security
institutions, autonomous agencies, local authorities, and SEES. Further steps have also been
taken to improve the credibility o f the budget preparation process.     The macro framework
decision o f HighPlanning Council for the 2004 budget included individually specified indicative
ceilings for each ministry and line agency based on the experience with the 2002 budget
preparationprocess.

38.      Rationalizingthe PublicInvestmentProgram. Onthe basis o f HighPlanning Council
decisions, the 2002 public investment program (PIP) cut the projected average completion time
to 8.5 years, a 32 percent reduction from the 12.5 year average completion time in 2001
(adjusted for the higher than expected devaluation and inflation). An action plan for further
rationalization o f the public investment program (PIP) in2003-04 has been prepared by SPO and

                                                                                      Annex IV
                                                                                   Page 10 of 14


was adopted by the High Planning Council in October 2002. The plan includes quantitative
 targets for further reductions in average project completion time o f at least 3 percent per year
 starting from the 8.5 year baseline established in 2002. An assessment prepared by SPO inM a y
 2003 confirmed the reduction in the average project completion time in the 2002 PIP and
 indicated a further reduction inthe average completion time, based on the initial allocations, to
 an estimated 7.6 years in the 2003 PIP along with a continued reduction in the number o f
projects. Following the budgetary cut inthe context o f fiscal measures required to meet the end-
year primary surplus target, we expect a transitory increase in the average completion time to
 8.6 years in 2004 due to reduced investment program allocation, however we will try to contain
this increase through structural measures. Towards this end, we plan to revise the action plan
prepared in2002 and strengthen the implementation o f the new plan.

39.     Policy Formulation. Actions are also underway to buildcapacity for policy formulation
and strategic planning, both at the central government and within public administrations to
complement the budgetary initiatives in improving the performance o f public agencies. The
strategic planning guidelines have been issued by State Planning Organization (SPO) following
consultations with public administrations. In July 2003, the High Planning Council issued a
decision announcing the launch o f the strategic planning initiative on a pilot basis in eight
agencies representing various parts o f general government. With guidance and support from
SPO, the eight agencies are expected to make satisfactory progress in their pilot strategic
planning studies. Based on the experiences o f these pilots a phased program to expand strategic
planning to the rest o f government will be prepared and implemented.

40.     Operational Performance.Under the original PEMstrategy, the government introduced
in2002 apilotprogram on improvingoperational performance insix agencies that was designed
to draw lessons for understanding the relationship between strategic planning and goal setting,
budgetary predictability, financial management and operational performance. As noted earlier,
the new PFMC law proposes a fundamentally new framework for public management that seeks
to improve performance orientation in government. By clarifying accountability o f heads of
public administrations, requiring spending agencies to define their performance goals and
requiring the submission o f accountability reports for performance, the new framework
highlights the focus on performance. In order to enable achievement o f goals the framework
proposes delegating managerial and financial authority while ensuring that it is backstopped by
an adequate system o f internal control and audit. Inthis respect, the law proposes an ambitious
expansion o f the original reform program. Its implementation is a long term challenge but key
enabling steps are being introduced. The performance based budgeting guidance is being
prepared by the MOF and it will be completed by end-December 2004.

FinancialAccountabilitV

41.     The PFMC Law clarifies accountability arrangements within the public administration, o f
the executive to Parliament, and the role o f TCA to provide assurance to Parliament as regards
financial statements prepared by the government. In addition, our government has undertaken
several reforms strengthening the public financial management systems.

                                                                                       Annex IV
                                                                                   Page 11of 14


42.     Accounting Reform. Reform of the public accounting system is well underway. The
 say2000i automated accounting system is now fully operational in all MOF accountancies. As a
result, it is now possible to prepare periodic financial statements within a reasonable period o f
time. Interfaces of the say2000i system have been completed with the automated revenue
systems o f the General Directorate of Revenues. Additional interfaces are being established: (a)
to the budget system (BYES) o f the General Directorate o f Budget and Fiscal Control o f the
MOF and (b) to the accountancies o f the Treasury. These remaining interfaces would provide a
fully integrated, automated system for tracking central government revenue and expenditure in
Turkey.

43.     The initiative to introduce modified accrual accounting in compliance with GFS
requirements is making progress but will take longer to complete than originally envisaged.
MOF has prepared a policy paper on accrual accounting which was published in November
2002. MOF has also prepared a regulation referring to accounting policies and principles, and
containing framework accounting standards and a framework chart o f accounts consistent with
GFS. This framework chart o f accounts will be adapted to meet the specific requirements o f
individual agencies while maintaining full compliance with GFS standards. The new chart o f
accounts is being piloted within consolidated budget agencies including several joint pilots with
the GFS budget classification. Based inpart on the experiences from the pilots, the timetable for
the accounting reform has been revised and is now as follows: (a) introduce modified accrual
accounting in consolidated budget entities in 2004; and (b) begin introduction o f the modified
accrual accounting in entities outside the consolidated budget in 2005. The long term objective
is to introduce full accrual accounting in general government. The government accounting
standards board to be established through the PFMC law will be responsible for transforming the
framework standards included inthe accounting regulation into full-fledged accounting standards
over time.

44.     Procurement. We have moved decisively to upgradepublic procurement legislation and
practices in line with international standards. The new public procurement law was enacted in
January 2002 and subsequently amended inJune 2002. The new law is based on the UNCITRAL
model and moves Turkey inthe direction of compliance with EU standards. The law covers all
goods, works, and services-with      the exception o f military contracts-and    encompasses both
budgetary and non-budgetary procurement. It i s applicable to central and local government
agencies, as well as SEEs. The law establishes thresholds (in TL) above which foreign bidders
cannot be restricted and a domestic preference o f 15 percent can be applied. The new law also
stipulates the qualification requirements (including technical and financial criteria) for
contractors which will supercede the existing contractor certificate system. The independent
Public Procurement Board and Agency established under the law to oversee public procurement
and ensure enforcement of the new procurement standards are fully operational. The secondary
legislation required under the law has been issued and the new procurement standards came into
force on January 1, 2003 as scheduled. In July 2003, a set o f further amendments was enacted
which authorized limited procurement by SEEs under commercial practice. New procurement
legislation for SEEs inthe public utilities sectors consistent with the relevant EUdirective is now
being prepared. W e are monitoring the implementation o f the new procurement system. If
improvements are deemed necessary, we will ensure that they are consistent with international
best practice.

                                                                                       Annex IV
                                                                                    Page 12 of 14


45.      Auditing. The modernization o f Turkey's public audit system has three main objectives:
(a) to extend the mandate o f Turkish Court o f Accounts (TCA) to the whole o f General
Government (b) to end TCA's involvement inbudget execution (c) and to transform T C A into
an effective supreme audit institution operating in accordance with recognized international
standards. These objectives have been facilitated by enactment o f the PFMC law. With regard
to extemal audit , the law clarifies the roles and responsibilities o f the line agencies, the MOF
and the TCA, and establishes a principle o f accountability which extends to the heads o f public
administrations. It also requires T C A to focus on ex-post financial and performance audits.
With regard to the transformation ofTCA, the law :(a) includes all consolidatedbudget agencies
including the Presidency and Parliament within TCA's          audit mandate as required by the
Constitution; (b) subjects T C A to extemal audit, the reports o f which are submitted to the
Parliament; and (c) after a transition period expands the scope o f TCA audits to cover the entire
general government.

46.      The transition period provides time for T C A to undertake intemal reforms to align its
working methods with international standards for supreme audit institutions and to upgrade its
audit capabilities.   A draft action plan for the TCA's internal reform has beenprepared andwill
be improved. Peer review o f the TCA and its action plan by auditors from another European
Supreme Audit Institution is envisaged. We are drafting a new legislation on Turkish Courts o f
Accounts to clarify the types o f audit (compliance, financial and performance) to be performed
by TCA. We believe that the new legislation will have a profound impact inthe public interest
by developing TCA's role in financial and performance audit. The new legislation will be
submitted to Parliament by December 2004.

Public Liability Management

47.      Our Government recognizes the importance o f strengthening public liability
management. The new Law on Public Finance and Debt Management, enacted in March 2002,
has established the foundation for a comprehensive risk management framework. The new Law:
(a) confirmed that the Treasury is the single borrowing authority for the central government; (b)
created a more prudent and transparent framework for the management o f government
guarantees; and (c) established a risk account in the budget, starting with the 2003 Budget, to
cover the expected fiscal cost o f called guarantees and unexpected losses from other fiscal risks.
The Treasury has established a new "Middle Office" for public liability and risk management.
The circular on establishment o f the Middle Office and a Public Debt Management Committee to
set the borrowing and liability management policy within the Treasury, was re-issued inJanuary
2003 with a strong emphasis on the risk control fimction o f the Middle Office.           The new
institutional structure for public liability management is now in place and fully operational.
Furthermore, the Middle Office has launched monthly fiscal risk monitoring notes for the
Treasury Management, and since April 2003 publishes quarterly Public Debt Management
Reports covering risks coming from both its direct debts and contingent liabilities. A review o f
the government guarantee portfolio was completed in June 2003, providing a preliminary
valuation o f the guarantee portfolio. The Middle Office updates this valuation on a quarterly
basis. Starting from January 2004 it had also implemented strategic risk benchmarks and

48.     Our Government aims to continue strengthening its capacity in public liability
management. To this end, a two-year capacity-building program supported by a grant from the
World Bank's Institutional Development Fund (IDF) in the amount o f US$320,000 was
formulated. Within the context o f this IDF program, consultants are being identified to assist
the Treasury's Middle Office in examining the best intemational practices in debt and risk
management, in strengthening its financial and fiscal risk management practices, and in
formulating optimal institutional arrangements for managing the government liability portfolios.

Public Sector Governance

49.     The Government is strongly committed to improve public sector govemance. A national
strategy to enhance transparency and good govemance in the public sector was adopted in
January 2002. The basic structure and actions o f this strategy has been reflected in the recent
Urgent Action Plan (UAP) o f our Government. We are undertaking efforts to improve public
awareness about good governance and is counting on the active contribution o f national NGOs.
Our Government is committed to implementation o f the UAP which is in line with the
framework set out in the national strategy.             The ministerial committee for enhancing
transparency and improving good govemance was established in March 2003. The committee
will steer relevant actions o f both the UAP and national strategy in this reform area. The
responsibility for implementation o f each action is clearly specified inthe UAP. The ministerial
committee will prepare regular implementation reports for the national strategy within the
context o fthe UAP. Among a comprehensive set o f substantive actions was the enactment o f the
Law on "Freedom o f Information for Citizens" in October 2003. Our Government recognizes
that this law provides an important new basis for enabling citizens to monitor the performance of
public sector. Legislation establishing a code of conduct for civil servants is expected to be
passed by end-July 2004.

50.     We realize that sustained improvements inpublic governance will hinge in large part on
effective reform of the civil service. Civil service reform is vital to raising the quality o f public
services and ensuring the quality o f the fiscal adjustment.    Preparations for a functional review
o f government were initiated in mid-2002, but then delayed by the run up to elections. The
functional review has now been re-launched under the responsibility o f SPO and the report will
be submitted to the Government in July 2004. Our Government is cognizant o f the potential
impact o f the measures in the Public Administration Framework Law on the implementation o f
both civil service reform and the results o f the functional reviews. It intends to examine carehlly
how these processes can effectively be aligned with one another, without slowing down the
process o f implementation.

    IMFCompletesSeventhReview andApproves US$495MillionDisbursementUnder
                               Stand-ByArrangement with Turkey

        The Executive Board o f the InternationalMonetary Fund(IMF) today completed the
 seventh review o f Turkey's economic performance under the Stand-By Arrangement and
 approved the disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 340 million (about US$495 million).
 Incompleting the review, the ExecutiveBoardalso grantedTurkey's request for waivers, and
 approved the rephasing o f the remaining program reviews and an extension o fthe Arrangement
through February 3,2005 to allow time for the final disbursement under the program.

        Turkey's Stand-By Arrangement was approved on February 4,2002 (see Press Release
No.02/7) ina total amount o f SDR 12.8 billion (about US$18.6 billion). So far, Turkey has
drawn SDR 11.1 billion (about US$16.2 billion) under the Arrangement.

        Following the Executive Boarddiscussion, Anne Krueger, Acting ManagingDirector and
Chair, said:

        "Turkey's economic program has continued to deliver impressive results. Economic
growth has exceeded program targets for the second year running, interest rates have fallen
sharply, helping Turkey's debt dynamics, inflation has declined to its lowest rate ina generation,
andconfidence inthe Turkish lirahasbeenrestored.

        "The government's commitment to meeting its primary surplus target o f 6% percent o f
GNP in2004 has playedan important role inthis success. The government's recent corrective
measures, includingcutting discretionary spending by 13 percent andraising excises,
demonstrate its commitment to meeting the 2004 program target, and the government should
remain vigilant to avoid slippages.

        "The adoption o f a comprehensive structural fiscal reform strategy in2004 should help
sustain this fiscal adjustment inthe mediumterm and lead to a better composition o f the budget.
Stronger tax administration will aid incombating tax evasion, planned social security reforms
will help underpin medium-term fiscal stability, and the forthcoming public expenditure review
should provide guidance on reducing rigidities inthe budget structure. Timely implementation o f
this ambitious reform agenda is needed to help boost policy credibility.

       "The Central Bank o f Turkey's handling o f monetary policy has continued to be
impressive, with inflation rates falling sharply. The government's continued fiscal discipline has
played a key role inthis accomplishment.

                                                                                     Page2 of 2



        "The current policy response to capital inflows-reintroducing   foreign exchange
purchase auctions, allowing modest real appreciation o f the exchange rate, and cutting interest
rates gradually-is  appropriate. Closer coordination between the Central Bank and the Treasury
insharingthe cost ofaccumulating reserves shouldhelp strengthen monetary anddebt
management.

        "The authorities' intention to reinvigorate banking reform is welcome. The BankingAct
is being brought more closely inline with EuropeanUnionpractice, while the inquiryinto Imar
bank should help strengthen banlung supervision. Needed further steps include accelerating asset
recovery by the Savings Deposit and Insurance Fund(SDIF) and reform o f state banks. Firm
support o fthe Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) will continue to be
important.

        "The Turkish authorities have continued to make strong efforts to adhere to their
ambitious program, includingby implementation o f fiscal measures ahead o f the Marchelections
to help meet the primary surplus targets. They have also adopted an ambitious structural reform
agenda for the remainder o f the program. The result has been a marked improvement inmarket
confidence and economic performance. These strong efforts deserve the continued support o f the
international community," Ms.Krueger said.
