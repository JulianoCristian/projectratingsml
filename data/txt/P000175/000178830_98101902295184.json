Its major components include: (i)\n            construction of the Bujumbura-Cibitoke-Rugomboroad (65 km)\n            to two-lane bituminous standards; (ii) improvement of the\n            classified road network by replacement of bridges in poor\n            state of repair, stabilization of steeply graded road\n            sections and road improvement; (iii) technical assistance\n            and consultants' services; (iv) procurement of road\n            maintenance equipment; and (v) improvement of the Ministry\n            of Public Works Laboratory.
