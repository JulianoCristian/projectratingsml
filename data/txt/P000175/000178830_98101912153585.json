under the Highway\n            Maintenance Project, 1974. Its major components include: (i)\n            construction of the Bujumbura-Cibitoke-Rugomboroad (65 km)\n            to two-lane bituminous standards; (ii) improvement of the\n            classified road network by replacement of bridges in poor\n            state of repair, stabilization of steeply graded road\n            sections and road improvement; (iii) technical assistance\n            and consultants' services; (iv) procurement of road\n            maintenance equipment; and (v) improvement of the Ministry\n            of Public Works Laboratory. The project would result in\n            reduced internal transport costs and assuring of all-season\n            access to agricultural areas and markets, particularly Bujumbura."}, "docdt": "1978-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
