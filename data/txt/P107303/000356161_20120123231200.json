satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the\n            importance of Government ownership, taking the time to\n            nurture it, through dialogue and analysis of the political\n            economy of reforms; the need to have a good understanding of\n            political economy of sensitive reforms; merits of working\n            within the harmonized framework for the provision of budget\n            support; flexibility in the Performance Assessment Framework\n            (PAF) to emerging issues should be encouraged; the need for\n            a good and robust Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)\n            framework for tracking progress and; ambitions and complex\n            reforms should not be avoided completely."}, "docdt": "2012-01-17T00:00:00Z"}
