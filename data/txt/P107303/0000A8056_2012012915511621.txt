                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The PRSC program aims at contributing to the achievement of Malawi's medium-term development objectives as outlined in the MGDS. It is therefore expected
                         that at the end of the series, the program will have contributed towards increased economic growth and poverty reduction by supporting implementation of
                         policy and institutional reforms that will lead to increased agricultural productivity, increased private sector investment, improved household resilience to
                         shocks, and sustained improvements in fiscal management.
                         Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                            Yes           No

Public Disclosure Copy




                         The Government continues to pursue the implementation of the critical reforms supported by the PRSC series although progress remains slow.

                         On the component on the functioning of agricultural markets, performance during 2009/10 has been generally mixed with some encouraging progress in the output markets but slow
                         progress in the output market reforms. Despite Government's commitment to ensure increased private sector participation in the output markets, ad-hoc interventions by government
                         in setting agricultural inputs and outputs minimum prices still remain. In 2009, the Government was able to implement a legume seed subsidy through private retail outlets, with
                         encouraging results on yields. Malawi also implemented a weather derivative contract in 2009 as part of its food security strategy, a second year round, and piloted a macro-weather
                         insurance.

                         On business climate, good progress has been made in the implementation of reforms aimed at increasing investor confidence by making it easier and cheaper to wind-up a business
                         as well as in putting in place a framework for transferring backlog cases to the Commercial Division of the High Court. This notwithstanding, progress has been slow in the adoption of
                         the New National Investment Policy as well as in establishing a revised Single Business Licensing Bill.

                         On economic governance, encouraging progress has been made, especially in the area of public financial and macroeconomic management, although the budget overruns related to
                         the input subsidy program and May 2009 Presidential and Parliamentary Elections resulted in higher domestic borrowing and lower reserve accumulation. However, the budget in
                         2009/10 continued to be a broadly credible instrument for public expenditure management. The Government also managed to strengthening linkages between the budget and the
                         MGDS.

                         The implementation of recommendations from the 2008 Personnel and Human Resource Management Information Systems (HRMIS) audits is improving the overall management of
                         the payroll and the IFMIS roll-out is capturing more institutions and plans are in place to further increase the number of institutions using IFMIS, particularly the local assemblies.
                         Ultimately, this will help to improve timely preparation of financial statements.

                         Good progress is being made in dealing with backlog of Auditor General’s reports and the country is also doing well in PEFA, although fiduciary management remains weak due
                         partly to delayed audits which are not presented to Parliament for scrutiny and other fiduciary control issues. Greater focus on the quality of audits and follow-ups will be key to
                         ensuring further improvements in public financial accountability.

                         On social protection, the focus was on improved targeting of the fertilizer subsidy program. Although progress has been slow, steps are being made to improve further the targeting of
                         the fertilizer subsidies to poorer households.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Since the most important challenge for Malawi is on how to diversify growth and make it more inclusive, the new Country Economic Memorandum provides a platform for broadened
                         debate on growth-friendly policy reforms, specifically looking at agricultural sector commercialization and diversification and the job creation agenda. Upstream engagement in this
                         area will help push forward critical reforms in agriculture and other key sectors which have the potential of being key drivers of growth.
