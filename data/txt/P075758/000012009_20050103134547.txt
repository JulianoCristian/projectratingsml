3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

Background

Armenia is a landlocked country of 3.2 million people with few natural resources. As such, it
must rely on the development of its human resources ti achieve economic growth. As with other
former Soviet Union (FSU) countries, Armenia's real output dropped sharply (60 percent)
following independence, 1991-93. Since then, growth has averaged a robust 5.5 percent. More
recently, growth has exceeded 10 percent. In addition, poverty declined from 55.0 to 48.9
percent and extreme poverty fell by 7 percentage points in the three years leading up to SAC5.
Recovery in agriculture and energy and expansion in construction and service sectors carried the
economy. The positive results may be partly due to the fact that Armenia has among the best
indicators of reform progress of any Confederation of Independent States (CIS) country.

Despite the strong growth and poverty reduction leading up to SAC5, there was still concern
about the sustainability of Armenia's growth. Although previous operations had focused on
private sector development (PSD), the manufacturing sector was not performing up to
expectations, nor was employment generation adequate. The November 2001 World Bank Study
"Armenia Growth Challenges and Government Policies" concluded that the business environment
did not develop adequately. There were also significant fiscal problems related to expenditure and
revenue management in public utilities and infrastructure. In addition, there was a low level of
financing for core social services. SAC5 was designed to address these priorities. SAC5 was
actually the sixth adjustment type operation with the first being a Rehabilitation Credit, approved
in 1994. Armenia has had a steady commitment to reform over these six adjustment operations.
Up to and including SAC3, the Government of Armenia (GOA) focused on securing
macroeconomic stability. Since SAC4, it has focused its reforms on development of the private
sector. Through SAC4 and SAC5, efforts have steadily increased to create employment and
spread the benefits of growth throughout the population. As will be shown in section 4, this
strategy proved successful, though it took longer than expected. The Government has made
adjustments where necessary, especially to ensure that growth is more evenly distributed and the
Bank has continued to support Armenia's reform program.

Objective

The original objectives of Armenia's SAC5, as stated in the Program Document, dated February
12, 2003, were to support the Government's efforts in: (i) developing the private sector and
accelerating public enterprise reform; (ii) promoting public sector reforms; and (iii) advancing
social sector reforms (including education, health, social protection and pensions). SAC5's
objectives focused on the priority needs in Armenia as identified through economic and sector
work (ESW), in cooperation with the GOA, including the above mentioned growth study and the
Public Expenditure Review (PER-2003). SAC5's objectives were consistent with the program
expressed in the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which was discussed by the Executive
Board on May 22, 2001, and, later, with the themes of the full PRSP, discussed by the Executive
Board on November 20, 2003, and jointly assessed positively by the World Bank and IMF. SAC5
was also designed to disburse quickly to help ease Armenia's budgetary needs.

3.2 Revised Objective:

No revisions

3.3 Original Components:

The components of SAC5 reflected the five themes of the PRSP: (i) promoting sustainable
economic growth through macroeconomic stability and private sector development; (ii) enhancing
human development and improving social safety nets; (iii) implementing prudent fiscal policies and
reforming the tax system; (iv) improving public infrastructure; and (v) improving core public
sector functions. SAC5 also followed the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY2002-2004,
which was discussed by the Executive Board in April 2001, and was consistent with 2005-08
CAS discussed by the Board in June 2004. SAC5's components were:

1. Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability,
2. Developing Private Sector and Accelerating Public Enterprise Reform,
3. Promoting Public Sector Reforms, and
4. Advancing Social Sector Reforms (including education, health, social protection and pension).

A summary of their rationale follows:

Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability. As is typical for a structural adjustment operation,
policies consistent with macro stability were a general condition. The GOA's main objectives
were to continue improvement of fiscal control and to pursue the targets of GDP growth of 6
percent, inflation below 3 percent and gross international reserves of at least three months of
imports in 2003.

Developing Private Sector and Accelerating Public Enterprise Reform. PSD has been the
core of Armenia's reform program since SAC4. Under SAC5, the focus was to help SMEs create
employment. To achieve job creation, SAC5 supported the removal of, as well as the
simplification of, the remaining administrative barriers to private sector entry and expansion. This
included support to PSD in five areas: (1) the business and legal environment; (2) public
enterprise reform; (3) public infrastructure; (4) tax and customs administration and (5) the
financial sector. Key measures included developing the new Labor Code to increase labor market
flexibility that is needed for job creation, implementing a wide-ranging action plan emphasizing
reforms of Tax and Customs Administration, accelerating the liquidation of non-viable
state-owned enterprises (SOEs), establishing a single utility regulator, improving property tax
administration, increasing the tax yield from retail businesses and reducing rent-seeking in the
importation of petrol, tobacco, etc., closing non-viable banks and strengthening financial oversight
by the Central Bank.

Promoting Public Sector Reforms. In line with the PRSP's priorities, the GOA placed a high
priority on improving public administration and reducing corruption. The Armenia PER provided
a comprehensive agenda to achieve these goals. Major recommended measures included
completing the anti-corruption strategy, developing a more comprehensive MTEF for 2003-05


                                                  - 3 -

   that covered more sectors and spelled out strategic priorities for budget allocations, especially in
   the context of the PRSP, and implementing a number of measures to upgrade budget management
   systems.

   Advancing Social Sector Reforms. Social sector priorities were articulated in the PRSP. For
   education, the GOA planned to improve quality and better reflect the requirements of the new
   economy. To accomplish this goal, the GOA was to create a national curriculum with standards
   and a testing regime. SAC5 supported increases in teachers' salaries as well as an overall
   increased budget allocation to the education and health sectors. Rationalization to address
   inefficiencies and over-capacity was also needed and was part of the core SAC5 program. In
   health, public expenditure was extremely low, about 1.4 percent of GDP, yet there was also
   substantial inefficiency. SAC5 supported higher primary health expenditures (a target of 30
   percent of outlays in the 2003 budget), introducion of a formal co-payment scheme and carrying
   out additional rationalization of the sector with greater emphasis on primary health care and
   improved efficiency through means testing the Poverty Family Benefit (PFB),.

   SAC5 components, their objectives and results are provided in Table 1.

   3.5 Quality at Entry:


   ICR ­ Satisfactory. The preparation of SAC5 benefited from Armenia's substantial experience
   of working with the World Bank, especially in adjustment operations. There was support from a
   PHRD grant for preparation, and, to a lesser extent, from the Second Structural Adjustment
   Technical Assistance Credit (SATAC2), that had supported previous adjustment operations, for
   implementation. The Bank offered a high level of support for Armenia as the CAS lending
   envelope was US$150 million for the three-year period of which SAC5 was a part. The main
   risks and mitigation presented in the Program Document are presented in Table 2 below.

   As stated, SAC5, like SAC4, differed from its predecessors, SAC3 and SAC2, which had focused
   more on a macro agenda. The policy priorities shifted under SAC4, for example, toward
   improving the business environment by aiming at a set of issues such as procedures for registering
   and licensing businesses and other steps in order to decrease the cost of doing business. These
   priorities continued under SAC5. SAC5's design also incorporated some of the main lessons from
   previous adjustment operations. These included for example higher budget allocations to social
   sectors, and providing strong TA resources for successful program implementation, particularly
   during the second and more detailed phase of reforms. SAC5 also pursued the 2001 CAS
   objectives of improving public sector services and rebuilding human capital.

Quality at entry was enhanced through preparation of specific action plans for major components,
including improving the business and investment environment, tax and customs administration and
budget management systems (see Annex 8). These plans gave greater specificity to the more
broad core conditions. The education component was aided by the simultaneous preparation of
the Education Quality and Relevance Project (EQRP), which went to the Board just before
SAC5. The EQRP was the first of a three-phase APL. Also, in the health sector, a Health
System Modernization project was prepared which has helped achieve efficiency through hospital
consolidation with the associated savings on hospital infrastructure and staff.

The quality at entry is also supported by a detailed set of monitorable indicators. These indicators
were worked out collaboratively between Bank sector staff and the Government local experts.
The targets were ambitious, but achievable, and provided good pilot preparation for the follow-up
series of PRSCs which was approved by the Board on November 18, 2004. Prospects for
achieving SAC5 targets were enhanced by their link to the GOA budget cycle.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:


The available outcome indicators clearly show that SAC5 was satisfactory in achieving its
objectives. The main indicators are all going in the right direction, with poverty falling, the
business environment improving, foreign investment and employment rising as well. Table 1,
above, provides these outcome indicators. The individual sections below provide evidence on
achievement of objectives.

Objective 1: Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability - Satisfactory

Real GDP growth has steadily increased since 1999. Growth soared to 12.9 percent in 2002 and
to13.9 percent in 2003 as shown in Table 3. The CPI remained in single digits, although it has


                                                - 10 -

recently crept upward to over 5 percent because of the increase in international prices of oil and
wheat. The unemployment rate has continued to decline, as has the government deficit. The
accumulation of international reserves reached 4.8 months of imports compared with the SAC5
target of 3 months.

Objective 2: Developing the private sector and accelerating public enterprise reform -
Satisfactory

This objective was to be met, in part, by further reducing administrative barriers and developing
institutions for PSD. Some of the main output indicators that were achieved or exceeded include:
the reduction in the average time necessary to get construction and building renovation permits
from 310 days in 2001 to 76 days by the end of 2003; and reduction in the number of goods
subject to mandatory certification at the border 80 (2001) to 60 by the end of 2003. There was
also an increase in the volume of FDI (outside the energy sector) to US$121.2 million, exceeding
the target of US$90 million for 2003. In the area of land registration, the number of registered
business transactions with agricultural land plots increased from 2,850 at the end of 2001 to 4,600
in 2003, and the number of land certificates issued to family farmers increased from 313,000 to
580,000 during 2001-03. The time necessary to complete liquidation procedures (before assets
sales) fell from 210 days in 2002 to 125 days in 2003. Responses from private firms, directly and
through the Business Council, which is a liaison for the private sector to the Government, show
increased satisfaction with the business environment and a reduced incidence of bribes to officials.

Improvements in tax and customs administration also led to strong outcomes, which met or
exceeded targets in all cases. The revenue yields from the largest retail markets in Yerevan in
2003 increased to AMD1,780 million or 26.4 percent from the level of 2001. Revenue from the
main excisable goods, such as petrol and tobacco in 2003 increased to AMD32,148 million (25.5
percent) compared with the same period of 2001. Car importation revenue increased US$14.1
million, a 3.3 fold increase between 2001 and 2003. The number of employees registered as
active payroll taxpayers increased by 16.0 percent during from December 2002 to December
2002-03. And the outstanding VAT balances due to exporters was reduced by the end of



                                                  - 11 -

October 2003 to AMD2,843 million, a reduction of 51.4 percent compared with the end of
October 2002.

Measures relating to improving the operating environment in the power and utility sectors also
produced generally good results. The average daily number of hours when water supply was
available to dwellers of multi-apartment buildings in Yerevan increased from 3.1 hours in 2001 to
9.3 hours in 2003, exceeding the target of 6.2 hours. Domestic budget financing of road
maintenance in the first ten months of 2003 was AMD2,036.3 million compared with the
AMD995.5 million in 2002 January-October, which was on a course to come close to, but not
quite meet the target of AMD2.5 billion for the entire year. The irrigation tariff was increased
from AMD3.9 per cubic meter in 2001 to AMD4.2 per cubic meter by the end of 2003, which
met the target. The accumulated energy payment arrears by state enterprises in the water sector
and metro were AMD25.0 million against a target of zero arrears. However, these arrears
reportedly derived from delays in budget financing in 2003.

There were also measures in the financial sector that were important to private sector
development. Reforms in the financial sector had been lagging to the extent that the sector was
not fulfilling an effective intermediary role for SMEs to operate and invest. Measures in insurance
and banking helped improve the environment for SMEs. Some of the outcome indicators
included : a 25.5 percent increase in total collected insurance premiums during 2001-03; the total
paid capital of the banking system increased by 10.0 percent to AMD41.5 billion by July 2003,
compared with the end 2001 level of AMD37.7 billion (below the targeted increase of 25
percent). This increase is magnified, however, when considering that 11 banks were closed, so
the per bank capital increased significantly; the minimum capital requirements for commercial
banks also increased from US$1,150 million to US$2,000 million from July 2001 by the end of
2003. Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) also declined. The percentage of NPLs in 2001 was 6.0
percent, in 2002 and 2003, 4.9 percent, and the first quarter of 2004, 4.4 percent.

Objective 3: Promoting public sector reforms ­ Satisfactory

Activities to achieve this objective focused on better budget management. The main progress in
public expenditure management (PEM), institutionally, was in budget consolidation, better
accounting and reporting (transparency) and a more strategic budgeting approach through the
MTEF. The main outcome indicator was the share of non-classified budget expenditures in total
expenditures. This share was reduced from 25.0 percent in 2002 to 9.0 percent in 2003, against a
target of 13.0 percent. As further evidence of the achievement of this objective, the GOA ensured
that PRSP assumptions matched the MTEF for social sectors.

Objective 4: Advancing social sector reforms, including education, health, social protection
and pensions--Satisfactory

SAC5 increased emphasis relative to its predecessor operations on the social sectors. The 2003
Household Survey showed overall substantial reductions in poverty. The poverty incidence
declined from 48.9 percent in 2002 to 42.9 percent in 2003. Extreme poverty also fell sharply
from 13.0 percent to 7.4 percent during the same period.



                                                  - 12 -

Key outcome indicators in the health sector include the elimination of budget arrears in health as
of 2003, with a payoff of AMD130 million during January-October 2003. The share of the
government health budget going to primary health increased from 19.1 percent in 2001 to 33.2
percent in 2003. The overall budget for health increased 23.0 percent during 2002-03. Both
indicators exceeded the target. Taking into account the hospital consolidation that has taken
place, especially under the hospital optimization in Yerevan, there has also been significant
capacity reduction, with the decline in hospital beds from 16,000 to 14,208, and increased
utilization. The immunization target for one-year olds for measles of 90 percent was exceeded in
2003 as the rate reached 94 percent of one year-olds.

In the education sector, school rationalization targets were exceeded, which was a positive
outcome because the target set did not represent all schools that needed to be rationalized.
School staff on school payroll was reduced by 21 percent. The average teacher salary increased
by 18 percent during 2003 and by 67 percent in 2004. The average monthly wage of school
managers increased by 110 percent and a further 67 percent in 2004. The enrollment rate in
elementary education of 2002/03 educational year was 97 percent, exceeding the target of 95
percent. Budget arrears were reduced from AMD489.2 million in 2002 to 411.1 million in 2003.
The overall budget for education increased 22 percent during 2002-03.

In social protection, the average monthly Family Poverty Benefit for 2003 was AMD7, 600, an
increase of 14.0 percent compared with the annual average level of 2002, and by and additional
26.3 percent in 2004. The average monthly old-age pension increased by 30.0 percent relative to
the 2002 level, and another 20.0 percent in 2004. Another objective was improving efficiency in
benefits targeting. The efficiency of targeting has been improved for some categories of
privileged benefits.

4.2 Outputs by components:

Many of the actual outputs were listed in the three Government Action Plans: Budget
Management Systems (Promoting Public Sector Reforms component), Tax and Customs
Administration and Improving the Business and Investment Environment (Private Sector
Development and Public Enterprise Reform component). These action plans were annexes to the
Program Document for SAC5, and were an effective vehicle for creating mini-reform programs in
key areas of PSD and public sector reform. These Action Plans are included as Annex 8 to this
report.

Developing Private Sector and Accelerating Public Enterprise Reform

Tax and customs administration was implemented somewhat slowly, mainly because of the
struggle with entrenched interests that benefited from the customs regime. Particularly in
question was the import market for gasoline, which operated as a rationed market with economic
rent seeking. Still, the conditions were met and were a major achievement for the MOF, and the
major targets were reached, as shown in section 4.1.




                                                - 13 -

Labor market. The overhaul of the labor code was a lagging agenda item in an otherwise
advanced reform program. The labor code still consisted mainly of Soviet era labor regulations
that were too rigid and benefits that were too generous and, therefore, not conducive to a
growing private sector. One reason that the labor code reform came late was that there were
other priorities, mainly infrastructure, in Armenia, such as fixing water and energy delivery.
These were in a crisis condition and, to an extent, displaced the implementation of labor reform.
The new labor code was submitted to the National Assembly in December 2003 and was
approved in 2004. The new labor code reinforces the principles of freedom of association and
collective bargaining, clarifies and simplifies the basic conditions for employment contracts,
reduces minimum annual leave entitlements, removes existing declaratory privileges to particular
groups of employees and imposes labor dispute resolution.

Land registration. Land privatization was carried out early in the reform process (1991), but no
process for land markets was established until recently. The rural land market advanced as title
and construction permits became easier to obtain. In the urban land market, the reforms reduced
the time to obtain a construction permit by 80 percent.

Financial sector. Financial Sector Development (FSD) recorded important outputs. Under
SAC5, the GOA was able to close three larger and five smaller banks, which, based on quarterly
reports and audit data, had been judged to be a drain on the sector. A diagnostic study was
performed with USAID funds for Armcommunication (one of the larger banks). A foreign
investor signed an agreement for the rehabilitation and sale of the Armcommunication bank. The
financial rehabilitation plan was approved and it was confirmed that the CBA would initiate
liquidation of this bank if there were deviations from the rehabilitation plan. Following a least
cost study, the license of the Credit Yerevan was revoked. The Economic Court has appointed a
liquidator for this bank. The CBA also organized a purchase and assumption transaction for some
of the assets and liabilities of Ardshinbank. A new bank, Ardshin Investment Bank, acquired
these assets and a liquidator was appointed to liquidate the remainder of the Ardshinbank.

Promoting Public Sector Reforms

The main action was the satisfactory implementation of the medium term Action Plan for
Improving Budget Management Systems. This action plan comprises 15 action items (see Annex
8) ranging from further strengthening of the MTEF to general transparency improvement
measures such as improving procedures for the government reserve fund, establishing a data base
in the MOFE required for budget programming and measures dealing with the road maintenance
fund, irrigation tariffs and program budgeting for the social sectors. The Government made
satisfactory progress on its action plan, which the outcome indicators support.

Advancing Social Sector Reforms

Social sector reforms were emphasized more in SAC5 than in previous operations. This was
partly because previous operations had envisioned more of a trickle down approach to poverty
reduction. In SAC5 there was more active targeting of expenditures. School and hospital
rationalization were key fiscal objectives, which, along with service delivery measures, would



                                                 - 14 -

benefit the sectors by making better use of social sector resources.

Education. SAC5 was to pick up portions of financial management that were not covered by the
EQRP. The two operations also reinforced each other in major areas such as school
rationalization. SAC5, for example, helped downsized teachers to find new jobs, which helped
the Government carry through a politically difficult measure. SAC5 covered financial
management of schools, which was not in the EQRP. The education reform also covered public
universities. SAC5 supported greater transparency of their financial operations, in particular
requiring universities to document their expenditures. Universities receive public funding, so it
was also an effort to improve public accountability.

School rationalization exceeded some targets. For example, the number of schools merged was
37 vs. a target of 5. 3,500 primary and secondary teachers were downsized. At the start of the
rationalization, the student teacher ratio was 10 to 1, with the goal at the eventual end of 14 to 1.
These measures were significant also in that they were the first time that GOA implemented a real
reduction of excess schools and teachers. Under the program, criteria were developed for teacher
dismissal with the first cut being those who were of retirement age and those who were in a
temporary employment status.       It was also important to establish minimum expenditure levels on
education because Armenia spent only 2.5 percent of its GDP on education. In higher education,
an accreditation process was laid out. Financial reporting requirements were also laid out and a
strategy for further rationalization was also developed.

Health. The GOA made progress in implementing the Hospital Optimization Plan for Yerevan as
well as in implementing the financial management action plan that was satisfactory to IDA. To
reduce hospital capacity, the Government agreed to merge 34 public hospitals in Yerevan into 12
hospital networks and take the necessary steps to restructure them. The Government submitted a
time-bound hospital optimization action plan. The plan identified 4 hospital networks to be
optimized during the first phase and appoint directors for the four networks. The government
also submitted a functional analysis of the first two hospital networks along with an evaluation of
the potential for functional improvement and a socio economic impact assessment of the mergers.
The optimization plan also included planned hospital configurations and a timetable for
subsequent phases.

Social Protection/Pensions. The government adopted the Law on Pensions and developed the
supporting legislation needed to carry out the new law. Specifically, the supporting legislation
provides (i) instructions for implementing identification numbers; (ii) rules for computing and
making partial payments to those with less than requisite insurance history; (iii) terms and
procedures for recording pension insurance history for awarding pensions; (iv) listing of
documents required for awarding pensions; (v) procedures for payments of the survivor's pension
to children under full state custody; (vi) procedures for payments of the survivor's pension to
pensioners under the full state custody; and (vii) awarding, computing and making payments for
"privileged" pensions. A Pension Law Implementation Committee was established at the MOSS
to oversee implementation.

Substantial. IDI depends to an extent on sector ownership of the reforms. The
Government-owned IPRSP and subsequently the PRSP were closely linked to the
SAC5-supported reform program. The strongest indication of overall Government ownership
was the integration of annual budget with the MTEF. This link is a substantial step forward in
that, although the MTEF was introduced several years earlier, for the first time, under SAC5, the
MTEF, became a major instrument in preparing the annual budget. The central role of the MTEF
was accompanied by improvements in public expenditure management (PEM) that were assisted
by a Bank Public Expenditure Review (PER). The Government has successfully integrated the
MTEF based on the PRSP process in the annual budget in order to strengthen the links between
policies and expenditure allocations. This link also facilitates and makes more explicit the
expenditure rationalization process. Increased ownership extended to other aspects of the
program as well. For example, on the cadaster side (land registration), ownership was high and
good use was made of substantial TA to develop the foundation for land markets. Measures to
improve the legal framework for labor were carried out, which are expected to lead to further IDI
in the areas of collective bargaining and job placement services. Rationalization in the education
and health sectors has instituted principles of operational efficiency and financial flexibility.
Improved social services, financial sector operations and utility and energy services, documented
in Section 4, have all contributed to substantial IDI.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:


Factors Outside Government or Implementing Agency control

One negative external factor was the surge in the prices of key imports, oil and wheat. Armenia
maintained its reform agenda, but inflation exceeded 5 percent and therefore the target of 3



                                                     - 16 -

percent.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

Attitudinal factors also affected implementation, both positively and negatively. One positive
factor that has benefited the reform program throughout its stages can be described as Armenians'
high receptivity to outside ideas. Though entrenched interests have at times slowed reforms, the
Government has seldom challenged the rationale of reforms that have changed the Government's
way of doing business.

A factor that may impede reform is a degree of complacency, which may have developed because
Armenian growth has been so successful (double digits). One example is that it could be doing a
better job of encouraging FDI, in particular, tapping the resources and expertise of the diaspora.
This would enhance the sustainability of economic growth. Given its challenging geographic
position and other constraints, Armenia does need to be more proactive in encouraging FDI.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

As in the previous operation (SAC4), there were a couple of factors related to concern over the
impact of rationalization program that, to some extent, slowed implementation. These could be
seen in the health and education sectors with concern over downsizing. Implementation was also
somewhat slower in the Tax and Customs Administration component as an ambitious Government
action plan challenged entrenched interests. The MOF helped reduce the impact of these factors
by improving support to and coordination among ministries and agencies. There were also
effective efforts to find dismissed teachers other employment.

5.4 Costs and financing:

The total original credit amount was SDR30.2 million (US$40 million equivalent). The entire
credit amount was disbursed in two tranches. The credit was made on standard IDA terms with a
term of 40 years, a 10-year grace period, and an IDA service charge of 75 basis points on the
undisbursed balance. The borrower was the Republic of Armenia. In December 2003, the
Government of Netherlands co-financed SAC5 with a grant for Euro 4.666 million (US$5.7
million equivalent).

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:


The sustainability of the SAC5 is rated likely. The GOA satisfactorily completed all tranche
conditions and continued its long history of successful reform with the preparation of a follow-on
PRSC (Board date, November 18, 2004). Many of the reforms may prove difficult to reverse,
such as preparation and execution of the budget within the medium term expenditure framework,
the labor code reforms and the rationalization programs in the education and health sectors.
Transparency and accountability in tax and customs administration will be engrained processes
contributing to private sector development. The further improvements in the business climate
along with better-targeted social investments have also helped achieve substantial gains in poverty



                                                    - 17 -

reduction. These achievements have strengthened sustainability by winning wider support from
the public. Despite these favorable factors, there continue to be concerns about regional stability
that could affect the reform program, and which makes Armenia less attractive to investors.
Other factors include a heavy reliance on donor funding and a narrowly based manufacturing
sector. Improved service delivery, including utilities, energy and social services, combined with
the substantial reduction in poverty have won the support of the public. This support, greater
fiscal discipline and the Government's strong record of reform, suggests that sustainability of
achievements of SAC5 is likely.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

SAC5 was a kind of transition adjustment operation for the upcoming PRSCs. Armenia has
graduated to a new level where the major adjustment actions have been carried out. "Big ticket
items" like privatization and an enabling legal framework have already been implemented.
Reforms in improving the business environment have deepened. The basic labor reform has been
passed along with further improvements in registration and licensing.

The three-year follow-up reform program that is supported by the PRSCs, is anchored in the
PRSP objectives, and further bolsters sustainability. The PRSC will begin its first of three phases
in FY05. The PRSC focuses on four critical reform themes: (i) consolidating macroeconomic
discipline and strengthening of governance, (ii) sharpening competition and entrenching property
rights, (iii) mitigating of social and environmental risks, and (iv) modernizing the rural economy.
These PRSCs are front-loaded, single tranche operations. To ensure sustainability, the PRSCs are
based on verifiable outcomes.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:


Satisfactory. The project design was a good response to the need to improve the business
climate and bolster the social sectors. The design was optimistic in gauging how quickly the
program could be implemented, but it was appropriate because it challenged Armenia's
capabilities in key areas of reform. (See Quality at Entry section).

The IMF was a good partner in the reform program with particularly strong support for the
financial sector reforms. SAC5-supported reform measures were aligned closely with the IMF
PRGF, approved by the Executive Board of the IMF in 2001. Supporting measures aimed at
strengthening public finance, maintaining a monetary policy consistent with price stability,
improving regulation of the banking sector and eliminating losses by state-owned enterprises.

7.2 Supervision:


Satisfactory. The Bank PREM and HD had good links and the SAC5, Health System
Modernization Project and EQRP (education project) together helped achieve a politically
difficult school and hospital rationalization. Close coordination of technical assistance from
bilateral and multilateral donors provided a critical mass of high-quality expertise. The Bank also



                                                  - 18 -

worked well with the IMF, cooperating on the politically difficult financial reforms. The
combined influence of the two institutions helped reform the financial sector by closing banks that
were losing money.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:


Satisfactory. The Bank performed well and supported a meaningful program in priority areas
that was fully implemented and produced strong outcomes.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:


Satisfactory. The GOA was fully supportive of the reform program at the highest levels. The
Borrower worked well with the Bank in design of the operation and in identifying measures in a
wide range of areas that would have substantial impact on improving the business climate and on
social service delivery. SAC5 was closely tied to the PRSP and to the budget process, a strong
indicator of substantial institutional development.

7.5 Government implementation performance:


Satisfactory. The GOA met all conditions for the release of all tranches. Government ownership
was good, as in previous operations, and the Government improved cross-ministerial coordination
of the program, which helped achieve the main reform targets on time. Strong reform advocates,
especially the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister, strengthened government
implementation. The Minister of Finance has helped guide previous adjustment operations as
well. At times the GOA went beyond core conditions to implement a broader reform program.
And in most cases, the GOA exceeded the benchmarks associated with the core conditions.

During implementation, the Bank had some concern regarding financial sector legislation. After
strengthening oversight and regulation of banking institutions, the GOA passed a law for
non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). The NBFI law was sufficiently vague to concern the
Bank and IMF that it might encourage regulatory arbitrage. NBFIs, which were not as closely
regulated as banks at the time, could have been allowed to take deposits and expose depositors to
considerable risks. The Bank and the Fund stepped in when the secondary regulations were being
drafted to ensure that NBFIs could not take deposits.

7.6 Implementing Agency:


Satisfactory. The MOF performed well with good coordination with other ministries in
implementing SAC5 conditions. One example of good IA performance was the State Committee
of the Real Property Cadastre. This entity performed well in moving the land registration process
forward making good use of TA and accelerating the titling process. The Armenian Development
Agency strengthened its capacity and became a focal point for government's investment and
export promotion activities and identifying bottlenecks in the business environment. The Ministry
of Justice did a particularly good job in its role in reforming the legal framework for business and
infrastructure and design of the labor code. Other IAs, especially social sector line ministries,
performed satisfactorily as well and utilized the TA support and related investment operations to


                                                  - 19 -

develop the capacity to implement reforms.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:


Satisfactory. Except for the few areas cited that can be improved under the PRSCs, borrower
performance on the whole was strong.

8. Lessons Learned

Establishing macroeconomic fundamentals before focusing on improving the business
environment is an effective development strategy. Improvements to the business environment
will not be effective until macro fundamentals are in place. The overall strategy of the reform
program from the Rehabilitation Credit to SAC5 of first establishing macroeconomic
fundamentals, and then focusing on improving the business environment has succeeded. There
was concern up to the preparation of SAC4 when rapid growth was not well distributed, but
growth benefits eventually spread more evenly as new data reveal.

Focusing on improving the business environment vs. more targeted interventions in health,
education and social protection is not necessarily an either/or proposition. With rapid
growth and fiscal savings through social sector rationalization, higher social expenditures were
possible simultaneously with continued business environment improvements. Thus, the social
sectors could also be adequately funded.

Monitoring instruments and taking into account feedbacks can play an important role in
design and implementation of an effective reform program. The use of monitoring
instruments and the incorporation of their feedback help improve both design and implementation
of a reform program. The Government closely monitored and evaluated SAC 5 through periodic
surveys and assessments. This M&E process significantly improved the effectiveness of
supervision and provided insights for the design of structural reforms, which are supported under
the PRSC. The Government closely monitored and evaluated through periodic surveys and
assessments implementation of the SAC5. This process guided the supervision and impact
assessments of the reform program and provided insights for the design of structural reforms
which are supported under the PRSC.

9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:

The fifth consecutive Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC V), provided to Armenia by the IDA
like the SAC IV somewhat differed from its predecessors, SAC III, SAC II and SACI, and aimed
to increase employment and spread the benefits of growth throughout the population. The credit
represented a significant source of budget deficit financing, and was crucial in terms of
development impact directed to the developing of private sector and the delivery of social
services. Taking into consideration Armenia's limited access to alternative sources of budget
support SAC V was of crucial importance to avoid contraction of and even increase the level of
public expenditures in the socially sensitive areas.




                                                 - 20 -

The Government of Armenia holds the view that SAC V was in accordance with the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper adopted by the Government as the components of SAC V focused on:
(i) promoting sustainable economic growth through macroeconomic stability and private sector
development; (ii) enhancing human development and improving social safety nets; (iii)
implementing prudent fiscal policies and reforming the tax system; (iv) improving public
infrastructure; and (v) improving core public sector functions.

In Government's opinion, the project supported by SAC V was especially successful in the
following directions:

        (i) Developing private sector by reducing administrative barriers and developing
        institutions for private sector development,

        (ii) Promoting public sector reforms by improving budget management through improving
        public expenditures management and developing strategic budgeting approach, reducing
        corruption, and

        (iii) Advancing social sector reforms by improving service delivery, which is essential for
        poverty reduction and human development.

At the same time, the Government realizes that further success in implementation of poverty
reduction and sustainability in reform process is dependent on continuous capacity building in
governmental structures. Armenia faced negative external factors during SAC V implementation
due to rising oil and wheat prices, which impacted the economy because Armenia is an oil and
wheat importer.

However, Government's strengthening fiscal discipline and strong support of reforms made
achievements of SAC V sustainable. The Government appreciates the flexibility and
understanding displayed by the Bank in the light of factors outside the Government's control that
hampered proper implementation of specific elements of the SAC V program.

The three-year follow-up reform program supported by the Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSC) is anchored in the PRSP objectives, and further bolsters sustainability of reforms. The
PRSC will be focused on such critical reform areas as: (i) consolidating macroeconomic discipline
and strengthening of governance, (ii) sharpening competition and entrenching property rights, (iii)
mitigating of social and environmental risks, and (iv) modernizing the rural economy.
