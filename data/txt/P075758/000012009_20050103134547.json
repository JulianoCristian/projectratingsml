Notwithstanding, lessons\n            suggest the following. The establishment of macroeconomic\n            fundamentals before focusing on improving the business\n            environment is an effective development strategy. The\n            overall strategy of the reform program under the initial\n            Rehabilitation Credit Project through this Fifth Structural\n            Adjustment Credit Project proved successful, i.e.,\n            macroeconomic fundamentals were first established, to then\n            focus on improving the business environment. With rapid\n            growth and fiscal savings through social sector\n            rationalization, higher social expenditures were possible\n            simultaneously, with continued business environment\n            improvements. Thus, the social sectors could also be\n            adequately funded. Moreover, monitoring instruments and\n            taking into account feedbacks can play an important role in\n            design and implementation of an effective reform program"}, "docdt": "2004-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
