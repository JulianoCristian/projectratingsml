of\n            National Public Management Information Systems Project for\n            Colombia were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk\n            to development outcome was moderate,

Some lessons learned included:\n            continuity in operational teams can have a substantial\n            impact on projects\u2019 success in achieving development\n            outcomes. Creating and maintaining interoperability - the\n            ability of information systems to have harmonized concepts\n            and data, and automatically exchange information - is a\n            process that requires continual reassessment, evolution, and\n            a phased approach. Thorough and complete risk assessments -\n            and the ability to adjust quickly when challenges arise -\n            can play a critical role in ensuring the successful\n            implementation of complicated activities. When designing a\n            component or sub-component that is highly concentrated in\n            information technology (IT) investment, it is important to\n            either engage in a deep analysis of the desired\n            functionalities during the preparation phase in order to\n            ensure a clear understanding of the scope of the system, or\n            to build in some flexibility in the allocation of project\n            funds in the event of greater than expected costs."}, "docdt": "2015-06-15T13:24:03Z"}
