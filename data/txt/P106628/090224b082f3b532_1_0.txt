F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Project was to solidify and expand the gains achieved by the
Borrower under PFM II and further improve the transparency, coverage, operation and
Interoperability of the Borrower's national public management information systems to
allow the Borrower's decision-makers to link performance measures with planning,
budgeting, and other managerial actions.

  The Project was to focus on:
   i. Enhancing public sector efficiency and transparency by strengthening and
       expanding the individual management information systems that are the building
       blocks of an integrated, performance-informed management model, including
       SIIF-Nación, SUIFP and MUISCA.
   ii. Support the design and implementation of mechanisms aimed at enabling the inter-
        operability of individual public management tools and systems.
   iii. Promoting the full use of information resulting from these integrated PM tools and
        systems to enhance strategic decision making.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      At the time of Project design, Colombia’s economy – which had been performing
well in recent years as a result of sound economic policies, far-reaching structural
reforms and favorable external conditions – faced some challenges. The global economic
downturn was posing new challenges to Colombia’s near term economic performance,
with gross domestic product (GDP) growth having slowed from 7.5 percent in 2007 to
just 2.5 percent during 2008 and the structural balance weakening that year in spite of the
Government’s decision to cut government spending. Fiscal responsibility was perceived
as key to assuring markets that public debt as a share of GDP would continue to decline,
and that the public sector’s financing needs would remain modest.

2.      The uncertainties of the global economic environment called for a flexible
approach to fiscal management. In the short term, advances in the implementation of
performance-oriented information mechanisms and integrated fiscal management tools
were viewed as something that could greatly enhance the quality of information and
decision making for the allocation of budget expenditures, improving the quality of
expenditure and the efficiency of public revenue collection. In the medium and long
terms, improvements in the quality and availability of information related to expenditure,
incomes, investment, debt and other fiscal issues were seen as crucial to improving the
transparency, efficiency and efficacy of public management of resources.

3.      Progress toward enhancing public sector management and improving
transparency in public finances had been substantial over the prior ten years, and included
important advances such as the clarification of expenditure management responsibilities
among different levels of government, the introduction of modem accounting concepts
and procedures, and the improvement of Public Management (PM) tools and systems in
areas covering expenditure and revenue, as well as monitoring and evaluation (M&E),
macro-programming and debt management functions. The Bank had provided support to
the different phases in the development and implementation of these public management
systems and tools through several different projects, including the First Public Financial
Management Project 1 (PFM I) which provided technical assistance to support incipient
government efforts to strengthen resource mobilization, macro-programming,
expenditure management, and government management control and public policy
evaluation, and included support to the early stages of the performance-informed Public
Sector Performance Evaluation System’s (Sistema Nacional de Evaluación de Resultados
de la Gestión Pública, SINERGIA) development. A follow-on operation, the Public
Financial Management II Project 2 (PFM II) supported reforms in revenue administration

and public expenditure management at the central government level, including the
development of new information systems and strengthening of existing ones 3.

4.      As such, the current Project was designed to support the third phase in the
development of Colombia’s Public Management systems by addressing some of these
remaining structural and other challenges to fully operationalizing existing public
management tools and systems and supporting an integrated vision of a performance-
oriented public management system by building upon and consolidating the achievements
of the PFM I & II operations. Over the years, the Bank had amassed valuable country-
specific expertise on the development challenges confronting Colombia’s achievement of
ongoing public sector management strengthening goals and was well positioned to
support efforts in this area. The Project was fully consistent with both Bank and
Government priorities, aligned with both the pillar of Colombia’s National Development
Plan for 2006-2010 called “A better state at the service of citizens” and a similarly named
pillar (“A State at the Service of its Citizens: Efficient and Effective Government.”) in
the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY2008-2011 (Report No. 42847-CO).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
5.     The objective of the Project were to solidify and expand the gains achieved by the
Borrower under PFM II and further improve the transparency, coverage, operation and
Interoperability of the Borrower’s national public management information systems to
allow the Borrower’s decision-makers to link performance measures with planning,
budgeting, and other managerial actions. 4

6.      The Project was to focus on 5:
         i.     Enhancing public sector efficiency and transparency by strengthening and
                expanding the individual management information systems that are the
                building blocks of an integrated, performance-informed management
                model, including SIIF-Nación, SUIFP and MUISCA.
         ii.    Support the design and implementation of mechanisms aimed at enabling
                the inter-operability of individual public management tools and systems.
         iii.   Promoting the full use of information resulting from these integrated PM
                tools and systems to enhance strategic decision making.



3
  Systems supported included the development of the Integrated Financial Management Information
System named SIIF-Nación; a new Unified Investment Management System (Sistema Unificado de
Inversiones y Finanzas Públicas – SUIFP), and the Integrated Tax and Customs Administration Model
(Modelo Único de Ingresos, Servicios y Control Autorizado - MUISCA); and enhancement of the
Integrated Financial Management Information System SIIF I, the National Investment Projects Bank
(Banco de Proyectos de Inversión Nacional - BPIN), and the strengthening of SINERGIA and one of its
components, the System of Programming and Management by Objectives and Results (Sistema de
Programación y Gestión por Objetivos y Resultados – SIGOB).

  As per the Loan Agreement dated December 29, 2009.

  These specific focuses were noted in paragraph 21 of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), describing
the Project’s development objective. However, only paragraph 5, above, appears in both the Loan
Agreement and the PAD. As such, project efficacy is evaluated against the objective as defined in the Loan
Agreement.


                                                    2
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
7.      No changes were made to the PDO during implementation. In the January 2013
restructuring, two PDO indicators were revised in order to adjust the baseline of PDO#5
to reflect the real 2009 year end value (and consequently adjust the targets so that the
percentage increase in efficiency was maintained), and to change the indicator designed
to capture increased capacity of the unit responsible for carrying out macroeconomic and
fiscal forecasting (PDO#6). See Annex 10 for a summary of PDO indicators and changes.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
8.      As captured by the PAD’s description of the higher level objectives to which the
Project was to contribute, the direct beneficiaries of the Project were expected to be
Colombian decision-makers, both within the Presidency and individual agencies who,
through the use of performance-based information, would be able to link performance
with planning, budgeting and other managerial actions. As the further expansion and
consolidation of Colombia’s public management continued to strengthen Colombia’s
public sector performance, consolidating fiscal discipline and promoting a better
allocation of resources, the general public was to be an indirect beneficiary.

1.5 Original Components

9.      Component 1: Strengthening of Public Management Information Systems
within the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (Ministerio de Hacienda y Crédito
Público, MHCP) (US$8.8 million of IBRD financing). This component was to support
the strengthening of the technical and institutional capabilities of the MHCP, through the
provision of technical assistance, training and equipment required for the enhancement,
implementation, completion and consolidation of the public management information
systems developed under PFM II.

10.     Component 2: Strengthening of the Public Management Information
Systems within the National Planning Directorate (Departamento Nacional de
Planeación, DNP) (US$1.2 million of IBRD financing). This component sought to
strengthen the technical and institutional capabilities of DNP, through the provision of
technical assistance, training and equipment aimed at increasing the overall efficiency
and efficacy of the Government’s public investments and the consolidation of
advancements achieved in the development of SUIFP under PFM II.

11.    Component 3: Expansion of the National Tax and Customs Directorate’s
(Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales, DIAN) Integrated Tax and Customs
Administration Model (US$8.0 million of IBRD financing). This component was to
support the carrying out of a series of activities aimed at supporting the consolidation,
continuity and further development of MUISCA through the acquisition of goods,
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure, operating costs and
the provision of technical assistance.



                                            3
12.    Component 4: Improving the Interoperability of Public Management
Information Systems (US$5.8 million of IBRD financing). This component was to
underpin the carrying out of a series of activities aimed at supporting the integration of
key public information systems and promoting the strategic use of information generated
by said systems with a view to enhancing policy making and building capacity within the
Public Credit and Treasury Directorate (Dirección General de Crédito Público y del
Tesoro Nacional, DGCPTN).

13.    Component 5: Project Management (US$1.2 million of IBRD financing). This
component was to support the strengthening of MHCP and DNP (including through the
provision of operating costs and the carrying out of Project staff training programs)
underlying the carrying out of Project coordination and management activities.

1.6 Revised Components
14.     In the January 2013 restructuring 6, one of the aims of Subcomponent 4.3 was
modified from “Provision of technical assistance to support MCHP with the
development, establishment, and operation of the Center for Fiscal and Financial Studies”
to “Provision of technical assistance to strengthen the Technical Vice-Ministry,
especially the General Directorate of Macro Economic Policy, to conduct sound policy
making, through the carrying out of high impact macro-economic and fiscal technical
studies”, reflecting the change in PDO#6 carried out at that time.

1.7 Other significant changes
15.     Over the course of implementation, three Level 2 restructurings took place
following Government requests. The first, in May 2012 7, extended the closing date from
December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013, with the goal of allowing time for the
development and implementation of information technology (IT) systems in DGCPTN
under Subcomponent 4.2 of the Project. In January 2013, a second restructuring took
place, revising two PDO indicators and seven intermediate indicators to better capture
Project results. Finally, in December 2013 8, a final restructuring was approved to extend
the closing date by 11.5 months to December 15, 2014; redefine selected activities in
Component 4.2, and initiate modernization of the DGCPTN via a business re-engineering
exercise and design of a new business model; carry out a partial cancellation of loan
funds originally allocated to Component 3 given that the component’s activities had
already been completed, and reallocate loan funds by expenditure category. (See Annex
11 for details on the reallocation of funds.)

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
16.    Project design built upon the work of and experiences learned through the PFM I
and II Projects. Lessons learned from these past projects – and in particular PFM II,

which included work with the same three agencies (MHCP, DNP, and DIAN) involved in
the current Project - were incorporated into design. In doing so, the Project endeavored
to focus upon objectives that would be achievable in the short-term timeline of project
implementation (rather than structural changes that often take much longer to realize).
The Project was expected to be implemented over the course of three years (with an
initial expected closing date of December 31, 2012). While many of the Project activities
were largely completed by the end of 2012, total project duration was almost two years
longer to allow for completion of the activities under Component 4.2, following their
revision to ensure the subcomponent’s continuing relevance to the client in the December
2013 restructuring.

17.     The Project Administration Unit (PAU) (housed within the MHCP) had been
responsible for implementation of PFM II, allowing it to build upon its experience
coordinating the required inter-institutional implementation arrangements, as well as
familiarity with Bank rules and procedures. As in PFM II, fiduciary responsibilities
(procurement, financial management and disbursement) were the responsibility of each of
the three participating entities through their respective line units and technical staff, with
all reporting to the MHCP. Technical committees were created within each implementing
agency with the purpose of ensuring coordination at the technical level.

18.    The Project structure (both in terms of the overall organization of components, as
well as the activities within shared components) was clearly divided by implementing
agency. The MHCP was responsible for implementation of Component 1 and
Subcomponents 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5 (jointly with DNP), as well as overall project
coordination in close cooperation with DNP and DIAN. DNP was responsible for
Component 2 and Sub-components 4.1, 4.3 and 5 (jointly with MHCP); and DIAN for
Component 3.

19.     The risk assessment was extensive, identifying a number of potential risks,
including a change in authorities and complex implementation arrangements. Following
the challenges associated with the implementation of SIIF-Nación in 2009, the risk
assessment associated with Component 1 was very comprehensive, and reflected a
detailed understanding of the challenges that can arise with the implementation of such
systems and the appropriate mitigating actions (the effectiveness of which can be seen in
timely completion of the system’s development and implementation). Fewer risks were
identified in relation to the other components. Given some of the challenges later
encountered (specifically related to Component 4.2, discussed in Section 2.2), it seems
that implementation could have perhaps been smoothed through a more careful
consideration of the focus at design, or at least, a deeper analysis of the associated risks
and the potential strategies for their mitigation.

2.2 Implementation

20.      Overall, implementation progressed quite smoothly, with the majority of Project
activities being completed more or less within the expected timeline.

Component 1


                                              5
21.      Given the identified challenges and corresponding risks associated with finishing
the development of SIIF-Nación and its rollout within Component 1, particular attention
was paid to such activities from the very beginning of implementation in order to ensure
proactive support to any challenges encountered. As recommended by the Bank, soon
after effectiveness, the MHCP created a team of international experts with experience in
the implementation of similar systems to work side-by-side with the Ministry’s technical
team, evaluate the system’s current status, and propose the measures necessary to ensure
its operation and launch. Following the diagnosis of key issues that could impact the
system’s performance in the short-run, by June 2010, a plan for the system’s adjustment
and launching was prepared 9 and followed up upon. As a result of this proactive and
responsive strategy, the system was successfully launched in January 2011, which in fact
served as the basis for the launching of the Government’s Economic Transparency
Portal 10 later that year.

22.     The successful advancement of SIIF-Nación presented the Government and the
Bank with the opportunity to advance on a related agenda - the introduction of a Single
Treasury Account (STA). Given that the laws needed to create the legal basis for an STA
had not yet been passed at the time of Project design, such work had not been explicitly
mentioned at that time. However, following the passing of such legislation in 2011, and
given its alignment with the scope of Component 1’s activities - work was undertaken to
support the development of the STA’s conceptual model (covering modules for
parameterization, payments, and consolidation). This work was leveraged to initiate the
related necessary adjustments to the SIIF, and the payments module was launched in
January 2015.

23.     Activities within Component 1.2 also proceeded largely as planned, with the
MHCP obtaining quality management certifications (ISO 9001:2008 and NTCGP
1000:2009) in July 2010 (maintained through a monitoring audit in 2011), developing
qualified internal auditors of process quality through training, measuring gaps in the
behavioral competencies to support human resources management, and implementing the
Integrated Management Monitoring System (Sistema de Monitoreo de la Gestión Integral,
SMGI), among other activities. However, no advances were made within the Project
regarding the adjustments to the MHCP’s organizational structure to incorporate the
Unified Management System’s (Sistema Único de Gestión, SUG) plan, as an analysis for
organizational change was instead undertaken and initiated as part of the MHCP’s work
under the 2010-2014 National Development plan. Additionally, as a result of the new
functions assigned to the MHCP and the expected structural reorganization, it was
decided to postpone the external audit to recertify the SUG for three years until after the
finalization of the new structure (still pending).

                                                     6
24.    Work within Component 2 proceeded as planned, with most activities being
executed in 2010 and 2011. By the time of the mid-term review, SUIFP was
consolidated, and activities were focused on promoting its diffusion, with efforts being
made to improve the usability of the information systems. As of Project closure, the
DNP was continuing to work on the automatization of processes related to the registry
and approval of budget processes.

Component 3:
25.     In turn, while achieving a number of its objectives, implementation of Component
3 did encounter some challenges.

26.     Project design was primarily focused on the further development and
consolidation of MUISCA, with a focus on modernizing aspects of customs
administration. In 2011, the project did not advance as quickly as expected. Legal
changes in law mid-way through implementation also contributed to slower than
expected progress as DIAN’s attention and internal resources needed to be directed away
from the development of new capabilities and towards the continuing operation of
existing functions.

27.     Imprecision in the original definition of results indicators contributed to
difficulties in measuring project progress within the component. As a result, in mid-2013,
a series of methodological clarifications to three intermediate indicators 11 and one PDO
indicator 12 measurements were discussed and agreed upon by the Bank and the
Government. Among the methodological revisions was a clarification to the type of
channel for which the PDO indicator related to customs clearance time would be
measured (electronic payments, without physical or document inspection), as well as the
stage at which a high impact procedures could be considered to have been modernized (in
this case, it was determined that processes would be considered modernized when the
physical advance was at least 50 percent and there were enough operational elements to
allow it to be put into production and its provision of a significant number of services to
external and internal users).

28.     In spite of advances (detailed in Section 3), implementation progress was
ultimately limited by the slower than expected implementation of a new Customs Statute,
which has prevented the full rollout of advances such as the complete elimination of
paper processes (a change which requires legal modification through the statute before it
can be implemented). Additionally, since 2013 there has been an increased focus on
further strengthening the robustness and inviolability of the customs system. As a result
of both the fact that the current system has more or less fulfilled its natural lifecycle as
well as the fact that the security of customs systems needs to be continually revised to


11
   The number of high impact DIAN procedures that have been modernized increase from 20 to 40 (100%);
Number of Systems Services (Servicios Informáticos Electrónicos) transferred to DIAN’s technology area
increases from 12 to 40; and The average number of physical documents required for customs clearance
has been reduced from 12 to 5.
12
   Average time to clear customs decreases from 48 hours to less than 8 hours.

ensure protection against cyberattacks or other associated risks, the Government has
decided to look into the possibility of developing a customs module outside of MUISCA
that would interact with such.

Component 4:
29.     Many aspects of Component 4’s implementation also proceeded quite smoothly,
with work to pilot interoperability functions between SIIF-Nación and systems including
SUIFP, the Electronic Procurement System (Sistema Electrónico de Contratación
Pública, SECOP), the Logistic Synergy System (Sinergia Lógistica, SILOG), Public
Debt and the Gasoline Tax being successfully implemented, as well as activities targeted
toward supporting strengthening of the information collected through the Single
Territorial Form (Formulario Único Territorial, FUT) and the DELFOS system, the
approval of Decree 4836 (2011) – promoting the use of SIIF and SUIFP, and a web tool
serving as a database of unitary costs and values within the public sector being developed,
among other things. While the Center for Fiscal and Financial Studies was not able to be
implemented as anticipated at design (with neither staff nor budget assigned to the center
as planned in 2012 following a change in the Government administration), adjustment to
the related PDO indicator in the January 2013 restructuring targeted the completion of
twelve studies to strengthen macro-fiscal programming being carried out in MHCP and
DNP.

30.    However, significant challenges were encountered in the implementation of
Subcomponent 4.2 (which targeted the strengthening of the DGCPTN with a focus on the
development and implementation of an integrated information and management system)
in large part due to an overly broad initial scope of work and numerous changes in
leadership.

31.     In 2010, implementation was put on hold due to the upcoming change in
administration, and delays in the re-initiation of work after the transition were
encountered while the Government familiarized itself with the work and revised progress
to date, including an International Monetary Fund (IMF) diagnostic. The Internationally
Competitive Bidding Process (ICB) for the system was launched in January 2012, but due
to a mismatch between the broad scope of work planned and the available budget, it was
determined that none of the bids met the requirements and the process was cancelled
without awarding of the contract.

32.    Following this, the Bank and the Government worked to re-orient the strategy
pursued under the subcomponent in order to ensure its relevance and alignment with
Government needs, and in 2013, it was decided to focus on the optimization of the
DGCPTN’s business model. While the plan for how to do so suffered from some
changes (contributing to implementation delays) as a result of changes in administration,
under the 11.5 month extension of the closing date in December 2013, it was ultimately
decided to contract an individual to design the DGCPTN’s strategic framework, a
recommended business model, and an implementation strategy for proposed business
model, work which was successfully completed in the second half of 2014.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization


                                            8
33.    Overall, the design, implementation, and utilization of the monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) arrangements are considered to be satisfactory.

34.    Overall, M&E design is considered to have been satisfactory. The monitoring and
evaluation framework was comprehensive, with the set of indicators being overall well-
defined to measure progress in each of the Project’s areas. In retrospect, given the
methodological adjustments necessary for measurement of some indicators within
Component 3, it seems that some aspects could have benefited from a deeper analysis at
design. However, these challenges were limited, and corrected during implementation.

35.    Implementation and utilization of the M&E arrangements is also considered to
have been satisfactory. M&E was carried out by a coordinator in each executing agency,
with the MHCP leading coordination between the three entities for the overall project. A
technical committee met every three months to monitor the Project, approve annual
operational plans and any changes to financing. Progress reports were provided to the
Bank regularly - and with greater frequency than stipulated by the Loan Agreement 13 -
providing both the Bank and the counterpart with important information on the
advancement toward project objectives.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

36.     Financial management was considered to be Satisfactory through June 2011
(through Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) #3). In January 2012 (ISR#4),
FM was downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory based on the results of a FM
supervision mission in August 2011, due to audit report findings that indicated moderate
shortcomings in financial management that jeopardized capacity to provide timely and
reliable information to manage and monitor project implementation; due to the ongoing
implementation of the accounting module in SIIF-Nación, executing entities had not been
able to generate their financial reports as of March of that year. The rating was raised to
Moderately Satisfactory in August 2012 (ISR#5), as moderate shortcomings in financial
management continued to exist but did not prevent the timely and reliable provision of
information for project management. Issues with SIIF-Nación continued to pose some
challenges for financial management, and the rating was maintained at Moderately
Satisfactory for the remainder of implementation.

37.    Procurement was satisfactory through June 2011 (ISR#3), and downgraded to MS
in January 2012 (ISR#4) due to the risks at that time associated with DNP needing to
appoint a procurement coordinator for the project. The rating was maintained during the
next ISR due to issues with procurement planning and monitoring, and an increase in the




13
  In the October 2010 mission, the Government and the Bank agreed upon submission of progress reports
twice a year instead of the one per year required under the Loan Agreement.



                                                  9
number of directly contracted consultants, and remained moderately satisfactory
throughout the remainder of implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

38.     With many areas of work under the Project having been completed by 2012, there
is already significant evidence of the continuation of activities well-beyond the scope of
the Project. SIIF-Nación continues to successfully operate, and the Bank and the
Government have discussed the possibility of financing an extended system, the rollout
of the implementation of the new business model developed under Subcomponent 4.2 of
the current Project for the DGCPTN and the supporting information system, as well as
the development of integration interfaces for external systems (important for the next
phase of work to further institutionalize interoperability). Similarly, the SUIFP and
MUISCA systems continue to be operated by DNP and DIAN (respectively). Both
agencies are continuing efforts to develop additional capabilities and enhance their
systems’ interoperability, and DIAN is also now exploring the development of a customs
module outside of MUISCA. The Customs Statute is expected to be approved in the near
future, allowing for advances in paperless processing, and initial discussions between the
Bank and the Government have taken place regarding the possibility of continuing Bank
support to DIAN through a reimbursable advisory service.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
39.     Overall relevance is considered to be substantial. The Project was fully aligned
with Engagement Area 3 (Inclusive Growth with Enhanced Productivity) of the CPS for
FY12-16 14 , which included “Improved Public Sector Management and Equity and
Efficiency of Economic Policies” as a Results Area” with Outcome 1 targeting enhanced
public sector efficiency and transparency by strengthening and expanding individual
management information systems that are the building blocks of an integrated,
performance-informed management model and specifically mentioning the Project (and
its progress contributing to the subsequent achievement of the corresponding indicator in
the 2014 CPS Progress Report). 15 The objectives remain of high relevance to the
Government; the Government and the Bank are discussing the potential for a future
project that would continue deepening this agenda and aligns with the country’s current
OECD accession process.

40.      The relevance of design and implementation is also considered to be substantial.
Design targeted the consolidation of systems developed through prior projects, as well as
activities that were complementary to these efforts to further strengthen key public
information management systems in Colombia. While Component 3’s assumption at

design that customs would be fully implemented within MUISCA did not maintain such
high relevance, the Government’s continuing commitment to modernizing and
consolidating customs administration (albeit in a separate system) highlights the strong
relevance of the objectives pursued by design. Project implementation was highly
responsive to the realities encountered, proactively advancing on work critical to project
objectives and making the adjustments necessary when challenges that were encountered.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

41.     Overall, the Project demonstrates a substantial level of achievement of its
objective to solidify and expand the gains achieved by the Borrower under PFM II and
further improve the transparency, coverage, operation and Interoperability of the
Borrower’s national public management information systems to allow the Borrower’s
decision-makers to link performance measures with planning, budgeting, and other
managerial actions. (Please see Annex 12 for a summary of achievement of PDO
indicators.)

42.     The objective related to improving the transparency of the Government’s
national public management information systems is considered to have been substantially
achieved. The successful launch of SIIF-Nación facilitated the development and
launching of the Economic Transparency Portal 16 , through which 100 percent of
consolidated budget information (including information on income, expenditures,
contracting, accounting and regional level data) is published and accessible to the public
one day after it becomes available (achievement of PDO#3). The system has helped to
strengthen accountability, providing important information for decision-making to
government entities, including the President, and moving ahead emphasis is being placed
on ensuring that the information is not only available to the public, but that it is also
presented in a meaningful way. Similarly, SUIFP has also contributed to transparency in
the public investment process, providing timely and good quality information on all
stages of public investment (formulation, programming, execution and monitoring). The
indicator measuring transparency in DIAN (Intermediate Indicator #13) was not achieved
during Project implementation due to the lack of measurement of the targeted index
(measurement was not within DIAN’s competencies).

43.    In regards to the objective related to improving the coverage of national public
management information systems, the objective is considered to have been substantially
achieved. With the issuance of Decree 4836 (2011), SIIF and SUIFP were made the
primary sources for decision-making related to the budget. With the launching of SIIF-
Nación, 100 percent of information on budget execution is now available on a daily basis
(achievement of PDO#1) and consolidated budget information available through the
Economic Transparency Portal (achievement of PDO#3). The system covers all central
government entities, and has also been implemented in 105 subnational entities. With the
passing of Decree 2844 (2010), use of SUIFP (which now covers all stages of the
investment process, from formulation to monitoring as well as components on budget

                                           11
project and modifications 17) is required by all entities to present projects, and the ratio
between the number of projects programmed and the number of projects registered has
risen to 122 percent. Additionally, new functions added within the BPIN module allow
for definition and monitoring of the value chain associated with investment projects, and
a database for registry of investment projects presented for financing through royalties
funds was also developed, facilitating compliance with existing agreements. In DIAN,
66 services - covering areas such as implementation of price controls and monthly reports
within selective imports, controls and auditing actions, institutional procedures for
process management, among others - have been developed and transferred to the
technological area.

44.     The objective related to improving the operation of national public information
systems is also considered to have been substantially achieved. SIIF-Nación, which
allows for standardized, real-time public accounting, has facilitated much more rapid
production of information, with aggregate information on the central government entities
and 105 subnationals now available within one day; previously, it took 35 days for
decentralized entities (achievement of PDO#2). The system is now much faster, more
stable and efficient, with the most complex process - which previously took seven
minutes – now only taking 81 seconds, and covers functions including budget
programming, administration of appropriations, annual procurement plans, expenditure
management, management of treasury payments, management of treasury revenue,
revenue management and accounting management. As previously mentioned, the
conceptual model for the STA was also developed under the Project, and is now in the
process of being developed and implemented. SUIFP has also brought about
improvements in the time related to the budget cycle and responses related to the various
stages in the public investment process. Efforts were also made to ensure the usability of
the system, with training having been delivered and a focus placed on improving system
interfaces and the performance of key processes. Advances in operation can also be seen
in the tax and customs system; average customs clearance time has decreased from 48
hours to 6.7 hours with electronic payment (achievement of PDO#4), tax administration
efficiency (as measured by total tax collection/DIAN’s executed budget) increased from
103.2 to 106.03 (achievement of PDO#5), and more than 560,000 pending obligations
normalized.

45.     Other advances contributing to improved operation include the completion of
studies to strengthen macro-fiscal programming in both MHCP and DNP (achievement of
PDO#6), providing the Government with important information and contributing to
overall better macro-fiscal management, as well as the quality certification (and
subsequent maintenance of such) of SUG (although as discussed in Section 2.2, this
certification has not been maintained), and progress was also made in closing HR
competency gaps and the SMGI implemented, making it the single repository of
management information in the MHCP and facilitating reporting and the implementation
of SUG processes. While work related to the DGCTPN did not advance as expected and

  Work to automate processes associated with budget procedures that take place during project execution is
currently underway.


                                                   12
the planned system was not able to be implemented, important progress was made in
defining the business model, and is expected to be continued in the future. Other
important advances under the Project that have contributed to the better operation of
public information systems include work on budget classifiers, and the development of a
Bank of Unitary Values and Costs.

46.      Finally, the objective related to improving the interoperability of national public
information systems is also considered to have been substantially achieved. The
information in SIIF-Nación and SUIFP on budget allocations and execution is now fully
consistent (achievement of PDO#7). There is 100 percent interoperability between SIIF-
Nación and the Bank of the Republic’s payment system, as well as with SECOP (in the
areas of CDP, commitments and future fiscal years) and MHCP’s Public Debt (through
flat files used to make debt payments. Additionally, pilots were carried out to integrate
the data generated by different government systems (between SIIF-Nación and SUIFP,
SECOP, the Ministry of Defense’s SILOG, and the Gasoline Tax system). While given
the evolving nature of the different systems involved in this effort, work is still needed to
continue to develop (and completely institutionalize) full interoperability, the Project’s
achievements reflect important advances in this process, and are expected to serve as the
foundation for future work.

3.3 Efficiency

Overall project efficiency is considered to have been substantial. In 2011, the MHCP
carried out initial calculations to estimate the value of annual savings resulting from the
implementation of SIIF-Nación. Four areas of savings were identified by the
Government, summing to a total of approximately US$105.75 million (COP$205
billion) 18: 1) other public entities no longer needed to develop, acquire, and maintain
their own financial management systems (savings of COP$40 billion, U.S$20.63
million); 2) no longer utilizing paper checks (COP$10 billion, US$5.16 million dollars);
3) direct wage transfers to the final beneficiaries in medium and small entities (COP$21
billion, US$10.83 million); and 4) direct transfers of central government resources to the
entities executing investment projects (COP$134 billion, US$69.12 million). (See Annex
3 for a description of how the Government calculated these estimations.) The project has
also contributed to the operational efficiency of the Government through a variety of
channels, which can be seen in a number of ways, including the ability to process
payments to contractors more quickly, improved response times of the SIIF-Nación help
desk and of public investment processes, and the reduction in customs clearance time to
less than seven hours with electronic payments.

47.    These savings suggest that project efficiency was quite high. With Project costs
(both Bank and Borrower resources) of US$33.85 million, estimated annual savings in
each year since 2011 have exceeded total project costs by a factor of more than three.


18
  A presentation reporting these estimated savings can be found here:
http://www.minhacienda.gov.co/portal/page/portal/HomeMinhacienda/siif/ObjetivoContenido/ASPECTOS
%20GENERALES%20david%20morales%20final.pdf


                                              13
Even considering all of the resources also devoted to related work in the PFM I and II
projects – and assuming that no savings were realized from work prior to 2011 (a strong
assumption) – total costs (US$147.35 million) for all three projects would have been
more than covered by the savings generated through use of SIIF-Nación in 2011 and 2012
alone. In terms of implementation efficiency, at U.S. $33.85 million (including both
Bank and counterpart funds) project costs also appear to be in line with the average costs
of completed IFMIS projects in a database analyzed in Dener et al (2011) (including ICT
cost, advisory support, training and project management) – approximately U.S. $25
million. 19

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

48.     Rating: Satisfactory. The Project’s overall outcome is considered to be
Satisfactory (See Table 1 below). The Project made substantial progress towards its
development objective of solidifying and expanding the gains achieved under PFM II and
further improving the transparency, coverage, operation and interoperability of the
Borrower’s national public management information systems over the course of
implementation. The advances in SIIF-Nación, SUIFP and MUISCA described above
have strengthened and expanded key elements of Colombia’s public management
information systems, enabling the full use of such information for strategic decision
making (with Government entities including the President using information from SIIF-
Nación) and the implementation of interoperability capacities and data integration pilots
between key systems.

49.     The operation’s objectives remain highly relevant for both the Government and
the Bank, and given the substantial relevance of design and implementation, overall
relevance is considered substantial. Estimated annual savings from implementation of
SIIF-Nación exceed the costs of the entire Project, and if realized over only two years,
would more than cover the costs of this Project plus PFMI and II, leading to an overall
assessment of substantial Project efficiency. In the context of declining commodity
prices (and their subsequent impact on fiscal space), the increased efficiency of public
expenditure enabled by Project advances and the fiscal savings generated will become
even more important in the future.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
50.     As a project focused on consolidating key public information management
systems at the national level in Colombia, this Project was not necessarily designed to
have a direct impact on poverty, gender, or social development issues. Nevertheless, the
more effective and efficient management of public resources that it was expected to
generate would likely create additional fiscal space to address national priorities such as
these, as well as provide tools to monitor the effective direction of resources towards
such.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

51.     The Project’s successful work on strengthening national public information
systems in order to increase the availability, accessibility and quality of public
information has had a significant impact on institutional strengthening, enhancing
transparency, facilitating public access to information, and increasing accountability. In
particular, work on the SUG has helped to support the creation of a culture of internal
audit and introspection within the MHCP - something of even greater importance now
given the temporary pause in external recertification efforts of quality control
mechanisms. Systems such as SIIF-Nación, SUIFP, and the Economic Transparency
Portal have also significantly contributed to institutional strengthening in Colombia by
making increasingly more information about Government operations available to the
public, and future efforts point towards ensuring that – in addition to be available –
information is delivered in such a way that it is meaningful to a broad range of citizens.

52.     Additionally, some of the challenges encountered during implementation –
particularly those related to Component 4.2 – led to a process of introspection that has
ultimately contributed to the MHCP’s institutional strengthening. The lessons learned in
relation to activity planning, and the need to prioritize and clearly coordinate different
entities needs in order to arrive at a viable output appear to have been well internalized
within the implementing team, and are likely to contribute to more effective planning and
execution in the future.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
53.     Progress on the STA is considered to be a positive unintended impact of the
Project. As discussed above in Section 2, the successful implementation of SIIF-Nación
combined with the passing of legislation in 2011 provided the opportunity for the Project
to support the development of the STA’s conceptual model – an important agenda for the


                                               15
Government. These advances were then leveraged to initiate the related necessary
adjustments to the SIIF, and launch the payments module.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
54.     A survey measuring perceptions of the quality of services provided through SIIF-
Nación was carried out in January 2015. The online survey, which was targeted at users
registered in training activities between April and December 2014 (3,590 users), received
859 complete responses. The survey found that 92 percent of users reported that the
administration of SIIF-Nación did a good or better job of meeting their expectations.
94.6 percent found the software services to be good or better; 88.8 percent that the help
desk provided good or better services; 90.8 percent that training was good or better; and
92 percent that information on the web page was good or better.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

55.      Overall, risks to the development outcome are considered to be moderate. Given
that many of the Project-funded activities were completed by 2012, and that the
Government has continued related and complementary work since through other sources
of funding, the continuing relevance and importance of such work is clear. Systems such
as SIIF-Nación and SUIFP exhibit stable performance and appear to have been well-
institutionalized, suggesting that risks associated with the systems are low. DIAN is
committed to continuing work to move towards an integrated customs process (albeit
within a new system) – work that is well-aligned with the overall development objective
of the operation, if not the specific objective of Component 3 – and there have been
initial discussions with the Bank regarding its provision of strategic support through a
counterpart funded activity.

56.      However, some risks to the development outcome remain. As previously noted,
re-certification of the SUG is currently on hold until the completion of MHCP’s
restructuring process. While this does not mean that oversight of the management system
is not being exercised - the practice of engaging in internal audits has been successfully
institutionalized and a supportive culture created - the resumption of external
recertification will be important for ensuring the maintenance of external control
mechanisms. Interoperability capacities were developed and piloted between SIIF and
other key national systems (e.g. SUIFP, SILOG, etc), achieving the objective of
developing the tools to enable such. However, given individual system’s continuing
evolution and the nature of interoperability efforts in general, how to move forward in the
further institutionalization of these capacities will be an important agenda for the next
phase of work.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

57.     The Bank team brought substantial, context specific knowledge to Project design,
building upon lessons learned from the PFM I and II operations. Project design
represented the key pending areas of work necessary for the consolidation of national
public information systems, and demonstrated a strong understanding of the potential
risks and necessary mitigating measures, particularly in regards to Component 1.

58.     However, there were some challenges which were not anticipated at design –
particularly related to Component 3 in terms of the definition of indicators, slower than
expected approval of the Customs Statute, and the Government’s decision to explore
development of a new module outside of MUISCA –as well as Component 4.2 - which
could have been perhaps lessened or prevented through greater consideration of risks at
the time of design.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

59.     Over Project implementation, the Bank team was very responsive, providing the
hands-on and proactive support which helped to ensure the success of Project activities
and the Project’s continuing relevance during a period of political transition. This
support was particularly critical for the successful launching of SIIF-Nación, and
following its launch, the team played a critical role in advancing dialogue on the
implementation of a STA. The task team benefited from strong consistency over the
years, with a stable composition of members that were involved in both the preceding
project’s implementation as well as throughout the entirety of the current Project. When
challenges presented themselves, the Bank team demonstrated flexibility and worked
with the Borrower to find solutions that fit the revised context, ensured continuing
relevance to the Government, and maximized progress towards the development
objective (e.g. clarification/modification of indicators, adjustments to Subcomponent 4.2,
etc.).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

60.     Given the overall high relevance of project design as well as the flexible and
proactive support provided during supervision but in light of the fact that design could
have better anticipated some Project risks which materialized during implementation,
overall Bank performance is considered to be moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory


                                            17
61.      Strong Government support for the overarching initiatives supported through the
Project was essential to the high achievement of Project Objectives. Given the inter-
institutional nature of the Project, this support was particularly critical. Changes in
administration did lead to some delays in implementation (particularly impacting
Component 4.2), as well as pauses in some initiatives (e.g. the pending recertification of
the SUG System), but in the end, solutions to these issues were found and there appears
to be clear commitment to continuing the lines of work pursued under the Project. While
interoperability functions were developed through the Project, it seems that the umbrella
of additional Government support could have helped to achieve even further
advancements in the interoperability agenda under the Project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

62.      The three implementing agencies’ (MHCP, DIAN, and DNP) approach to project
implementation ensured the overall successful implementation of the Project in spite of
unanticipated challenges that were encountered. The three worked proactively to adjust
project activities to shifts in priorities and institutional structures, finding forms that were
both aligned with the achievement of Project objectives and institutional realities.
Demonstrating a clear understanding of the cultural shifts often required to
institutionalize the systems strengthened through the Project, their emphasis on training
and communication played a critical role in consolidation efforts.

63.    Some fiduciary challenges were encountered during implementation, with
moderate shortcomings in financial management and areas for improvement in the area of
procurement being noted by the Bank. The implementation of Subcomponent 4.2 also
experienced difficulties due to the original breadth of the activity’s scope and shifts in the
implementation strategy.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64.    The Government’s and implementing agencies’ overall demonstrated strong
performance, ensuring the successful implementation of Project activities. Given the
implementation challenges encountered, overall Borrower performance is considered to
be moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

65.      Continuity in operational teams can have a substantial impact on Projects’
success in achieving development outcomes. Team composition was quite stable (both
on the Bank and the Borrower’s side), with a number of team members having also been
involved in PFMII. This continuity allowed for implementation to hit the ground running
following effectiveness, and helped to support the successful progress forward on
activities even when challenges were encountered.



                                              18
66.      Similarly, strong coordination between the three agencies (MHCP, DNP, and
DIAN), as well as with the Bank, played an important role in smoothing project
implementation. Having worked together in the implementation of PFM II, the Project’s
institutional arrangements and coordination mechanisms were well-established at
launching, helping to avoid challenges that are often observed in these types of projects
and ensuring progress towards the development objective. Close and constant contact
between the counterpart and Bank team facilitated the provision of high quality technical
support and proactive adjustments to the implementation context.

67.     Creating and maintaining interoperability – the ability of information
systems to have harmonized concepts and data, and automatically exchange
information - is a process that requires continual reassessment, evolution, and a
phased approach. Efforts undertaken within this Project to connect the national
government’s various public information systems represent an important first step
towards interoperability in Colombia, with significant advances having been made. It will
be important to continue to work on the next phase of this agenda in the future and
further strengthen its institutionalization through the creation of national standards.

68.    Thorough and complete risk assessments - and the ability to adjust quickly
when challenges arise - can play a critical role in ensuring the successful
implementation of complicated activities. While there were a number of challenges
that needed to be overcome in order to successfully complete implementation of SIIF-
Nación, their clear identification at design allowed for the proactive rollout of actions
designed to mitigate these risks and ensured the system’s launch in 2011.

69.     When designing a component or subcomponent that is highly concentrated in
IT investment, it is important to either engage in a deep analysis of the desired
functionalities during the preparation phase in order to ensure a clear
understanding of the scope of the system, or to build in some flexibility in the
allocation of Project funds in the event of greater than expected costs. In the case of
Subcomponent 4.2, the lack of initial clarity in the system’s scope contributed to delays
in implementation, and the eventual need to redesign the planned activities.

70.    Loans do not have to be big to have a big impact. While relatively small in
size compared to other World Bank loans to middle income countries, this Project had a
large impact thanks to its high relevance to the Government, strong implementation
arrangements, and the application of the Bank’s past lessons learned from
implementation of integrated financial management systems.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
71.     As a part of the last Interim Financial Report (IFR), the Borrower prepared a
substantial closing report presenting each component’s outputs, main achievements,
lessons learned, as well as a description of the implementation process, which served as
an important input to this ICR. No comments on the ICR were received prior to its
finalization.

  • Interoperability through web services
         o SUIFP (DNP). In 2012, a web service was put into production for the
             process associated with Modification Letters for the budget planning
             process.
         o MUISCA (DIAN). DIAN has finished the definition of the requirements
             for interoperability to generate withholding vouchers, to be carried out
             once the updating of MUISCA to the current regulations is finished.
         o Interoperability with the Surcharge System. In the last trimester of 2012,
             the functional area of the Directorate for Fiscal Support took the decision
             to modernize the application for the administration of the gasoline and
             combustible oil for motors surcharge. As such, the work plan for
             interoperability of SIIF-Nación with the new application is linked to the
             timeline of implementation of the new system.
         o Interoperability with SECOP system (Electronic public procurement
             system). In 2012, the coordination process with the National Contracting
             Agency was started to define a catalogue of goods and services to be used
             to acquire and administer goods. In the area of interoperability, there are
             no requirements defined by the agency.
         o Interoperability with the SMGI system. The development of the web
             service was completed by the provider, which was necessary for the
             consultation of the defined indicators. During the first half of 2013, it was
             put into operation in a testing environment in MHCP.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
        As noted in the main text, in 2011, the MHCP carried out initial calculations to
estimate the value of annual savings resulting from the implementation of SIIF-Nación.
Four areas of savings were identified, summing to a total of approximately U.S. $105.75
million (COP $205 billion): 1) other public entities no longer needed to develop, acquire,
and maintain their own financial management systems (savings of COP $40 billion,
U.S$ 20.63 million); 2) no longer utilizing paper checks (COP$10 billion, U.S. $5.16
million dollars); 3) direct wage transfers to the final beneficiaries in medium and small
entities (COP $21 billion, U.S.$10.83 million); and 4) direct transfers of central
government resources to the entities executing investment projects (COP $134 billion,
U.S. $69.12 million).

        Annual savings from the first were calculated by determining the entities that had
previously used their own financial management systems, but had transitioned to using
SIIF-Nación and no longer needed to develop or maintain their own systems. The 2011
budget was then examined to determine the value of the budget allocated to investment
projects in all types of software (approximately COP $100 billion), and several entities
asked the percentage of their software spending which had previously been destined to
financial management systems.         Based on their response that they had used
approximately 40 percent of these funds for their financial management systems, it was
estimated that the same ratio was assumed to apply to the total COP $100 billion
allocated to software investment across the Government). 24

        Annual savings from the second source originated from payments made by
entities which had joined SIIF, and were no longer making payments via physical checks,
with MHCP estimating that approximately 4 million physical checks had been issued
each year, at a cost of 2,500 Colombian pesos each.

      Annual savings from the third and the fourth sources reflect estimates of savings
from no longer making wage and investment transfers to beneficiaries through
commercial banks (which required reciprocity of approximately five days), but instead
making the transfer directly.

        These savings suggest that project efficiency was substantial. With Project costs
(both Bank and Borrower resources) of U.S. $33.85 million, estimated annual savings in
each year since 2011 have exceeded total project costs by a factor of more than three.
Even considering all of the resources also devoted to related work in the PFM I and II
projects – and assuming that no savings were realized from work prior to 2011 (a strong
assumption) - total costs (U.S. $147.35 million) for all three projects would have been
more than covered by the savings generated through use of SIIF-Nación in 2011 and
2012 alone. In terms of implementation efficiency, at U.S. $33.85 million (including
both Bank and counterpart funds) project costs also appear to be in line with the average


24
   As the budget lines considered from the 2011 budget only included investment projects (i.e. they did not
include maintenance costs), this estimate is believed to represent a sub-estimation of savings of this nature.
