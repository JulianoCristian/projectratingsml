Consolidation of\n            National Public Management Information Systems Project for\n            Colombia is to improve the transparency, coverage, operation\n            and interoperability of key national financial management\n            information systems that will allow Government decision\n            makers to link performance measures with planning, budgeting\n            and other managerial actions. There is a change to two\n            outcome indicators. For project development objective, or\n            PDO level outcome indicator five, it is proposed to change\n            the baseline and thus yearly targets for measuring tax\n            administration efficiency. The baseline value was changed\n            from the estimated (September 2009 value) to the real end of\n            year 2009 value, while preserving the target for percentage\n            of increase in efficiency. The second change is to drop the\n            PDO level outcome indicator six proposing the establishment\n            and staffing of the center for fiscal and financial Studies\n            and replacing it with a new indicator measuring the number\n            of comprehensive studies in different sectors while keeping\n            with the objective of increasing the capacity of the\n            responsible unit for carrying out macroeconomic and fiscal forecasting."}, "docdt": "2013-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
