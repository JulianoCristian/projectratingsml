Re: REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA: Loan 7831-CO
Consolidation of National Public Management Information Systems Project
Third Amendment to the Loan Agreement
His Excellency,
We refer to the Loan Agreement between the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (the "Bank") and the Republic of Colombia (the "Borrower") dated December 29,
2009 as amended, with respect to the above-captioned Project (the "Loan Agreement"). Please
note that capitalized terms used in this letter (the "Amendment Letter") and not defined herein
have the meaning ascribed to them in the Loan Agreement.
We also refer to the letter No. SC-2-2013-044010 dated November 19, 2013 from the
Borrower's representative and our recent discussions on the need to amend the Loan Agreement
so as to: (a) redefine selected activities of the subcomponent 4.2 of Schedule 1, Part D.2 to the
Loan Agreement; (b) reflect partial cancellation of the Loan proceeds under Component 3, and
(c) extend the Loan Closing Date.
Consequently, the Loan Agreement is hereby amended as follows:
1.     Part D.2 of Schedule I to the Loan Agreement is hereby incorporated to read in its
entirety as follows:
"(c) Reviewing and adjusting the DGCPTN business model through a reengineering
process that includes: operational structure adjustments; definition of a
monitoring system; identification of a management strategy; and management
and evaluation activities of the Project subcomponent 4.2."
2.     Section IV.A.2 (table of Category of Eligible Expenditures) of Schedule 2 to the Loan
Agreement is amended to read in its entirety as set forth in the Annex to this Amendment
Letter.
3.     The Bank agrees to establish December 15, 2014 as the new Closing Date for the Project
and consequently Section IV B. 3 of Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement is hereby
amended to read as follows:


﻿2
"3. The Closing Date is December 15, 2014."
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendments by signing, dating and
returning to us the enclosed copy of this amendment letter. This Amendment Letter will be
executed in two counterparts, each of which shall be an original. This Amendment Letter shall
become effective as of the date of countersignature, upon receipt by the Bank of a countersigned
copy of this Amendment Letter.
Please also note that the restructuring paper dated December 13, 2013 (a copy of which is
attached herewith) will be disclosed on the World Bank's external website.
