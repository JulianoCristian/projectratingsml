      Project for Kazakhstan of were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the first and perhaps main lesson incorporated in\n            this project was the importance of linking the objectives of\n            environmental protection and sound land use and management\n            with tangible benefits for rural families. The project\n            placed emphasis on managing lands for improved natural\n            resource management and conservation which also helped to\n            return once abandoned lands to productive use, while at the\n            same time generating improved incomes for local stakeholders\n            and users of the land. Though this concept of improving the\n            environment by mitigating the threat of desertification and\n            simultaneously improving the lives of local population is\n            not new, cases of actual implementation were infrequent.\n            Another feature worth highlighting is the multiple focus\n            strategic approach which encompassed rural landholders,\n            local and central authorities, businesses, and research\n            institutions, which working together set up the basis for\n            developing the links between land management and\n            income-generation. Additional lessons incorporated into the\n            design of the project were: (a) the importance of training\n            for project related activities such as procurement,\n            disbursement, supervision, and financial management; and (b)\n            the need to inform, disseminate and communicate relevant\n            information to all stakeholders."}, "docdt": "2010-11-02T00:00:00Z"}
