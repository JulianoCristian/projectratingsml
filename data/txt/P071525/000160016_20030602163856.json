Project for Kazakhstan is to demonstrate\n            and promote sustainable land uses in the marginal dryland\n            ecosystem of a pilot area in the Shetsky rayon (a district\n            in the southern part of the Karaganda oblast - province).\n            The project is a pilot activity that will test the\n            environmental, social and economic viability of shifting\n            from the current unsustainable cereal-based production\n            system to the traditional livestock-based production system.\n            In support of this objective, there are four main project\n            components. The project--with active participation of local\n            communities--will assist the Government of Kazakhstan to:\n            (i) develop sustainable land use systems; (ii) provide\n            initial service support to producer groups; (iii) improve\n            national capacity to quantify carbon sequestration; and (iv)\n            undertake a broad public awareness campaign and develop a\n            strategy so that project interventions could be replicated\n            in similar areas of Kazakhstan and other Central Asian\n            countries. By promoting sustainable land use practices, the\n            project emphasizes an integrated ecosystem management\n            approach to achieving ecological, economic and social goals\n            that are expected to yield benefits at a local, regional and\n            global level."}, "docdt": "2003-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
