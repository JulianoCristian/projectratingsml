Drylands Management Project are to reverse land\n            degradation, improve biodiversity, protect rare or\n            endangered flora and fauna, increase the store of carbon in\n            biomass and the soils, and to maintain if not improve soil\n            quality. This environmental management plan outlines\n            expected negative environmental impacts and proposes the\n            mitigation measures. Among them are the following: To\n            increase biodiversity and carbon storage, and reduce\n            invasive weeds/pests, the project will formulate a binding\n            agreement with farmers and MNREP not to plough reclaimed\n            pastures, provide increased market opportunities for animal\n            products, reclaim watering points, and provide training in\n            land management. It will also undertake soil monitoring of\n            selected areas to establish the effect of better farming\n            systems on soil quality and conduct farmer training to avoid\n            decreased soil quality. Other impacts include increasing\n            carbon sequestration and biodiversity by reclaiming ploughed\n            areas with local grasses and legumes-ensuring that species\n            choice is appropriate for land and climate, improving\n            management of all rangelands, and installing systems to\n            measure and monitor carbon accumulation. To avoid waste\n            collection, storage, and disposal problems from increasing\n            numbers of livestock (cattle)that may lead to waste seepage\n            into groundwater and well water supply, demonstrate proper\n            housing facilities for cattle that include waste management\n            and the use of organic fertilizers on pastures/kitchen\n            gardens, etc., take measures to prevent methane venting, and\n            study the economics of waste use."}, "docdt": "2003-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
