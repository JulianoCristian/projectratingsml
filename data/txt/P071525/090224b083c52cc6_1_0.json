Many people living in\n            Kazakh drylands struggled to sustain their livelihoods as\n            growing crops and grazing cattle in the difficult\n            environment was a major challenge. Drylands Management\n            Project tested the viability on people, the economy and the\n            environment of shifting from growing cereals to raising\n            livestock. Over thirty five thousand hectares of land were\n            restored and perennial fodder crops were grown. Farmers\u2019\n            incomes increased because they were able to graze more\n            livestock, in the fertile lands. The project helped farmers\n            to raise cattle and sell milk. The long lasting effect of\n            the project was creating the enthusiasm of government and\n            farmers in improving the livestock production and overall\n            livelihoods of rural population in the drylands territories\n            of Kazakhstan."}, "docdt": "2011-06-29T06:18:04Z"}
