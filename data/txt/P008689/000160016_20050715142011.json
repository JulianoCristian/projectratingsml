There are four lessons: 1)  Biodiversity\n            conservation cannot be carried out in isolation. It has to\n            be integrated within the economic interests of local and\n            regional communities. Resentment is created when financing\n            of nature conservation appears to have preference over unmet\n            local needs, be it employment or delivery of basic services.\n            Failure to integrate local interests in the conservation and\n            management strategy of a biosphere reserve can endanger its\n            longer-term sustainability. 2) Conservation areas will be\n            sustainable only if there is good management and sufficient\n            funding. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) project\n            designers must help establish sound management and\n            governance arrangements that include local stakeholders and\n            promote income-generating activities. 3)  When establishing\n            biodiversity reserves, facilitate networking of the reserve\n            staff with the national and international nongovernmental\n            organizations and promote recognition by international\n            conventions.  4) The GEF should move towards a\n            country-focused strategic approach to complement its\n            thematically-driven development framework. By doing so GEF\n            would develop synergy from a more coherent policy framework,\n            thus improving effectiveness and reducing transaction costs."}, "docdt": "2005-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
