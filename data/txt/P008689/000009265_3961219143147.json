project\n            aims to protect the Romanian Delta ecosystems. It will\n            contribute to the conservation of biodiversity within the\n            Delta, strengthening the capacity of the Danube Delta\n            Biosphere Reserve Administration (DDBRA) and the Danube\n            Delta Institute (DDI), a research institute whose primary\n            role is to conduct research on the delta ecosystems on\n            behalf of DDBRA. It will enable DDBRA and DDI to monitor and\n            manage protected areas effectively, working with local\n            community groups to ensure sustainable resource use, and\n            restoring some wetlands to their natural condition. An\n            innovative feature comprises testing various approaches to\n            wetland restoration and monitoring their impact. The project\n            includes the following components: (a) strengthening the\n            wardens department, to support natural protection, surveys,\n            public awareness and nature interpretation in the Delta,\n            through the provision of equipment to enhance mobility and\n            surveying, infrastructure and training; (b) monitoring,\n            through improved population and species inventories,\n            ecosystem surveys, and development of an integrated database\n            using Geographic Information System technology to provide\n            the basis for development of resource management plans; (c)\n            restoration of abandoned fish and agricultural polders to\n            their natural condition with impact and hydrological\n            monitoring, together with applied research into reed\n            restoration; (d) protection of a lake from direct inflow of\n            Danube water; willow planting; village woodlots; pilot\n            protection of fish fingerlings from an irrigation pumping\n            station intake; removal of some deteriorating metal\n            structures for aesthetic enhancement; sturgeon propagation\n            following studies; and establishment of a small grant fund\n            to fund research proposals with special focus on management\n            of buffer zones; (e) public awareness, including support to\n            the wardens to work with schools and local communities,\n            support to the DDBRA in production of public awareness\n            material, and support to local non government\n            organization's to enable them to expand their public\n            awareness activities; and (d) assistance with coordination\n            of activities between Ukraine and Romania, and limited\n            technical assistance for project management, especially for\n            procurement and disbursement."}, "docdt": "1994-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
