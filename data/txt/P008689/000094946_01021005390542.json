        sustainability is likely, and institutional development\n            impacts are high. Several lessons are drawn from the\n            project. The level of responsibility granted to staff of\n            participating institutions, was conducive in turn to the\n            delegation of authority demonstrated in project management\n            during implementation. Both aspects proved instrumental no\n            only in securing project success, but in building ownership,\n            and capacity. The relatively low cost of preparation, and\n            the absence of processing requirements at the time, were\n            offset by the support of quality supervision, enhanced by\n            staff continuity, consistently including a mix of relevant\n            Bank technical, and administrative expertise, who\n            contributed to improved relations with the country. However,\n            public resistance, and negative support to the project,\n            could have been minimized, had a public communications\n            strategy been professionally designed, early on in the\n            project cycle, to build the necessary support among key\n            stakeholders. Likewise, an early participatory approach\n            should have been pursued to undertake a socioeconomic\n            assessment of reserve resources, and thus develop community\n            based strategies, to strengthen sustainable means for\n            resource conservation. Most importantly, performance\n            indicators should be available, to form the baseline for\n            assessments of ecosystems, socioeconomic aspects, and\n            factors affecting the use of natural resources."}, "docdt": "2000-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
