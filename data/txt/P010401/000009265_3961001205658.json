objectives are to: (a)\n            accelerate the development of indigenous hydrocarbons,\n            utilizing private sector resources to the maximum extent\n            possible; (b) ensure that such indigenously developed\n            hydrocarbons reach the end consumers in an efficient manner;\n            (c) enhance the commercial orientation and operational\n            autonomy of the public sector entities in the subsector to\n            pave the way for a larger private sector role; and (d)\n            strengthen the regulatory and policy making functions of\n            governmental agencies in the subsector to facilitate larger\n            private investments.  The project will include the following\n            components: (1) development of oil and gas fields under\n            joint venture with the private sector; (2) construction of\n            gas pipelines and installation of compressors, and a\n            Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System; (3)\n            measures to mitigate the environmental impact of (1) and (2)\n            above; (4) corporate restructuring of the Oil & Gas\n            Development Corporation; (5) institutional strengthening of\n            the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources including\n            measures to implement the Government's new petroleum\n            policy; and (6) technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1992-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
