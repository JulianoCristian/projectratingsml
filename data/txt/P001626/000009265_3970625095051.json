planning\n            capability; (ii) strengthening the national extension system\n            through development of more effective mechanisms for program\n            priority setting, resource

Division (PD) staff. Main\n            features of the project include: (i) strengthening\n            MOA's Planning Division through technical assistance,\n            training and logistical support and (ii) strengthening the\n            Department of Agriculture's capacity to plan, implement\n            and monitor the agricultural extension program.
