planning\n            capability; (ii) strengthening the national extension system\n            through development of more effective mechanisms for program\n            priority setting, resource

Division (PD) staff. Main\n            features of the project include: (i) strengthening\n            MOA's Planning Division through technical assistance,\n            training and logistical support and (ii) strengthening the\n            Department of Agriculture's capacity to plan, implement\n            and monitor the agricultural extension program. The project,\n            to be carried out over 5 years, provides funds for civil\n            works; vehicles, furniture and equipment; training;\n            technical assistance; and operating costs."}, "docdt": "1985-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
