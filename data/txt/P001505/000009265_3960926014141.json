Adjustment\n            Operation Project in Madagascar was implemented. On the\n            whole, the performance of the agricultural sector in\n            Madagascar has shown some progress but remains nonetheless\n            disappointing. The Bank has been flexible and has shown a\n            capacity to adopt a pragmatic and realistic solution to help\n            Madagascar move gradually towards a more liberal system of\n            economic management. The Borrower showed a commitment to\n            sector policy reform and economic adjustment. In order to\n            sustain and expand agricultural growth, improvements will be\n            needed simultaneously on several of these fronts.\n            Appropriate and consistently followed macro-economic\n            policies (exchange rate management, tariff and trade\n            policies, fiscal regime, etc.) will also be essential for\n            preserving and building upon the gains which have been made\n            under the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (ASAC) and\n            other adjustment operations. Political stability and\n            consensus is an obvious pre-requisite for achieving this,\n            together with well conceived and coherent support from\n            external aid agencies. This project was designed as a\n            complement to the ASAC, in order to provide investment funds\n            needed to help entrepreneurs respond to Government's\n            policy and to create economic opportunities in the\n            agriculture sector."}, "docdt": "1993-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
