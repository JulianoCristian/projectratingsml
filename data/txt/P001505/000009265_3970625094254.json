Agricultural\n            Sector Adjustment Credit are to: (i) support the 1986-87\n            phase of the Government's program to increase\n            production and incomes by making it's agricultural\n            economy more market-oriented; (ii) to help prepare the next\n            phase of the reform program (1988-90) and (iii) to provide\n            foreign exchange for imports needed to realize fully\n            benefits associated with the reform program. The price and\n            market reform will benefit primarily the farming population,\n            whose terms of trade have deteriorated sharply over the last\n            decade. Increased production, particularly rice, over the\n            next years will benefit urban dwellers. Finally, import\n            substitution and higher exports will improve the balance of payments."}, "docdt": "1986-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
