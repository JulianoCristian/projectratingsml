"Within the strategic context, the\n            Agricultural Research and Extension Project will strongly\n            support the government's efforts for poverty reduction,\n            by improving agricultural technology systems, thus\n            increasing agricultural productivity, and farmer incomes,\n            and further expanding agricultural marketing, and processing\n            industries. The project components call for: a) the\n            development of program and policy coordination, to manage\n            technology systems, and coordinate public sector support for\n            agricultural research, and extension, in addition to\n            facilitating institutional reforms; b) the establishment of\n            an agricultural technology fund, to co-finance adaptive\n            research, and extension projects, based on competitive\n            bases, to be selected regionally. Farmers and\n            research/extension institutions, - private sector\n            participants, government technical institutions, or\n            non-governmental organizations - will co-finance projects to\n            be implemented at regional, and community levels; c) an\n            increased capacity building, for the development of\n            strategic programs, within national technology systems.\n            Training and information systems regarding institutional\n            analyses, and planning for selected programs of applied, and\n            strategic research, and extension, will be provided; and, d)\n            development grants, to finance additional projects on a\n            competitive basis, are envisaged."}, "docdt": "1999-10-25T00:00:00Z"}
