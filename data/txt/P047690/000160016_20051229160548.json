Among the\n            lessons cited were the following: 1) The APL because of its\n            long-term nature is useful to carry out sustained policy\n            dialogue, since many of the institutional reforms proposed\n            in a project such as this require a strong political\n            commitment on the part of Government, and the reform of\n            public sector institutions are difficult to achieve from\n            within. 2) A competitive grant system is feasible within the\n            Peru and has been advantageous from several viewpoints: It\n            is a useful stimulus to the development of a decentralized,\n            private-sector led agricultural innovation system and\n            provides a means for leveraging additional resources. The\n            emphasis on a detailed business plan is valuable in ensuring\n            a market orientation to proposals. A two-phase selection\n            process with initial review of project profiles followed by\n            detailed preparation of proposals for those selected is\n            effective, particularly in light of considerable technical\n            assistance required for the preparation of detailed project\n            proposals. 3) Because of the weakness of many institutions\n            in the sector, considerable preparatory work -information,\n            training is required which has associated costs both in\n            financial terms and with respect to the time required to\n            successfully launch the decentralized, private sector-led\n            agricultural technology innovation system. This requires a\n            larger allocation of resources than was first envisaged. 4)\n            A Management Information System (MIS) should be established\n            in the very early stages of the project, and attention needs\n            to be given to making available the knowledge gained from\n            the subprojects particularly with respect to enabling its\n            use in further development of the agricultural technology\n            innovation system. 5) While independence from the mainstream\n            Ministry of Agriculture enables a PIU to effectively manage\n            project operations it is likely to limit its input to\n            national strategy formulation."}, "docdt": "2005-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
