living conditions of 16,000 poor rural families\n            (about 83,000 persons) living in Ecuador's Tungurahua\n            province. The project components include: (i) credit and\n            other agricultural support services; (ii) the rehabilitation\n            and expansion of irrigation works; (iii) construction and\n            improvement of rural roads; (iv) rural electrification; and\n            (v) other social services, e.g., provision of potable water\n            and health services. The only special risk which this\n            project faces would be the occurrence of organizational and\n            management problems owing to Ecuador's little\n            experience, to date, with integrated rural development\n            projects of this type."}, "docdt": "1978-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
