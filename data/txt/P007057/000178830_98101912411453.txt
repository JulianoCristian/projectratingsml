1.  THE RURAL SECTOR
1.01      In the two decades up to the early 1970s, Ecuador's economy grew
about 5% per annum, arising mainly from expansion of agricultural export
crops: cacao, coffee, bananas and sugar. The domestic impact of this trade
expansion was limited, however, and large segments of the rural population
remained engaged in subsistence activities. Low productivity, low purchasing
power, limited internal markets, low saving rates and limited capacity to
import interacted to restrain the country's economic and social development.
1.02      The advent of petroleum as a major export in 1973 had a marked
impact on Ecuador's internal and external financial position and considerably
accelerated the rate of economic growth. In constant terms, GDP expanded by
18% in 1973, 14% in 1974, 5% in 1975 and 7% in 1976 and 1977, and the value of
exports and imports more than doubled. However, this growth was accompanied
by notable inflation: 23% in 1974, 15% in 1975, 11% in 1976 and 13% in 1977.
Contributing to inflation was the inability of the agricultural sector to
expand output to satisfy rising food demand from a growing population (increas-
ing 3.4% p.a.) and higher consumer incomes. Demand increases have been
highest for dairy products, wheat, feedgrains and edible oils.
1.03      Despite recent changes in the Ecuadorian economy, the agricultural
sector remains the major source of employment, with about 55% of the labor
force engaged in agriculture. Until 1972, the sector accounted for more
than 85% of total export earnings, although its share has dropped to about 30%
since the advent of petroleum exports. In 1976, it accounted for about 20% of
GDP, down from 27% in 1970.
1.04      Average per capita income of the rural population, which made up
about 58% of the 1977 total of 7.6 million persons, was estimated at US$300,
less than 40% of the national average.  Of the 1977 rural population of 4.4
million, 2.9 million were classified as "relatively poor" since their per
capita income was less than one-third the national average. The "absolutely
poor," i.e., those with annual per capita incomes of less than US$60 equivalent,
was estimated to number 1.5 million in 1977. While rural poverty is a nation-
wide problem, it is generally more serious in the Sierra and in the Oriente
than in the Costa.
1.05      Although the national adult literacy rate is relatively high at 69%,
social services are generally deficient. Schools are located in larger villages,
thus excluding in practice many children of the widely dispersed rural popula-
tion. Of the rural dwellings, 87% are not served by public water supplies,
88% have no electricity and 89% have no sewerage facilities.  Health services
in rural areas are generally poor, and the local hospitals are often poorly
equipped and understaffed. Infant mortality in rural areas has been estimated
at 79 per 1,000 births. Waterborne infections are widespread and lead to a high
incidence of illness and death in rural areas.
1.06      While the country is relatively well served by a main road system,
rural feeder roads are deficient. Numerous communities are not linked to



the road system, and, because of the lack of maintenance, many roads are
impassable during periods of prolonged rain. These conditions impede the
flow of goods into and out of main rural areas.
Agriculture
1.07      Resources and Land Use.  There are three natural resource regions:
Costa, Sierra and Oriente. The Costa, typically humid-tropical, specializes
in bananas and plantains, coffee, cacao, sugarcane, beef ranching, rice,
hard corn, yuca, cítrus, oilseeds (annual and perennial) and fibers. The
Sierra highland valleys produce temperate climate foodgrains, pulses,
potatoes, vegetables and deciduous fruits, and most of the dairy enterprises
are also located there. Sheep herds are maintained on native high-altitude
pastures.  The Oriente suffers from limited access, although the situation is
less seríous in the northeast where most of the oil fields are located. While
the Oriente as yet contributes relatively little to sectorial output, it is
known that limited zones (the extent is as yet undetermined) have considerable
potential for beef, rice, oilseeds, and yuca.
1.08      The wide range of altitudes and broken terrain, especially in the
Sierra, produce a wide variety of climatic conditions throughout the farming
areas. Soils vary from well-drained to swampy and water-logged, and from
young volcanic ash to deep well-developed soils of high agricultural potential.
Rainfall ín most of the country varies from 1,000 and 2,000 mm per annum but
is as low as 500 mm in parts of the Sierra (including the Tungurahua project
area) and 300 mm in the Santa Elena peninsula. In the northern part of the
Costa and in the piedmont section of the Oriente, rainfall may be over 3,000 mm
per annum.
1.09      With the exception of the Oriente, the arable land per rural person
in Ecuador is low.  This is particularly the case in the Sierra, where mini-
fundia represent 54% of the farms, with less than 2 ha each, equivalent to
0.34 ha per capíta 1/. The situation is better in the Costa (0.51 ha per
capíta) although here, as well as in the Sierra, continued rural population
growth will weigh heavily on land resource availability.
1,10      Land Distribution.  According to the 1974 Agricultural Census, 54%
of the 519,000 farms, occupying 2.2% of the land in farms, were less than 2
ha in size. Seventy-six percent of these minifundia were located in the
Sierra. At the other extreme, 2.2% of the farms are over 100 ha and occupy
48% of the land in farms.  However, owing to the limited arable land (except
for the Oriente), reduction of the extent of skewness in land distribution
would have little effect on elimination of minifundia, especially in the
Sierra.
1.11      The enactment of the Land Reform, Idle Lands and Settlement Act
in míd-1964, revised in 1967 and 1973, provided a basis for making sound
1/   Agricultural Sector Memorandum.  LCPA4 February 1977.

changes in the prevailing land tenure pattern. The chief executing agency
is the Ecuadorian Land Reform and Settlement Institute (IERAC), which also
has responsibility for supervising "planned" and "spontaneous" colonization
schemes. However, the measures which have been introduced have been sporadic
and modest in scope and results have fallen short of expected targets. From
its inception until 1976, the program has had about 78,300 beneficiaries (about
10% of farm holdings), redistributing about 1.5 million ha. Almost 80% of the
total land transferred was a result of new land colonization schemes. Less
than 90,000 ha of privately owned lands have reverted to or been expropriated
by the state, benefitting about 11,000 families. Security of title has been
established for some 50,000 former tenants and squatters, but, given the land
suitability, the holdings of the beneficiaries are, by and large, too small
to provide a family with adequate farm income.
Agricultural Services
1.12      Extension Services.  Crop extension services in the Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) were, until recently, organized along specific
crop lines, an approach, at odds with the diversity typical of farming in Ecuador.
According to a reorganization now being implemented in MAG, however, extension
services for specific crops such as cocoa, banana and oilseeds will continue to
be provided, but extension personnel will also focus on the farm as an integral
operation involving various cropping activities. Concurrently, MAG profes-
sional and technical staff are being sent to rural areas rather than station-
ing them mainly in provincial capitals (para 3.01). Integrated Technical
Assistance Programs (PIDAs) and Agencies for Agricultural Services (ASAs) are
new organizational forms now evolving, using the foregoing concept of. the farm
as an integral operation. ASAs will operate at the canton (county) level and
the PIDAs will concentrate on smaller geographical areas. The proposed
project would build upon and strengthen this promising Government initiative
in the project area.
1.13      Agricultural Credit.  Institutional credit to the agricultural
sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, from about US$66 million equiv-
alent in 1971 to US$500 million in 1977. During this period, credit for
livestock approximately quintupled lending for crops slightly more than
doubled. The channels of institutional credit to the sector are the Govern-
ment's National Development Bank (BNF), accounting for about 70%, and the
commercial banks. The Central-Bank of Ecuador (CB) operates a number of
Fondos Financieros for rediscounting loans made by the banking system for
agricultural activities (as well as in other sectors), mostly for short terms.
External loans channelled through the CB and BNF have been the major sources
of finance for medium- and long-term lending to the agricultural sector (the
Bank has made four loans to the Government for this purpose). As institu-
tional credit is available to only about 10% of the farms, many farmers
utilize a considerable but unquantified volume of non-institutional credit
available from suppliers or moneylenders. While considerably more expensive
than institutional credit and usually for relatively short periods, such
sources allow farmers to avoid mortgaging land or having to submit to the
procedures generally adopted by banks for the granting of credit.

1.14      Agricultural Research.  Since its founding in 1959, the National
Agricultural Research Institute (INIAP) has evolved as an institution of
major importance in Ecuador and has attracted the support of the Rockefeller
Foundation and bilateral and international aid agencies. Bank group credits
and loans for crop and livestock projects and the recent seeds loan
(para 1.16) have supported its activity, as has a loan of US$11 million
recently approved by the Interamerican Development Bank. In 1977, INIAP's
professional staff, totalling some 300, was engaged in plant breeding, agronomic
and plant protection research, pastures and livestock nutrition, and farm manage-
ment. Also, 14 years of research have provided a reasonably good technical basis
for providing practical advice on increasing agricultural productivity. Over
this period, INIAP has developed and tested improved varieties of most of the
major crops in Ecuador, although research should be intensified to produce im-
proved varieties of soft corn, beans, rice, soybeans and pasture and expanded
to include agricultural machinery, water management at farm level, and crops
such as grain sorghum, pulses, fruits, vegetables and poultry. It appears
that the Institute is íncreasingly concentrating on developing lower cost
technology packages more appropriate to the conditions under which low-income
farmers operate in Ecuador and on strengthening the mechanism for transmitting
research results to farmers via the extension service.
Government Obiectives and Bank Assistance
1.15      The Government's developmental objectives in the agriculture
sector, as outlined in the National Development Plan for 1973-77, are to
increase agricultural production and improve economic and social conditions
in rural areas. To pursue these broad objectives, efforts have been made
to improve the investment capacity of the public sector by setting up a
National Pre-investment Fund (FONAPRE) and a National Development Fund
(FONADE). However, progress in planning and project preparation has been
slow, despite recent attempts, supported by two Bank loans for technical
assistance (1230-EC for US$4 million and S-006-EC for US$11 million, to
define a rural development strategy and to prepare rural development
projects. Loan 1230-EC in fact assisted in financing preparation of the
proposed project. In addition, the Fourth Highway Loan (1231-EC) includes
a technical assistance component for the preparation of a rural development
project (Puerto Ila-Chone) in the Costa.
1.16      Past Bank loans for agriculture are as follows:  Livestock I,
Loan 501-EC for US$3.7 million, approved May 18, 1967; Fisheries, Loan
555-EC for US$5.3 million of September 5, 1968; Livestock II, Credit
173-EC for US$1.5 million, approved September 4, 1969; Livestock III, Credit
222-EC for US$10 million, approved on November 24, 1970; Milagro Irrigation,
Credit 425-EC for US$5.5 million signed on May 17, 1973; Seeds, Loan 1229-EC
for US$3.0 million and Technical Assistance Loan 1230-EC for US$4 million,
both of them signed on May 24, 1976; Agricultural Credit, Loan 1459-EC and
a Technical Assistance Loan S-006-EC, both of which were signed on November
3, 1977.

1.17      A project Performance Audit Report issued on October 21, 1975 for
the first two credit operations indicates that they achieved their main
objectives: to improve productivity in participating ranches and increase
national beef production. The third agricultural credit loan has now been
fully disbursed and is also generally considered well executed. The forth
agricultural credit project has a broader thrust than its predecessors as
it also aims to spur the development of crop farms and small agro-industries.
This loan became effective on June 14, 1978 and disbursements are expected
to begin in mid-FY79. The infrastructure component of the Milagro Irrigation
project, has progressed well with disbursements on schedule, but the project's
on-farm development component is lagging. The seeds loan and the technical
assistance loan have made some progress but they both have been hampered by
weaknesses of the executing agencies.

II. THE PROJECT AREA
Location, Climate and Soils
2.01      The project would be located in the province of Tungurahua in the
center of the Ecuadorian high Andes about 140 km south of Quito. The province
covers 320,000 ha at altitudes ranging from 2,400 m to over 6,000 m, and it
has a population of 270,000, two-thirds of whom live in rural areas. The
project area of 30,000 ha lies just south of the provincial capital of Ambato
(population, 100,000).
2.02      The province, like the other mountainous provinces of Ecuador, has a
climate with only minor seasonal changes. The average monthly temperatures at
an altitude of 2,400 m vary between 12.4 and 15.0 0C.  Temperatures are lower
at higher altitudes and smilarly show little variation between seasons. Raín-
fall is unevenly distributed, depending mainly on altitude and air currents.
Precipitation is low at the valley floors and on hillsides protected from
southeasterly currents (500 mm average per annum), while high figures (over
1,000 mm average per annum) have been recorded on slopes exposed to most south-
eastern winds; about one year in five has about 25% less precipitation. Monthly
rainfall distribution is relatively even, with no absolutely dry months. The
lowest precipitation, about 25 mm per month, generally occurs from July to
September and for December/January. Climatic data are presented in Annex 1,
Table 1.
2.03      Characteristies of the inter-Andean valleys are steep slopes, deeply
eroded side valleys, and fertile but narrow main valleys. Snowcapped vol-
canos reach to altitudes of over 6,000 m and some are active. Minor earth-
quakes occur frequently. The most serious in recent history destroyed parts
of the city of Ambato in 1949.
2.04      Soils in the project area, mostly of volcanic origin at the lower
altitudes, are generally fertile, with good internal drainage. At higher
altitudes (above 3,000 m), there are deep organic soíls of light texture,
which are fertile despite a deficiency of phosphorus and poor internal drainage.
Under INERHI, a preliminary soil survey of the "Paramo" area (above 3,000 m)
has been carried out and it shows that about half would be suitable for crops
and the other half for permanent vegetation: improved pastures and forestry.
Population and Employment
2.05      Population in the project area was about 83,000 in 1977.  About
60,000 lived in the irrigated area of Huachi-Pelileo and Quero-Ladrillos-
Huambalo and about 23,000 in the rainfed agriculture areas of Quero and
Chibuleos (see Map). The population growth rate in the area is estimated
at about 3.1% per annum, slightly lower than the country's average of 3.3%,
and population density is 277 per square km. About 48% of the population
is under 15 years of age.
2.06      Rural unemployment near major urban centers appears to have decreased
in recent years because of the current construction boom but there is high
underemployment of a seasonal nature in the minufundio area that could be



- 7 -
reduced by diversification programs and intensified production in agriculture.
About 22,500 people, or 1.5 persons per family, are economically active.
2.07      An important addition to family nutrition and income is being
made by some family members who own bee hives set up in alfalfa fields or
who use non-cropped areas for small installations in which they raise guinea
pigs, rabbits, poultry and pigs. Others work as employees of small agro-
industrial plants, such as those producing fluid milk, tomato paste and raw
textiles and processing of hides and skins. A third group trades agricultural
products, mainly vegetables (mostly onions and garlic) potatoes, cereals
and fresh fruits (apples, peaches, plums, pears and berries), and a fourth
group migrates seasonally to the Costa, to work on large farms and plantations.
Specific data are not available on income of small Sierra farmers from their
non-farm work. 1/
Land Tenure and Use
2.08      About 16,000 farm families (average of 5.2 persons) have holdings
within the estimated 30,000 ha area of the project. About 11,500 families
with an average holding of 1 ha are located in the 12,000-ha area suitable
for irrigation; about 3,500 families with an average holding of 2.9 ha are
located in the 10,000 ha rainfed agriculture area of Quero; 11 communities
occupy a total of about 5,000 ha of communal land; and 3,000 ha are occupied
by about 1,000 families in the Chibuleo area. About 50 farmers with more than
100 ha each in the Quero rainfed area would not be eligible to participate
under the proposed project, although they can get financing under the Bank's
ongoing agricultural credit project, Loan 1459-EC. The value of having clear
land titles is well understood in the region, but, owing to the extreme land
pressure and often slow judicial process, probably no more than 40% of the
owners hold such titles. Rowever, IERAC is working to correct the situation.
The distribution of holdings according to farm size is shown in Annex 1,
Table 2.
2.09      About 37% of the project area is cultivated; 39% is used for raising
livestock; and the rest is fallow, in forestry or unproductive. The areas
occupied by the principal crops and used for other purposes are as follow:
1/   Studies cited in the publication `Rural Enterprise and Non-Farm
Employment--A World Bank Paper", January 1978, page 23, indicate that,
for small farmers with 1 ha or less of land in North Thailand, Pakistan
and Zambia with about the same total income level as in the Tungurahua
region, the contribution to income of non-farm work is probably in
the range of 40 to 75%.

/1   See paragraph 2.12.
/2   The area surveyed was slightly larger than the project area.
2.10      The value of total production in 1976 was S/. 225 million, of which
76% was derived from agriculture and 24% from livestock. The main crop was
potatoes, which represented 30% of the value of total production, while
vegetables accounted for 28% and fruits, 16%. The volume and value of the
major crops are presented in Annex 1, Table 3.
Existing Infrastructure
2.11      Roads.  The project area is connected to Quito (140 km), Riobamba
(55 km) and Guayaquil (290 km) by the Pan American highway. A railway line
runs parallel to the road between Quito and Guayaquil. Tungurahua province
has a rather extensive road network but it is not adequately maintained, and
rural roads at higher altitudes, especially those to the paramo areas, 1/ are
almost impassable during periods of prolonged rain. The agricultural develop-
ment of the paramo, which depends on a well maintained road system, has thus
been seriously impeded.
2.12      Irrigation.  The existing irrigation systems in the project area
(Huachi-Pelileo and Quero-Ladrillos sectors) supply irrigation water to a
total net area of about 6,700 ha. Traditional water rights have been estab-
lished by water user directorates, which are also responsible for operation
and maintenance of the systems. Unlined canals, generally originating
from river and stream diversions, are deficient and supply water irregularly;
1/   Paramo is an ecological formation cold and wet and above 3,000 m in
altitude.



- 9 -
water losses in the distribution system have been reported by the Ecuadorian
Water Resources Institute (INERHI) as reaching about 60%. Based on the
estimated total present water availability of 2.7 m3/s, the losses in the
system reduce the water available at the field level to 1.08 m3/s, or 0.16
l/s/ha, while the water demand has been estimated at 0.4 l/s/ha. The dis-
charge of the main rivers on which the irrigation systems depend is presented
in Annex 1, Table 4. The Government is presently constructing an 11.6-km
tunnel, which, together with a diversion weir in the Ambato River and a major
distribution system (consisting of 36 km of main canals, including 11 syphons,
and a secondary distribution system consisting of canals and pipes), is  3
designed to serve the 7,800-ha Huachí Pelileo area with an additional 3 m /s.
2.13      Potable water supply.  Of the 13 villages that are parish.seats (the
lowest administrative level), only five have potable water supply systems and
only three of these provide house connections; the remaining systems offer
public standpipes only. The widely dispersed population takes its water from
unlined canals or springs.
2.14      Electrification.  Rural electrification is insufficient in the
province and in the project area. Only eight of the 13 parish seats in the
province have electrical connections and can supply electricity to only about
80% of the population of these villages.
Existing Services
2.15      Education.  About 30% of the population above 10 years of age is
illiterate. There are 109 primary schools within the project area, but most
of them are inadequate and located in the villages that are the seats of the
"canton" and parish administrations.  The nearest secondary schools are in
Ambato, adjacent to the project area. Thus, many children living outside the
villages do not attend school.
2.16      Health.  Health conditions are generally poor, with predominant
illnesses resulting from respiratory, skin and parasitic diseases. There are
hospitals in the city of Ambato and one 20-bed hospital in Pelileo. Health
posts, with a total of five beds, are located in 13 villages. These posts are
visited regularly by a medical doctor, a dentist, a nurse, a health inspector
and an auxiliary nurse. There is one medical doctor per 7,800 persons, one
dentist per 23,000, and one auxiliary nurse per 2,700.
2.17      Extension Service.  Extension work has focussed mainly on develop-
ment of paramo lands and has been well received by farmers. However, the
extension service for farmers in the project area as a whole is poor. An
experimental tree nursery has been established in Pillaro to select and supply
the most appropriate fruit tree varieties, but there are no extension services
in the irrigated areas.
2.18      Credit.  BNF is the main banking institution in the area.  In
December 1976, the total loan portfolio of the Ambato office amounted to
S/. 113.6 million, with agricultural credit representing about 61% of the
lending volume. However, only 10% of the farmers in the project area had



- 10 -
ever used agricultural credit from institutional sources and 85% of these
received only one-third of the total credit volume. In a national context,
the 2% of the rural population of Ecuador living in the project area received
only 0.3% of the total volume of agricultural credit.
2.19      Besides BNF, the Ecuadorian Center for Agricultural Services
(CESA), a non-profit organization established for agrarian reform actions
on church lands, operates in the project area, offering technical assistance
and short-term credit to farmers.
2.20      Marketing.  The small farmers have only limitéd marketable surpluses
and practically no storage facilities. About two-thirds of the output of the
project area is sold between April and July; during that period, prices are
considerably lower than during the rest of the year. The congestion of the
marketing period has been particularly critical in regard to potatoes, where
prices often fall to an extent that growers are forced to either abandon their
crop or use it as animal feed. The largest share is acquired by wholesalers
who transport the products to various urban centers.
2.21      The main marketing place is in Ambato, where about 70% of the pro-
duction is sold, while local markets in Quero, Pelileo and Cevallos account
for 25%. There is little effort made to maintain quality, although there is
a refrigerated storage center for fruits and vegetables at Cevallos and
limited storage facilities for grains, potatoes, garlic and onions in Ambato.

III. AGENCIES PARTICIPATING UNDER TRE PROJECT
Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG)
3.01      MAG comprises planning and administrative bureaus and five operating
bureaus--Crops, Livestock, Rural Development, Forestry and Marketing--and it
has 10 Zonal Offices, one of which is in Ambato. The Ministry's budget rose
by 9% in 1975 to SI. 690 million and in 1977 to S/. 1,375 million. In 1977,
the total budgeted staff was 1,896, of whom 1,255 were professional and
technical. There are also a number of autonomous agencies attached to MAG
dealing with land reform (IERAC), irrigation (INERHI), agricultural research
(INIAP), storage and marketing (the National Marketing Corporation - ENAC),
retail marketing, and several regional development agencies.
3.02      While most departments of MAG are involved in programs which
benefit poor farmers, the main responsibility for the preparation and imple-
mentation of rural development projects rests with the Directorate for
Farmers Organization and Training (Direccion de Organizacion y Capacitacion
Campesina). Staff of this directorate have been directly involved in the
preparation of the proposed as well as other rural development projects
under consideration for Bank financing.
Agricultural Credit Project Unit (ACPU)
3.03      ACPU, which was originally attached to the Central Bank (BC), has
been transferred to MAG. The Unit was created under Bank credit projects
(Credit 173-EC and 222-EC, Loans 501-EC and 1459-EC) and was charged with
the responsibility of their execution. The first two projects have been
analyzed 1/ and they were found to be well managed, having improved agri-
cultural productivity and output. The Director of the Unit, who is assisted
by two Regional Technical Directors and by an Agricultural Advisor and Financial
Advisor, approves or rejects development plans supporting requests for credit
and disbursement before the latter are forwarded to BC. He lays down the
technical guidelines and standards to be followed by the staff of the Unit
and by other organizations and consultants in the preparation of investment
proposals, the supervision of sub-borrowers, and the collection and analysis
of the results of subprojects. He is also responsible for supervising the
application of such guidelines by the participating banks.
3.04      A Technical Executive Committee, under the chairmanship of the under-
secretary of MAG, is responsible for the formulation of general agricultural
credit policies, for supervising the Unit, and for the appointment of the
Director of the Unit.

Lending Institutions
3.05      The largest agricultural credit institution is BNF, which has a
branch office in Ambato (para 2.18).  At end 1977, BNF reported net assets
of S/. 13,208 million (US$528.3 million), including a loan portfolio of
S/. 8,750 million (US$350 million) and an investment portfolio of S/. 1,223
million (US$48.9 million). BNF has a staff of over 2,000, 20% of whom work
at the head office in Quito. Credit technicians number 248, 122 of whom
have university training.
3.06      The other credit institution operating in the project area is CESA
(para 2.19). CESA was established in 1969 with the principal objectives of
supporting agrarian reform and of promoting the development of small-scale
farmer associations through the provision of short- and medium-term loans.
It is set up to provide supervised production and commercial credits.
3.07      The monetary authorities require that private banks maintain 20%
of their portfolio as loans to the agricultural sector (25% in the case
of foreign-owned private banks) or else that the bank hold 4% interest-bearing
national bonds. This requirement was composed because the legal maximum
interest rate for short-term lending in the sector is only 3%, making such
operations unattractive to private banks.
Ecuadorian Water Resources Institute (INERHI)
3.08      INERHI was created in 1966 as an autonomous agency attached to MAG.
It has a staff of 1,785, and is empowered by law to administer and supervise
all activities for irrigated agriculture and to enter into agreements with
other agencies which participate in project execution. Under the new Water
Law of 1972, INERHI has been given even broader powers for the development and
management of water resources, including the creation of irrigation districts.
INERHI's general policies are defined by its Board of Directors, chaired by
the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock and comprising one representative
each from The National Planning Board (JUNAPLA), IERAC and BNF, and an elected
representative of the agricultural sector. The head of INERHI and its legal
representative is the Executive Director, appointed by the Minister of Agricul-
ture and Livestock. INERHI has developed good capabilities to construct civil
works, leaving the management of agricultural development to the farmers or
other agencies. Based on the experience with the Milagro project, INERHI would
be well qualified to carry out the civil works of the irrigation component of
the proposed project.
Ecuadorian Land Reform and Settlement Institute (IERAC)
3.09      IERAC was established in 1964 as an autonomous agency attached to
MAG following passage of the Agrarian Reform Law of 1964, and has been
consistently short of funds and qualified staff. Facing the tremendous task
of land titling and redistributing agricultural lands, IERAC concentrated its
efforts in priority areas (e.g., Santo Domingo de los Colorados) where it made



- 13 -
progress. However, in other areas, IERAC was not even able to control spon-
taneous settlements on land it owned. The main objectives of the 1964 law were
to give farm workers titles to the land they cultivate, establish settlement
projects on public domain, subdivide and settle certain public estates, and
expropriate and redistribute underutilized private lands.
3.10      Until now, the land reform measures that have been introduced have
not been fully effective. Between 1964-69, the number of families benefitting
from the reform program was less than half the target figure of 82,000; like-
wise, total land distributed was only 42% of the projected figure. From
1970 to 1976, however, the pace of the land reform program increased somewhat,
with total land distributed rising almost 76% over that handled in the 1964-69
period. The problems of the land reform program can be attributed to: (a)
inadequate financial resources; (b) lack of support and cooperation among
other Government agencies; (c) rapid turnover of officials; and (d) absence
of efficient legal procedures and clear definitions.  For example, the precise
meaning of the term "insufficiently exploited", as applied to agricultural
land making it subject to expropriation, has not been officíally established.
Ecuadorian Institute for Sanitary Works (IEOS)
3.11      IEOS is a semi-autonomous agency under the Subsecretary of Environ-
mental Health and Sanitary Works of the Ministry of Health. It is charged
with planning; project preparation; financing and construction of health
facilities; and water supplies and sewage disposal systems in rural areas; and
supervision of the autonomous municipal entities (empresas) for water supply
and sewerage in the larger cities. IEOS also provides technical assistance
to the municipalities. In the past, the activities of IEOS were seriously
hampered by a lack of financial resources from central government contribu-
tions, but it now has an earmarked share of the oil royalties, which has
reduced its financial problems.
Ambato Electric Utility Corporation (EEA)
3.12      EEA owns the generating plants in and near the city of Ambato.  LEA
would be responsible for the execution of the electrification component of the
project since most rural electrification networks in the province of Tungurahua
depend on its generating plants. EEA is sufficiently experienced to carry out
the construction of rural electrification projects.
3.13      EEA would be assisted by the Ecuadorian Electrification Institute
(INECEL), an autonomous government agency responsible for planning, preparing,
financing and constructing electrical power generating facilities and distri-
bution networks. INECEL is a shareholder in the major municipal power utilities
such as EEA and is experienced in the construction of major generating plants.
Among power generating plants recently built is the Pisayambo hydroelectric
plant located some 60 km northwest of the project area.



- 14 -
Provincial Government Office of Tungurahua Province (CPT)
3.14      The Government of the province of Tungurahua is headed by a Governor
appointed by the Central Government. The responsibilities of the Provincial
Government include the construction, operation and maintenance of civil works
such as the rural roads that would be financed by the project. A small
technical office is in charge of the design, construction, operation and
maintenance of roads, generally carried out by force account.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Brief Description
4.01      The Government of Ecuador has requested a Bank loan of US$18.0 mil-
lion to help finance a rural development project in the province of Tungurahua,
a densely populated area of the Andean region. The feasibility study for the
proposed project was prepared by MAG, INERHI and international consultants,
the latter financed under Loan 1230-EC, and submitted to the Bank in October
1977. The project, the first integrated rural development effort of the Bank
in Ecuador, would aim at improving rural incomes, expanding agricultural
production, and promoting economic and social development and improving living
conditions of the rural poor. The number of direct beneficiaries is estimated
at 16,000 families.
4.02      The proposed project would include:
(a) rehabilitation and expansion of irrigation systems and
on-farm works, on 1,800 ha in the Quero-Ladrillos area
serving about 2,300 farm families;
(b) on-farm works on 7,800 ha of irrigated land in the
Huachi-Pelileo area serving about 9,700 farm families;
(c) support services to improve agricultural production on the
irrigated area and on 18,000 ha of rainfed lands in the
Quero and Chibuleo area serving about 4,000 farm families;
(d) construction and improvement of rural roads and rural
electrification networks;
(e) provision of social services comprising potable water,
latrines and health facilities, and community centers;
(f) consultant services to assist the project unit and to
carry out studies for follow-up projects.
4.03      The project would be carried out over a six-year period (1980-1985).
To implement it, a project executing unit would be established which would
report to MAG.
B. Detailed Features
Irrigation and On-Farm Works
4.04      Works in the Quero-Ladrillos area would consist of a diversion
structure, about 28 km of main and secondary canals, and six syphons to be



- 16 -
supplied with water from the Mocha-Pachanlica River. This system would
deliver water to "modulos", each with about 70 ha net (111 ha-gross).
4.05      On-farm works within the "modulos" in both the Quero-Ladrillos
and Huachi-Pelileo area would consist of irrigation ditches, small distribu-
tion structures, pipes (where required because of steep slopes) and service
roads. On an experimental basis, sprinkler and drip irrigation equipment
would be financed through the agricultural credit mechanism on about 100 ha
to obtain information that could lead to application at these methods in other
water-short inter-Andean Valleys. Farmers within each "modulo" would estab-
lish water user directorates, which would participate in carrying out on-farm
works.
Agricultural Support Services
4.06      An agricultural extension program has been worked out under which:
(a)  the existing staff of MAG and INERHI would be increased so
as to reach a ratio of one extension agent for 500 farmers;
additional vehicles and demonstration equipment would be
purchased for extension staff so as to provide adequate
services to farmers;
(b)  technological packages for each of the major crops and
livestock activities (except those pertaining to fruits
and vegetables) would be used by staff from INIAP for
in-service training of extension agents, and would subse-
quently be disseminated among farmers. The technological
packages are adequate except for those for fruits and
vegetables, where INIAP's research program is weak; the
project would therefore use the services of an outside
expert in this field (para 4.14).
4.07      Credit would be provided to farmers and farm cooperatives for
on-farm investments and incremental production costs.
(a)  On-farm investments would be financed consisting of (i)
medium-term investments for agricultural implements for
semi-permanent crops and minor livestock species; for
minor on-farm improvements such as storage facilities,
fencing, terracing; and for small local industries such
as brick manufacturing, grain milling and handicrafts;
and (ii) long-term investments for cattle development,
(principally for milk production), and for tree planting
(fruit trees in irrigated areas; pines and eucalyptus in
rainfed zones).
(b)  Incremental seasonal farm-operating expenses consisting
of inputs, improved seeds, agricultural chemicals, tools,
hired labor and machinery services, would be financed
through credit during the six year period of project
implementation.



- 17 -
4.08      The project would expand an existing fruit tree and forestry seedling
nursery to cover project requirements over the first five years, and would also
construct storage and marketing facilities.
Roads and Electrification Networks
4.09      Some 28 km of new roads would be constructed and abut 95 km of
existing roads improved, mainly for the development of the paramo lands.
The project would also improve and extend the electrical networks of the
villages of Quero and Pelileo, which depend on the generating plants of
the Empresa Electrica Ambato.
Social Services
4.10      Potable Water.  Sixteen potable water supply systems would be
installed to serve a total of about 17,000 beneficiaries. The systems would
be fed by gravity and would deliver water through public standpipes located
within villages and at points that would serve more widely scattered settle-
ments. Sources of water of adequate quantity and quality have been deter-
mined as well as the cost of the individual systems, based on standard IEOS
systems for rural areas which are satisfactory. A maximum system cost of
S/. 1,500 (US$60) per beneficiary has been established.
4.11      Latrines.  The project would provide financing for the construction
of about 7,600 latrines for a total population of about 50,000. Latrines
would be installed in all settlements in the project area that presently lack
such facilities. While most latrines would be built for individual families,
some would be grouped together in villages. Works would be carried out based
on standard designs developed by IEOS which are satisfactory.
4.12      Health Facilities.  The project would provide funds for the construc-
tion, furnishing and equipment of two new health sub-centers with living
quarters for medical personnel; construction, furnishing and equipment of eight
new health posts; and renovation of two existing health posts. One vehicle
for the supervision of health sub-centers and five motorcycles for sub-center
personnel to use in supervising health posts would also be provided. The
basic health post design would provide for a permanent structure of about
56 m2 with facilities for attending patients and displaying health and nutri-
tion information and living quarters for medical personnel. Each health post
would be staffed by an auxiliary nurse and visited regularly by medical
personnel. It would serve about 1,500 persons. The health sub-centers would
provide for a permanent structure of about 190 m2, with facilities for attending
patients, including two beds for observation of patients and living quarters
for a medical doctor. Designs of health facilities would be in accordance
with standards developed by IEOS which are satisfactory.
4.13      Community Centers.  Twenty community centers would be provided under
the project, either through new construction or renovation of existing facili-
ties benefitting a total population of about 20,000. Each community center
would have two small offices and a community hall to be used, among other
things, for agricultural training and other services provided under the



- 18 -
project. The community centers would consist of permanent structures, each
providing approximately 150 m2 of space with facilities for meetings, training,
storage and small office.  The design would be prepared according to standards
developed by MAG and found acceptable to the Bank. Whenever possible, health
facilities and community centers would be built as one combined structure.
Consultant Services
4.14      The project would finance 90 man-months of consultant services
at an expected average cost of 6,450 per month. All consultants would be
internationally recruited under terms and conditíons satisfactory to the Bank
and would include a project administrator (for two years; estimated cost
US$154,800), an agricultural engineer (for two years; US$154,800), an agri-
cultural extension expert (for one year; US$77,400), a horticultural and fruit
expert (for one year; US$77,400) and various specialists (for a total of
18 man-months; US$116,100) to assist the Project Executing Unit in the pre-
paration of the monitoring and evaluation system, marketing, agricultural
engineering and social services. While the recruitment of the project admin-
istrator would be a condition of effectiveness of the project (para. 5.02),
the agricultural extension expert, the agricultural engineer and the horti-
cultural and fruit expert would be recruited not later than six months after
signing of the Loan Documents. In addition, an amount of US$620,000 has been
set aside for the preparation of a follow-up project in the Tungurahua province,
and the second phase of the Chibuleo area development, and to study ways of
promoting off-farm activities on which many farmers in the project area depend
for additional income. Terms of reference for the studies would be prepared
by Government and submitted to the Bank for approval not later than 12 months
after signing of the Loan Document. Assurances on this and on the recruitment
of the experts were obtained at negotiations.
Chibuleo Area Development
4.15      Included in the project is a first phase effort to provide infra-
structure and services in the Chibuleo area, the poorest region in the
Tungurahua province, within an area of about 3,000 ha where most of the
population of 5,000 is concentrated. A detailed plan, however, for the
Chibuleo area development is not yet available. MAG, assisted by the
Project Executing Unit, would prepare a detailed plan for this component
and would submit it to the Bank not later than six months after signing
of the Loan Documents (para 5.07).
C. Project Costs
4.16      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$30.0 million, of
which US$10.9 million, or 36%, represents the foreign exchange costs. The
cost estimates were based on a feasibility study using 1977 costs, subsequently
updated to reflect cost increases due to inflation from 1977 to 1978. Physical
contingencies of US$1.8 million, or 8% of baseline project costs, and a price



- 19 -
contingency of US$5.9 million, or 26% of baseline costs, to cover expected
price increases over the six-year implementation period, were added. Physical
contingencies calculated for infrastructure, production support, social
services, Chibuleo area development and administration vary between 10% and
15%, depending on the extent of detailed information available on individual
items, while price contingencies were based on the Bank's price projections.
The rates for civil works were 8% for 1978, 7.5% for 1979 and 7% for 1980-84,
while, for equipment, these rates were 7% for 1978, 6.5% for 1979 and 6%
thereafter. For the other project components, the rates determined for civil
works have been used. About 20% of the base project cost would be for irriga-
tion, about 44% for agricultural support services and about 7% for social
services. Details on costs, which are free of duties and identifiable taxes,
are in Annex 1, Tables 5 through 19. A summary of cost estimates is as follows:

D. Financing
4.17      The Bank loan of US$18.0 million, or 60% of project costs, would
cover the foreign exchange cost of US$10.9 million and the equivalent of
US$6.6 million of local currency financing; the Government of Ecuador through
annual budgetary allocations, would provide counterpart funds equivalent
to US$11.5 million, or 38.3% of total project cost; and project beneficiaries
would finance the equivalent of US$1.0 million, or 3.4% of project costs.
The proposed cost-sharing proportions are as follows:
Financed by
Total Cost  Beneficiaries  Government  Bank
------------- (US$ Million) ---------------
Infrastructure                         6.2               -          2.6      3.6
Production Support                    11.1             0.8          3.5      3.8
Social Services                        1.6               -          0.6      1.0
Chibuleo Area Development              0.8               -          0.3      0.5
Administration                         2.6               -          1.0      1.6
Contingencies                          7.7             0.2          3.0      4.5
Total                            30.0             1.0        11.0      18.0
4.18      The Government would be the borrower and would repay the loan,
including interest, and bear the foreign exchange risk. The Bank loan of
US$18.0 million would be for 17 years, including six years of grace. The
Government would make arrangements to provide the agencies responsible for
the operation and maintenance of the project components with adequate funds
and staff to maintain the irrigation systems, public roads and health centers.
Assurances on this were obtained from Government during negotiations.
E. Procurement
4.19      Items to be procured under the project include civil works, equip-
ment, vehicles and services. Civil works, estimated to amount to US$8.0
million excluding contingencies, would cover irrigation works (about US$4.4
million); roads, potable water supply, community centers and health centers
(US$2.5 million), collection centers, latrines, the tree plant nursery; and
buildings (US$1.1 million). All components consist of numerous small works
scattered over the project area. Furthermore, the desirability of using labor
intensive construction methods, including self-help organizations and mostly
small contractors located near the construction site, would limit the oppor-
tunities for local competitive bidding. For these reasons, civil works would



- 22 -
be carried out on the basis of individually negotiated contracts or through
(MAG or INERRI) force account. Negotiated contracts are the usual implementa-
tion form by INERHI and experience shows such negotiated contracts are cheaper
than competitively bid contracts because INERRI sets low rates and is able to
get contractors to accept them. Contracts in excess of US$150,000 of which
there are expected to be few, would be procured on the basis of local competi-
tive bidding following current Ecuadorian procurement legislation which is
satisfactory; such contracts would be reviewed by the Bank before award.
Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
4.20      For goods and services to be financed through agricultural credit,
estimated to amount to US$7.9 million excluding contingencies (US$7.6 million
under the credit component and US$0.3 million under the Chibuleo area develop-
ment), procurement would be through normal commercial channels. It would not
be practicable to arrange for bulk procurement under international competitive
bidding procedures, considering the large number of sub-borrowers and the
wide range of items to be financed under the project. An adequate selection
of farm inputs and other agricultural equipment is available through local
and international suppliers, who maintain adequate stocks and whose margins
are in an acceptable range.
4.21      All equipment (except electrical equipment) vehicles, and spare
parts with an estimated total value of US$1.3 million excluding contingen-
cies would be procured tax exempt, as all Government agencies are exempt from
sales taxes and import duties. Procurement would be through local competitive
bidding, according to procedures which are acceptable to the Bank. Bidders
would be required to guarantee acceptable arrangements for the supply of spare
parts. Because of the numerous items which would have to be procured by
different Government agencies and over a period of about four years, inter-
national competitive bidding would not be practical. Electrical equipment
estimated to cost about US$200,000 would be procured by internationally
advertised competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines for procure-
ment. Assurances on these matters were obtaíned during negotiations.
F. Disbursements
4.22      The investment period would extend over six years and Bank disburse-
ments are expected to run about 6-1/2 years. Disbursements from loan proceeds
would be made for:
(a) 58% of amounts rediscounted by the Central Bank for
farmer subloans for a total value of US$4.5 million;
(b) 54% of total expenditures for civil works (for infrastructure,
production support, social services, Chibuleo area development
and administration) for a total value of US$5.0 million;
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported vehicles and equipment
or 80% of expenditures for imported locally procured vehicles
and equipment; and 100% of ex-factory costs of those manufactured
locally for a total value of US$1.8 million;



- 23 -
(d) 100% of total expenditures for consultant services and overseas
training for a total value of US$1.7 million; and
(e) 54% of local expenditures for incremental cost of personnel
for project administration and extension for a total value
of US$2.0 million.
The above values include US$2.2 million price contingencies; the balance
of US$1.5 million would initially be unallocated, together with the physical
contingencies (US$1.5 million), for a total amount of US$3.0 million.
4.23      Disbursements under the credit component and for civil works and
services carried out under force account would be made against statements of
expenditure, the documentation for which would not be submitted for review
but would be retained by the borrower and be available for inspection by
the Bank during the course of project supervision. All other expenditures
under the loan would be fully documented and submitted to the Bank, after
being certified by the Ministry of Agriculture, along with the respective
withdrawal applications. The borrower would provide an annual report and
would obtain an opinion from independent auditors on whether or not the funds
had been used for the purpose for which they were provided. Report and
opinion would be sent to the Bank not more than four months after the close
of each fiscal year.

4.24       The estimated schedule of Bank disbursements would be as follows:

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
5.01      This project would be the first rural development project in Ecuador
involving participation by various agencies. The organizational structure has
therefore been designed to ensure coordination of the work of such agencies
while giving their local representatives as well as the project beneficiaries
as much responsibility as practicable.
Organization and Management
5.02      Overall responsibility for carrying out the project would rest
with MAG, which would establish a Project Executing Unit in the project area.
This unit would be headed by a senior professional as Project Director,
assisted by two consultants: one for administration and the other for agrí-
cultural extension. The Project Director, whose qualifications and terms and
conditions would be satisfactory to the Government and the Bank, would be
appointed by MAG. Assurances on these points were obtained at negotiations.
It would be a condition of effectiveness that the Project Director and the
consultant for administration had been appointed.
5.03      A Coordinating Board would supervise the project and ensure timely
implementation of all project components. In view of the essential need for
coordination, high Government officials would be represented on the Board:
the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock (President); the Director of Agrarian
Zone No. 7 (Vice-President); the Governor of Tungurahua Province; the President
of the National Planning Board (JUNAPLA); the Executive Director of INERHI;
the Director of IERAC; the Project Director of the Agricultural Credit Project
Unit in MAG; or their respective delegates. The Board would further more
include three farmer representatives, and the Project Director (without vote).
5.04      The Board would meet at least twice a year to review progress on the
basis of consolidated quarterly progress reports prepared by the Project Exe-
cuting Unit. An Advisory Board would also be established to provide local
representation and facilitate coordination at the regional level. This
Board would consist of the Director of Agrarian Zone No. 7 (President), the
head of the provincial Government office; the head of INERHI's office at
Ambato; the head of IERAC's office at Ambato; the head of BNF at Ambato; the
head of IEOS at Ambato; three farmer-representatives, two of whom would be
elected by the farmer associations and one appointed by the Director of
Agrarian Zone No. 7; and the Project Director. It would receive monthly
reports from the Project Director and meet at least every three months to
review progress. Assurances on the establishment and operation,of the
Coordinating and the Advisory Board were obtained during negotiations.
Project Execution
5.05      The Project Executing Unit would be responsible for overall project
administration; construction of roads, storage facilities and community centers;
hiring of consultants; organization of farmer cooperatives; preparation and
implementation of training programs in collaboration with the Agricultural
Credit Project Unit (ACPU); production of tree-plants, with assistance from
INIAP; and development of the Chibuleo area. It would have four operational



- 26 -
divisions--rural development, irrigation, legal affairs and farmers' organiza-
tions--and four zonal units would be set up in Pelileo, Huachí, Quero and
Chibuleo. The proposed organization is outlined in Chart 1. The unit
through its Planning, Programming and Budgeting Division would be responsible
for coordinating the activities of the agencies participating in the project
and for implementing specific project components (para 5.08). An annual
investment plan and budgets and an outline for future project expenditures
would be sent to the Bank two months before the start of the year in question.
Assurances on this were obtained at negotiations.
5.06      MAG would provide the extension staff to the Project Executing
Unit and would, through the Unit, be responsible for implementation of the
credit component through participating banks in accordance with the terms and
conditions established in Loan 1459-EC.
5.07      MAG, assisted by the Project Executing Unit, would prepare a plan
in such detaíl as the Bank may request for the implementation of the Chibuleo
area development component and would submit it to the Bank six months after
signing of the Loan Documents. A special group would be created for the
implementation of this project component and would consist of four professionals,
two of whom would be extension agents, one would be specialized in the organí-
zation of cooperatives, and one would be in charge of an agricultural machine
pool. This group would assist the local population in introducing advanced
production methods and improved seeds and modern agricultural inputs and in
the operation of the agricultural services center.
5.08      Individual project components would be executed by the following
participating agencies: INERHI, IEOS, EEA and CPT. IERAC would provide
land titling and INIAP advisory services for training extension workers.
5.09      INERHI would be responsible for the final design and the construc-
tion of the major irrigation works and for the provision of technical assis-
tance for the design and the construction of on-farm irrigation works in
collaboration with the irrigation division of the Project Executing Unit.
INERHI would, furthermore, be responsible for the organization of water user
directorates, for operation and maintenance of the major irrigation works, and
for establishing adequate water charges. The water user directorates (para
6.02) would be organized according to the provisions of the Ecuadorian Water
Law (Titulo XVI) which specifies directorate rights and obligations. Their
charters determining organization and operation have to be approved by INERHI.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that beneficiaries would, through
adequate water charges, pay the full cost of operation and maintenance and pay
back the irrigation capital investment adjusted to inflation over a time
period set in accordance with present INERRI regulations (para 8.04). INERHI
would also periodically exchange views with the Bank on the adjustment of such
water charges as required.
5.10      IEOS would be responsible for the design and construction of potable
water systems and health facilities. It would also be responsible for deter-
mining the location of latrines, supervising construction and supplying construc-
tion materíals and installations. After the construction of the potable water
systems and latrines, the communities concerned, assisted by IEOS, would be



- 27 -
responsible for their operation and maintenance, while the Ministry of Health
would be responsible for staffing and operation and maintenance of the health
facilities.
5.11      EEA would be responsible for preparing a detailed plan for the
rural electrification component and would submit it to the Bank for approval
not later than 12 months after signing of the Loan Documents. An assurance
on this was obtained at negotiations.
5.12      After the construction and improvement of the rural roads through
the Project Executing Unit, CPT would be responsible for their maintenance.
Subsidiary Project Agreements
5.13      In order to ensure that the participating agencies would carry
out their assigned tasks for the project, MAG would enter into subsidiary
project agreements, acceptable to the Bank, with INERHI, IEOS, EEA and CPT.
An assurance on this was obtained at negotiations. Further, it would be a
condition of disbursement for each component separately that the Bank had
received and approved the relevant subsidiary project agreement between MAG
and the concerned agency. Agreements would define the authority and respon-
sibilities of each agency to: (a) prepare, together with the Planning,
Progranmming and Budgeting Division of the Project Executive Unit, the work
program and budgets for the relevant project components; (b) carry out its
part of the project with the funds allocated; (c) provide staff and sepvices
as required; (d) comply with established procurement procedures; (e) comply
with established disbursement procedures; (f) maintain uniform separate
project accounts; (g) submit information to MAG in accordance with the moni-
toring evaluation systems adopted for the project; and (h) collaborate with
the inspection staff of the Project Executing Unit.
Revolving Fund
5.14      To provide the finances necessary, the Government would establish
not later than June 30, 1979 a project revolving fund in the Central Bank of
not less than US$500,000 equivalent. This fund would be replenished as
withdrawals of project funds proceed. At the beginning of each financial
year, the Government would make an appropriate budget allocation equivalent to
the estimated annual expenditure of each participating agency and the Project
Unit. Assurances on these points were obtained at negotiations.
Lending Terms and Conditions of Agricultural Credit
5.15      Credit would be made available through private and official partici-
pating banks and other lending institutions such as CESA (para 2.19). While
the credit institutions would be responsible for determining the creditworthi-
ness of prospective sub-borrowers, the Project Director of ACPU would have the
responsibility to approve the investment plans, unless he decides, together
with the Project Director, to delegate this responsibility to a participating
lending institution (para 3.03). Eligibility would be established on the
basis of the technical, financial and economic soundness of the investment
plans and projections of typical farm models of the area, in accordance with
terms and conditions established in the Loan Agreements of Loan 1459-EC.



- 28 -
5.16      The mínimum annual interest rates on subloans, including commission
allowed to be charged by regulation 927-76 of the monetary board of the
Borrower, would be 11% for small farmers (defined below) and 14% for others.
Terms of subloans are expected to range up to 12 years, including up to five
years of grace prior to the repayment of principal. The proposed interest
charges are considered adequate. Inflation rates in Ecuador have fallen
substantially from the levels of 23% in 1974 and 14.4% in 1975 to about 11%
in 1976/77 and 12% in 1978 and are expected to average at 10% over the next
three years owing to the Government's anti-inflation policy. On this basis,
all categories of sub-borrowers would pay positive interest rates. The
Government would keep the differential in the rates for small and larger
farmers in accordance with Government policy. Subloans other than those to
small farmers and cooperatives composed of a majority of small farmers, would
not exceed 10% of the funds of the credit program under the project.  Assurances
were obtained that any changes in the terms and conditions of subloans as
specified in this and the preceding paragraphs would be made only with the
concurrence of the Bank.
5.17      For the purpose of determining the rate of interest, a small farmer
would be defined as one with net assets of less than SI. 500,000 (US$20,000),
including the cadastral land value but excluding the value of the buildings
thereon, and whose principal source of income was the farm for which the
subloan was sought and off-farm manual work. Water user directorates and
legally established small farmer associations would be qualified under the
same terms and conditions as individual small farmers, provided that the
Project Director is satisfied that such associations operate for the benefit
and under the administration of small farmers.
5.18      The small farmer subloans would cover up to 90% of investment
costs, with the remaining 10% contributed by the beneficiary. The maximum
subloan to any small farmer would be US$12,000 equivalent.
5.19      Other subloans for agricultural operations and processing of farm
products would cover up to 80% of the investment costs. The free limit of
US$100,000 equivalent, cumulative, to any sub-borrower, established under
Loan 1459-EC would also apply for this project; subloans above the free
limit would continue to be submitted to the Bank for approval.
5.20      Participating lending institutions would be able to re-discount with
BC up to 90% of the subloans made to small farmers. Subloans by participating
banks would be re-discounted as follows: 80% for subloans of up to US$50,000
equivalent; 75% for subloans of between US$50,000 and US$100,000 equivalent;
and 70% for subloans of over US$100,000 equivalent. Re-discounting requests
to BC would be made within three months of the date of disbursements of the
participating bank.  Interest rates charged by BC (including its administrative
service charge of 0.5%) would be between 3% and 6% below the interest rates
charged by participating banks for subloans. In the case of subloans to
beneficiaries other than small farmers, the re-discount rate charged partici-
pating banks would be no less than the sum of the interest rate on the Bank
loan plus the administrative service charge of BC. Repayment schedules to BC
would be in line with those of the sub-borrowers. Government would enter into
an agreement with BC determining the terms and conditions under which the
proceeds for this part of the loan will be transferred.



- 29 -
5.21      The above arrangements would provide adequate incentives to the
participating lending institutions to lend to small farmers and to use
their own funds.
Accounts and Audit
5.22      MAG would administer the project funds and maintain appropriate
financial records which would reflect expenditures made by each participating
agency and for each investment category. Each participating agency would
maintain separate accounts for all expenditures incurred in the implementation
of the respective project component. Project accounts of each agency would be
subject to auditing by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank. The
project account would be audited annually, and MAG would send the audited
accounts, together with the auditor's comments, to the Bank within four
months of the close of each financial year (para 4.23). During negotiations,
assurances were obtained from the Government on these matters.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.23      The results of the project investments would be monitored by the
Project Executing Unit, which would arrange for the collection of information
in a form comparable to the original implementation schedule and development
plans and projections of the works and services financed. This information
should allow thorough project supervision, early detection of problems and
timely modification of the project program. The detaíled information would be
retained by the Project Director and would be available for inspection by Bank
supervision missions. Summaries and analyses of the information would be
included in the Project Director's quarterly reports as the information became
available. To assist the Project Executing Unit in the preparation of this
component, a consultant specialized in monitoring and evaluation would be
hired by the Government for a period of about two months to identify the
special monitoring and evaluation requirements of the project and to prepare
a detailed proposal for implementation (para 4.14). Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the consultant's report would be prepared and made
available to the Bank not later than six months after signing of the Loan
Document. During the second year of project implementation, a specialist
in monitoring and evaluation would again be hired to assist in a review and
adjustment of monitoring and evaluation procedures as required.
5.24      Promptly after completion of the project, but in any event not
later than six months after the Closing Date, unless a delay is agreed between
the Borrower and the Bank, the Borrower would prepare and furnish to the Bank
a draft completion report of such scope and detall as the Bank may reasonably
request on the execution and initial operation of the project, its costs and
benefits, the performance by participating agencies and the Bank of the
respective obligations under the Loan Agreement, and the accomplishment of the
purposes of the loan. During negotiations, an assurance was obtained on this.

VI. TECHNICAL FEATURES
Irrigation Works
6.01      The irrigation works have been designed using standard INERHI
critería for canals and structures (Annex 1, Table 20), based on 1:5,000-
scale maps with 5-m contour intervals. The minimum river flow, shown in Annex
1, Table 4, would satisfy the irrigation water requirement of this area (Annex
1, Table 21). Water losses were estimated based on an irrigation field
efficiency of 65%, canal losses of 5%, and systems efficiency of 62%. While
the design for the 850-ha Quero sub-area is available, the design for the
950-ha Ladrillos-Huambalo sub-area still has to be completed. No disbursements
would be made for irrigation works before the design of the complete Quero-
Ladrillos-Huambalo area had been submitted to the Bank for comments.
6.02      The secondaries would deliver water to the cooperatively organized
"modulos," within which the farmers organized in water user directorates (para
5.09), and assisted by project engineers, would buíld internal distribution
systems, which would take into account existing land ownership patterns. No
drainage system is required because of steep slopes and pervious soils.
Production Support
6.03      A tree-plant nursery at Pillaro, which is currently producing about
10,000 fruit tree seedlings per year, would be expanded under the project to
produce about half a million fruit tree seedlings during the first five years
of the project. At the same time, the nursery would be expanded to produce
about one-quarter million of forestry seedlings. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the cost of tree seedlings would be fully recovered
through adequate sales prices.
6.04      Storage Facilities.  To support better storage and marketing of
farm produce in the project area, the following structures are envisaged:
(a) one silo for potatoes with a capacity of 80 tons, located
in the paramo of the Quero district;
(b)  one produce collection center with an area of 150 m2 in the
village of Pillaro; and
(c) one storage and marketing facility in the city of Ambato.
6.05      Extension Service and Training.  The extension service would be
organized in two teans for the irrigated area.  Both teans would consist of
a team leader, one veterinarian, 12 agricultural extension agents and two
secretaries. One team would be created for the rainfed area, consisting of a
team leader, one veterinarian, six agricultural extension agents and one
secretary. Training would be provided to farmers in the project area as well
as to professional staff at the national level. Courses would be given to



- 31 -
train farmers in agricultural techniques, to organize cooperatives for agricul-
tural production and marketing, and operation of storage facilities and the
like. Scholarships would be provided for specialized agricultural studies
abroad.
Roads and Electrification
6.06      Rural Roads.  The Consejo Provincial would prepare the design of
the roads other than the road to the paramo region to be financed by the
project, using the following críterna:
Width of road compacted by pneumatic roller         4.00 m
Minimum thickness of compacted layer               15.00 cm
Maximum gravel size                                 7.00 cm
Width of shoulders                                  0.60 m
Maximum gradient                                     10%
Minimum horizontal curve radius                    30.00 m
6.07      The improvement of the roads financed under the project would
be carried out to the same technical specifications. Depending on the present
conditions of various road sections, three types of road improvements have
been specified:
Type 1 - Rectification of alignment, placement and compaction of
gravel surface layer, drainage works.
Type 2 - Placement and compaction of gravel surface layer,
drainage works.
Type 3 - Improvement of gravel surface layer, drainage works.
The proposed new road to the paramo region would be designed by consultants
under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
6.08      Rural Electrification.  Electrical equipment would be financed
as specified by a study to be undertaken by the Empresa Electrica, Ambato.
The study would include a detailed program for carrying out this component,
including plans for strengthening the transmission facilities involved, sur-
veys of the households to be connected, tariffs, load forecasts, designs,
bills of materials and procurement, construction and connection schedules.
No disbursements would be made for this component until the program and rural
electrification tariffs have been approved by the Bank (para 5.11).
Potable Water Supply
6.09      The potable water supply systems would generally include a spring
catchment, a reservoir, a slow filter for villages with over 1,000 inhabitants,
and piping to public standpipes and laundry facilities. The preliminary
design of the 16 proposed water supply systems has been prepared according to
IEOS standards, which calls for the following:



- 32 -
(a)  estimate of the population to be served during the next 20
to 25 years, considering a population growth rate of 2% per
annum;
(b) calculation of a water demand of 100 liters per person per
day where public standpipes are planned; and
(c) determination of standard reservoir sizes (between 15 and
60 m3) and appropriate locations permitting a static pressure
between 5 and 70 meters.
Environmental Impact
6.10      The project would include farm-level terracing and reforestation,
which would have a positive effect on the environment. Fertilizers and
chemicals for plant and animal protection utilized in the project would have
little or no effect on the local ecology, assuming normal precautions in their
application.

VII. PRODUCTION, DEMAND AND MARKETING ASPECTS
Agricultural Production
7.01      Future Land Use and Cropping Patterns.  No major changes are
expected in the total area of 15,000 ha under crops in rainfed agriculture
in Quero although, under the project, there would be a shift from low yielding
crops to somewhat higher yielding crops.
7.02      In the 9,600-ha irrigated area, better water availablility would
permit íncreasing the cropping intensity for annual crops from 95% to 134%.
There would also be a shift from such crops as maize and barley, which are
grown maínly because of the limited irrigation supply, to fruits and vege-
tables, which wíll be grown with the more reliable irrigation water supply.
Projected land use in the irrigated area would be as follows:
Commanded    Suitable for    Minus Project and On-farm
Zone                Area       Irrigation*         Infrastructure (20%)

Pelileo                 1,508          1,390                   1,112
Quero                   1,200          1,040                      832
Ladrillos-Huambalo      1,400          1,170                      936
Total                  13,500         12,000                   9,600
*    Column (1) minus Class VI lands.
7.03      Yields.  The limited use of fertilizer, agrochemicals and improved
seeds, and the inadequate extension service in the project area have resulted
in a stagnation of yields and production in recent years. Although farmers
presently make relatively good use of their existing resources, project
investments would result in considerable increases in production through
irrigation, roads, on-farm works, provision of improved seeds, fertilizer,
agro-chemicals and technical assistance. The farmers in the area are already
accustomed to irrigation. Present and future crop and livestock yields are
shown below. The projected yields would be reached after the introduction of
improved inputs, credit and extension services (three years for annuals and
about 10 for perenníals). The yield increase per year would be linear.

7.04      Incremental Production.  The value of incremental production would
be about US$8 million per annum at full development, based on long-run economic
prices. Most of the incremental production from the project area is expected
to be consumed in the urban centers of Ecuador (about seven-eights) such as
Quito, Guayaquil and other cities in the coastal areas. Expected distribution
of the incremental production from the project ís as follows:
Consumption

Products                  Production             project area
=------------ (tons) ---------(%)
Vegetables                  19,500                     229                  1.2
Potatoes                    21,000                  5,919                  28.2

7.05      The impact of the incremental production on the national supply
would be very small so that prices of the products produced under the Project
would not be significantly affected. On the other hand, producer prices at
local level would most probably improve since storage facilities and marketing
would be upgraded under the project.



- 35 -
Demand
7.06      The demand situation for agricultural production in Ecuador is
generally favorable, especially for most of the main crops to be produced
in the project area, since the growth of supply is expected to lag behind
demand. Producers in the project area would be in an especially favorable
situation because of their traditional orientation towards the supply of
the rapidly growing urban areas of the country.
Marketing
7.07      The k:e9ently unfavorable marketing conditions (paras 2.20 and 2.21)
would be improved under the project. Since none of the rural markets has
adequate storage facilities, not even temporary storage, farm products have
to be disposed of immediately after harvest (in some cases abandoned).  The
project would, therefore, finance the construction of storage facilities in
the project area and in the city of Ambato (para 6.04).
7.08      Presently, the prices of agricultural products vary considerably
from market to market, and there is, moreover, no information system on prices
in and between markets, which contributes to the unfavorable situation of the
farmers. To strengthen the farmers' bargaining position, the project would
support the formation of marketing cooperatives (para 6.05), which would allow
the farmers to reach the most favorable markets and obtain better prices.

VIII. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Financial Analysis
Financial Return in Farm Models
8.01      Two farm models, representative of the rainfed area development,
were prepared, using the technical coefficients, technical parameters and
prices given in Chapter VI: model 1, shown in Annex 1, Tables 24 to 27,
represents the "community development approach" while model 2, shown in
Annex 1, Tables 28 to 31, illustrates the development which could be achieved
on individual farms. The model shown in Annex 1, Tables 32 and 33, indicates
the present (without project) and future (with project) situation for the
irrigated area.
8.02      Under the assumptions used for the preparation of the models, the
calculations show (Annex 1, Table 27 and 31) that the investments would be
financially rewarding for the farmers with financial rates of return of 33.5%
and 23.7%. The illustrative budget of Annex 1, Table 34, shows that the incre-
mental net value of production would increase 170% from SI. 2,708 (US$108) per
farm to S/. 7,350 (US$294) per farm. About 3,000 farmers in the irrigated
area with farms of this size would remain below the level of present relative
poverty (para 1.04) but above the absolute poverty level, if only their farm
income is considered. They will, consequently, continue as at present to seek
employment outside of their farms. Farmers with 1.6 ha farms (Annex 1, Table
35) would have incomes above the poverty level at full development. The family
income calculated for both rainfed models would also be above the present
poverty levels at full development.
Cost Recovery of Project Works
8.03      The directly productive components of the project would be carried
out through self-help actions or financed through a regular credit operation
at a low but positive real interest rate; therefore, funds would be fully
recovered by participating lending institutions. The communities would con-
tribute voluntary labor 1/ to the construction of potable water systems,
latrines, community centers, health and storage facilities.
8.04      The Water Law of 1972 requires that the beneficiaries of Government-
financed irrigation projects must pay for operation and maintenance of the
irrigation systems and for the cost of the irrigation works, and charged
INERHI with responsibility for determining water tariffs. INERHI established
such tariffs according to the provisions of the Water Law and determined a
repayment period of 75 years for the investment cost without charging interest
and without making adjustments to inflation. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that INERHI would review the water tariffs with a view to adjust
the investment cost to inflation before calculating annual repayments (para
5.09). The application of this procedure to the Quero-Ladrillos project,
making the necessary adjustments for inflation, shows (Annex 1, Table 37) a
rent recovery index of 58.6% and a cost recovery index of 32%. This level of

projects; such self-help activity is known as "minga".

cost recovery is justified, as the project beneficiaries in both irrigated and
rainfed areas would almost exclusively consist of the target group: over 90%
presently have an estimated income below the relative poverty level and about
65% have agricultural incomes below the absolute poverty level.
8.05      No direct recovery of capital cost is expected on investments
incurred for roads, electrification, storage facilities and social infrastruc-
ture. On the basis of these assumptions it is estimated that only 28% of the
total project investment cost will be recovered during the first 17 years of
the cash flow analysis. (S/. 208 miliíon, equivalent to US$8.3 million.)
8.06      Beneficiaries would pay through irrigation water charges the full
cost of operation and maintenance of the irrigation works (as established by
law) and would also pay, as is the general practice, the full cost of operation
and maintenance of potable water, latrines, community centers and storage
facilities.
8.07      The cash flow analysis (page 38) indicates that the project requires
an average of S/. 11.9 miliíon (US$0.5 million) Government counterpart funds
per annum during the first six years of implementation and an average of
S/. 65.8 million (US$2.6 million) during the succeeding 11 years. The cumula-
tive fiscal balance, during the 18-year period of the cash flow analysis is
negative and would continue to be negative because the social infrastructure
and public facilities financed by the project are not expected to be recovered
directly from the beneficiaries of the project.
B. Economic and Social Analysis
Economic and Social Benefits
8.08      The economic benefits of the project would come from increased
yields and production through upgrading and expanding irrigation on a net area
of 9,600 ha, and through intensifying cropping on about 18,000 rainfed ha.
The direct beneficiaries would be some 16,000 farm families (approximately
83,000 people).
8.09      In the Quero-Ladrillos area, the cost per ha would be about US$1,500
for a mix of irrigation rehabilitation and new irrigation, excluding price
contingencies; the average cost per farm family of US$1,600. In the rainfed
zone, the cost per ha of US$500 and the average cost per farm family of US$1,400
(excluding price contingencies) would be lower since no major infrastructure
works are needed.
8.10      From the individual farmers' point of view, social and/or non-
quantifiable benefits would include: rural roads, rural electrification,
storage facilities, potable water, health services to lower mortality and assist
in family planning, increased employment for under-employed family members,
and improved nutrition.

8.11      From a national point of view, the project would support the Govern-
ment's rural development policies; contribute to attaining self-sufficiency
in fruits, vegetables and milk production; and help decrease income disparities
between rural and urban areas, thereby reducing rural-urban migration. Since
this would be the first of a series of rural development projects that the
Government plans to implement in Ecuador, the several participating institu-
tíons would gain experience which would be valuable in carrying out similar
irrigation and rainfed projects in other parts of the Sierra.
Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
8.12      The economic rates of return were calculated for the irrigated and
the rainfed area as presented in Annex 1, Table 38. The cost stream includes:
investment costs for irrigation infrastructure, roads, tree-plant production,
marketing facilities and necessary on-farm investments; incremental annual
costs for project administration, extension and banking services; and operation
and maintenance for the irrigation systems and roads.  However, investment and
operating costs for training, consultant services and social components
(health, electrification, potable water supply, latrines and community centers),
have not been charged to the project. The projected benefits represent the
incremental net value of farm production. It was assumed in the analysis that
the benefits from annual crops would reach the full level of development in
year 7 of the project, from livestock production at year 10 and from perennial
crop production at year 15. The buíldup to that level reflects both the
anticipated rate of construction of physical works and the rate at which
farmers are expected to adopt measures to increase productivity and cropping
intensity.
8.13      The economic rate of return calculations are based on the following
assumptions:
(a)  Output prices.  Prices for barley, maize, beef and wool are
based on the Bank's commodity price projections in constant
1978 prices adjusted for transport costs and variations  in
quality. The remaining products have been priced at prevailing
average farmgate prices. The prices used in the economic
and financial analysis are given in Annex 1, Table 36.
(b)  Input Prices.  Investment and operating costs (including farm
inputs) have been priced at constant January 1978 prices based
on local market prices. Total investment costs charged to the
ponject are US$56 million over the six year implementation period.
(c)  Hired Labor.  Current wages  in the area for farm labor are S/. 50
per day, and construction labor wages range from S/. 80 to S/. 120
per day. Shadow wages for unskílled hired labor as a percentage of
market wages were assumed at 70% of the market wage for on-farm and
construction labor. The 70% rate for hired labor is the average
shadow wage rate for unskilled labor in Ecuador.



- 40 -
(d) Family Labor. For the shadow pricing of labor used for on-farm
infrastructure investments, family labor has been valued at 25%
of the wage rate of unskilled labor; for operating expenses the
corresponding shadow price is 50% of the wage rate of unskilled
labor. These rates reflect the under-employment prevalent in the
minifundio region and the fact that work for on-farm infrastructure
investments would be implemented during the off-farm season through
farmers' self-help organizations.
(e) Exchange Rate. A standard conversion factor (official exchange
rate divided by the shadow exchange rate) of 0.93 has been applied
to the prices of internationally nontradable goods. The estimated
shadow exchange rate and, hence, the standard conversion factor are
based on weighted averages of import tariffs and export subsidies.
(f) Period of Analysis. The economic analysis was based upon a 40-year
period for the irrigated areas and a 26-year period for rainfed
areas.
8.14      The overall rate of return for the project on the above assumptions
is estimated at 21% (Annex 1, Tables 38 and 39). The economic rates of return
for the project's sub-areas would be as follows:
-    for the rainfed area of 18,000 ha:  35.7%;
-    for the Quero-Ladrillos irrigated area of 1,800 ha:  12.7%; and
-    for the Huachi-Pelileo irrigated area of 7,800 ha:  14.4%.
These rates of return do not include the social and other non-quantifiable
benefits described in paragraphs 8.10 and 8.11. The effects on the rates
of return of cost overruns, timing of costs, and benefits or output short-
falls, in Annex I, Table 39, show that the project is more sensitive to
changes in the estimated benefits than to changes in investment costs or
delays.
8.15      The rate of return for the Huachi-Pelileo area was calculated on
the assumption that the tunnel and related major distribution works from the
Ambato River to serve this area (para 2.12) will be completed. If these
works were not completed the execution of on-farm development works on the
presently irrigated area of about 5,500 ha plus some improvements in the
present primary and secondary canal system would still, by themselves, improve
water deliveries. The rate of return, under these assumptions is estimated
to be about 13% (see Annex I, Table 39).
Project Risk
8.16      Decreases in product prices and incidence of diseases of fruits
and vegetables represent a risk factor of the project; their occurrence could
have a negative effect on the project's rate of return on the other hand,
demand for fruits, vegetables and milk products, may be greater than presently
foreseen and the economic benefits from storage facilities and roads (not
quantified--see para 8.10) will probably be significant. Concerning the



- 41 -
construction of the irrigation distribution works, the probability of cost
overruns is considered to be low. INERII has experience with similar works
and appropriate physical contingencies have been taken into account in
estimating the costs. A major risk would be the occurrence of organization
and management problems since Ecuador has, up to now, had little experience
with integrated rural development projects of the type proposed.

IX. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
9.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
that:
(a) Consultants would be hired according to terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Borrower and the Bank, with an agricultural
engineer and a horticultural and fruit expert to be hired not later
than six months after signing of the Loan Documents (para 4.14); and
terms of reference for studies would be prepared by Government and
submitted to the Bank for approval not later than 12 months after
signing of the Loan Documents;
(b) Government would make arrangements to provide the agencies respon-
sible for operation and maintenance of the project components
with adequate funds and staff to carry out the work (para 4.18);
(c)  Provisions for procurement as presented in paragraphs 4.19-4.21
would be followed;
(d) A Project Executing Unit would be established in the project area
and the Project Director and two experts (agricultural extension
and administration) would be appointed by MAG according to terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para 5.02); and a Coordí-
nating Board and an Advisory Board would be established (paras
5.03 - 5.04);
(e) An annual investment plan and budget and an outline for future
project expenditures would be sent to the Bank two months before
the start of the year in question (para 5.05);
(f) The Project Execution Unit would prepare a detailed plan for the
Chibuleo Area Development and submit it to the Bank for comments
(para 5.07);
(g) Beneficiaries would pay the full cost of operation and maintenance
and pay back the irrigation capital investments adjusted to inflation
over a time period set in accordance with present INBRHI regulations
(para 5.09);
(h) Empresa Electrica Ambato would prepare a detailed plan for the elec-
trification component and submit it to the Bank for approval not
later than 12 months after signing of the Loan Documents (para 5.11);
(i) MAG would enter into subsidiary project agreements with all
participating agencies defining their responsibilities (para 5.13);
(j) Government would establish a project revolving fund of not less
than US$500,000 equivalent and replenish the fund in accordance
with withdrawal of project funds. The Government would also make
appropriate budget allocations equivalent to the estimated annual
expenditures of the participating agencies and the Project Unit
(para. 5.14);



- 43 -
(k) Any changes in terms and conditions of subloans as spelled out
in paragraphs 5.15 and 5.16 would be made only wíth the concurrence
of the Bank;
(1) Each agency would maintain separate accounts for all expenditures
incurred in the implementation of the respective project component
(para 5.22);
(m) Accounts of each agency would be subject to auditing by an
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank. The project accounts
would be audited annually, and MAG would send the audited accounts,
together with the auditor's comments, to the Bank within four months
of the close of each fiscal year (para 5.22);
(n) A consultant would be hired by government to identify monitoring and
evaluation requirements of the project, and to prepare proposals for
implementation; the consultant's report would be submitted to the
Bank not later than six months after signing of the Loan Documents
(para 5.23);
(o) Not later than six months after the closing date of the project,
the Government would prepare a draft completion report on the
execution and initial operation of the project, its costs and
benefits and performance of the Bank and participating agencies
(para 5.24); and
(p) The cost of tree seedlings would be fully recovered through
adequate sales prices (para. 6.03).
9.02      A condition of effectiveness would be that the Project Director,
and the administrative expert had been appointed (para 5.02).
9.03      A condition of disbursement for each component separately would be
that the Bank had received and approved the relevant subsidiary project agree-
ment between MAG and the concerned agency (para 5.13). A condítion of dis-
bursement for the Quero-Ladrillos irrigation works would be that the Bank had
approved the design for the complete area (para 6.01).
9.04      With the assurances, the proposed project would constitute a suit-
able basis for a Bank Loan to the Government of Ecuador for US$18.0 million
for a term of 17 years, including six years of grace, with interest at the
rate prevailing at the time of loan approval.

1/  The 7,800 ha area would receive irrigation water through a tunnel and major distribution works still to be
completed. As these works are not included in the project, the rate of return was calculated discounting
the benefits attributed to these works (overall reduction of 30%). If these works would not be completed
the rate of return would still be about 13% based on the following assumptions: (a) the irrigated area would
be reduced to about 5,500 ha; (b) the cost of irrigation works would be the same as presently foreseen;
(c) operating costs and agricultural investments would be proportionately lower; and (d) benefits would be
reduced by 60% compared to the with tunnel situation.
