Rural Finance Projects financed a\n            wide range of rural investments to 4.45 million families and\n            small enterprises whose net incomes rose by an average of 65\n            percent. Investment lending by twenty five participating\n            financial institutions to private rural entrepreneurs\n            increased fourteen-fold and the volume of lending to the\n            poor and to micro-enterprises jumped 250 percent.
