as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: when a government is taking a series of measures\n            to improve conditions in rural areas, and rural term credit\n            is in short supply, easing this constraint can have a major\n            positive impact on rural incomes. It also leads to increases\n            in access to other financial services such as use of savings\n            deposits. Credit projects are likely to succeed when they\n            are relatively straightforward in structure, provided that\n            the broad financial sector reform issues have been or are\n            being addressed at the same time. A local commercial bank,\n            if suitably strengthened, may be in the best position to\n            serve as an apex lending institution, provided that there is\n            strong commitment from its senior management including\n            willingness to provide the necessary resources to a Project\n            Management Unit (PMU) and to set up an effective Monitoring\n            and Evaluation (M&E) system. A strong PMU can be used as\n            a training ground for its larger institution, provided the\n            institution's senior management is committed to this\n            rather than isolating the PMU. Private Banks can be\n            attracted to significantly expand term credit in rural\n            areas, provided they have access to longer-term funds and\n            receive appropriate training and Technical Assistance (TA).\n            It is feasible to have vigorous competition among banks,\n            even in poor rural areas. Environmental standards can be\n            introduced even for small sub-borrowers, provided that\n            emphasis is given to education and not just regulation. This\n            is especially important in activities like livestock and\n            aquaculture. Job creation, in relation to investment\n            amounts, is much greater for small subprojects than for\n            larger ones. Beneficiary surveys should be built into credit\n            projects, and should preferably be carried out by or at\n            least with the participation of independent entities."}, "docdt": "2010-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
