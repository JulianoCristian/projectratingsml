Term lending to rural areas was\n            insufficient to lift a large proportion of the rural\n            population out of poverty. Rural Finance Projects financed a\n            wide range of rural investments to 4.45 million families and\n            small enterprises whose net incomes rose by an average of 65\n            percent. Investment lending by twenty five participating\n            financial institutions to private rural entrepreneurs\n            increased fourteen-fold and the volume of lending to the\n            poor and to micro-enterprises jumped 250 percent. The\n            quality and range of financial services improved, and all\n            participating institutions improved their risk and credit\n            management system."}, "docdt": "2011-04-05T07:45:03Z"}
