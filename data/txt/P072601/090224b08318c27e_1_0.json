Because of the\n            small size of farms, agricultural growth needed to be\n            combined with non-farm employment to make a sustained attack\n            on rural poverty. The flow of term lending to the rural\n            areas was insufficient to meet the investment needed to\n            increase output and to lift a large proportion of the rural\n            population out of poverty. The Second Rural Finance Project\n            was implemented between 2003 and 2009 to spur rural\n            investments throughout Vietnam. As a result, the income of\n            the rural population rose by 65 percent and generated an\n            estimated 2.74 million additional jobs. Finally, the project\n            also led to the improvement in financial services and risk\n            and credit management systems."}, "docdt": "2010-09-23T08:37:04Z"}
