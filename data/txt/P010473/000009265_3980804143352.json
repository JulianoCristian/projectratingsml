The World Bank-funded Tuberculosis Control\n            Project used social assessment (SA) as an\n            \"umbrella\" approach to collect and analyze the\n            socioeconomic data needed for project preparation and\n            design; create an innovative strategy for stakeholder\n            involvement in project planning and activities, including a\n            tribal peoples' action plan; and develop appropriate\n            social indicators for the project. The SA found that the\n            stigma associated with TB also prevents patients from\n            seeking treatment, and then from completing it. The SA\n            helped the project team: (a) better understand the major\n            obstacles to patient compliance with treatment regimens; (b)\n            identify the main problems associated with the provision of\n            services by private and public practitioners; and (c)\n            uncover the key hindrances to effective communication\n            between patients and providers. With this information the\n            project team was able to prepare a more focused\n            communications strategy, a new approach to involving private\n            physicians in TB control, and a more appropriate way to\n            measure project effectiveness and outcomes."}, "docdt": "1997-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
