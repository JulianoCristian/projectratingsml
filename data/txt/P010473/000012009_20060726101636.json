The project provides\n            important insights into several aspects of design and\n            implementation, as listed below. State ownership and\n            management capacity are critical for effective\n            implementation of centrally-sponsored programs.\n            Restructuring provided an enhanced role for the state level\n            in supervision and monitoring. After restructuring, the\n            states were also required to develop their State Program\n            Implementation Plans (SPIPs) including setting their own\n            targets. Through these changes the states had a larger role,\n            and were made accountable for the performance of the project\n            in their districts. Furthermore, clear objectives and\n            management guidelines lead to effective program\n            implementation. The field testing of program guidelines, and\n            a requirement that an appraisal be conducted in each\n            district before the start of service delivery in the\n            district, ensured that a minimum standard or \"readiness\n            filters\" were adequately met at program inception.\n            Other lessons address the involvement of the private sector\n            in government health programs; the need for a well developed\n            monitoring criteria, essential for program success; and,\n            planning for program extension, which should also include\n            plans to enhance staff capacity."}, "docdt": "2006-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
