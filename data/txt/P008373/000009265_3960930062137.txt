MEMORANDUM AND RECOMNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Loan to
the Republic of Cyprus for US$30 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The proposed Loan would be on standard IBRD terms with a 15 year maturity
including a five-year grace period, and would help to finance an industrial
restructuring program for the country.
2.          Background.  Cyprus' economic performance has been good over the
past ten years. High growth in output and income has been combined with high
levels of employment and a steadily improvlng record of inflation. Growth in
tourism has been impressive, while industry and agriculture have remained
important contributors to GDP. The long-term sustainability of such performance
is a source of concern, however. Tourism has limited expansion possibilities
and its sustained growth is heavily dependent on external factors. The recent
crisis in the Gulf had an immediate adverse effect on tourism flows into Cyprus.
New strategies are needed for industry and agriculture, given the small size of
the Cypriot market and the diminishing prospects for Cypriot products in the
Middle East. Additional concerns result from the persistence of a growing fiscal
deficit, and a deteriorating current account position.
3.          Many of the difficulties anticipated for the manufacturing sector
result from a legacy of public intervention in the market through protection
and other forms of insulation from competition.   Industry developed under
protective trade barriers, specific subsidies and promotional activities,
restrictive licensing procedures, price and interest rate restrictions and other
forms of distortionary policies. As a result, the long-term development of
activities in terms of physical, human and technological investment was based
on a set of distorted price signals which lacked close linkage to international
prices.
4.          To restore Cyprus' external and internal balances, the Government
has embarked on a significant restructuring program aimed at making the
industrial sector more efficient and internationally competitive.   In this
context, the Government is developing closer ties with Europe, and as a first
step it signed in January 1988 an agreement to proceed to a Customs Union with
the European community (BC); application for full membership was presented in
July 1990. Furthermore, a new comprehensive tax law was recently passed by the
Parliament. Its main features include the introduction of a value added tax,
the reduction of corporate tax, and modifications of individual tax rates to
provide a more equal incidence. The Government has also indicated its intention
to seek non-bank domestic financing of budget deficits, thus deepening the
domestic financial markets. Yet, net foreign financing would be required during
the initial few years to support the adjustment process.
5.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's strategy in Cyprus is
to support the Government's efforts aimed at liberalizing and diversifying the
country's economic base, currently highly dependent on tourism, and at fostering
exports. Specifically, Bank assistance under the proposed Project would support



policy reforms enabling private entrepreneurs to restructure, expand and
diversify their businesses in order to become more competitive. To facilitate
the transition of industry from a highly protective environment to an
internationally competitive regime, there is a need for greater amounts of long-
term investment resources in the private sector. To that end, this Project will
encourage the participation of commercial banks to enhance the efficiency and
competitiveness of the credit delivery system.  The proposed Project would
supplement the limited term resources available to industry and also improve the
quality and range of financial services available to the industrial sector.
6.          Prolect Obiectives.   The Project is an integral part of the
Government's plan to modernize the country's industrial sector to enable it to
compete effectively within the European Community (EC) and elsewhere. 'While
integration with the European market will obviously offer challenging prospects
for Cypriot manufacturers, it will also necessitate profound readjustment of
their production patterns, since several sectors have traditionally enjoyed a
high rate of effective protection. In addition, a growing awareness of the
adverse effects of uncontrolled agricultural and industrial development on the
environment is expected to lead to further adjustment. Finally, the Project will
support a number of reforms in the financial sector, which will be strengthened
to enable it to provide the required support.
7.          Project Description. In line with the above objectives, the proposed
Project would consist of: (a) a policy/institutional development component to
support: (i) policies and programs for restructuring the industrial sector, with
due attention to environmental considerations; (ii) strengthening the regulatory
and supervisory system for increasing the soundness and efficiency of financial
institutions, particularly as regards financial cooperatives (currently not
properly regulated and supervised); and (iii) a program for increasing the
financial autonomy of the Cyprus Development Bank (CDB); (b) an nvestment
coonent (credit facility), to support the working capital and investment needs
of eligible enterprises for restructuring subprojects; and (c) a technical
assistance component to support enterprise restructuring, local industrial and
environmental consulting, quality controls in manufacturing, environmental
protection, and reforms in the financial sector.
8.   The policy measures that the Government intends to carry out are embodied
in a Statement of Policy, which was adopted by the Government on March 21, 1991.
Reforms for the industrial sector reflect the Government's commitment to
developing a dynamic, competitive sector, from the existing highly protected,
inward-oriented production structure; they include removing, in accordance with
the Customs Union Agreement with the EC, all quantitative restrictions,
abolishing import licensing, reducing and rationalizing tariffs, and liberalizing
prices. To enable enterprises to restructure and compete effectively in the EC,
the Government will establish the Consultants Clearinghouse (CCH), which will
undertake, inter alia, company level assessment of competitiveness, and
adjustment requirements, product quality standards and management, and assess
enterprise capacity for pollution control. To facilitate the enforcement of the
recently introduced legislation on water and air pollution from industrial
sources, the Government will assist in the establishment of a specialized agency,
the Environmental Research and Training Institute (ERTI), charged with analyzing



-3-
industrial processes and assessing their environmental implications, assisting
interested industries in their prevention/mitigation, and operating as an apex
institution for mobilizing and promoting environmental consulting capabilities
in Cyprus. Finally, the Government will aim at strengthening and deepening the
financial sector, by: introducing improved regulations and institutional
arrangements for monitoring the activities of cooperative banks, and measures
for strengthening their interdependence; increasing CDB's autonomy and operating
efficiency by opening lts capital to external shareholders and removing current
restrictions to its ability to borrow on financial markets; and designing an
action plan for developing active financial markets in Cyprus.
9.   The credit facility will help to finance the investment and permanent
working capital needs of enterprises undergoing extensive restructuring,
including reorganization, changes in output structure, and increased efficiency
of productive factors. Investments rendered necessary by the more stringent
environmental policies recently introduced by the Government will be eligible
for financing. The technical assistance component will assist in undertaking
competitiveness enhancement and environmental impact studies for enterprises,
introducing quality standards for industrial products, developing the
environmental consulting industry and strengthening environmental auditing and
control mechanisms, and carrying out a study on the development of financial
markets.
10.  Agreed Actions: At negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government
on the following: (a) a program for carrying out reforms in the industrial
sector, pertaining, inter alia, to quantitative restrictions, import licensing,
tariffs, and prices; (b) an action program for enhancing the country's
competitiveness assessment and environmental appraisal capabilities; (c) an
action program for upgrading quality standards, accreditation and testing
facilities; (d) an action program, to be adopted by December 31, 1991, for
strengthening the cooperative banking system, building on important measures
introduced in early 1991; (e) on-lending arrangements, eligibility criteria for
financial intermediaries, beneficiary enterprises and subprojects, subloan
processing and administration, and on-16nding terms and conditions for
subsidiary loans and subloans. This includes agreeing on the foreign currencies
(British pound, German mark, Japanese yen, Swiss franc or U.S. dollar) in which
subloans would be denominated, and on spreads over LIBOR for on-leading to Pns
(iLitially not more than one percent); (f) arrangements for training PBs' staff
in project appraisal and supervision; (g) the procurement, disbursement,
monitoring, accounting, auditing and reporting requirements; and (h) enactment
of an action program to restructure CDB. The Government has endorsed on March
21, 1991 a Statement of Policy satisfactory to the Bank, which was a condition
of Board presentation.   Conditions of Loan effectiveness are:   (a) the
establishment of CCH and the signing of an administration agreement satisfactory
to the Bank between the Government and the CCH, for executing the competitiveness
enhancement subcomponent; and (b) the signing of a participation agreement
between the Government and at least one bank. Conditlons of disbursement are:
(a) for the ERTI component: the signing of an administration agreement between
the CDB and ERTI for executing the environmental assessment and auditing
subcomponent; and (b) for each participating bank: the signing of a participation



agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, between the
Government and the concerned bank.
11.         Progect Benefits and Risks. The Project fosters a program of actions
aimed at facilitating the restructuring and modernizing of the manufacturing
sector in Cyprus, with a view to enhance its competitiveness in European and
other international markets. Support is also being provided to assist in the
implementation of the new environmental standards. Finally, a number of actions
are aimed at the financial sector, to ensure that it is in a better position to
provide the required support to the adjustment process.
12.         Three main risks may have to be faced in the context of the proposed
program. First, the Government may face some resistance to its efforts in
fostering industrial liberalization, particularly when the program starts having
its full effect on inefficient enterprises. To alleviate this, the Government
is willing to commit substantial technical and financial assistance to
restructuring enterprises, as reflected in the design of the Project. Second,
the Government could run into difficulties in its attempt to restructure the
cooperative banking system.   To minimize this risk, substantial technical
preparation has already been undertaken, with a view to establishing a consensus
basis among concerned parties. The third risk is that credit demand could be
insufficient, leading to a slow disbursement of the credit facility. Regarding
this risk, the credit component, which will be onlent on terms competitive with
other financial sources, is estimated to amount to only 4X of the current
financing needs of the manufacturing sector, needs which should be substantially
increased by the restructuring process. The expected involvement of several PBs
would be an additional way to ensure a broad reach for the Bank's funds.
13.         RecomendatIon. I am satisfied that the proposed Loan complies with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed Loan.
