satisfactory,\n            sustainability is highly likely, and the institutional\n            development impact is substantial. However, and in contrast\n            to the satisfactory performance of the Borrower, the Bank\n            performance is unsatisfactory, on the grounds that project\n            design, with too many unrelated sub-components, led to\n            unsustainable supervision costs, and, the process to\n            restructure the project, and cancel credit lines, should\n            have been taken much earlier. Lessons suggest that project\n            design, and preparation be simple, to avoid multiple\n            objectives requiring substantial supervision resources, and,\n            long implementation periods impose high costs in terms of\n            Government oversight, potentially reducing flexibility.\n            Credit lines design should consider a banking environment\n            with no distortions, or at least only few distortions, in\n            the credit markets. Interest rate ceilings existed in Cyprus\n            at the time the Bank extended the credit line, and it\n            negatively affected credit demand. Furthermore, under\n            intense restructuring of the enterprise sector, private\n            financing needs become difficult to assess, thus it would be\n            preferable to initiate smaller credit lines to be tested,\n            and perfected in time, to form a solid base in assessing the\n            real demand. Technical assistance should be clearly defined,\n            not financed by the Bank if grant funds are available, and,\n            should be responsive to client needs."}, "docdt": "2000-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
