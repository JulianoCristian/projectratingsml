                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         To improve the implementation performance, the following decisions were agreed: (i) continue to monitor closely the procurement processing to reduce the current excessive
                         timeframe and steps involved; (iii) project teams (Bank and government) to work closely to ensure that the strategic activities will achieve their objectives.
