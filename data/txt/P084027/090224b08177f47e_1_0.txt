                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is an update to reflect the project implementation progress following the last implementation support mission from September 25 to October 5 2012.

                         Following the implementation of priority actions identified during the Mid-term Review in October 2010 and supervision missions in July 2011 and November 2011, the project is
                         progressing satisfactorily toward achieving its development objectives. Project implementation has gradually improved by focusing on fewer and more strategic activities and through
                         improved project management by key counterpart during this period. Reflecting this improvement, disbursements reached 68% in October 2012 .

                         At the strategic level, the project has contributed to strengthen: (i) the budget support mechanism and financial transfer to local governments through the support to the creation of the
                         FPDCT (Permanent Development Fund for Local Governments) and support to preparation of municipal contracts and implementation (ii) the capacities of urban communes to
                         deliver services (financial, administrative, organizational).

                         The project has implemented most of the activities planned for 2012. The main achievements of the project include (i) the ongoing completion of the urban master plan (SDAU)
                         studies for 12 selected cities; (ii) significant capacity strengthening at the municipal level with respect to mainstreaming of urban planning and municipal management mechanisms in
                         13 provincial capitals through development of municipal audits, acquisition of goods, and access to training; (iii) improvement of municipal financial management through the
                         development and dissemination of financial guidelines, as well as training for the municipal staff in 49 cities; (iii) the development of a software that integrates national and local
                         finances software and improves municipal financial management at the central government level; and training for staff in the 13 provincial capitals; (iv) consolidation of the national
                         street addressing program and roll out of the program in 6 municipalities; (v) significant increase in the share of the municipal budget allocated to infrastructure investments and
                         maintenance far exceeding the original project target values (from average 17% in 2005 to average 46% in 2010 for the six cities, with individual cities substantially exceeding
                         targets); (vi) significant increase in own source revenue collection exceeding the original target values (on average a 79% increase in own source revenue collected between 2005 to
                         2010 on average for the six cities, with individual cities substantially exceeding targets); and (vii) capacity strengthening at the central level aiming at supporting the municipalities
                         through comprehensive support provided to the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralization (MATD), Ministry of Finance and Budget (MFB), Ministry of Housing and
                         Urban Planning (MHU) and the Association of Municipalities of Burkina Faso (AMBF), including goods and training.

                         Beyond the immediate project objectives, the implemented activities have significantly impacted the Burkina decentralization environment by (i) structuring the national mechanism of
                         investment resources transfer toward local governments, through the FPDCT; and (ii) strengthening city management systems through the setting up of an urban information system,
                         solid waste management strategy, the near master plans, and a the national social housing policy.

                         A detailed plan for completion of the remaining activities before project closure on January 31 2013 was agreed upon during the mission.
