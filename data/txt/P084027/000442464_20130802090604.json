Urban\n            Capacity Building Project for Burkina Faso were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: linking\n            capacity building and budget support processes to provide\n            financing for local investment and enhance reforms requires\n            strong selectivity in areas of intervention and a clear\n            institutional framework for implementation. Mainstreaming\n            project management responsibility in government entities\n            with the support of a small coordination team may be a\n            positive innovation, but requires consistent and rigorous\n            implementation support. Readiness of activities,\n            implementing stakeholders, and substantial Bank support in\n            initial stages of implementation is critical for effective\n            implementation projects with complex institutional\n            arrangements. Advancing policy dialogue and reforms through\n            combination of budget support and standalone operations can\n            be effective in achieving reform gains. Designing and\n            implementing a stand-alone capacity building project\n            requires clear incentives, goals, and institutional\n            frameworks. The application of technical assistance loans\n            may be better justified and manageable in a short to medium\n            term policy reform area with tangible and timely outputs."}, "docdt": "2013-07-30T00:00:00Z"}
