                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is an update to reflect the project implementation progress following the last implementation support mission in October 2011. Following the implementation of priority actions
                         identified during the Mid-term Review in October 2010 and supervision missions in July 2011 and November 2011, the project is progressing satisfactorily toward achieving its
                         development objectives. Project implementation had gradually improved by focusing on fewer and more strategic activities and through improved project management by key
                         counterpart during this period. Reflecting this improvement, disbursement levels have improved from 40.7% in April 2011 to 59.83% in December 2011. It is nevertheless vital to
                         continue this steady trajectory of progress so that additional support for urban local governments can be considered by IDA at a later time.

                         The project has implemented most of the activities planned for 2011.Key elements of progress during the period of this ISR are noted here. As of October 2011, the share of the
                         municipal budget devoted to the investment and infrastructure maintenance in the 6 project municipalities have reached the targeted levels and in some cases they have even
                         exceeded by 25%. Significant progress has been achieved with respect to updating the municipal property registers integrated with street addressing, which is now 90% completed.

                         These are key for improving the municipal own revenues collection. Also, the implementation of the municipal own revenues collection has reached the operational phase in
                         September 2011 — as of December 2011, the first tax revenue collection is expected to start because of the significant progress of this component. One of the strategic actions of the
                         project is the financing of the development of urban master plans for 12 cities. The selected consultants are currently performing the assignments in the respective cities.
