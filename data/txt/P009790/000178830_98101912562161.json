Government\n            to redress the imbalance between domestic demand for and\n            supply of petroleum products, and to improve energy\n            efficiency in the sector. Its main components include: (a)\n            installation at four refineries of additional capacity and\n            secondary processing facilities to convert fuel oil into\n            higher-value products; (b) additions to petroleum tankage\n            and distribution facilities; (c) facilities to reduce energy\n            requirements; and (d) pollution control facilities. The\n            project faces only limited risks in that it involves\n            primarily the expansion and rationalization of existing\n            facilities, using commercially proven technology."}, "docdt": "1982-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
