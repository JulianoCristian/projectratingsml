It will undergo major\n            construction, alignment, and upgrading. During the designing\n            period, the design of sewage treatment in stations and\n            service areas should guarantee the life sewage and\n            industrial wastewater within disposal standard. The highway\n            should avoid running through residential districts in\n            cities/towns, and the alignment should be away from schools\n            and hospitals. The highway should occupy as little\n            farmlands, grasslands, and woods as possible. Trees removed\n            will be replanted. During construction, sewage from the\n            construction camps can be led into available drainage\n            network. Wastewater with oil should be collected and stored\n            in a pond for eventual drying up. Oil or chemical pollutants\n            and waste materials will be disposed of in accordance with\n            regulations. Water should be sprayed to avoid dust. The new\n            construction and traffic access roads should be paved with\n            asphalt. Noise impacts will be reduced by locating\n            constructions far away from protected areas. No borrow pits\n            are allowed in the wind gap and farmlands. Sites should be\n            restored after construction. During operation, enclosing\n            walls will be built to reduce noise levels. Live sewage\n            water can be used for landscaping purpose following treatment."}, "docdt": "2002-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
