To meet its development\n            objective, the components will: 1) include the construction\n            of a four lane expressway, and additional two lanes in the\n            Kuitun-SailimuHu Highway, as well as upgrading the existing\n            two lane roads to Class 1 (and/or Class 2) standard,\n            combining new, and existing alignments. An eighty percent of\n            the KuiSai highway will use the existing alignment, while\n            new alignments will mostly serve as bypasses to urbanized\n            areas in Wusu, and Jinghe; 2) connect primary local roads,\n            and townships to the provincial, and national highway\n            system, to ensure access to rural areas, and poor counties.\n            The component will entail a four-year rehabilitation\n            program, implemented under a programmatic approach; and, 3)\n            strengthen institutional capacity, by providing training\n            assistance, and specialized equipment, to address sector\n            issues, key in preparing future sector reforms. This\n            includes traffic safety, highway toll management, road\n            management and maintenance, and transport facilitation."}, "docdt": "2002-08-12T00:00:00Z"}
