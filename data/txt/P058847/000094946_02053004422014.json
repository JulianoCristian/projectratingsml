Distinctive\n            characteristics identify language; culture; economic\n            activities and reliance on subsistence modes of production;\n            the use of customary and cultural institutions; attachment\n            to ancestral territory, or natural resources, i.e., long\n            established, traditional herd migration routes. Following\n            consultations, concerns included roadway and traffic safety,\n            access for pedestrians and non-motorized traffic, protection\n            of ecologically fragile pastures, and protection of cultural\n            heritage sites. Design, and implementation arrangements will\n            take these concerns into consideration. The IPP took also\n            into consideration China's legal framework,\n            particularly the legislation on minority nationality\n            regions, administrative regulation in minority nationality\n            townships, and the law on villager committee organization.\n            Issues and measures relating to land acquisition, and lost\n            assets; environmental protection; highway safety; and,\n            livestock access are defined in the institutional, and\n            project arrangements, based on consultations with\n            minorities, while monitoring and grievance mechanisms will\n            be contained in the environmental assessment, and\n            resettlement action plan."}, "docdt": "2002-05-31T16:43:02Z"}
