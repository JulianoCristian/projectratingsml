3. Appendix 1, Cultural Relics, is newly added.
An Investigation Report on Distribution and Protection of Cultural Relics during
Construction Along Kuisai Highway Project
For the sake of construction of Kuitun-Sailimu Lake Highway Project by
the PEO of Xinjiang High-grade Highway Construction Authority, we, the
Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology of Xinjiang made survey on
distribution of cultural relics in the highway corridor. We have reviewed the
"General Survey of C'ultural Relics" and have made the site visits. We can
identify that there are no cultural relics in the right-of-way, because the
Highway runs basically along the existing National Road 312 with few
rehabilitated sections. The cultural relics out of the right-of-way shall be
protected during conslruction.
If any cultural relics are accidentally found during construction, the
construction units are supposed to protect the site, timely report to the
cultural relics departrrment and keep the relics in safety according to "Cultural
Relics Protection Law of P. R. China".

Statements of Cultural Relics for EIA of Xinjiang Highway Project III
1. After being authorized by Xinjiang High-grade Highway Construction Authority, the
Institution of Cultural Relics and Archaeology of Xinjiang made site visit on cultural
relics distribution along the whole line of Kuitun-Sailimu Lake Highway during
February 5  7, 2002 (3 days). The method is to study the survey materials in the past
years and the plan-out of Kuitun-Sailimu Lake Highway, then to find out the
distribution of the cultural relics near the Highway, and finally to check on site one
by one so as to confirm whether or not relics is impacted and if construction is
influenced. One site survey was made for the Project.
2. The major contents oi the survey: all the heritage and historical remains that can be
seen with eyes.
3. The objective of the survey on cultural relics is to make further confirmation if there
are any valuable cultural relics. It is the Institution of Cultural Relics and
Archaeology of Xinjiang who made the General Survey on Cultural Relics.
4. There are six spots to be surveyed, which are not related to the Project. The details of
the 6 spots are shown in the following table.



No.       Location                Item            Distance to Side of
Right-of-way

2        K342+140            Ancient Tomb               30
3       K475+000             Ancient Tomb               40
4        K268+100       Soil heap, not cultural tomb    92
5       K301+200             Ancient Tomb               45
6       K415+000             Ancient Tomb               55
5. Two ancient tombs are close to the Project, which are respectively at K475 and
K342+140. The distances outside the right-of-way to the two tombs are 40m and
30m. The distance can guarantee normal construction without any damage to ancient
tombs.
6. The procedure that the Chinese National Laws on Cultural Relics is stipulated that
survey on cultural relics will be made prior to construction of the projects. If the
cultural relics have any influence on construction, they should be excavated. If they
will not produce any impacts and are close to construction sites, the relics should be
protected during construction. If they are far away from construction sites and
without any impacts on construction, construction can continue. After the survey on
Kuitun-Sailimu Lake Highway, no relics that influences the Project are found. The
two relics that are close to the Highway will be well protected under the inonitoring
of supervision engineer and the local cultural relics department. Any relics found
during construction will be reported in time to the cultural relics management
departments.
The survey procedures of cultural relics on Kuitun-Sailimu Lake Highway comply
with the relevant stipulation of Chinese National Laws on Cultural Relics.

Environmental Action Plan of Local Road Rehabilitation Program (LRRP)
VII. Policy Framework af EAP for the Future 7 Sub-projects
The background, environment, sensitive spots and potential impacts in the 7 future sub-projects
are similar to the 5 sub-projects to be implemented soon. Accordingly, the determination of the
sensitive spots will focus on schools, hospitals and residential areas. The screening of potential
impacts will be the same as the ones for the first 5 sub-projects, including land resources,
ecological environment, water pollution, noise pollution, air pollution, traffic safety, and cultural
relics. Mitigation measures for environmental protection for the future 7 sub-projects are listed in
the Table 7-1.
With experiences of the 5 sub-projects, we have decided to invite experts of environmental
protection in the design phase of the 7 future sub-projects for better design to make more
outcomes in respect of environmental protection.
With survey information, we have confirmed that there is no natural protective zone in the areas.
Please refer to Fig. 1-1. In addition, all the 7 future sub-projects are to upgrade the existing roads
without any new roads. There is no requirement of land acquisition. Accordingly, there will be
made no further TEE for the future 7 sub-projects, and only the EAPs will be developed for each
sub-project based on this policy framework.
