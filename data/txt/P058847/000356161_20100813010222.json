satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            during project implementation, Xinjiang Communications\n            Department (XCD) increased its funding for road maintenance,\n            and introduced some improvement in management. The condition\n            of Xinjiang's road network at the end of the project\n            showed to be significant better than at the start. However,\n            during the same period, XCD, with its own funds, carried out\n            a substantial program of improvements of the Xinjiang's\n            road network, which likely had a significant impact on the\n            condition of the network. XCD sought to maximize the impact\n            of the training by requiring trainees to evaluate the\n            various training sessions and by disseminating inside the\n            agency the knowledge received by the trainees. Past\n            experience has shown that a good training mix should include\n            both domestic and foreign training. Designers generally pay\n            less attention to the design of local roads, limiting their\n            efforts to a sketchy design much less accurate than the one\n            of the expressway, thinking these local roads are less\n            important. Experience showed that could lead to major\n            problems at implementation stage, particularly for the roads\n            in difficult topography and geology. A recurrent problem in\n            the four-lane sections of Kuitun-Sailimuhu Highway (KSH)\n            road is the dangerous crossing at at-grade intersections."}, "docdt": "2010-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
