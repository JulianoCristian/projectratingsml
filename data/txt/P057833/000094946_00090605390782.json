standards, enforcing pilot programs\n            towards cleaner technologies, as well as implementing air\n            quality monitoring and evaluation. Project components\n            include: The first component includes enforcement of\n            emissions regulations for in-use vehicles, development of\n            vehicular emissions and fuel standards, lubricant\n            regulations, and pilots for vehicular pollution control.\n            Control options will be discussed and developed with vehicle\n            manufacturers to ease implementation. It should include\n            improved quality of lube oil, pumpless lubrication, and\n            regular engine maintenance. Alternative vehicular fuels such\n            as compressed natural gas will be considered, and liquefied\n            petroleum gas and diesel fuel emissions will be reduced,\n            through enforcement of improved vehicular standards. A\n            public awareness campaign will be conducted to raise the\n            level of information and establish an environmental\n            education program. The second component, essential air\n            quality information and evaluation of pilot activities will\n            include air quality monitoring in Dhaka, air quality\n            laboratory upgrade, and four studies examining key issues\n            affecting public health. The component includes provision of\n            technical assistance, equipment supply, training, and the\n            development of policies and strategies for quality assurance."}, "docdt": "2000-07-25T00:00:00Z"}
