MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO ROMANIA
FOR A TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.     The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan of
US$120.0 million equivalent to P.omania is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be on standard I8RD terms with a ;7-year term, including a
five-year grace period and would help finance improvezent of the national road
network and urgently needed equipment for maintenance of railway operations.
2.     Background.  Since 1990, the Government of Romania has formulated and
started implementation of a reform program towards an efficient market
economy. A new legal and institutional framework has been established, and
the policy framework has been substantially liberalized. Over 360,000 new
private firms were registered by the end of 1992, of which about 30% in
manufacturing and trade, and about 78% of these have already opened for
business absorbing over 600,000 employees. A recent survey of 2,500 private
firms identified the condition of infrastructure as one of the most impo-tant
constraints for their development. An efficient transport system and
particularly improved roads and road transport will be essential to support
the structural reforms of the economy and the emerging private firms.
3.     Road density, with regard to both population and land area, is the
lowest among Central and East European (CBS) countries. This is not
surprising, since roads received only 9% of the transport sector investments
in the 1970. and less than 5% in the 1980s. As a result, rehabilitation
including strengthentng of roads has lagged behind the needs. The network
totals 73,000 km of which 20% are national roads carrying 60% of the road
traffic. Road traffic stagnated in the 1980. as it was suppressed by
regulations. In the last two years, private car traffic increased rapidly and
truck traffic was affected much less than rail traffic by the economic
downturn. Road transport is expected to grow faster than the other modes in a
market oriented economy and its share of land transport will increase at the
expense of the rail share. It is estimated that about 5,000 km, or one-third
of the national road network requires some form of strengthening to avoid
failure. The project would improve about 1,100 km of these roads.
4         4.      As in other centrally planned economies, Romania's transport sector
has been heavily rail oriented. The rail network of 11,000 km is 36%
electrified and 26% double tracked. Although the rail share decreased
gradually over the last 30 years, in 1989, rail still accounted for almost 70%
of freight and 40% of passenger traffic. Rail freight had reached 300 million
tons and 80 billion t-km in 1989, but has since fallen to le  than 150
million tons or half its late 1980s level. Passenger rail traffic held off
better, declining only 30% since 1989.
5.     In 1990 and 1991, major changes took place in the transport
instituti2ns. The former Ministry of Transport and Public Works was split
into two separate Ministries. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) was reorganized
to concentrate on policy making and regulation functions rather than being an



-2-
operator of transport means. The railways, highways and porto became
autonomous units or "Regie Autonomes" (RA), while road transport departments,
construction departments and design or research institutes became respectively
transport companies, contractors and consultants commercial companies (CC).
The shares of these CC are still owned 100% by the state, but with the
intention of privatization.
6.     In past decades, the transport sector received only 10% of total
investments, which is low in comparison with market economies at a similar
stage of development. In addition, these funds emphasized large scale
projects and neglected to rehabilitate and modernize existing transport
systems. The Government of Romania (GOR) recognizes that the transport sector
requires a major transformation and has an important role to play in the
economic reform process, and has already taken steps to rationalize
investments and increase tre market orientation of the transport sector e.g.
increasing tariffs, setting fuel prices on the basis of world market prices,
stopping or slowing uneconomic investments (work has stopped on the Bucharest
metro and on the Bucharest-Danube Canal and only protection work is proceeding
in Constanza port), beginning the commercialization of transport services and
starting a system of road user charges with the introduction of fuel taxes.
With the help of Bank financed consultants, a more complete system of road
user charges will be developed and introduced according to an agreed
timetable. The GOR requires, and actively seeks, outside assistance in
implementing all aspects of its economic and sector reform program.
7.     Rationale  _or Bank involvement.   The proposed project is justified
because: a) the ongoing macro economic and structural reforms must be
accompanied by the physical reconstruction of critical assets; b) given the
deteriorated condition of the infrastructure, there is an urgent need to make
up for years of deferred maintenance, only possible with external support;
c) project components have high economic returns; and d) project components
support enterprise reform, private sector promotion and economic pricing
wherever applicable. In addition, the Government has requested the Bank to
coordinate the activities of other donors in the transport sector. The
project has been prepared and appraised jointly with EBRT) and ZIB who are
cofinanciers.
8.     The Bank has begun the process of assisting the reform of the
Transport Sector through studies in the railway, road and port subsectors.
Consultants have started work on a railway restructuring study and a road user
charges study financed under the Technical Assistance and Critical Imports
(TACI) project (LN 3363-RO). A port master plan study for Constanza, financed
by the Netherlands, started in March 1992. However, these studies only begin
our familiarization effort in the sector. Real institutional reform will
require continuous, long term, technical assistance -- only possible when
combined with investment lending. The proposed project would be the Bank's
first loan in the sector since lending to Romania has resumed and would
finance primarily highway rehabilitation and maintenance with a small railway
component. Two transport loans made in 1980 and 1981 were successfully
completed. Economic returns are lower than expected, following the downturn
in the economy since 1990, but all components remain justified. The



-3-
Government is anxious to cooperate fully with the Bank in designing and
implementing new projects. We will continue monitoring implementation of the
railway and port subsector studies under the TACI project. Subsequent lending
may also be warranted in these subsectors upon completion of the studies.
9.     Project Obiectives.  The objectives of the project are to:
(a) increase efficiency of the sector and accommodate expected changes in
transport demand by improving th} condition of the road network; (b) promote
the selection of transport investments on the basis of economic criteria;
(c) improve fiscal performance and reduce the uneconomic use of transport and
energy by implementing a cost-based system of road user charges; (d) develop
the execution of road works by contract; (e) build on transport policy
initiatives under the TACI project particularly with regard to investment
selection and restructuring of the railways; and (f) support the economic
reform program and encourage social stability by financing geographically
dispersed efficient employment generation, including in newly privatizing
contracting companies to the extent feasible. The civil works to be financed
by the project will be done by contract. Under competitive bidding, this will
provide an opportunity for local contractors to develop, as well as the
creation of jobs in various parts of the country. A program to gradually
shift maintenance work from force account to contract has been agreed with the
National Road Administration (NRA). The possibility of equipment leasing is
being explored with the private sector and with cofinancing by EBRD. The
project would assist NRA in developing better practices for managing its
equipment pool including the setting up of a charge back system. Supervision
of the project by consultants will also promote the devolution of such tasks
to the private sector and provide work for the emerging consultants, industry.
10.    Proiect Descriotion.  The proposed project includes (a) re bilitation
of some 1, 100 km of national roads; (b) improvement of border posts;
(c) material and equipment for road safety, road maintenance, vehicle
inspection and training; (d) technical assistance and training for the road
subsector; and (e) urgently needed track maintenance and data processing
equipment, spare parts and training for the railways. Road sections to be
rehabilitated have daily traffic ranging from 2,000 to 10,000 vehicles per day
with the lowest levels on some sections near the country's borders. For the
rehabilitation program, 13,000 km of national roads have been analyzed in
terms of physical characteristics and traffic level. All sections retained
for the project are of high priority and have rates of return greater than
20%.
11.    The total cost of the project is estimated at US$405.0 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$271 million (67%). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Romania are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report no. 11441-RO dated March 5, 1993 is
being distributed separately.



-4-
12.    Implementation and Procurement.  The project will be implemented by
the NRA, the Romanian Automobile Registrar (RAR) and the National Railway
Company of Romania (SNCFR). The NRA has established a Project Management Unit
(PMU) to liaise with the Bank on all matters relating to project
implmentation and supervision. SNCFR has established a project management
team for its component and the head of the team will be a member of the PMU.
Procurement proved to be a problem in Bank financed projects in the 1980s.
However, the new Government is fully committed to follow Bank rules and
acceptable standard documents have already been developed for the procurement
of goods under the TACI loan. Bidding documents for the civil works using the
Bank's sample bidding documents have been agreed with NRA. The implementation
of a revised road user charges system and the annual reviews with Government
of total road expenditures to ascertain that priority continues to be given to
maintenance ensures the sustainability of the project and particularly that
the standards and quality of the national road network will be maintained.
13.    Agreed Actions.  There is a convergence of objectives and strategy
between the Ministries of Economy and Finance and of Transport and the Bank
and other donors. This reflects the great urgency of needs and consensus on
means to meet them. There are no outstanding policy issues. At negotiations,
GOR confirmed that, given the difficult budget situation, the Bank will, each
year starting in 1993, review with the authoritieo total road expenditures for
the following year, and that new road investments and/or credit guarantees for
s-uch investments would only proceed after acceptable economic and financial
feasibility studies have been performed. The Government also confirmed its
agreement to implements a) a revised road user charges system upon completion,
in mid 1993, of the study financed under the TACI Project; b) a system of axle
load control according to an agreed action plan; c) a time phased plan for
shifting eelected maintenance activities from force account to contract;
d) introducing better management practices including a charge back system for
NRA's equipment pool; and e) a plan to improve road safety. Regarding
railways, agreement exists under the TACI project that the restructuring study
would address the respective obligations and responsibilities of the
Government and the railways for railway operations and define the future role
of the railways in the transport sector, includings (a) the tariff policy
(including unprofitable social services and related subsidies); (b) investment
strategy; (c) substantially broadened management autonomy; and (d) stafftng
requirements for a restructured railway. Discussions on restructuring will be
pursued in this context while this project will finance ursnt high priority
items for track maintenance and data processing essential under any
restructuring scenario.
14.    3_viroumental Imaact. The project has been classified as "B" for the
purpose of O.D. 4.01. Most works will consist of improvement to existing
roads, therefore the environmental impact of the project will be limited.
Also, the bidding documents and contracts will ensure that contractors will
take adequate measures, particularly for waste disposal, sanitary conditions
of worker camps, landscape protection against erosion (quarries) and emissions
of their plants and equipment, to mitigate the impact during construction.



15.    Benefits.  The project is expected to play an important role in
accommodating the economic reorientation of transport demand to road transport
and beginning restructuring the railways accordinglq. The economic rates of
return, astimated on the basis of reduced vehicle ope-ating and maintenance
costs, range from 23 to 66% for roads tc be rehabilitated and from 22 to 29%
for railways components on the basis of reduced operating costs and improved
safety.
16.    Risks.  Project risks are low.  The GOR, MOT and NR4 have expressed
strong interest in the project, and it is expected to proceed even in the
event of political changes. The main risk is that the GOR would not have
sufficient counterpart funds, or would not be able to continue with a
satisfactory road maintenance/rehabilitation program following the completion
of the project. However, the local component of US$125 million would be
affordable. It would amount annually, over the project implementation period,
to about one third of total highway expenditures budgeted for 1992.
17.    Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
