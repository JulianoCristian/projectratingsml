"The objectives of this project are to:\n            (a) increase efficiency of the transport sector and\n            accommodate expected changes in transport demand by\n            improving the condition of the road network; (b) promote the\n            selection of transport investments on the basis of economic\n            criteria; (c) improve fiscal performance and reduce the\n            wasteful use of transport and energy by implementing a\n            cost-based system of road user charges; (d) develop the\n            execution of road works by contract; (e) build on transport\n            policy initiatives under the Technical Assistance and\n            Critical Imports Loan (TACI) project particularly with\n            regard to investment selection and restructuring of the\n            railways; and (f) support the economic reform program and\n            encourage social stability by financing geographically\n            dispersed efficient employment generation, including newly\n            privatizing contracting companies to the extent possible.\n            The project also includes; (i) rehabilitation of some 1,100\n            kilometers of national roads; (ii) improvement of border\n            posts; (iii) material and equipment for road safety, road\n            maintenance, vehicle inspection and training; (iv) technical\n            assistance and training for the road subsector; and (v)\n            urgently needed track maintenance and data processing\n            equipment, spare parts and training for the railways."},
