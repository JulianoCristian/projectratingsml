Two key lessons\n            were learned. A) Particular attention should be given to the\n            quality and adequacy of detailed design with as little time\n            delay as possible between design and the execution of works.\n            B) A contract price adjustment formula which takes into\n            account actual changes in the underlying parameters and\n            which is agreed by all the institutions which have a say in\n            this matter, is important for effective contract administration."}, "docdt": "1999-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
