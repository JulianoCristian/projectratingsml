These were some of the lessons learned:\n            1) With Government support and advice about where the\n            opportunities are for feasible reform, a Bank project can\n            support profound change. Even with strong preparation and\n            good design, this project required the active and energetic\n            intervention of ministers, whose commitment was strengthened\n            by the fact that they were overseeing the success of their\n            own initiative. 2) Perceived fairness of distribution\n            provides strong support for the sustainability of a land\n            distribution program. The methodology used to distribute\n            farmland allocated parcels by lottery. This approach assured\n            that those who designed the parcel division would seek\n            evenness in value, not knowing which parcel they themselves\n            might receive. 3) A key to success of rural credit\n            initiatives is whether the project team correctly identifies\n            the issues faced by farmers. An over-lengthy credit\n            application, the need to travel to the capital for an\n            application, inconveniently timed repayments, the likelihood\n            that market profits will be robbed on the road - all these\n            and a host of other micro-issues affect success. Unraveling\n            of these by listening to the client and analyzing rural\n            incentives can take a rural credit initiative from apparent\n            failure to success. 4) Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)\n            are not necessarily well-prepared to focus on participatory\n            work and listen to the voices of the poor. The NGO hired for\n            community development was not specifically instructed to\n            achieve economic gain for the poorest members of the\n            community. In short, the NGO behaved as a rational economic\n            actor meeting its terms of reference (TORs) and achieving\n            payment and a growth in salable experience. Perhaps no more\n            should have been expected, and the TOR should have been\n            written accordingly. 5) The transaction costs of rural\n            credit are high. These costs are sometimes concealed by the\n            structure of donor or government-sponsored initiatives.\n            However, they must not be underestimated if work toward\n            sustainable rural credit is undertaken."}, "docdt": "2004-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
