This\n            objective will be achieved by providing: (1) essential\n            support services necessary to sustain privatized agriculture\n            at the raion and farm levels.  These are: land registration,\n            farm information and advisory services, credit services, and\n            rehabilitation of critical irrigation and drainage\n            infrastructure; (2) an enabling environment which will build\n            linkages between key institutions, viz., the Ministry of\n            Agriculture, the State Land Committee, the State Irrigation\n            Committee, Agrarian Reform Commissions and agricultural\n            banking institutions; and (3) a community based social\n            services and formation of village groups in support of land\n            privatization and farm restructuring.  The project will\n            consist of four components to be implemented over a period\n            of five years.  These are: (1) farm privatization support\n            services at the national level and in the raions; (2)\n            rehabilitation of the main irrigation water supply and\n            drainage works; and (3) a community development program; and\n            (4) project management and implementation."}, "docdt": "1996-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
