roads and other\n            selected roads and bridges through the reconstruction,\n            rehabilitation or periodic maintenance of the affected\n            sections. It includes: (i) reconstruction and, in a few\n            cases, widening of about 600 km of badly deteriorated main\n            paved highways; (ii) periodic maintenance of about 1,400 km\n            of selected sections of main roads; (iii) construction or\n            rehabilitation of about 85 highway bridges; and (iv)\n            purchase of road maintenance vehicles and other equipment.\n            The project would also include consulting services to help\n            the Government coordinate and supervise the project works,\n            to strengthen its planning and management systems for road\n            and bridge rehabilitation and maintenance, and to prepare\n            preinvestment studies and an analysis of transport sector issues."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
