Following are some of\n            the lessons learned: The economic returns from such\n            replication in BiH could be considerable, multiplying the\n            economic returns to date by several times. Trade\n            facilitation is always a multi-sectoral and multi-agency\n            activity. Customs control is expected to become more\n            effective and efficient under streamlined procedures, based\n            on selectivity and risk analysis. Further cooperation and\n            commitment from government agencies, especially in the area\n            of updating data in website are essential to make the\n            regional website sustainable and successful. It is important\n            to continue the modernization of procedures at all border\n            stations using as much as possible the rules and\n            recommendations of the revised Convention on the\n            simplification and harmonization of Customs procedures.\n            While constructing border crossing facilities, innovative\n            designs that allow future conversion into logistic centers,\n            warehouses, etc, must be encouraged. The long lines of\n            vehicles waiting to be processed at border crossing points\n            are symptomatic of the need for trade facilitation. Building\n            a tradition of inter-agency communication and information\n            sharing as well as building the mechanisms on which such\n            communication can be based, needs a high-level government\n            commitment and ideally a champion. Cumbersome visa\n            procedures and requirements for professional drivers are\n            slowing down especially road freight transport."}, "docdt": "2006-03-22T00:00:00Z"}
