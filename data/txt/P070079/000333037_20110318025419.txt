      IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.

About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes: first, to
ensure the integrity of the Banks self-evaluationprocess and to verify that the Banks work is producing the expected results,
and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the dissemination of lessons drawn from
experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of the Banks lending operations through field
work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are
relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested
assessments; and those that are likely to generate important lessons.
     To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other
in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as relevant.
The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is
sent to the Banks Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the
public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
      IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending
instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project
ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is available on
the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance of
objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with
the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives.
Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account
their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher
than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is
not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High Significant,
Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Petformance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation and
supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operation of supported activities after loankredit closing, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The
rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency or
agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and implementing
agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface
The World Bank's Southeastern Europe Trade and Transport Facilitation Program (hereafter, the
TTFSE or the Program) was a $120 million regional initiative covering projects for eight countries
(Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Romania, and Serbia)
between 2000 and 2007. The main objectives were to reduce non-tariff costs of trade and transport,
and reduce smuggling and corruption at border crossings. The Program was elaborated in the
context of international efforts to help restore the economic linkages among these countries, most
of which had been part of a common economic space until the events of the early 1990s.

This report is an assessment by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of the Program as a
whole, based on an evaluation of the three projects more recently completed (Bosnia-
Herzegovina, Moldova, Serbia), as well as on an earlier 2005 IEG study of the first three TTFSE
projects (Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania-hereafter, "the case study"), a documentary review of
all eight projects--including the Project Appraisal Documents, Implementation Completion and
Results Reports, and other relevant documents--and discussions with the relevant Bank staff and
managers, in Washington and in the field. As per IEG guidelines, the assessment takes into
account the most recent information relevant to the Program objectives and outcomes. The
assessment of the Program is in the main text, and the detailed evaluation of the three more
recently-completed projects in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Moldova, and Serbia are in Annexes A, By
and Cyrespectively.

For the evaluation of the three projects, an IEG mission visited Bosnia-Herzegovina, Moldova
and Serbia in November 2009, including extensive in-country travel to border customs posts, and
met with about 70 interlocutors, including government officials, customs officers, private sector
representatives, traders, truck drivers, and journalists. IEG gratefully acknowledges the enabling
environment and invaluable practical support provided by the World Bank offices in Belgrade,
Sarajevo and Chisinau.

The draft report was sent to the appropriate government entities and no comments were received.

Summary

The World Bank?s Southeastern Europe Trade and Transport Facilitation Program (TTFSE or the
Program) was a regional initiative covering projects for eight countries (Albania, Bosnia-
Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Romania, and Serbia) between 2000 and
2007, in the context of international initiatives to help restore the economic linkages among these
countries and bring them closer to the European Union. The two interrelated objectives were to:
(i) reduce non-tariff costs of trade and transport; and (ii) reduce smuggling and corruption. This
report assesses the Program as a whole, based in part on an evaluation of the three projects more
recently completed (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Moldova, Serbia) and in part on other evidence from
the other five projects and the Southeast Europe region. This summary assesses the TTFSE
Program as a whole, the evaluation of the three projects is presented in annexes A, B and C.


The TTFSE Program
The Program?s strategic relevance and timeliness were of high order- following on the end of
major conflict in the region, capitalizing on the strong interest of the countries in closer
integration with the European Union and the reciprocal interest of the European Union in trade
liberalization, and setting two objectives consistent with the Bank strategy for the countries.
Largely through the dialogue leading to the TTFSE, the Bank helped foster the understanding
that regional cooperation would be necessary to take advantage of the substantial market access
granted by the European Union. The need for measures to facilitate transport and trade among
one another flowed from this understanding.

Theprojects? designs were sound. The TTFSE was an umbrella program with common
objectives, menu of components and performance framework. Both development objectives were
important, and ,the infrastructure, information technology, procedural customs reforms, and
training and dissemination to be provided through the project were well suited to their
achievement. Although anti-corruption has been an explicit objective in a number of Bank
operations, one may argue that, as an outgrowth of other factors, reduction in corruption is not a
valid project objective on conceptual grounds. However, on balance, it may be considered
appropriate in this case. The regional approach added value to the projects and was critical to the
outcomes. In other respects, each project was tailored to the country and supported a specific mix
of activities. The combination of country-specific activities and the common framework
produced consistency with the regional strategy while providing effective support to the
individual countries. (Also, the project design was participatory with the governments
concerned.)

The components were appropriate and costs were moderate. The total cost of the projects was
$129.6 million (8 percent above estimate), of which the Bank accounted for over 90 percent,
with the remainder from governments? contributions and cofinancing, mainly by the United
States and the European Union Customs and Fiscal Assistance Office (CAFAO). The size of the
individual projects ranged from about $9 million (in Moldova) to about $25 million (in Croatia),
with the majority clustered around $15 million. The ?menu? of components was the same for all
eight projects, comprising:
                                                   xii


e       support to information systems (including transit and inland control systems)
e       institutional modernization of customs
e       improvement of customs terminals and border crossing facilities
e       trade facilitation development (mainly training and dissemination)
e       program implementation

As shown below, within this menu the weight of each component differed in the various projects,
with physical infrastructure accounting for the largest share of costs in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Bulgaria and Romania, and information technology for the main cost component in Moldova and
Serbia. Measures for the institutional modernization and integrity of customs, however, were
included in every project and were key to the outcomes.

The monitoringframework was simple and robust on the trade facilitation side. The main
indicators covered the performance of customs offices at pilot inland terminals and pilot border
crossings (measured in terms of clearance time required), as well as the administrative efficiency
of the customs agency as a whole. Partly owing to the ambiguity of the corruption reduction
objective itself, the indicators for the second objective were necessarily less precise and - as is
always the case - relied on perception surveys and indirect evidence. Moreover, the nature of the
objective precluded setting specific targets in advance - making it especially difficult after the fact
to arrive at a solid conclusion without recurring to a variety of direct and indirect evidence. Actual
monitoring was close and reporting was regular - helping to keep the focus on progress and
largely preventing backsliding. More attention could have been given to assuring sustainability of
the monitoring framework itself, but a majority of governments voluntarily continued to monitor
customs performance on the same or similar basis as in the TTFSE projects.

Efficacy and efficiency

The efficacy o the Program was substantial, in terms of both cost reduction and reduction in
               f
smuggling and corruption. The TTFSE Program also contributed to an extent to the rapid
expansion of Southeast Europe's trade during the Program years (from about US$63 billion in
2000 to $3 12 billion in 2008), although that expansion was caused mainly by other factors,
primarily the restoration of stability and the liberalization of trade policies.

The achievement o the cost-reduction objective was substantial in all countries and high in
                 f
some-- whether measured by the Program's own indicators or by other indicators of customs
                                                xiii


efficiency, as in the Doing Business survey (DB) and Business Environment and Enterprise
Performance (BEEPS) survey. Through the introduction of risk analysis and other measures,
for Southeast Europe as a whole the average percentage of trucks inspected was cut by almost
three-fourths (and along with it the opportunities for corruption), and customs clearance entry
time was reduced from an average of over two and a half hours to less than one hour. At the
end of their project periods, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Macedonia had the shortest clearance times,
with Moldova and Romania lagging behind. The largest relative improvements were registered
by Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, Moldova, and Serbia, and the smallest improvements by
Bulgaria and Croatia (as can be expected, since Bulgaria and Croatia had the shortest clearance
times at the start of the projects), The single most noteworthy improvement was registered by
Macedonia which, despite a comparatively short clearance time at the start of the project
achieved one of the largest percentage improvements in the Balkans. Serbia, too, registered
substantial progress, especially considering that the Government measures entry time to
include all inspections (such as phytosanitary and veterinary) and not only customs.

Smuggling and corruption in customs were also significantly reduced from their high levels
at the turn of the century, although smuggling is still a major problem in some countries,
especially in Moldova, and corruption in customs persists to some degree in most TTFSE
countries. The BEEPS survey shows a reduction in frequency of customs bribes in Southeast
Europe, from 19 percent in 2005 to 5 percent in 2008 (compared to a reduction from 13 percent
to 7 percent for Europe and Central Asia as a whole.) At individual country level, additional
specific evidence exists of improvements in overall public integrity and in customs in
particular. Not all of the reduction in corruption in customs can be attributed to the Program
measures, however, as a contribution was also made by the overall improvement in governance
and climate of integrity in many countries.

The efficiency o the TTFSEprojects was substantial. The transport cost savings from the
                 f
reduction in clearance times were in almost all countries larger than originally estimated. The
economic rate of return of the TTFSE Program has been higher than projected in the project
appraisal documents - ranging from 19 percent to over 75 percent - including a conservative
estimate of the additional indirect benefits from the trade expansion made possible by the
reforms under the projects (but not including the gains from the reductions in smuggling and
corruption.)


Bank and governments performance

Bank and government performance were generally satisfactory. Bank performance was
satisfactory in all countries, with quality at entry ranging from moderately to highly satisfactory
and quality of supervision satisfactory or better. A signal accomplishment of Bank supervision
was the evolution of government ownership, shaky in some countries at the start of the project
but strong in almost every country at the end of the project. The performance of project
implementation teams was consistently satisfactory, despite initial doubts on their
appropriateness, while government performance was more variable -- best in Macedonia, Serbia
and (recently) in Moldova, and with shortcomings and slippages in Bosnia-Herzegovina and
Romania.

Ratings and overall conclusion

Based on the evidence provided by the supervision reports during projects implementation, the
implementation completion reports, and the broader and more recent evidence assembled
through this assessment, the ratings for the eight projects and the Program are shown in Table 6
in the text. As of early 2010, the most successful of the eight TTFSE projects were Macedonia
and Serbia, with Croatia and Moldova next. This assessment concludes that only in Bosnia-
Herzegovina was the outcome less than fully satisfactory.

Overall, the TTFSE Program must be rated as a very effective intervention - costing less than
US$130 million, supporting critical international goals, covering eight countries in varying
degrees of initial political and economic difficulty, with a high rate of return, and satisfactory
outcomes.


Cross-cutting issues

Regional vs. multicountryprojects. The experience of the TTFSE Program sheds light on a
major difference between a multicountry project and a genuinely regional project. A regional
project can be defined as a multicountry project that either reinforces a functioning preexisting
regional organization or is a vehicle for the creation of a new one (as in the Southeast Europe
Energy Community). While the TTFSE Program was not regional in the above sense, any added
costs from the multicountry coverage were more than offset by the savings from the common
approach, menu of components, and M&E framework for all eight projects, leading to a low cost
of implementation arrangements. It would be useful for the Bank to conduct a top-to-bottom
analysis of the costs, in the various sectors, of preparing and supervising regional projects
compared to the costs of doing so for national projects.

Is reduction of corruption a valid project development objective? Reducing corruption is an
explicit objective in a number of Bank operations, and corruption and smuggling were a very
serious problem in Southeast Europe at the start of the Program. There is an argument, however,
that reducing corruption is not a valid independent objective, because corruption is primarily an
outgrowth of governance and public management weaknesses. Moreover, for the TTFSE,
opportunities for smuggling and corruption were closely related to the regulatory complexities and
transport difficulties, the alleviation of which underpinned the first objective. The two objectives
were therefore closely interrelated. Also, if the nature of the objective precludes apriori clarity
and precision (not necessarily quantification), and thus setting realistic targets, ex post evaluation
of the degree of achievement of the objective is difficult. On balance, the objective should be
considered valid in the case of the TTFSE, but the reciprocal linkages between broad governance
developments and trade facilitation could have been explored more adequately.

Pilot sites and traffic diversion. The TTFSE projects focused on "pilot" sites, and the failure to
compare performance between those sites and other border posts might have resulted in
overlooking possible traffic diversion. From field visits and on closer examination this did not
occur, mainly because the project "pilot" sites included the major crossings and accounted in
most countries for the bulk of road traffic. A different issue emerges, however. Performance at
borders must be compared with the inland terminals, to assure that the elimination of some
                                                xv


unnecessary procedure or bribe opportunity at the border is not simply shifted to the inland
terminals. (The contrast between the problems in Moldova in this respect and the comparatively
good experience in Serbia is instructive.)

The need for complementariLy The TTFSE Program experience shows that complementarity in
this sector has three aspects: across borders, between components, and with human interaction.
First, the evaluation confirms that infrastructural or procedural improvements should occur on
both sides of the border in order to be fully effective. The need.for complementarity is also
evident among components- infrastructural investments in the absence of institutional reforms
are likely to be partly wasted, but if the infrastructural bottlenecks had been left unattended
transaction costs and clearance times would not have improved much despite the institutional
reforms--especially considering the large expansion of intra-regional trade and transit traffic in
Southeast Europe. (With good donor coordination, however, such complementarity need not be
provided by the Bank project itself.) Finally, there is complementarity between physical
infrastructure and trade facilitation, on the one hand, and the fostering of human contacts, on the
other--with functional facilities providing the physical enabling environment for constructive
interaction between the customs managers on both sides of the border.

The need for cooperation. Within the country, complementarity requires cooperation among the
border agents concerned - customs, police, various inspectors-but cooperation at the border
cannot be sustained unless there is also cooperation among the respective headquarters. Between
countries, cooperation is necessary to address potential inconsistencies between interventions on
the two sides of the border.

Lessons

The main lessons drawn from the TTFSE Program as a whole are as follows.

Make haste slowly. It's sustainability that matters, especially in institution-intensive projects,
and a slow start need not be a major concern so long as there is evidence that the'institutional
foundation is in fact being built. A related point-especially relevant to information technology-
-is the need to consider carefully whether consistent small steps can, in time, achieve the desired
outcome faster than a simultaneous comprehensive initiative. In transport and trade facilitation,
it is especially important not to underestimate the power of small practical improvements to
make a big difference. In the same spirit, and especially relevant to the Balkans, the small steps
taken to rebuild social capital proved important, as post-conflict reconciliation flows from the
accretion of such specific trust-rebuilding 'measures.

Embed goodpractice. Sustainability is in part a function of ownership, and a proof of genuine
ownership of the TTFSE projects is that most governments continued to track performance after
project closing. It is important to explore at the outset ways to consolidate the performance
monitoring habit, by embedding the indicators in the country's own system and/or by explicit
understanding that monitoring will continue after the project closing.

Beware of champions-Rely on institutions, not persons. While all change requires individual
leadership, the TTFSE experience shows the risks of excessive reliance on individual champions.
(In Serbia, the over-dependence on a high customs official caused the project to come to a
complete halt when he was replaced.) One should instead look to organizations as the real
                                                xvi


champions. In Moldova, for example, the new monitoring unit in the Customs Service provides
guidance on change management, and in Bosnia-Herzegovina the customs human resources
department succeeded in undoing some of the ethnic cleansing and in breaking up patronage
networks.

Foster high-level partnerships. In ensuring momentum and buy-in, the Program strongly
benefited from high-level support from private and official external parties. In particular, the
Business Advisory Councils promoted the need for trade facilitation, using various channels of
communications to the decision makers, and the main development partners provided key
support for designing the program, as well as parallel financing and implementation assistance.

Never forget the power ofincentives. Very low salaries may be sufficient for corrupt behavior,
in customs as in other public functions, but are not necessary. The only outcome of raising
customs salaries, without any other change, is to pay corrupt officers better. However, when
salaries are increased in conjunction with strengthening accountability mechanisms and rule
compliance, the impact can be powerful, as demonstrated by the experience of several TTFSE
countries (for example, in Serbia, when the 150 percent salary raise during the project period
interacted with stronger rule enforcement and organizational streamlining to produce a six-fold
increase in customs revenue collected per custom staff member).

Do not neglect the governance dimension. Just as one country can be adversely affected by
infrastructural or procedural defects occurring across the border, so it can be positively
influenced by improvements in the quality of governance in the neighboring countries. (The
signal example in this case is the large reduction in smuggling into Bosnia-Herzegovina resulting
from governance improvement in neighboring Serbia). A multicountry project thus requires an
assessment of the governance aspects, not only in the individual countries, but also in terms of
inter-country relations and the credibility and capacity of the regional organization-if one exists.
This may require either raising the bar in terms of the review of the project at the preparation
stage and/or a different sort of review--focused as much on the governance environment as on
technical design.

1. The Regional Context: Disintegration and
Reintegration
1.1      The break-up of the former Yugoslavia and the other political changes in Eastern
Europe and the former USSR fragmented what had been common economic spaces into
disparate entities - many at war for the first half of the 1990s. A number of international
initiatives were taken to help gradually reintegrate the economies concerned, alongside
political developments and peace-making efforts. Among these, the most relevant for the
evaluation of the World Bank's Transport and Trade Facilitation Program are the Central
European Free Trade Area (CEFTA) and the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe.

1.2     CEFTA began in 1992 when Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia joined in
association with the European Union, and progressively expanded to include Albania,
Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria and all countries of the former Yugoslavia. As and when some
of these countries became European Union (EU) members they left CEFTA, which currently
therefore includes all Southeast European countries except Bulgaria and Romania.

 1.3     The Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe was approved in 1999 in Sarajevo at the
initiative of the European Union. It was intended to replace the ad hoc and reactive crisis
interventions with a comprehensive strategy to strengthen the efforts of countries of South
Eastern Europe (SEE) to foster peace, democracy, respect for human rights and economic
prosperity, in order to achieve stability in the whole region. In addition to the SEE countries
themselves, the Pact includes the EU members, other major countries (including the U.S.,
Russia, and Turkey), and the principal international organizations concerned. Among other
things, the Pact undertook to draw South Eastern Europe "closer to the perspective of full
integration ... into [EU] structures", including eventual full membership.

1.4     Under the Pact, a Working Group on Trade Liberalization and Facilitation brought
together trade representatives from all the SEE countries, the EU, the World Trade
Organization (WTO, the World Bank;and major interested governments, including the U.S.
and Turkey. Through this working group, the SEE countries signed a Memorandum of
Understanding in 200 1 to improve the trade environment in the region, and subsequently
concluded 3 1 bilateral free trade agreements. To address the complications resulting from the
large number of these bilateral agreements, the working group later recommended replacing
them with an inclusive agreement to produce a harmonized trade regime (and also to take
into account other policy issues such as trade in services, government procurement, state aid,
and intellectual property rights). In April 2006, the summit meeting of SEE countries in
Bucharest agreed to create a single free trade area in the region through the simultaneous
enlargement and amendment of the Central European Free Trade Area. Negotiations to that

held in September 2007 in Ohrid, Macedonia.

1.5     Around the time of the signing of the Stability Pact and in the context of the
discussions that led to the memorandum of understanding (MOU) on trade liberalization in
SEE, the Bank designed a regional program to facilitate trade and transport and improve
integrity in customs in Southeast European countries. This was the Trade and Transport
Facilitation for Southeast Europe Program (hereafter, the TTFSE or "the Program"), a $120
million initiative covering similar projects in eight countries -the six Balkan countries of
Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia, in addition to
Moldova and Romania.




2. The Transport and Trade Facilitation in Southeastern
Europe Program
2.1     The description and assessment of the Program rest on in-depth evaluations of the
TTFSE projects for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Moldova and Serbia, as well as a 2005 IEG study
of the first three TTFSE projects (Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania-hereafter, "the case
study"); a desk review of the documentation on all the eight projects; other current trade-
related information on Southeast Europe as a whole; and extensive interviews with a variety
of official and non-official stakeholders. The three country project evaluations are annexed.
They include some recapitulations of objectives, indicators and other information common to
all TTFSE projects, but only to the minimum necessary to make each evaluation self-
contained. The experience of all eight projects is included in this report as appropriate for the
assessment of the TTFSE Program as a whole.

Strategic relevance
2.2     The Program strategic relevance and timeliness were of high order -- following on the
end of major conflict in the region, and capitalizing on the strong interest of the countries in
closer integration with the EU and the reciprocal EU interest in trade liberalization.

2.3     Conflict-prevention strategies and trade treaties gain operational meaning only when
implemented with the support of concrete measures to improve transport and facilitate cross-
border trade. The TTFSE Program aims of facilitating trade and reducing corruption were
thus central to the edifice designed by the Stability Pact and CEFTA, and their
implementation was concurrent with the gradual improvement of economic policies and
governance practices in Southeast European countries.

2.4     A number of other goals and also activities converged onto the same general agenda--
harmonization of SEE tariffs and standards and norms with those of the European Union;
accelerated WTO accession efforts on the part of the non-member countries; completion of
the bilateral trade agreements within Southeast Europe; and increased emphasis on
liberalization of trade in services.
2.5      The political context of the countries was mixed and capacity varied substantially
(e.g., in Albania and in Bosnia-Herzegovina where the state had responsibilities in the trade
area not commensurate with its capacities). All countries had significant initial reservations
against regional cooperation but all shared a strong European ambition. Largely through the
TTFSE dialogue, the Bank played a major role in fostering the understanding that regional
cooperation would be necessary to take advantage of the substantial market access granted by
the EU. The ensuing need for measures to facilitate transport and trade flowed logically from
this understanding.

Approach, objectives and design
2.6    The Program was implemented during the period 2000-2007, at different times for
each country project. Below are the appraisal and closing dates, respectively:

          Albania:       11/02/2000-0313 1-2005
          BiH:           11/06/2000-09/3 0/2005
          Bulgaria:      11/29/2000-09/30/2005
          Croatia:       06/08/2000-03/3 1/2005
          Macedonia:     11/13/2000-12/31/2005
          Moldova:       06/10/2003-09/30/2007
          Romania:       11/06/2000-06/30/2004
          Serbia:        06/04/2002-03/3 1/2007

2.7     The TTFSE approach was grounded on major analytical studies by the World Bank,
as part of its general effort to engage the countries of South Eastern Europe as well as major
partners - primarily the EC -- in a dialogue on trade relations in the region. One such study
was the strategy for South East Europe (World Bank, 2000), and another was the Regional
Trade Study on SE Europe (World Bank, 2002).2 Studies on trade in services and trade
standards were also prepared.

2.8     The liberalization of trade policies envisaged through the international efforts would
have been impeded by a continuation of the severe de facto restrictions, customs
inefficiencies, smuggling and corruption prevalent in most of the region at the turn of the
century. Listing the components of economic distance provides a simple frame for
understanding the linkages among trade policy, non-tariff costs, and other barriers that
underpinned the logic of the Program:

    Economic distance =f (Transport, Insurance, Customs Duties, NTB, Transaction Costs);
                    Transaction Costs = g (Cost of regulation, Corruption)

2.9    The TTFSE was thus conceived as an integral part of the reduction in economic
distance to be achieved through the lowering in customs duties and formal non-tariff barriers


2
  These studies were very favorably reviewed by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) and were rated highly
satisfactory for strategic relevance and in several other dimensions.
                                                        4


envisaged in the regional trade liberalization agenda. Accordingly, the Program set the two
objectives to reduce non-tariff costs to trade and transport; and reduce smuggling and
corruption at border crossing^.^ Although separable, these two objectives are interrelated to a
substantial extent-- and were both to be pursued through a variety of infrastructural
improvements, new information technology, organizational reforms in customs, and training
and dissemination.

2.10 In particular, improvements in information technology--both hardware and
software-were intended to introduce risk analysis in customs and minimize personal
contacts with customs officers as well as facilitate information exchange among border
agencies and with other countries. Institutional reform of customs was to be pursued through
preparing a new legislative and regulatory framework, streamlining customs procedures,
monitoring customs performance, and fostering interagency cooperation at border crossings.

2.1 1 The procedural and infrastructural improvements were to be introduced at the major
inland termipals and at "pilot posts" at the borders. The inland terminals selected were those
in each country's capital. The "pilot posts" were selected on the basis of volume of traffic,
coverage of the national territory, and irhportance for transnational trade-as the major road
corridors to/from Greece and Turkey go through most of the countries in the region. (As
discussed later, the "pilot post" terminology was misleading, insofar as it gave the impression
of small-scale experimentation even though they accounted for the bulk of road traffic.) Also,
the procedural and organizational implications of the projects affected the performance of the
customs agencies as a whole.

2.12 Well situated within a strategy of improved integration among the countries
concerned and between them and the rest of Europe, the TTFSE was an umbrella program
with common objectives, menu of components and performance framework. The common
objectives and approach were critical to Program success. In other respects, each of the eight
projects was tailored to the country and supported a country-specific mix of activities. The
combination of country-specific activities with the common objectives, indicators and menu
of components, produced consistency with the regional strategy while providing effective
support to the individual countries. Moreover, the project design was participatory with the
government concerned-which emphasized even more the country-focus of the activities.

2.13 This approach had the advantage of generating full ownership in most of the eight
countries, but also the drawback of missing out on the complementarity of the reforms and
infrastructural improvements on both sides of the border. To an extent, this was an inevitable
reflection of the political landscape of the peninsula and attitudes at the turn of the century-

 In particular, the EU had identified customs administration and enforcement practices as critical constraints to
meeting the requirements for accession.
4
  The formulation of the project development objectives is slightly different in the DCAs, which specify
reducing smuggling and corruption "at the Borrower's crossings". This may appear to be a distinction without
a difference, since the Borrower's borders cannot be crossed without affecting the neighboring country.
However, the wording difference is revealing of the dissonance between the Bank's single country-orientation
and its encouragement of regional activities. Moreover, in this particular case, the PDOs cannot be fully
achieved if improvements in transport and trade procedures are limited to the Borrower's territory, as discussed
later.
                                               5


which made it very difficult to persuade neighboring Balkan countries to agree to joint
activities.

2.14 One design feature that worked well and was common to all projects was the
inclusion of provisions for close public-private cooperation. Every project entailed the
creation of new consultation mechanisms including government officials, transport operators,
freight forwarders, shipping firms, and businessmen. A special role in training in the new
customs' procedures and their dissemination was assigned, in most countries, to the national
Chambers of Commerce. Also constructive was the activity of the SECI-PRO Committees.
Established under the Southeast Europe Cooperation Initiative (SECI), these committees
brought together private and public stakeholders to improve international trade through the
simplification and harmonization of procedures and practices on administration, commerce
and transport. Each country had its PRO committee, identified by the country initials - e.g.,
CROPRO for Croatia, MOLDPRO for Moldova etc. (See www.SECINET.org for details.)

2.15 In addition to the PRO committees, consultation on common trade and transport
issues and dissemination of good practices were facilitated by the widespread appreciation of
the Bank's involvement and the use of its "convening power".

Components and costs
2.16   The "menu" of components was the same for all eight projects, comprising:

0      support to information systems (including transit and inland control systems)
0      institutional modernization of customs
0      improvement of customs terminals and border crossing facilities
e      trade facilitation development (mainly training and dissemination)
0      program implementation

2.17 Within this general menu, the actual project contents varied widely. Table 1
summarizes the project components and costs. The total cost of the TTFSE projects was
$129.6 million (8 percent above the appraised estimate), of which Bank loans or IDA credits
accounted for over 90 percent, with the remainder covered by governments' contributions
and cofinancing, mainly by the US and the EU Customs and Fiscal Assistance Office
(CAFAO).

2.18 The variation in the weights of each component in the different projects is evident,
with physical infrastructure accounting for the lion's share of costs in Bosnia, Bulgaria and
Romania, and information technology the main cost component in Moldova and Serbia. The
temptation to consider a more "balanced" project cost structure (as in Albania, Croatia or
Macedonia) as preferable to an "unbalanced" one (as in Bosnia or Bulgaria) was
appropriately resisted. Targeting the resources to the major specific problems of the country
is appropriate, and demonstrates responsiveness to the client. Also, the excellent partnership
between the Bank and other donors entailed a certain division of labor that made it
appropriate for activities heavily financed by another donor to receive only a small portion of
TTFSE project resources. (What may be of some concern, however, is the significant
                                                      6


underestimation of the costs of the IT interventions, by a weighted average of about 33
percent .)

2.19 Finally, program administration costs lower than 3 percent of total disbursements
indicate a high degree of cost-effectiveness that reflects the soundness of the initial
arrangements and, more importantly, the ownership and in-kind contributions by most of the
national customs agencies and their own staff.

Monitoring and evaluation
2.20 The monitoring framework, also common to all projects, was satisfactory in design as
well as implementation and-in most countries-utilization. The performance indicators
were directly relevant to the objectives, clear, adequate, and with good arrangements for
monthly monitoring and reporting-although for smuggling and corruption they were
necessarily less precise and more indirect. The main indicators relevant to the first objective
of cost reduction covered the performance of customs offices at "pilot" inland terminals and
"pilot" border crossings (measured mainly in terms of clearance time required), as well as the
administrative efficiency of the customs agency as a whole. Because there is no direct
objective measure of corruption, the indicators for the second objective of reduction of
corruption and smuggling were based on surveys of the incidence of bribery at the borders
and on indirect measures such as the value of recorded imports. One important indicator,
the percentage of trucks inspected, was relevant to both the cost reduction and the corruption
reduction objectives--as the introduction of risk analysis through the project would permit to
reduce clearance times for low-risk cargos as well as cut down on individual discretion.
(Another indicator of corruption, used in this report but not specified in the TTFSE, is the
unit value of the recorded import declaration. Although increases can arise from a number of
factors, especially large increases over a short period of time suggest a reduction in the bribes
given to customs officers in exchange for registering artificially.lower import values and thus
pay less customs duty.)

2.21 Unlike the M&E framework of some multi-country TTFs, which have been complex
and excessively detailed, the TTFSE Bank teams did not over interpret Bank guidance on
result frameworks, and accepted the responsibility for robust selectivity that attaches to their
special competence in the sector. Actual monitoring was close and reporting was regular --
helping keep the focus on progress and largely preventing backsliding.




' The surveys, financed with trust fund resources, were terminated in 2003 owing to lack of finding. Although
they were followed in most countries by surveys by Transparency International or other entities, including
corruption in customs, the bases were not exactly comparable, adding to the necessity to assemble other
evidence of developments in corruption at customs.
6
  Nor could the customs officer just pocket the amount "saved", as the revenue collection discrepancy would be
obvious from the recorded import declaration and the duty rates.

2.22 As noted, the indicators covered customs performance at "pilot" inland terminals and
"pilot" border crossings (more on the "pilot" issue later), and the overall efficiency of the
customs agency as a whole. The former included mainly:

e        Time needed to clear customs at entry          '
e        Time needed to exit at border crossings
e        The "examination rate" (percentage of trucks inspected)
e        The rate of irregularities relative to truck inspections performed.


2.23      The main indicators of overall customs effectiveness included:

e        Import value per custom employee
e        Customs revenue per employee
e        Cost of customs relative to customs revenue

2.24 While the indicators were appropriate, some targets were somewhat arbitrary. In
general, target rates of truck inspection proved to be too loose and too easily achieved and
surpassed, whereas target entry clearance times were in some cases over-ambitious in light of
actual experience in other countries.

2.25 The result framework could have been simpler still without losing robustness by
dropping the exit time indicator. Related to the issue of limiting improvements to only one
side of the border, exit times are a bad indicator of customs performance, because they are
influenced more by what happens in the neighboring country -whether temporary road
construction, infrastructural bottlenecks, strikes, introduction of new rules, or other factors. 8

2.26 Beyond the effectiveness of monitoring under the project, the simplicity of the M&E
framework is important for the sustainability of the M&E framework itselJ: Whether the
government decides to continue to track performance after project closing is in part a
function of the simplicity and economy of the indicators. It may be legally necessary to limit
monitoring of progress "to the project life" (Croatia PAD, p.3), but explicit prior
understandings should have been reached to assure that the performance indicators would be
monitored even after the projects closed. Fortunately, in most TTFSE countries--Bulgaria,
Macedonia, Croatia, Moldova, Romania, Serbia--the authorities continued to do so of their
own accord.

7
  Serbia decided to include the overall time needed for entry, including customs clearance as well as all other
border inspections
8
  For example, the exit times at the Gradina border between Serbia and Bulgaria have been consistently much
longer than at other Serbian posts, and the intra-year variation has been extreme-- from an average of 5 minutes
in April to 43 minutes in October during 2002-2007. The cause was not weather (since in 2008 exit time was
108 minutes in April and 7 minutes in December), but the physical bottlenecks on Bulgaria's side of the border
and the changes in Bulgarian customs operations that affected exit times from Serbia-without any increase in
entry time into Serbia (which is measured from the moment the truck registers with the Serbian customs). The
exit time indicator therefore says nothing in itself about the performance of Serbian customs.

Efficacy
2.27 A major issue of attribution should be flagged at the outset. Because the development
impacts of the customs reform measures supported by this program can reasonably be
expected to materialize and grow beyond the life of the project, this PPAR will assess project
impact and achievement of the development objectives by the most recent evidence, rather
than only by the evidence available shortly after project closing. It is important, to the extent
possible, to try and link events occurring after the closing of the projects to reform measures
taken during and as a result of the projects themselves. This is generally the case of
institutional development-intensive projects, as the payoff from improved procedures and
systems extends by definition much beyond the project's life. It is particularly the case of the
TTFSE projects, where the achievement of the development objectives was understood from
the start to be long-gestating and to require several years before it could fully materialize.
Moreover, the improvement in customs performance was in part contingent on major
organizational reforms, the impact of which is typically delayed. A key judgment test for
attribution to the project of post-closing benefits is thus whether the measures undertaken
during and as a result of the TTFSE project have been sustained after its end, and if the
procedures and reforms introduced have been mainstreamed into the regular customs
procedures and general systems of government. Accordingly, this report evaluates the
achievement of the objectives of the TTFSE projects and their impact on the basis of credible
evidence during the project period itself but also of the most recent statistical evidence, as
well as on current views of knowledgeable stakeholders. On these bases, the attribution issue
may be deemed satisfactorily resolved.

2.28 The achievement of the objective of reducing non-tariff costs of trade and transport
was substantial in most TTFSE countries and high in some, and the achievement of the
objective of reducing corruption and smuggling was substantial in all but one country.
Through its contribution to the reduction in economic distance, the project impact also
facilitated to some extent the remarkable expansion of international trade in the region during
the Program years, although that expansion was cause largely by other factors and primarily
the restoration of peace and the liberalization of trade policies. The following analysis
assembles the evidence on the direct and indirect impacts of the Program.


TRADE
    EXPANSION

2.29 Although from a small base, the increase in external trade of Southeast European
countries has been remarkable, as Table 2 shows. Between 2000 and 2008 merchandise
exports of Southeast European countries increased in value four and a half times and imports
more than five times-compared to about one and a half times for Europe as a whole. As a
result, Southeast Europe's trade doubled as a percentage of Europe's total trade, from 1.2
percent in 2000 to 2.4 percent in 2008 - still a very small proportion, but highly significant
for specific segments of the SEE countries' economies. By far the most important factors of
this expansion were the restoration of political stability and the trade policy liberalization

 As the tables refer to the already-identified TTFSE countries, the countries' names are not included in the
headings.
                                                                  10


    which by 2008 brought the trade regimes of SEE countries to compare favorably with other
    countries at similar levels of income. The increase in Romania?s trade and, to a lesser extent,
    Bulgaria between 2006 and 2008 is easily explained by their accession to EU membership in
    2007 - indeed, the bulk of their trade increase was after 2006. However, trade expanded
    almost as rapidly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, Moldova, and Serbia, reflecting some
    positive impact from the trade facilitation and customs improvement measures.

    2.30 Relevant evidence of the improvement in trading conditions is provided, first, by the
    various indicators of the ?Trading Across Borders? dimension of the Doing Business survey,
    as shown in Table 3. The information on the TTFSE countries is only available from 2007.
    The progress registered since then is not dramatic but is significant-e.g., the 7 percent
    reduction in import time (by 3 1 hours). Because the organizational improvements in customs
    agencies and the procedural streamlining that were associated with the TTFSE projects take
    time to bear fruit, it is plausible to attribute to the Program some part of this progress.

    2.3 1 An improvement is visible in the trade-related data as well, with a 10-20 percent
    reduction in the average time needed to import and export, and a small reduction in the
    volume of required documentation. Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Serbia could not be
    expected to improve from their already good record of 2007 in ease of cross-border trading.
    Delays were longest in Moldova - at over one month on average for both import and export
    transactions - despite the apparently streamlined documentation, and Bosnia-Herzegovina

experienced some reduction of the time required to export and import. But it is the
experience of Macedonia and Albania that deserve special notice: by 2009, Macedonia
ranked best in Southeast Europe for ease of cross-border trading and had met OECD
standards for trading time, and Albania

managed to achieve both a substantial improvement in public integrity and the largest
percentage reduction in trading time. (Once again, the attribution of this progress to the
TTFSE depends on the lagged impact of project reforms, which can be expected to diminish
over time. Moreover, the influence of non-TTFSE factors on the overall trading indicators is
large. This information is therefore presented mainly to assist the reader to place the TTFSE
in a broader context.

2.32 Directly relevant to the TTFSE are instead the specific TTFSE indicators. The most
important such indicators are the average clearance time for imports and the rate of cargo
inspection, summarized in Table 4.

2.33 Overall, the improvements for the TTFSE Program as a whole are impressive-
cutting the truck inspection rate by almost three-fourths (and thus among other things the
opportunities for corruption) and reducing the average customs clearance entry time from
over two and a half hours to under one hour--saving on this account alone an estimated $20
per truck per day (based on the $350/day cost), or some $50 million per year in total for the
TTFSE countries (under estimated traffic of 6,800 truckdday.)

Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia; 2002-2006 for Serbia; and 2003-2007 for Moldova.
** Weighted average for entry time, unweighted average for truck inspection rate


2.34 At the end of their respective project periods, Bulgaria, Croatia and Macedonia had
the shortest clearance times, with Moldova and Romania lagging far behind. In percentage
terms, the largest improvements were registered by Bosnia, Macedonia, Moldova and Serbia
and the smallest by Bulgaria and Croatia. This is to be expected, as Bulgaria and Croatia had
the shortest clearance times at the start of the projects; at the same time, the implied
importance of the TTFSE project for these countries was correspondingly lower to begin
with. Despite a comparatively short clearance time at project start, Macedonia managed to
achieve one of the largest percentage improvements in the Balkans. Serbia, too, registered a
noteworthy improvement, considering that the Serbian customs measures entry time to
include all inspections (phytosanitary, veterinary, etc.) and not only customs as do the other
seven countries. In addition, Serbian customs were in part indirectly responsible for the
reduced clearance time in neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, through their improvement of
procedures at the borders with Republika Srpska (RS), one of the two constituent entities of
BiH. (See Annex C for details.)

2.35 The available evidence on the quality of inspections is more equivocal. Greater
customs selectivity means not only that fewer trucks are inspected (and are identified on the
basis of risk analysis and objective criteria rather than personal discretion), but also that the
inspections are more detailed. Hence, the percentage of irregularities out of the total (lower)
number of inspections would be expected to rise, other things being equal. Instead, at the
closing of the project zero irregularities were found in truck inspection in some cases--at the
RS pilot posts along the BiH-Serbia border and all pilot border posts of Albania and
Romania. In the other countries, the percentage of irregularities increased as the truck
                                                       13


inspection rate decreased, as would be expected. On the one hand, the possibility of traffic
diversion through non-pilot posts cannot be discounted - since trucks with illicit cargo or
declarations of dubious accuracy would avoid going through pilot posts. On the other hand,
the very knowledge that risk analysis and rigorous truck examination had been introduced
would tend to reduce the initial number of illicit cargoes. A targeted study would be
necessary to arrive at a conclusion on whether these factors were operative and, if so, which
was more important.



DEVELOPMENTS IN CORRUPTION SMUGGLING
                         AND

Corruption and Regulatory Effectiveness: The Overall Trends in Southeast Europe

2.36 It is impossible to quantify precisely a reduction of smuggling (as any illegal
activity), concerning corruption, all indicators are perception-based -- not only do
perceptions change over time, but they are auto-correlated, making the validity of before-
and-after comparisons doubtful. Also, corruption in customs affects and is affected by the
broader climate of integrity and efficiency in government. Accordingly, a variety of
information and other evidence needs to be brought to bear to reach a nuanced conclusion,
starting with the evidence on changes in systemic corruption and regulatory quality in
Southeast Europe as a whole. (The two are closely related, as excessive regulatory barriers
are a well-known source of corruption opportunities.) Thus, before moving to the customs-
specific indicators needed to assess the probable impact of the TTFSE on corruption and
smuggling, the developments on overall public integrity and regulatory quality are
summarized very briefly below.

2.3 7 The Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index (TICPI) shows that
during 2003-2005 public integrity in the TTFSE group remained at a comparatively low 3.0
score (on a scale of 1-lo), with minor improvements in some countries and some
deterioration in others) but improved significantly after 2005, to 3.9 in 2009. The progress
registered in Macedonia and, to an only slightly lesser extent, in Serbia has been remarkable,
and significant in Albania, Moldova and Romania. Bulgaria and Bosnia-Herzegovina are the
exceptions to this picture of progress. It is noteworthy that, during the same period, the
perception of public integrity in the member countries of the European Union (not including
Bulgaria and Romania) declined significantly, especially after 2007. As a result, the relative
perception of public integrity in Southeast Europe, which was at its lowest point vis-a-vis the
EU countries in 2005, improved substantially by 2009 to well over half the EU average. 10

2.38 The above trend is paralleled by the changes in regulatory quality and control of
corruption surveyed through the World Governance Indicators. (See Kaufmann, Kraay and
Mastruzzi, 2007.) The percentile ranking of the TTFSE countries for regulatory quality
increased from 44 in 2003 to 50 in 2005 to 58 in 2009, and their ranking for control of

lo Because the TI index of corruption perception is based on the previous two years, and perception lags behind
the real changes (see McFerson, 2009), the actual improvement is likely to have occurred mainly during the
TTFSE Program period-though of course not as a major outgrowth of the Program measures.
                                                          14


corruption from 42 to 46 to 49, respectively. Finally, the Doing Business survey
(www.doing business.orq) showed Southeast European countries, on average, scoring better
than 77 percent of countries in the world for overall ease of doing business.



Corruption in customs in the TTFSE countries

2.39 In general for the region, the earlier 2005 Case Study concluded that corruption and
smuggling were "probably reduced" but at that time the evidence was insufficient to be sure-
let alone to measure the reduction. A clearer improvement appeared from the BEEPS survey
for 2005 and 2008, as shown in Table 5. l 1 The change is not large, but is significant given
the size of the sample and the fact that it is an average for the eight countries of the Program.
In particular, the 19 percent increase in the percentage of Southeast European enterprises
reporting that corruption was not a problem, contrasts sharply with the large deterioration for
ECA as a whole. And where ECA showed an improvement-as in business perception of
quality of customs regulations and frequency of bribes paid at customs-the improvement
was smaller than in the TTFSE countries.

2.40 It is not possible to quantify the contribution of the TTFSE projects to these regional
changes, but it is plausible that such contribution was significant, considering the
complementary evidence from the country-specific surveys and extensive mission interviews.
As of 2009, there was a unbroken consensus among all official and private respondents in all
three countries-BiH, Moldova and Serbia-that: (i) both smuggling and corruption in
11
  In earlier years, before the full impact of the projects, the BEEPS survey had found only slight
improvements.
                                                      15


customs had decreased sharply; and (ii) this occurred in large measure as a direct result of the
reforms put in place through the TTFSE projects. This consensus is confirmed by the
evidence presented in Annexes A, B and C for each of the three countries.

2.41 Several factors were responsible for the reduction of corruption in customs. First, the
general improvement in public integrity in all Southeast European countries, described
earlier, had a positive influence on integrity in customs and reduction in smuggling at border
posts. Specifically for the three countries, a major contribution was made by the
reorganization of customs in Serbia; by the new leadership of customs in Moldova; and by
the merger of the two separate customs administrations for the Federation and Republika
Srpska in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Finally, the introduction of computerized import clearance
systems was very important. The newest version of ASYCUDA (ASYCUDA World) was
particularly effective in Moldova, but also in BiH and Serbia the introduction of ASYCUDA
substantially reduced bribery opportunities, even though its effectiveness was somewhat
diminished by country-specific problems, as discussed in Annexes A and C.



EXTERNALITIES SPIN-OFFS
          AND

2.42 Although by far the major impact of the TTFSE was on the individual countries, and
through them on trade and transport facilitation in the region, there were some positive
externalities,for the region and in other respects. (In time, the successful experience of the
Program might give rise to additional positive replication or emulation in other TTF projects
and/or regional projects in other regions.)

2.43 Most importantly, the positive experience of the TTFSE was a facilitating factor of
the extension to the TTFSE countries of the Central Europe Free Trade Area (CEFTA) in
2006, which replaced the plethora of bilateral trade agreements that had been negotiated
between 2001 and 2005. As a ?road test? of the countries? capacity and willingness to take
concrete measures to facilitate trade and transport and reduce corruption, the TTFSE helped
provide the EU with the measure of comfort it needed to roceed further on the road to
regional cooperation with Southeast European countries. 72

2.44 Under the TTFSE, two countries implemented a single-window system to integrate
      ?



the operations at the border of customs and the various other control bodies - Macedonia
first, then Moldova in 2008. (See Annex B.) The system has been praised by the World
Customs Organization (WCO), and is now being replicated by other FSU countries-
Kazakhstan, Azerbajian, Belarus.

2.45 The major systemic experience relevant to other regional initiatives is the need to
build reciprocal trust among concerned institutions and member countries that may be

l 2 Very indirectly, another signal of EU comfort with developments in the subregion was the decision to
anticipate to December 2009 the waiver of EU visa requirements for Serbian nationals, possibly to be followed
by similar actions in respect of nationals of other Balkan countries.
                                                       16


initially skeptical of the utility of cooperation. This requires time, patience, and very close
and supportive supervision by Bank staff-ne        of the hallmarks of the TTFSE Program.

2.46 Finally, the TTFSE monitoring framework itself had some spin-offs. Although in
Central Asia there has been little emphasis on trade facilitation measures and reductions of
corruption, the monitoring of performance of corridor movements has benefited from the
TTFSE experience, and much of the methodology developed for the TTFSE was replicated in
Central Asia.

Efficiency
2.47 Under reasonably conservative assumptions the efficiency of the TTFSE Program as
a whole can be rated substantial or better. (The estimates of the rates of return of the three
projects newly-evaluated are discussed in Annex B.)

2.48 Ex ante, the quantification of benefits was estimated on the same basis for all eight
TTFSE projects-given the commonality of approach, performance indicators, and
envisaged targets. The PADs quantified the lower transport costs associated with the
decrease in clearance times at the borders and inland terminals, and the economic benefits of
trade expansion resulting from the project. The former were estimated .based on the targeted
reductions in entry and exit clearance times and the average value of truckhime
($3 5O/truck/day, all inclusive) that was directly obtained through interviews and other
primary data, plus an estimate of the growth in traffic volume from economic recovery and
several other exogenous factors.

2.49 The trade expansion benefits from the project are far more difficult to quantify, in
general and especially in the Balkans given the limited data availability at the start of the
TTFSE and the variety of other much more important influences on expansion of regional
trade. The Program relied for this purpose on the methodology proposed by Anthony
Venables (Venables, 2002; see also Venables, 2003) which produces additional savings in
the range of 20-30 percent of the direct benefits from the transport cost reduction--and used
the lower bound of 20 percent. l3 Altogether, the economic rates of return ranged from about
20 percent to 50 percent.

2.50 Expost, the economic rates of return (as reported in the ICRs) were in most countries
higher than estimated in the PADs (except for Croatia and BiH, where they were somewhat
lower), and ranged from about 19 percent (for BiH) to over 75 percent (for Serbi,a).
Considering that by far the largest portion of the economic return came from the empirical
information on actual truck costs and the verified reductions in clearance times, these rates of
return are credible, (Indeed, even if the indirect benefits from trade expansion attributable to
the projects are discounted to zero, the rates of return of the TTFSE projects would be
substantially higher than the 10 percent rate normally considered as acceptable.)

2.51 After the launching of the TTFSE, research covering 126 countries (Djiankov et al,
2006), concluded that each day of delay before shipment reduces trade by at least 1 percent.

13
     The ERRS estimated in the PADs ranged ftom about 25 percent to 50 percent.
                                                       17


As Djiankov puts it, each day is equivalent to a 40-mile increase in the country's economic
distance from its trade partners. Relative to the $300 billion value of merchandise trade of
Southeast European countries in 2008, this would add up to over $3 billion a year in savings.
Even if a very small fraction-say, hypothetically, 5 percent--were attributable to the impact
of the TTFSE projects, the annual benefit would be larger than the total $130 million TTFSE
investment. l 4

Bank performance
2.52 The specifics of Bank performance differed in the individual countries. Details are
provided for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Moldova and Serbia in Annex I; for Bulgaria, Romania
and Macedonia in the 2005 Case Study, and for all eight countries in the respective ICRs - to
which the interested reader is referred. (See the References.) Bank performance was
consistently satisfactory, with quality at entry ranging from moderately to highly satisfactory
and quality of supervision satisfactory or better.

2.53 The various TTFSE projects were generally ready for implementation at the time of
Board approval. Some delays,in making the project effective stemmed from the need to
complete important institutional reforms (e.g., the new Customs Code in Serbia). At the
beginning of the respective projects, there were some implementation difficulties associated
with the mutual suspicions among countries and the still-strong vested interests that stood to
lose from procedural facilitation and customs integrity measures. The Bank teams worked
closely and sensitively with the governmental and nongovernmental entities interested in
modernization and greater efficiency; were pragmatic and effective in cooperating with the
EU and bilateral donors; and used well the leverage of working across eight countries at the
same time.

2.54 For the most part, the Bank teams were proactive in addressing problems, helped by
the contribution of staff in the country offices. In general, the most important practical
aspects of supervision were in procurement, given the dominance of civil works and/or IT in
most projects, and the intervention of the procurement staff to resolve emerging problems
was timely and constructive. As in the Africa TTF regional projects, the TTFSE projects
have benefited from continuity of involvement of competent and committed task teams. Such
continuity was especially important given that the multicountry TTFSE projects could not be
anchored onto a strong regional organization.

2.55 The one area where more attention at entry and greater assertiveness in supervision
could have helped was in embedding the otherwise sound performance framework into the
countries' own regular practices. This was achieved in Serbia using essentially the TTFSE
framework continuously from the end of the project todate, and in Moldova using a modified
but satisfactory monitoring framework. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, by contrast, the
insufficient attention to this aspect during supervision was partly responsible for the virtual
disappearance of performance monitoring from BiH customs after project end.


l4 A correspondingly larger stream of economic and financial benefits will accrue to the economy and the public
finances from the permanent reforms put in place through the project (as shown by the additional improvements
registered in many countries after the closing of the project).
                                               18


2.56 At the start of the projects, government ownership was shaky in some countries, and
cooperation with the project was motivated more by the interest in closer association with the
EU rather than by genuine commitment to facilitating trade and transport with other Balkan
countries and reducing smuggling and corruption. At the end of each project, government
ownership was strong in most countries, as evidenced by the continuation of monitoring of
border performance, better rule enforcement, and combating bribery-as reported by official
and non-official stakeholders. Accordingly, aside from satisfactory supervision of the
progress of project components, the signal accomplishment of the Bank was to nurture
government ownership through constructive dialogue at the top and collegial partnership
with local officials.

Governments and implementing agencies performance
2.57 Again, the reader interested in assessments of individual government and
implementation team performance is referred to Annex I for BiH, Moldova and Serbia and
the respective ICRs for the other countries. In general, implementing agencies performance
was consistently satisfactory, while government performance was more variable -- best in
Macedonia, Moldova and Serbia, satisfactory in Bulgaria and Croatia, and with some
shortcomings and slippages in Albania, BiH, and Romania. Counterpart funding availability
was a particular issue, despite continued Bank representations to the governments concerned
to make the funds available. However, in view of the limited contribution expected from
governments, co-financing by other donors and imaginative bridging solutions devised by
project implementation teams prevented these funding shortfalls from causing serious
implementation problems.

2.58 In all other respects, government performance was satisfactory or better during the
Program, primarily in the customs administrations but also through the support from the
political leadership. After the Program, performance has been uneven - ranging from
marginally satisfactory in some countries to highly satisfactory in others. Improvement in
customs administrations has been substantial in all cases, with major changes in leadership at
the top, and some renewal of personnel by replacing retired older staff with younger
employees more interested in professionalism and less tolerant of bribery and inefficiency.

2.59 At the time of Program conception, there were doubts that the establishment of
separate project implementation teams (PITs) would be appropriate to projects in middle-
income countries with comparatively good local capacity. As the projects began to be
implemented, however, these doubts were assuaged. The PITs did not duplicate local
capacity or short-circuit its growth, and worked in close cooperation with the country's
authorities - particularly customs. In several countries, e.g., Croatia, Moldova, Serbia, the
functions and/or the staff of the former PITs were mainstreamed into the national customs
organization.

The bottom line
2.60 The evidence provided by the ISRs during project implementation, the ICRs, and the
more recent evidence assembled through this PPAR allows a comprehensive scorecard of the
eight projects and the program as a whole, shown in Table 6. The in-depth evaluation
including a field mission covered BiH, Moldova and Serbia. Accordingly, it was decided that
it would not be appropriate to revisit the ICR ratings for the other five projects. However,
because the assessment is intended to be of the TTFSE Program as a whole, a substantial
review was conducted of those five projects as well, including, among other things,
documentary and statistical evidence subsequent to the time when those ratings were
assigned, as well as the informed opinion of mission interlocutors. On these bases, although
the earlier ratings were not changed, one may conclude as of early 2010 that the most
successful of the TTFSE projects were Macedonia and Serbia, with Croatia and Moldova
next, and that only one project, Bosnia and Herzegovina, was less than fully satisfactory.

2.61 Overall, with a total cost of under US$130 million (less than the average DPL), this
regional program supporting critical international goals, covering eight countries in varying
degrees of political and economic difficulty, and with satisfactory or better outcomes, must
be rated a highly effective intervention of the Bank.

3. Cross-Cutting Issues and Major Lessons

Cross-cutting issues
"Regional" vs. "multicountry" projects: Is there a difference?

3.1     The issue of the congruence between Bank procedures, which are borrower-centered,
and the Bank encouragement of regional initiatives has been under examination at the Bank
in recent years, including a major IEG evaluation (IEG, 2007) and a Quality Assurance
Group (QAG) Learning Review completed in early 2010. l5 The experience of the TTFSE
sheds some additional light on whether there is a meaningful difference or merely a semantic
distinction.

3.2     A key difference is whether the regional mechanisms associated with a multicountry
program: (i) function well; and (ii) are sustainable. The answer to the good functioning of
the regional mechanisms lies in sound design of the project and in proactive supervision -- as
in the TTFSE, where the Regional Steering Committee, the regional website and PRO
committees worked well during the early years of the Program. The answer to the issue of
sustainability raises the prior question of the interplay between the regional mechanisms and
the project, and is at the heart of a distinction between regional and multicountry projects.
Four scenarios can be sketched: (i) the regional organization is an instrument for a more
effective multicountry project; (ii) the regional organization is nonexistent, inoperative, or
irrelevant to the outcomes of the project; (iii) the project is, in part, intended to reinforce a
preexisting regional organization; or (iv) the project is, in part, a vehicle for the creation of
the regional organization and regional integration.

3.3      The TTFSE Program represents the first case, The Regional Steering Committee
(RSC), the regional website and all other ad hoc regional arrangements connected to the
TFFSE were useful during the life of the projects but could not be expected to be
"sustainable". These regional mechanisms generated new habits of bilateral customs
cooperation and fostered improvements in national procedures that in turn made the
preservation of the regional mechanisms unnecessary. And, since all TTFSE countries were
oriented toward the EU rather than each other-with intra-Balkan cooperation a means to the
end of demonstrating their reliability as EU trading partners-the political incentive to keep
the TTFSE regional mechanisms alive was inherently weak.

3.4      The case of the creation of a regional organization coterminous with the project and
critical for the continuation of the activities is represented by the Southeast Europe Energy
Community. l6 The objectives of the Energy Community are broadly similar to those of the


l5 The shifting terminology is itself an indication of the need for greater clarity - the IEG review of regional
programs is subtitled "An Evaluation of Multicountty Operations", and the QAG review mentions regional
projects.
16
  The contracting parties are the same as the TTFSE countries except for Moldova (who is expected to join in
2010) although Romania and Bulgaria necessarily left when they joined the EU in 2007.
                                                         22


TTFSE, and namely: exploiting regional benefits (scale economies in the case of energy,
reductions in economic distance in the case of the TTFSE); develop rules and institutions
compatible with the EU; and promote stability and prosperity in the region. However, unlike
the TTFSE, owing to the particular nature of energy markets, the SE Energy Community is
underpinned by a number of permanent coordination mechanisms, including a regulatory
board, and is a truly regional undertaking with sustainable regional institutions. (See Nyman,
20 10.)


Scale economies or added costs?

3.5     Whether or not they are "regional" in nature, all multicountry projects entail a
combination of added costs and economies of scale for the Bank. In the case of the TTFSE,
the added costs of creating regional mechanisms were more than offset by the savings in
preparation and supervision costs flowing from the common approach, menu of components
and M&E framework for all eight projects-as demonstrated by the very low 3 percent of
project costs accounted for by the implementation arrangements. Also, in the TTFSE
experience the role of the procurement staff in Bank offices was generally constructive and
responsive.


Pilot sites

3.6     As previewed earlier, a criticism of the TTFSE project design is that the M&E
framework failed to include monitoring of some border sites other than the pilot sites of the
project, for comparison and to check on the net impact of the improvements in the pilot
sites-and thus the impact of the project itself. (For this reason, the mission for this
evaluation visited also two non-pilot sites, to obtain at least an indication of substantial
differences in performance or whether traffic had been diverted as a result of facilitation or
anti-smuggling measures at some border posts and not others.)                  ''
3.7     On closer examination the objection is less weighty than it appears. The problem was
in the use of the term "pilot sites" -- accurate in the sense that the trade facilitation and
transport improvements were introduced in those sites, but very misleading as it gave the
impression of small-bore experimentation. In reality, the pilot sites selected included in every
TTFSE country the major border crossings, which accounted for the bulk of road traffic into
and through the country (over 90 percent in Serbia, from two-thirds to three-fourths in the
other countries, and 55 percent in Bosnia-Herzegovina). There appears to have been a
spontaneous minor rerouting of traffic, with trucks with cargo not requiring inspections
(other than customs) choosing to go through the smaller non-pilot sites. This may have
contributed to a slight extent to reducing entry time through the pilot sites -- but the initial
concern with the failure to compare performance in different sites does not appear well
founded.


17
   In Serbia both the pilot site of Batrovci and the non-pilot site of Siv were visited, and in Bosnia both the pilot
site of Raca and a non-pilot border post between Raca and Sarajevo.
                                                 23


3.8      The real issue of comparison is not between "pilot" border posts and the other border
posts, but between the border posts and the inland terminals. When some procedure or bribe
opportunity is eliminated at the border, resulting in a reduction in entry or exit time or
transaction cost, one must ascertain whether the procedure or bribe opportunity has been
eliminated altogether or simply shifted to the inland terminals. (The same point applies to
infrastructural improvements.) The real "entry time" should be timed to end not with
crossing the border, but with the final clearance of the cargo. While this lesson applies to all
TTFSE projects (including in Serbia's Belgrade terminal, which functions comparatively
well), it is especially important in Moldova, where the substantial progress made in customs
procedures and infrastructure at the border posts has not been matched by improvements at
the Chisinau terminal - which has therefore become a worse bottleneck. Measuring entry
time to include final clearance at inland terminals can be very difficult, since clearance can
take place at more than one location in the country. However, it would at least be necessary
to qualify the results at the borders with some consideration of "in-country" facilitation.

3.9      In a broad political sense, the entire TTFSE was a "pilot", insofar as the good
experience of implementation contributed to raising the comfort level of the European Union
institutions in cooperating with SEE countries and-to that extent-facilitated the formation
of the CEFTA. The EU customs and fiscal assistance organization CAFAO was heavily
involved in TTFSE, and is now supporting CEFTA. Some respondents argue that better
integration between the Balkan countries and the EU was contingent inter alia on a positive
prior experience of trade facilitation in the Balkan countries themselves.


Was there traffic or trade diversion?

3.10 Within each country, the fact that facilitation and infrastructural investments were
undertaken in "pilot" border posts could have led to diverting traffic toward those posts, thus
putting added pressure on the achievement of the trade facilitation indicators. Conversely, the
introduction of improved inspection and other anti-smuggling measures at pilot posts could
have led to altering smugglers' routes toward other posts, thus diluting the anti-corruption
effectiveness of the project measures. While neither of these effects should be considered
problematic in themselves, they could distort the assessment of the overall efficacy of the
project. However, aside from the fact that the pilot posts accounted in most countries for the
bulk of road traffic before the project, the PPAR found little evidence of such internal traffic
diversion

3.1 1 Between countries, trade diversion was a possible result of Bulgaria and Romania
joining the EU in 2007. Again, while this report has not attempted either to quantify trade
diversion or to rule it out, respondents did not believe that it has been significant - at least so
far. (A possible explanation is that major physical transport bottlenecks in and between
Bulgaria and Romania have constrained a possible trade diversion effect.)
                                                        24


The need for complementarity

3.12 The TTFSE experience shows that complementarity in this sector has three aspects:
across borders, between components, and with human interaction.

3.13 The 2005 Case Study concluded that improvements must occur on both sides of the
border in order to be effective. While this is generally true, procedural and/or infrastructural
improvements need not always occurparipassu on both sides of the border in order to
facilitate trade and transport. An improvement on the side of the border that is more affected
by procedural or physical bottlenecks can be effective in and of itself. The more accurate
formulation of the issue is that improvements on only one side of the border cannot facilitate
trade if the narrower bottleneck (physical or regulatory) is on the other side. 18

3.14 The need for complementarity is also evident among components. The 2005 case
study highlighted the fact that the infrastructural investments made the institutional reforms
more palatable. Both were necessary and neither was sufficient by itself- infrastructural
investments in the absence of institutional reforms are indeed likely to be wasted, but one
cannot expect a positive impact from streamlining procedures if major physical bottlenecks
are left untouched. Especially considering the large expansion of intra-regional trade and
transit during the TTFSE period, if the infrastructural bottlenecks had been left unattended
transaction costs and clearance times would not have improved much despite the important
institutional and procedural reforms put in place. (Cases in point are the situation at the
Gradina post on the Serbia-Bulgaria border and at the Chisinau inland terminal in Moldova.)

3-15 Finally, not only is there complementarity between physical infrastructure and trade
facilitation, but also between the two, on the one hand, and the fostering of human contacts,
on the other. Functional facilities provide the physical enabling environment for cooperation
between the customs managers. By contrast, in border posts where facilities were improved
on one side but not the other, and there was no agreement for sharing the facilities, the two
border post customs chiefs rarely if ever met to discuss and resolve common problems.

3.16 However, if there is good donor coordination or concurrent government initiatives,
the required complementarity does not necessarily have to be addressed within the Bank
project itself, as shown by the different weight of TTFSE project components in the different
countries.


The need for cooperation

3.17 Complementarity requires cooperation. A first necessity is improved cooperation at
the border among the agents concerned--customs, police, inspectors. However, cooperation
at border posts is hampered if there isn't cooperation at headquarters-level among the
concerned agencies--customs, health, agriculture, interior--as was rightly concluded by the

l 8 It will be interesting to follow closely the experience of the TTFSE I1 project in Bulgaria, and assess its
impact on relieving the bottleneck in Kalotina and thus contribute to improving the situation on Serbia's side as
well.
                                              25


2005 Case Study. The multi-sectoral and multi-agency nature of border processes requires
coordinated actions by all agencies to facilit.atetrade and reduce corruption. (For example, it
took years in Serbia to synchronize the schedule of phytosanitary inspections with the
working hours of customs officials.)

3.18 Second, the potential for inconsistencies between interventions on the two sides of the
border, which would reduce the transport and trade facilitation impact, calls for cooperation
between the two countries concerned. Owing to the political tensions among countries at the
start of the TTFSE Program, such cooperation was largely absent. In less tense situations,
identifying those potential inconsistencies in advance and pressing for a closer dialogue
between the two governments before approval of the project in either country can preserve
the advantages of the regional model while addressing this drawback.

3.19 Other than integration initiatives with the EU, future cooperation in customs,
transport and trade facilitation among the TTFSE countries will most probably be on a
bilateral basis. For example, the Moldova Customs Service has regular meetings with
Ukrainian Customs-most recently in November 2009 in Odessa-to discuss common
problems and make sure that improvements are made on both sides of the border. (As of
early 2010, there are already five joint border posts with Ukraine, and discussions are
ongoing on setting up others -- hopefully with EU assistance, which has been requested.)


Lessons
3.20 Lessons specific to the individual countries are identified in Annex A - C for Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Moldova and Serbia, respectively. Below are the main lessons applicable
to the TTFSE Program as a whole.


Underestimating information technology costs and implementation difficulties

3.21 The cost of the IT components and the time for implementation were systematically
underestimated. Because compensating reductions were made in other components
(including in project implementation, which benefited from more proactive involvement by
the respective customs agencies) project implementation performance overall did not suffer.
However, it will be prudent in future projects to adopt a less optimistic approach to
estimating the costltime of IT modernization in customs (and to dampen clients' excessive
enthusiasm in "cutting-edge" and "state of the art" systems.)


Bounded flexibility

3.22 Several previous ICRs of TTFSE projects underlined as a lesson the need for
flexibility. What is less recognized is that it was precisely the commonality of strategy,
objectives, and performance indicators that allowed the unusual degree of flexibility required
to adapt to circumstances while adhering to Bank rules. First, the weight of project
components could be more easily adapted to each country's needs and with fewer questions
                                              26


raised because the approach was common and the menu of components was the same for all
countries. Second, the handling of emerging procurement and FM problems was responsive
and expeditious (with some exceptions) as well as consistent with fiduciary responsibilities
and Bank procedures.

Make haste slowly

3.23 It's sustainability that matters, and a slow start should not be a major concern so long
as there is evidence that the institutional foundation is in fact being built. (Cases in point
include the Macedonia TTF, which after initial stumbles eventually became one of the most
successful in the region, and Serbia, where the lack of progress in the first two years led the
Bank to consider cancellation, which would have been a grave mistake as the eventual
successful outcomes demonstrated.)

3.24 Related to the above is the need to consider whether small steps can, in time, achieve
a more favorable outcome than attempting to reach the objective in a comprehensive and
simultaneous fashion. Sometimes, real progress does require pushing for major
improvements compressed in a short period of time, in order to overcome initial inertia and
produce visible results. But progress can sometimes be best achieved by introduction of
successive consistent measures. A salutary lesson in this respect is provided by the attempts
at rapid introduction of integrated border management, still not in place in several Balkan
countries despite years of effort and support. Certain measures could have been introduced
severally to produce significant improvements at low cost, build cooperation from the bottom
up and encourage trust. (For example, a focus on phytosanitary and veterinary inspection
could have produced an agreement on common systems and procedures for inspections, in
contrast with the current situation in which no Balkan country still recognizes any of the
other countries' inspection certificates, which hinders trade for all.)


Embed good practice

3.25 Sustainability is in part a function of ownership, which can be strengthened as a result
of successful implementation of the project itself. After the fact, there are two tests of
genuine ownership: (i) whether the government continued to track performance after project
closing; and (ii) whether the reform activities of the project unit management unit were
mainstreamed. Both tests were met in a majority of TTFSE countries.

3.26 It is impossible to guess whether more attention to the sustainability of the monitoring
framework would have helped deepen it further, or consolidate it where it was not actively
continued. However, consideration should be given to including in a project cofinancing of a
small budget to finance performance monitoring for a defined period after project closing.
Alternatively, a special facility could be set up at the regional level to fund such continued
monitoring. The objective would be to consolidate the performance monitoring habit, by
embedding the indicators in the country's own system. (In genuinely regional projects, such
ex post continuous monitoring should include monitoring of inter-country cooperation.) In
any event, one cannot overestimate the importance of identifying performance indicators that
                                              27


are few, relevant, clear, realistic and monitorable - as was generally the case of the TTFSE
results framework.


Beware of individual "champions"-Rely on institutions, not persons

3.27 Obviously, all change requires leadership by individuals with the power to promote
and bring it about, but excessive reliance on "champions'y,who come and go, can backfire. In
the early years in Serbia, for example, the over-dependence on the Director-General and the
IT Director of Customs caused the project to come to a complete halt when they were
replaced by persons with a different agenda. We should look instead at organizations or
functions as the real "champions". As an example, also in Serbia, the Trade Facilitation
Section, into which the previous PIT was mainstreamed after the project closing, is now beset
by requests for advice and assistance on change management. In Moldova, the new
monitoring unit set up in 2008 in the Customs Service fulfils a similar emulative role. And in
BiH, the human resources department in the customs division of the Indirect Tax Authority
(ITA) was determined to undo some of the ethnic cleansing and breakup corrupt networks,
and succeeded in doing so.


The power of incentives

3.28 A classic fallacy in debates on anti-corruption strategies is to presume that because
very low salaries are associated with high bribery, increasing salaries will in itself reduce
corruption. But while very low salaries may be sufficient for corrupt behavior, they are not
necessary. However, when salaries are increased in conjunction with strengthening
accountability mechanisms and better rule enforcement, the impact can be powerful, as
demonstrated by the experience of several TTFSE countries (and particularly Serbia, with the
150 percent salary raise during the project period was associated with the six-fold increase in
customs revenue collected per custom staff member).


The power of small things

3-29 In transport and trade facilitation, very small practical improvements can make a big
difference-e.g., in Bulgaria, Croatia and other countries the simple relocation of the
officers' cabins in the truck lanes made it unnecessary for the driver to go into the customs
post leaving the truck to block the lane; designating special lane for transit trucks, as in
Macedonia, contributed to the major reduction in entry time; and establishing joint border
posts, as in Bosnia, saved time and minimized confusion and misunderstandings.

3.30 In the same spirit and particularly relevant to the Balkans were the small steps taken
to rebuild social capital. One example, cited in the 2005 case study, was the collaborative
relationship developed between customs chiefs and staff on opposite sides of the border
crossing between Guysevo (Bulgaria) and Deve Bair (Macedonia). Another example is
described in Box 1 in Annex B. One should not make too much of such small initiatives,
                                                         28


taken in isolation, but post-conflict reconciliation does flow from the accretion of specific
trust-rebuilding measures. l9


Do not neglect the governance dimension

3.3 1 The need for complementary measures on both sides of the border raises a broader
implication in terms of governance. Just as one country can be adversely affected by
infrastructural or procedural defects occurring across the border, it can be positively
influenced by an improvement of governance in the neighboring country. The signal example
is the large reduction in smuggling into Bosnia and Herzegovina resulting from the
governance improvement in neighboring Serbia. The process of governance improvements in
the Balkans had major implications for trade and transport facilitation and for improvements
in transparency and integrity.

3.32 The regional dimension of a multicountry project thus requires a particularly
thorough assessment of the governance and political economy aspects, not just in terms of
the individual nations, but also in terms of inter-country relations and the credibility and
capacity of the regional organization, if one exists. This may require either raising the bar in
terms of the review of the project at the preparation stage and/or a different sort of review-
focused as much on the governance and public management environment as on technical
design.

   An analysis of the international experience in post-conflict reconstruction concludes that civil strife, especially
in its most virulent ethnic form, short-circuits the rules that keep human interaction constructive and predictable,
targets primarily the organizations and individuals who administer those rules, and wipes out most positive forms
of social capital. Hence, the fundamental reconstruction priority is to rebuild the bridging networks that can
restore mutual trust among individuals and communities. (Schiavo-Campo, 2003)

Annex A. Evaluation of the Trade and Transport
Facilitation Project in Bosnia and Herzegovina

 Summary: Project Outcome and Lessons
 1.     The TTF Project for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), supported by an IDA credit of
US$12.36 million equivalent, was among the first TTFSE projects--approved in February
2001, effective in December, and closed in September 2005 after a one-year extension. The
objectives of the project were to reduce non-tariff costs to trade and transport and reduce
smuggling and corruption at border crossings. These objectives, strategy, and general design
were the same as for the other projects in the TTFSE Program, but the peculiar political
structure of the country ensuing from the Dayton accords that ended the civil war in 1995
entailed a very specific project design. The state of BiH comprises two largely autonomous
Entities (the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Republika Srpska - hereafter the
Federation and the RS. The Federation is further decentralized in ten Cantons. An
autonomous District of Brcko was added to the structure in 1999. At the time of project
approval, the entities had separate custom administrations. The project, like the country, was
thus necessarily split in two parts-one for Federation customs and the other for RS customs.
(In 2004, the two were merged into a single customs administration, as described later.)


MAIN FINDINGS


2.       The overall project outcome is rated moderately satisfactory, with a substantial risk
to development outcome. Nevertheless, it must be recognized that the country context was
extremely difficult, and the consensus of respondents (including Government officials, Bank
staff, other donor representatives, private businesspersons, and the media) is that this project
stands out as an example of institutional advance and interethnic cooperation in BiH.

3,      Aside from macro-level risks to development outcome, the major issues remaining
are related to informatics and organization. While the personnel aspect of the merger of the
two customs administrations has been successful, the informatics systems for custom duties
is very limiting and does not interface with that for domestic indirect taxes; and the
governance structure and organizational architecture of the Indirect Tax Administration need
review and revision. 20




*'This situation would suggest a potential for constructive follow-up assistance-especially to use the
unification of customs on a non-sectarian basis as a healthy precedent for other state-wide initiatives of inter-
entity cooperation in BiH. However, the political gridlock at every other level of BiH and the politicization of
ITA leadership raise serious doubts on the utility of hrther assistance.
                                             34



LESSONS


4.     Several of the lessons learned through this project are the same as for the other
       TTFSE projects, as discussed under the overall Program Assessment. The additional
       lessons specific to the BiH experience are:


       Even in political gridlock, some partial progress can be made. The successful
       merger of the two customs administrations and the creation of the Indirect Tax
       Administration (ITA) shows how it is possible to improve efficiency and public
       service in one sector despite continuing macro-level impasse.
e       The creation o positiveforms o social capital through bridging networks is
                       f                 f
       especially important in Bosnia, considering its recent past o ethnic conflict and
                                                                      f
       sectarian divisions. In itself, the merger of the two customs administrations would
       have produced only administrative savings. The quantum jump was produced by the
       deliberate policy to remedy the effects of past discrimination by relocating customs
       officers to assure ethnic diversity and to break up patronage and bribery networks.
       This was probably the most important and durable single achievement during the
       TTFSE period and subsequent years, demonstrating not only that past enmities can be
       quickly overcome but also offering a practical model replicable elsewhere in the
       country. (A study of the modalities and implementation of the BiH customs merger
       could yield interesting lessons for post-conflict reconstruction in general.)
e      The habits o performance monitoring need to be consolidated. If the rebuilding of
                     f
       social capital through the customs merger was a signal achievement, the failure to
       continue central monitoring of customs performance was a major shortcoming. This
       is not to be laid exclusively at government's door, because with greater attention to
       the need to embed results-orientation into the organizational culture of customs the
       Bank could have spurred stronger ownership of performance monitoring which
       would, in time, have led to sustainability of the performance framework itself, as
       occurred in a majority of TTFSE countries.



The Project
OBJECTIVES

5.      The project's development objectives are: (i) reducing non-tariff costs to trade and
transport and (ii) reducing smuggling and corruption at border. The objectives were the same
in the project appraisal document and the development credit agreement (DCA) and were not
revised during project implementation.
                                               35

COMPONENTS AND COSTS


6. In addition to a program implementation component (Table 7), the main substantive
   components were:


a      Improvement of Border Crossing and Customs Facilities (RS): construction at RaEa
       border crossing and an inland truck terminal; purchase of weighing scales and lab
       equipment; monitoring RS customs performance at pilot sites.

a      Improvement of Border Crossing and Customs Facilities (Federation): construction of
       new Izacic and Orasje border stations, reconstruction of inland terminals; design,
       supervision and technical services, including to monitor customs performance at pilot
       sites; and training.

a      Trade Facilitation Development (both entities): training in trade, logistics and
       international transport in cooperation with the Chamber of Economy; improvement of
       public-private cooperation; creation of a website and provision of corresponding
       equipment to support information availability.

In sharp contrast with most of the other TTFSE countries, virtually the entirety of the funding
in this project went for physical infrastructure, and even the trivial amount destined for trade
facilitation was not disbursed. This is mainly because the institutional and informatics
improvements were supported by the EU Customs and Fiscal Assistance Office (CAFAO)
and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

Implementation Experience
MONITORING EVALUATION
         AND

7.      The quality of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is modest, from substantial quality
of design, and modest implementation and utilization. The M&E framework is similar to that
of the other projects, discussed in the Program Assessment. Briefly, one set of indicators
monitored the time and cost (including "facilitation" payments) of regional road travel;
another addressed cost effectiveness in customs and revenue mobilization; and a third
measured the performance at selected "pilot" sites (primarily the documentary requirements,
delays, and incidence of bribery), Unlike other countries, where the "pilot" sites accounted
for the bulk of total trade, in BiH they accounted for just over half. However, this was due
primarily to the need to take account the interests of the various groups in BiH. 21 Also, the
ownership of the M&E trade facilitation framework proved to be weak in BiH.)

8.       During the project, monitoring was systematic and with regular progress reports but,
unlike Moldova and Serbia, BiH has stopped using the indicators to monitor customs
performance after the end of the TTFSE project. Although assertions are made that customs
and other border agencies' performance continues to be monitored, IEG was unable to find
evidence to that effect, or to obtain current data (despite repeated requests to that effect). It is
therefore not possible to confirm that the progress made during the project period in trade
facilitation has continued during the last three years. (Anectodal information suggests that it
has not, although corruption has continued to diminish.)

9.     Environmental and social safeguards. The project was classified as Category C
under the Bank's safeguard policies, as it would have no impact on the physical and social
environment. No safeguard issues arose during project implementation.


10.     Fiduciary aspects. Procurement and financial management arrangements were
satisfactory and so was their implementation. The procurement plan was closely followed, 22
and the financial management system and software were tailored to the particular
characteristics of the project. Submission of financial reports was timely and unqualified
opinions were rendered by the independent auditor. There were shortfalls in counterpart
funding, however. Also, some procurement issues emerged and initial difficulties were
experienced in hiring the right financial management specialist (who had to be an ethnic
Serb). In all such instances, the emerging problems were adequately resolved by the
implementation team, as described later under Borrower performance.




21 The sites were, in RS, the Banja Luka terminal and the Raca and Bosanska border posts and, in the
Federation, the Grude terminal and the Izacic and Orasje border posts.
22 The only change was to split contracts to accommodate community concerns on the Kostanica border post.

RELEVANCE
11.     Overall relevance is rated Substantial, as combination of high strategic relevance of
the objectives and some shortcomings in design leading to modest relevance of design.

12.      Objectives. The twin objectives of reducing non-tariff costs to trade and transport and
reducing smuggling and corruption were in line with BiH own strategy and with the Bank
strategy (see the May 2000 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and, for the current strategy
in light of the political gridlock, the December 2007 CAS covering 2008-201 1). Beyond the
same strategic relevance as the other TTFSE projects, in the particular case of BiH the
project offered an opportunity of serving as workbench of interethnic cooperation - which is
the fundamental requirement for progress and development in the country.

13.      Design. The IT needs were addressed through EU CAFAO assistance, and the
project approach as in other TTFSE cases was intended to be demand-driven. Moreover, the
role of the Bank as regional TTFSE trade facilitation coordinator should be stressed, as well
as the important training programs put in place in cooperation with the Chamber of
Commerce. It is nevertheless questionable to dedicate the entirety of project financing to
civil works and procurement of equipment, however much one may take into consideration
the division of labor with other development partners. The difficulties that arose later in the
implementation of the IT component and the compatibility issues between the ASYCUDA
and the VAT systems suggest that some material involvement by the Bank in the IT and
institutional components could have been fruitful.

 14.     The assessment of the major risks was thorough and candid, and what mitigation
measures could be taken were adequate - although an overall assessment of High risk instead
of Substantial as in the PAD would have been more appropriate. In the event, the macro-
level risks proved much less serious than expected in the early years, but have intensified in
recent years. Although the risk of inadequate political ability to resist pressure groups was
recognized, it was not given sufficient weight, as became evident later in the non-use of the
testing and laboratory equipment provided by the project.


EFFICACY

15.     The project's overall efficacy is rated Modest, from modest achievement of both
objectives. Two important caveats are necessary at the outset concerning the assessment of
the impact of this specific project.

16.      First, the assessment of the efficacy of the BiH project presents special difficulties of
attribution, owing both to the particularities of the country and to the very important
organizational reforms that took place in customs and tax administration during the project
period. The improvements in clearance times and reduction of smuggling and corruption
during the project period were much more the result of the merger of the separate customs
administrations and the creation of the Indirect Tax Authority than of the project itself
(especially considering that the entirety of project funding went for works and equipment.) It
is true that the project fit within a broader reform and assistance context. Thus, although the
                                               38


decision to merge customs had been taken in principle before project approval, government
officials believe that the project was important to firm up the decision. Also, supervision
reports and mission aide-memoires, as well as other evidence, demonstrate clearly that the
major customs reforms of 2004 were strongly encouraged by the Bank, in the context of the
broader dialogue within which project supervision took place. Finally, the project fit within
an agreed division of labor with the EU CAFAO, which had led in supporting customs
reform in BiH after the end of the war and continued to do so during the life of the project.
Thus, the impact of the project on major organizational reforms was substantial, but
attribution to the project of the achievements in reducing non-tariff costs and smuggling and
corruption can only be even more partial and indirect than in the TTFSE projects in other
countries.

17.     Second, unlike the TTF projects in most of the other countries, where the "pilot posts"
accounted for well over two-thirds of total traffic, in BiH they accounted for only about
55percent. This makes it difficult to extrapolate from the clearance improvements at border
posts to improvements in BiH as a whole. Also, in this case one cannot rule out that
corruption and smuggling opportunities were diverted to other border posts where
improvements had not been made. This may be the case, for example, in Izacic where,
despite the impressive new facilities, actual traffic appears very slight -- raising the
possibility that illicit activities have moved to "non-pilot" posts. There is no evidence of such
an effect (yet another consequence of the failure to continue performance monitoring at
border posts) but it should be kept in mind as a qualifier of the achievement of project
objectives.



Reduction o non-tariff cost o trade and transport
           f                 f


18.     Trade expansion. BiH trade has expanded during the project period and subsequent
years, as shown in Table 8. In part as a result of trade policy, with major tariff reductions (by
20 13 tariffs on all goods coming from the EU will be eliminated altogether), a 2 1 percent
annual rate of increase in trade during the project period 2002-2006 was followed by a 28
percent annual increase in the two subsequent years. Although substantial, overall this is
slightly slower than in Southeast Europe as a whole and compares with the higher 23 percent
and 3 1 percent annual rates of trade expansion for those two periods in neighboring Serbia.
(Among the reasons for this difference, the most important one is the rapid political and
public management progress in Serbia.)

 19.    Figures on the volume of traffic (number of trucks entering BiH pilot posts) are not
available after the project closing. It is noteworthy, however, that between 2002 and 2004,
the 35 percent increase in the number of trucks was significantly lower than the 53 percent
increase in the value of merchandise imports. This could result from an increase in the real
unit value of shipments, from some diversion through non-pilot posts, from an increase in
declared valuations closer to the real value of the cargo - or a combination of all three.
However, because there would be no incentive for legitimate shippers to divert their traffic to
the less efficient non-pilot post nor any reason to assume an increase in the real average value
                                                          39


of import shipments, the most likely explanation is that the registered values became closer
to the real values of the shipments, which is a strong indication of a reduction in corruption at
customs, also confirmed by other information presented later.

20.     Trudefacilitation. Table 9 summarizes the main results under the TTFSE indicators
during the project period. (See the March 2006 ICR for details.) Average import clearance
time at border posts was cut from almost two-and-a-half hours to less than one hour; the
incidence of physical examination of cargos was reduced from 26 to 8 percent, and the
incidence of irregularities fell to a minimal level. 23

2 1.    The significant difference found in several other countries (except Serbia) between
higher clearance times at inland terminals than at border posts is evident in BiH as well. In
this case (unlike in Moldova's Chisinau terminal) the difference appears to be related mainly
to the higher inspection rates at the terminals.




23 Transit traffic should be facilitated further by the adherence of BiH to the transit international routier (TIR)
treaty at the end of 2009. (See www.UNECE.org/tir)
                                                           40


TABLE 9. SUMMARY OF CLEARANCE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, BIH, 2001-2005




* Clearance performance at borders is the unweighted mean of performance at the "pilot" posts of Bosanska and Raca in RS,
and Izacic and Orasje in the Federation. Exit times are less meaningful as indicators of customs performance and should be
interpreted with care-see text,


22.      Some questions are raised by the reported figures - e.g., the strangely identical exit
times in BiH border posts in the Federation between 2002-2005, and the drastic reduction in
entry clearance time at Raca border post from over two hours in 2003 to 18 minutes in 2004,
which some view as too good to be true. It also does not inspire confidence in either the
reliability of reports or the integrity of the system that zero irregularities were found in truck
inspections in all BiH border posts in RS, including at Banja Luka terminal despite the still
high percentage of inspections conducted there.

23.     In any event, these apparently excellent results during the project period are clouded
by the cessation of reports on performance information after the project closure. Indeed, the
ITA has stopped even asking border posts for performance information, although the border
                                                          41


posts themselves still keep track of the clearance times in order to let their colleagues at the
other end know when the cargo entered.24 According to border post customs chiefs, they
"attempt" to keep to one hour or less the time for clearing loaded trucks for entry. If so, this
would be a major slippage from the 16-minute average in mid-2005 - albeit still a far cry
from the two hours and 20 minutes in 2001.



24.     Customs effectiveness. In BiH, customs revenue is not an appropriate indicator of
project performance, owing to the dominant impact on revenue of the sharp cuts in tariff rates
during the period. As for customs effectiveness, as Table 10 shows, between 200 1-2004 there
was a small increase in import declarations processed by customs staff, but a significant
reduction in the relative cost of customs, from 4.5 percent of revenue collected to less than 3
percent. Particularly noteworthy in terms of the likelihood of reduction of corruption is the
finding that revenue per customs staff increased proportionately nine times more than the
increase in number of declarations processed, entailing a jump in average declared value
much too large to be entirely attributable to a higher unit value of f.0.b. shipments. This leads
to the next issue.

Reduce corruption and smuggling at border crossings

25.     The general picture. As noted, individual indicators of regulatory effectiveness or
corruption need to be interpreted with care, In the case of BiH, however, they all point in the
same disappointing direction. Concerning the overall investment climate, BiH still has one of
the least favorable climates in the world (World Bank, 2008), and the Doing Business survey
(DB, 2009) ranks the country 116 worldwide for ease of doing business - compared to an
average rank of 77 for the TTFSE countries as a group.

26.     The indicators of corruption and regulatory quality show a similar picture. As Table
11 shows, while the mechanisms for control of corruption have not worsened, public
integrity is perceived to be lower today than it was in 2003, or in 2007. (In part, this is
related to the near-total political gridlock discussed later under risk to outcome.) The
deterioration in perceived corruption has taken place mainly during the project period, to
2005. This gloomy general picture does not extend to customs, however - quite the contrary,
as shown later.

  methodology, the score is in inverse order of corruption perception--lower scores indicate perception of
  higher corruption.


27.     Smuggling. Although there were no formal surveys in the early years after the end of
the civil war in 1995, there is a consensus among all interlocutors that corruption in customs
was rampant and smuggling was quite out of control. This state of affairs was in part related
to the post-Dayton political structure combined with the circumstances of the time. Informal
but very strong barriers to trade existed between the entities of the State of BiH and within
the Federation, with very loose controls at the border between BiH's Herzegovina region and
neighboring Croatia and virtually no controls between BiH and Serbia along the border
crossings into RS.

28.     Subsequently, the political change in neighboring Serbia helped substantially, and in
recent years the internal de facto barriers to trade within BiH have been substantially
dismantled while the external borders have been hardened into reality. In particular,
smuggling has been cut drastically by the hardening of the BiH Serbia border at the RS
crossings, although most of the credit for this achievement is due to Serbia rather than to
positive action on the other side of the border. Over the 2001-2008 period, private sector and
media respondents consider that smuggling fell by a minimum of 50 percent from the
rampant levels of the turn of the century. However, smuggling can only stop altogether when
all border agencies cooperate closely, which is not yet the case in BiH. Attempts at
introducing an integrated border management system began in 2003 with support from the
EU, but unfortunately without result to date, and individual discretion of customs officers in
the use of the new technical facilities is still excessive.

29.     Corruption in customs. Concerning corruption, the percentage of businessmen who
reported having to pay bribes in customs fell from 2002 to 15 percent in 2005, and still
further to only 5 percent in 2008. (See the Business Environmental and Enterprise
Performance surveys.) Also, unlike at the turn of the century when customs ranked at the
very top of cormption-plagued agencies, the Investment Climate survey found that corruption
in BiH is today associated primarily with underperforming former state enterprises (which
had been voucher-privatized in 1999).
                                              43


30.    Transparency International/Bosnia, too, considers that the two main sources of
corruption in the country have become privatization and, in the trade area, the oil terminals-
with customs and other border inspections way down the list - as shown in its recent survey
(TI Bosnia, 2009). Key survey findings that are relevant to corruption in customs are:


    0   Corruption has dropped in the list of perceived problems facing the country (after
        unemployment, poverty, low standards and political instability).
        Corruption is seen as especially prevalent in the privatization process, in political
        parties, and in parliament
    0   Customs is in 15* place for incidence of corruption, out of 26 public agencies.
        (Customs was near the top at the turn of the century.)
    0   The highest incidence of bribery was for doctors and other medical staff, with police
        in second place, but in amount the largest average bribes went to university
        professors.

3 1.     The main reason for the large improvement of integrity in customs was the merger of
the two customs administrations and the creation of the ITA, which led to a major shrinkage
of the gray economy, as discussed next. Differences in taxation between RS and the
Federation remain, however, and are a major source of distortion in economic activity. Also,
as tariffs were lowered and the VAT introduced, corruption opportunities have migrated from
customs to the domestic taxation side.


Institutional developments and issues


32.     Merger of the two customs and creation of the Indirect Tax Administration. The
most important development affecting implementation of the project was the merger of the
separate customs administrations for RS and the Federation and Brcko District into a single
customs service, in turn folded into the new Indirect Tax Administration (ITA) -the largest
state-level institution, established pursuant to the December 2003 law on indirect taxation.
During 2004, the merger of the separate customs administrations was completed; a tax office
was established for the first time at state level to develop the new value added tax system;
and the Indirect Taxation Administration began functioning as an integral organization
covering the entire territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina as of January 1, 2005, with
headquarters in Banja Luka, the largest city of RS. By mid-2006 the final phase of VAT
introduction began, with the registration of VAT taxpayers. (See the ITA website
www.uino.nov.bden for details.)

33.     The merger of customs and creation of the ITA were crucial to supersede the former
internal divisions and create a single economic space in the country, as well as to cut
smuggling and shrink the grey economy. The connection to the project, closed in September
2005, is only indirect, but these measures were undertaken as part and parcel of the same
dialogue that launched and fueled the project.
                                                     44


34.    A lot has been achieved in the short nine years since the start of the TTFSE -- legally,
organizationally, procedurally and in physical infrastructure. Cooperation within the unified
BiH customs and between the four main customs divisions of Banja Luka, Tuzla, Sarajevo
and Mostar is now excellent - with staff regarding themselves as colleagues, and the
improvements since 2004 serve as a model of what could be achieved in inter-ethnic
cooperation in BiH.

35.     On the downside, with tariff revenue reduced to 7 percent of total revenue, as a result
of the cut in tariffs and introduction of the VAT, the ITA leadership has become much more
interested in domestic taxation. Paradoxically, therefore, the merger of customs and
improvement in trade policies has led to neglecting the monitoring of performance at border
posts.

36.      Customs has not engaged in new recruiting, despite losing about 300 employees over
the last three years - from headquarters and regional centers as well as younger staff, well
trained in information technology -- moving to private employment. However, staff and skill
shortages have served to reinforce cooperation with neighboring countries, by making it
necessary to have greater contacts with and reliance on customs officers across the border.

37.     IT and ITA. The version of the automated system for customs data (ASYCUDA)
introduced in BiH with CAFAO support turned out to be problematic (unlike in Moldova,
where the latest version of the ASYCUDA system was introduced). Both headquarters staff
and field personnel express dissatisfaction with the system, which is viewed as very limited,
in terms of:


        geographic reach -- as trucks can be tracked only within the immediate area;
        type of queries -- the system does not have the capability to search by name of driver
        or truck license plate;
        interface with other posts -- searches by type of procedure can be made only within
        the servers of the regional customs offices; and
        user reports. 25


38.     Although the merger of customs and VAT into the ITA has achieved important
results in personnel and integrity, as noted, it has not been matched by equivalent information
technology integration. The ASYCUDA for customs and the system used for VAT have
difficulties in communicating, despite several adjustments made. At the same time as the ITA
has to deal with this problem, it also had to produce a special module to monitor the quota
system, and now needs to move to implementing the National Computerized Transit System
(NCTS). It will be very difficult with the current information technology systems to meet
NCTS requirements and conform to EU rules.


25Whether because of ASYCUDA limitations or other reason, reliance on paper files is still widespread, as
visible for example in the Raca border post. Also, despite ASYCUDA, implementation of risk analysis is in
practice far from complete-as shown by the reportedly still very high incidence of truck inspections.
                                                        45

39.     Next to a well-functioning informatics system, which is a must, the priority is to
eliminate the still-excessive individual discretion with which the technical facilities at
borders are used. This will require further development and enforcement of the risk analysis
module. However, such development is constrained by the ITA organizational structure -
now six years old and in need of revision. In part, such revision will serve to bridge the
difference in perspective of information technology specialists and the functional staff, which
however also require a neutral ?consulting referee? and clear leadership. In light of the much
greater contribution to government revenue from the VAT and the fact that customs duties
are indirect taxation as well, it would be preferable for an integrated system to be based on
expanding the system used for domestic taxation, rather than continuing to try and merge the
two different systems.

40.    Non-use of laborafory equipment. The implementation of the subcomponent in the
RS component for procurement of laboratory and testing equipment was blocked by an
internal institutional wall. While procurement itself was smooth, the use of the equipment
was hampered by the vested interests affected - including the lucrative opportunities
generated by multiple tariffs on oil products -- with obstructionism practiced even by some


               ??
managers in the government testing institute itself. The one-year closing date extension of
the TTFSE roject was approved in part to allow time to install the equipment and train the
operators. However, as of late 2009, the equipment was still in crates, while the testing
continued to be done by private laboratories at substantial cost to the Government--and very
conveniently for the shared interest of importers and ?clients? in precluding transparency and
robust phytosanitary and veterinary controls. The issue of wasted equipment, costing about
US$ 1.5 million, is entirely secondary to the issue of the maintenance of collusive practices
and damage to the country?s trade. In addition to the health and safety risks to Bosnian
consumers, BiH still has serious problems with international certification. These problems
cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of foreign buyers unless the testing system is revamped
and the vested interest networks dismantled. (Unfortunately, the exporters? lobby in BiH is
much weaker than the combined interest of importers, smugglers and their clients.)


4 1.     Rebuilding social capital. To conclude with perhaps the most important achievement
for the long term, the merger of the separate customs administrations and the closing of some
border posts opened the door for a deIiberate policy to reshuffle and reassign staff formerly
segregated by ethnicity-thus in some measure undoing the ethnic cleansing of the 1990s
and breaking up networks of corruption and favoritism. Some Bosniak officers were moved
to the northern posts on the Croatia border and some to Serbian borders; some ethnic Serbs
were relocated to the southwest border; and some ethnic Croat officers to the southeast
borders. It is interesting to note that these moves were generally welcomed by the customs
staff affected, many of whom had been colleagues in the unified Yugoslav customs system.

42.    Also important was the decision to locate the headquarters of the Indirect Tax
Authority in Banja Luka, the principal city in RS, with top leadership from all three ethnic
groups, and the creation of the joint Croatia-Bosnia border post at Izacic (see Box 1) provides

26
     The other reason was to permit completion of the works at Raca border crossing with Serbia
                                                46


a model for similar cross-border cooperation initiatives, to the extent that the overall political
climate in BiH will permit.

      Box 1. Cooperation through co-location: Thejoint Croatia-Bosnia border post


         In addition to its advantages in terms of practicality and cost-effectiveness, the
 setting up of a joint post was especially significant from a social capital perspective.
 Because facilities were deficient on the Croatia side of the border, if transit were to be
 improved the Croatian personnel would necessarily have to be located in the newly-built
 Bosnian customs post. It took a careful and sensitive dialogue to persuade Croatia to place
 in a Bosnian post its own customs agents and police-some of whom had been fighting in
 the civil war less than ten years earlier. But when this was accepted, actual cooperation in
 border post operations was made much easier. A "climate of reciprocity" was also created,
 by which Croatian facilities are made available to Bosnian customs officers and police at
 Croatia's border post at Velika Kladusa, some 50 km away.


EFFICIENCY
43.    The project efficiency is rated Substantial.

44.     Project costs were one third higher than anticipated. Also, the non-utilization of the
laboratory equipment should be considered. However, the cost increase was mostly from
exchange rate changes rather than incorrect estimates. On the benefit side, given the
comparatively smaller proportion of total traffic accounted for by the pilot posts as well as
the lack of trade facilitation measures in the project, quantifying direct project benefits is
more approximate than in the other TTFSE projects. However, the reductions in clearance
times shown in Table 9 permit estimation of savings of the order of $4.6 million by 2005,
compared to the PAD projection of $5.7 million. On this account alone, at 19 percent the
economic rate of return would still be almost twice as high as the standard 10 percent
thresholds, although lower than the optimistic 35 percent estimated in the PAD.

45.     In addition, indirect benefits need to be considered, but in this case they are especially
hard to quantify. They may include a share of the benefits from the expansion in trade, and
some gains to legitimate traders and to the government from the substantial reduction in
smuggling and corruption at customs. The efficiency savings from the improvement in
customs effectiveness are less speculative--with a doubling of average revenue collected per
employee, and a reduction in total relative cost of customs, from 4.5 percent of revenue
collected to less than 3 percent.

46.      Finally, like Albania but unlike all other TTFSE countries, BiH is not a major transit
country f r o d t o Greece and Turkey (or f r o d t o Russia and Ukraine in the case of Moldova).
For example, only 20 percent of goods entering the major post of Izacic (on the border with
Croatia) are destined for Serbia, Albania or Montenegro, with 80 percent for use within BiH
itself. This implies, other things being equal, that a 1arge.r share of the benefits from lower
trading transaction costs and less corruption accrue to local residents.

OUTCOME

47.    The project's overall outcome is rated moderately satisfactory. The sub-ratings for
each of the two development objectives are shown in Table 12.

* The major reduction in smuggling was achieved in large part because of actions taken by Serbia to harden its
border with the RS, and cannot be credited in fbll to the TTFSE project in BiH. To a lesser extent, the same is
true of the reduction in non-tariff costs on the RS-Serbia border posts.



RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

48.     The overall risk to development outcomes is significant. The PAD correctly
identified as high risks the inadequacy of political commitment to resist pressure groups and
the issue of regional cooperation, and listed other sources of substantial risk - concluding
that the project had "substantial" risk, but potential high return. It was hoped at the time that
political developments within BiH and elsewhere in the Balkans would reduce the macro and
governance risks to this project. However, after early improvements, the last three years have
been marked by nearly total political paralysis, following what was already identified three
years ago as "political obstruction of reforms and frequent political gridlock" (Bosnia 2007
CAS, p.3). Customs has been one exception, but it will remain a fragile exception so long as
the general climate does not improve.

49.     Closer to the question of sustainability of the TTFSE project achievements
themselves are some doubts expressed by government and private sector representatives alike
about the politicization at the highest level of ITA, and the extent of its actual cooperation
with the Ministry of Transport in Sarajevo. Wisely, some institutional memory has been
preserved in the ITA through retention as consultants of former top customs officials (and in
the Ministry through the mainstreaming of key project implementation staff). However,
absent the additional organizational and IT reforms in the ITA it is hard to envisage a
consolidation of progress made at the pilot terminals and the border posts, let alone an
expansion to other posts.
                                                      48

BANK PERFORMANCE

50.      Overall, Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

5 1.     Quality at entry. Quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory. The split design
was made inevitable by the need to adapt to the peculiar political structure of the country and
the existence of two separate customs agencies. Nevertheless, the emphasis on civil works
was clearly excessive, and insufficient attention (and no money) was given to trade
facilitation measures. By far the major factor of achievement of development objectives was
the unification of customs and creation of the ITA, rather than any feature of the project
design. Also, although the risk of inadequate political ability to resist pressure groups was
recognized, it was not given sufficient weight, as became evident later in the deliberate non-
use of the testing and laboratory equipment provided through the project.

52.      Quality o supervision. Bank supervision was satisfactory. In the early years, there
                  f
were inevitable difficulties in working at the same time with both the state and the two
entities, with a more difficult governance environment in the RS. The Bank team was
pragmatic and effective in cooperating with the EU and other bilateral donors, and diplomatic
in its dealings with the two entities.

53.      The Bank team was also proactive in addressing problems. A case in point was the
initiative to use Bank funding to bridge the missing local contribution from the Federation
when for a time in 2003 there was no Federation Minister of Finance to authorize it. In
general, the most important aspects of supervision were in procurement, given the dominance
of works in the project, and the intervention of the procurement staff in the Bank office to
resolve emerging problems was timely and highly constructive. An example relates to the
need for funding the facilities on Croatia's side of the border at Izacic, funding which could
not be provided through the Bank project for Bosnia (illlustrating the limitations of multi-
country projects as contrasted with genuine regional projects). Based on an imaginative
proposal by the Bank procurement staff, the problem was resolved, partly through the EU
contributing some funding to cover the missing facilities.

54.     The performance in supervision is all the more praiseworthy considering the
complexity of the institutional arrangements, with multiple entities and agencies involved;
the tensions between the ethnic communities; the pervasive climate of corruption at the time
of project effectiveness; and the limited institutional capacity. Indeed, Bank supervision
could be rated highly satisfactory except for the insufficient attention to consolidating the
performance monitoring framework: the team could have been more forceful in its
representations and interventions vis-&vis the ITA in this respect.


BORROWER PERFORMANCE

                                                                                21
55.     Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.


*'According to the harmonized evaluation criteria and the ratings assigned to implementing agency
performance and to outcome, overall borrower performance could be rated moderately satisfactory. In this case,
                                                      49


56.     Government performance. Government performance was moderately unsatisfactory.
The most evident shortcomings concerned the non-utilization of expensive testing and
laboratory equipment procured under the project for the RS, and the cessation of monitoring
of performance at customs. The signal accomplishment was the successful merger of the two
separate customs administrations and the deliberate ethnic re-mixing of customs personnel
(which had immediate positive implications for customs efficiency and integrity).

57.     Counterpart funding availability was a continuing issue, despite Bank representations
to the government to make the funds available. For this reason the team correctly signaled
financial performance as an area of concerns in FY04 -- although the intervention of the FM
specialist in the Country Office helped mitigate those concerns.

58.     Implementing agency performance. Implementing agency performance was
satisfactory. Establishing a single project implementation unit at state level (rather than
separate ones in each entity) was a major step forward at the time of project approval, and
was facilitated by the fact that a decision in principle had already been taken to eventually
unify the two customs administrations, and that by the political division of labor in BiH
customs is listed as a state responsibility.

59.   The implementation unit performed well, on both the procurement and the financial
management side, and the key people were later mainstreamed into the Ministry of
Transport.

60.    A particular procurement issue arose from by a Bosnian law by which local
contractors would be taxable but not foreign contractors. This issue was side-stepped when
the ICB was won by a foreign company, which then proceeded to subcontract over 90
percent of the activities to local contractors (as it had committed in its bid proposal).

61,    After the ITA came into full operations in January 2005, implementation was much
simplified, although by then the project was drawing to an end and the separate locations of
the ITA in Banja Luka and the Ministry of Transport in Sarajevo (despite the good reasons
for such separate locations) posed some logistic problems for cooperation.




___


however, a greater weight should be assigned to government performance as the major determinant of project
impact over time, especially considering the failure to continue to monitor customs performance after project
closing.

Annex B. Evaluation of the Trade and Transport
Facilitation Project in Moldova


Summary: Project Outcome and Lessons
1.      The Trade and Transport Facilitation (TTF) Project for Moldova, supported by an
IDA credit of US$7.21 million equivalent, was the last in the first series of TTF projects in
eight Southeastern European countries. It was approved in June 2003, effective in December
2003, and closed on schedule in September 2007. The objectives of the project were to
reduce non-tariff costs to trade and transport and reduce smuggling and corruption at border
crossings. These objectives, strategy and general design were similar to those of the other
projects in the TTFSE Program, but the weight of components differed as also did certain
aspects of implementation experience.


MAIN FINDINGS

2.      Overall project outcome is rated Satisfactory. The evidence demonstrates that the
development objectives have been achieved to a substantial extent, and intervening events
make the risk to development outcome negligible to low. In particular, further progress
occurred after project closing in both trade facilitation and reduction of corruption from its
very high levels (although corruption remains a major problem). Performance monitoring
has continued; important procedural and organizational changes were made in the Moldova
Customs Service (including new leadership); and the recently-elected government appears
determined to accelerate reforms, including in trade and customs.

3.       The major problem remains the Chisinau customs terminal, a bottleneck to both
efficiency and integrity. No institutional improvements could have any impact given the
cramped and dilapidated facilities (which are also a convenient alibi for customs,
phytosanitary and veterinary inspectors not to improve their performance). In addition, new
IT modules need to be developed and plugged into the Automated System for Customs Data
(ASYCUDA)-World, and annual surveys of corruption in customs and related services can
should be conducted to track progress and identify specific areas of intervention. 28




  Further Bank assistance to Moldova in these directions appears promising, if the position of the new
government is consolidated and the customs development plan continues to be implemented.

LESSONS


4.      Most of the lessons learned are the same as for the other TTFSE projects, as discussed
under the overall Program Assessment. Three additional lessons specific to the Moldova
project are:


       Integrating senior customs officials into the localproject teams is a major success
       factor. In Moldova, major synergies resulted from the assignment of a senior
        Moldova Customs Service (MCS) official to work closely with the PIU, with the
        latter focusing on project administration and fiduciary arrangements and the former
        ensuring the interface with the progress of the reforms.
        The "latecomer's advantage" can be important. For example, contrary to the
        criticism of ASYCUDA voiced in some other TTFSE countries, Moldovan
        respondents state their satisfaction with the system. This is because Moldova uses the
        newer version -- ASYCUDA World, which has the advantage of being internet-based
        and capable of interfacing with EU systems. (Other examples are mentioned later.)
        The assessment o tradefacilitation impact must encompass both the border posts
                          f
       and the inland terminals. When an inefficient procedure or bribe opportunity is
        eliminated at the border, resulting in a reduction in entry or exit time or transaction
        cost, one must ascertain whether the procedure or bribe opportunity has been
        eliminated altogether or simply shifted to the inland terminals. (The same point
       applies to infrastructural improvements.) The real "entry time" ends not with crossing
       the border, but with the final clearance of the cargo. While this lesson applies to all
       TTFSE projects (including in Serbia's Belgrade terminal), it is especially important in
       Moldova, where the substantial progress made in customs procedures and
       infrastructure at the border posts has not been matched by improvements at the
       Chisinau terminal - which has therefore become an increasingly serious bottleneck.


The Project
OBJECTIVES


5.      The development objectives of the Moldova project are similar to those of the other
seven TTFSE projects: (i) reducing non-tariff costs to trade and transport and (ii) increasing
revenue and compliance and reducing smuggling and corruption at border crossings. The
objectives were the same in the Project Appraisal Document and the Credit Agreement, and
neither they nor the components were revised during project implementation.
                                               54


COMPONENTS AND COSTS



6.       Although the menu of project components was similar for all TTFSE projects, the
number, weight and definition of each component were tailored to the specific country needs
and conditions. In Moldova, the number of components was larger than in other projects but
the cost emphasis was primarily on developing an integrated customs clearance and
information system (ICCIS) - which accounted for two-thirds of project cost -- with
institutional strengthening of customs a distant second. However, the dialogue emphasis was
as much on procedural and organizational reforms as on IT issues, and Bank supervision
gave equal attention to these complementary measures. The project was co-financed by the
U.S., which also provided a Customs Advisor.


7.      Actual disbursements were close to the appraised estimate. (Table 13.)
Disbursements under the IT and institutional strengthening components were higher than
estimated, but the difference was offset by lower expenditures on infrastructural
improvements and on project implementation. The shortfall in government contribution
should be attributed mainly to fiscal difficulties. Also, a significant in-kind contribution was
made through the assignment of senior customs officials to work closely with the project
implementation unit (PIU). In any case, the shortfall in government contribution was about
equal to the contingencies provided for at appraisal but not required.

Implementation Experience
MONITORING EVALUATION
         AND

8.       The M&E framework for the Moldova project is similar to that of the other seven
projects, discussed in the Program Assessment. M&E design, implementation and utilization
are all rated substantial.

9.      Briefly, one set of indicators monitored the time and cost (including "facilitation"
payments) of regional road travel; another addressed cost effectiveness in customs and
revenue mobilization; and a third measured the performance of border agencies at selected
"pilot" sites (primarily the documentary requirements, delays, and incidence of bribery). As
in most of the other countries, the "pilot" sites accounted for the bulk of total trade.*'

10.      A major improvement, based on the experience of the other TTFSE projects, was the
introduction of user surveys on the quality of customs services and incidence of bribery -
which produced a much fuller picture of the impact on corruption than had been possible i n .
other countries, and also served as precedent for similar follow-up surveys-another
illustration of the latecomer's advantage.

11.      Monitoring was systematic, with regular progress reports. Also, unlike some other
countries (e.g., Bosnia-Herzegovina), it was used as a basis for evaluation, interpretation of
performance data, and recommendations to the MCS top management and coordinators of
pilot sites, with a major contribution made by the U.S. Customs Advisor.

12.     Like Serbia, Moldova too has continued to monitor customs performance after the
end of the TTFSE project. They have adapted the indicators, and also expanded monitoring
to four additional customs posts, three at the border and one inland. A Performance
Monitoring Committee chaired by the MCS Deputy Director General, was established in
2008 to continue regular monitoring of customs and border agency performance based on a
detailed and clear methodology, Although derived from the TTFSE M&E framework, in
some respects the new methodology is an improvement over the project performance
indicators. 30 At the time, new forms were elaborated for reporting by customs posts, but
currently the paper forms are being replaced by automatic entry into the monitoring software.



13.    Environmental and social safeguards. The project was classified as Category C
under the Bank's safeguard policies, as it would have no impact on the physical and social
environment. No safeguard issues arose during project implementation.




*' sites were the Chisinau inland terminal, the Leuseni and Cahul posts on the western border, and the
 The
Palanka-Tudora post on the Ukrainian border.

14.     Fiduciary aspects. The procurement and financial management arrangements were
satisfactory and so was their implementation - with timely submission of the quarterly
financial reports and unqualified opinions rendered by the independent auditor. The
performance by the PIU was reportedly sound and was made more effective by the regular
liaison with a senior MCS official designated for this purpose. 31



RELEVANCE

15.    Overall relevance is rated High, on account of high relevance of both the objectives
and the design. The design of the project also took advantage of the experience of the earlier
TTFSE projects.

16.     Objectives. The twin objectives of reducing non-tariff costs to trade and transport and
increasing revenue and compliance and reducing smuggling and corruption were in line with
Moldova's own development and poverty-reduction strategy and the Bank strategy (see
Moldova CAS, 2004.). Also, as discussed in the Program Assessment, the TTFSE Program
as a whole (and Moldova's project within it) was fully in keeping with the Bank strategy for
the region, and with the shared international interest in the improvement of policies and
practices in Southeast European countries and harmonization of their standards and norms
with those of the European Union - as expressed in the creation of the Stability Pact and the
establishment of the trade liberalization working group.

17.     Design. The Moldova TTF project design was similar to that of the other TTFSE
countries. As the last of the eight countries in the first TTFSE series, the country had the
advantage of benefiting from the prior experience of the other TTFSE countries, including in
the project design, particularly in introducing the latest version of the ASYCUDA system.

18.     The Government interest in trade facilitation was strongly supported by the private
sector. The Chamber of Commerce was given responsibility for implementing the training
component, and the AITA (International Road Transport Association) for implementing the
ICT component.32 The project design was also consistent with a development action plan
prepared by Moldovan customs in 2002. (A more comprehensive plan was developed in
2008.)



EFFICACY

19.     The project's overall efficacy is rated modest, based on substantial achievement of
the trade facilitation objective and modest achievement of the corruption reduction objective.

31 Unlike the other countries, where the PIU consultants were either integrated into the customs service or were
still in the country, the consultants in the Moldova TTFSE PIU had left and could not be contacted, but other
respondents viewed their work as satisfactory.
32   The initial intention was to assign all these responsibilities to the Chamber of Commerce.

Reduction o non-tariff cost to trade and transport
           f

20.     Trade expansion. Moldova's trade has expanded rapidly during the project period
and in the two subsequent years. Although in 2009 the economy was severely affected by the
global economic crisis, the Central Bank's support of the lei through purchases of $600
million of foreign exchange in 2008-09-reportedly for pre-election political reasons-had a
substantial impact on keeping the price of imports down and thus supporting their volume. 33
Prospects are favorable, however. Although the effects of the preferential agreement with the
EU are not yet tangible, the new Convention on Border Traffic has removed politicization
from Moldova-Romanian relations and opened up fresh possibilities of cooperation with the
EU, and new negotiations with the EU haven been initiated for a new preferential agreement
and a free-trade area arrangement with Romania. More generally, the political changes in
Moldova after the 2009 parliamentary elections should also make for easier external relations
and cooperation. The expansion in merchandise trade is shown in Table 14.

21.     Supportive evidence of the expansion in imports from the start of the TTFSE project
to date is provided by the increase in the number of customs declarations, shown in Table 15.
Although this does not precisely track the trend in either volume or value of imports, and the
number of trucks is necessarily lower than the number of declarations (as one cargo may
entail more than one declaration) the number of customs declarations is a reasonable proxy
for import road traffic. (A comparison of the value of imports with the number of customs
declaration is revealing, as discussed later.)

22.     It is important to note the sharp decrease in customs declarations at the Chisinau
inland terminal compared to the rest of the country-especially after 2006. Part of the
explanation is the change in origin of imports after Romania accession to the EU on January
2007. Another part of the explanation is the move to a single-window at the border posts. In
any event, the data confirm that Chisinau terminal remains by far the largest bottleneck to
import facilitation in Moldova--and increasingly so in recent years.

23.     Tradefacilitation. Although it is not possible to quantify the proportion of
Moldova's trade expansion to be attributed to the trade and transport facilitation provisions
of the project, it is plausible that they contributed significantly, as shown by the reduction in
clearance times and other indicators of the TTFSE-induced improvements in customs
procedures and transport infrastructure. Table 16 summarizes the main results during the
project period. The economic and practical importance of the reduction in entry clearance
time, from over three hours to less than an hour at border posts and from over eight hours to
two hours at Chisinau should not be underestimated, and the reduction in the "examination
rate" (percentage of trucks inspected) from nine in ten to fewer than one in three is a signal
achievement.

24.    Significant progress was also made in customs revenue collection and customs
administrative effectiveness. Between 2002 and 2006, customs revenue increased from $183
                                                      59


million to $5 15 (despite the substantial reduction in tariff rates during that period), and
average revenue collected per MCS employee more than doubled to $268,000.

25.     Progress made during the project continued after its closing. Performance indicators
continued to be systematically collected by the Government, and the methodology was
simplified and improved. As noted earlier, achievements occurring after the closing of the
projects can be considered linked to reform measures taken during and as a result of the
TTFSE project when whether the measures have been sustained after its end. In Moldova this
has been the case. The main results for 2008 are as follows:


      average entry clearance time at the inland terminal was reduced by a further 25 minutes
      to less than 99 minutes;
0     entry time at all border posts averaged 48 minutes, apparently the same as the 49
      minutes of 2007 but an actual improvement since all border posts were,included and
      not only the "pilot" posts where TTF improvements had been made; and
      average exit times at border posts decreased by a further 20% compared to 2007.



Reducing corruption and smuggling


Corruption in customs

26.    Smuggling remains endemic, especially from Ukraine and through de facto
autonomous Transnistria, although less than in earlier years, mainly through the EU efforts at
border monitoring. 34

27.     Corruption has been and continues to be pervasive throughout Moldova's public
sector, and among the worst among TTFSE countries, with a 3 1 percentile rating for overall
public integrity, although with noticeable overall improvements. (See text table 5 .) The
evidence concerning corruption in customs is mixed, but the preponderance of evidence is.on
the side of some slight progress.

28.     By the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey, the percentage of
businessmen who reported having to pay bribes at customs remained at about the same 15
percent through 2008 (although as noted later a separate survey found that the average bribe
amount declined. An assessment of November 2008 concluded that Moldovan customs had
made great progress in recent years and was no longer the primary source of costs and delays
for traders. By contrast, a report in April 2009 by a consulting firm for a major bilateral
donor reached negative conclusions-not only on the extent and deep roots of the problem but
also on the government efforts to improve the situation. That report, however, relied on

34 The more than 50 "casinos" in Chisinau - with hardly any customers but plenty of colored lights- are bright
evidence of the pervasive laundering of smuggling proceeds in Moldova. Tracking the number of such
establishments could be a rough partial indicator of changes in the incidence of smuggling.
                                                      60


doubtful methodology, did not attempt to assess the changes over time, and had
recommendations ranging from generic exhortations to unrealistic advice that salaries of
customs officers should simply be raised, without prior or concomitant strengthening of
genuine accountability. 35

29.      A statistically more reliable study (Carasciuc, 2007) found that after 2002 the MCS
took concrete steps toward transparency, dialogue with users, and corruption prevention. The
single most important step in that regard was the introduction of the newer version of the
ASYCUDA system, ASYCUDA-World, which has the advantage of being internet-based
and is capable of. interfacing with EU systems, especially the NCTS. 36 Additional factors of
improvement included the adoption of a customs code of ethics based on WCO experience;
the introduction of automated registration of customs transactions; the creation of a customs
brokerage system which has reduced the frequency of direct contacts with customs officers;
the practice of rotation of customs officers; and the creation of an anticorruption unit as well
as a hotline and an online system to register complaints. The study concluded that, "even if
currently not very efficient,,,these measures had some positive impact on the quality of
customs services" and the conclusion was confirmed by an opinion poll of business people
(ibid., p.48)

30.    As in trade facilitation, further progress occurred after 2006. Although bribery in
customs remained widespread, an updated survey of the changes in 2007 and 2008
(Transparency International/Moldova, 2009) found that:

a       The population is fully aware of the negative impact of corruption - listing corruption
        as the third highest concern, next to poverty and high unemployment.
a       The willingness to make unofficial payments is diminishing. The share of respondents
        ready to make unofficial payments to customs decreased slightly from 8 1% to 77%
        among businessmen and from 76% to 65% among households-and along with it the
        cost of corruption decreased.
a       The media is becoming more active in addressing public corruption issues, as
        reflected in the marked increase in the share of respondents who believe in the
        accuracy of corruption-related information provided by the media, from 40% to 50%
        of households and from 38% to 55% of businessmen.
0       The annual amount of bribes paid to police, customs, health, and tax services
        remained at a total of around $30 million equivalent in nominal terms, implying a
        decrease of around 10- 15 percent in real terms.
a       The incidence of bribery (including both "voluntary" and "coerced" payments)
        remained the highest in customs -- and indeed rose, from 68% of respondents in 2007
        to 75% in 2008. The incidence of corruption in the health services and the police also

35 Neither reports may be cited, as they were shared with IEG on the understanding that they could be used but
on a not-for-attribution basis.
36 The MCS is now working on tailoring ASYCUDA even closer to Moldovan needs-by          introducing a new
module for minimum customs valuation of goods and another for integrated tariffs as in the EU. The drawback
is the high cost of making such modifications-owing to the need for expensive UNCTAD expertise. (No
modification is needed to record company deposits required for customs clearance, which is effectively handled
through a separate software package, called "Ekonomist".)
                                                        61


         rose, respectively from 62% to 65% and from 45% to 51%. As could be expected, the
         average amount of bribe paid to police and health personnel went up as well.
         However, it went down for customs staff, and the average bribe paid by businessmen
         was cut by more than half from about $260 to $125 equivalent.
e        As a result, the total annual bribe paid to customs declined from over 20% of the
         amount of bribes paid in 2007 for those four public services, or $6 million--to under
         10% in 2008, or less than $3 million.
e        Paradoxically, respondents also became somewhat more skeptical concerning the
         probability of reducing corruption overall (although a hopeful three out of four
         believe that it is possible to do so). This is probably explained by the disturbing
         increase in both incidence and size of bribery in the health services and the police --
         to which the largest proportion of the citizens are exposed.

3 1.    Additional evidence of progress is provided by a comparison between the figures on
the value of imports during 2004-2008 (Table 14) to those on the number of import customs
declarations (Table 15). The 36 percent increase in number of customs declarations during
that period is a mere fraction of the almost five-fold expansion in the value of imports.
Consequently, the average unit value of import declarations more than doubled, from less
than $16,000 to over $32,000 per declaration. Although there can be a number of
explanations, this large change is consistent with the other evidence of a reduction in
corruption at Moldovan customs during the TTFSE project period. Moreover, although the
unit value of import declarations rose every year since 2004, the annual average increase of
13 percent during 2004-2006 pales in comparison with the 38 percent jump in the single year
between 2007 and 2008 (from a declared unit value of $23,300 in 2007 to $32,200 in
2008)-the year when the various reforms introduced in Moldovan customs in 2006 and
2007 could be presumed to begin to have a significant impact.



The TTFSE and corruption: Some caveats

32.     None of the above should be understood to imply that public corruption, including in
customs, does not remain widespread and a major hindrance to the country's development
and poverty reduction. Moreover, bribery is ductile and in the area of customs it may have
partly morphed into a more sophisticated form. While the introduction of the customs
brokerage system has been a major step forward, the state-owned brokerage firm
MOLDVAMA Group currently supplies at least one half of total trade brokerage services in
the country. Reportedly, customs officials are increasingly "encouraging" shippers to use
MOLDVAMA services instead of the 25-30 private customs brokerage firms, in exchange
for something of value.) 37

33.      Various other informal practices also persist. For example, physical examination of
transit cargo should occur only when the customs officer detects suspicious tampering with

37 Albeit outside the scope of this evaluation, the optimal policy response to this market distortion would be the
privatization of MOLDVAMA Group. Short of that, the government newly-elected in 2009 may wish to inquire
into the informal relationships between MOLDVAMA and some customs officials.
                                              62


the seals. However, a customs officer can allege such tampering as a way to justify a time-
consuming physical examination-which can be "waived" under the right circumstances.
This and other such practices cannot be combated by systems and computers but can be
reduced and eliminated, in time, by more active recourse to the corruption hotline and the
other complaint mechanisms, and a more assertive role of the media.

34.      Even if the improvements in integrity in customs are genuine, it is important to again
underline the difficulty of attributing them mainly to the TTFSE project. On the eastern
border, a major contribution has also been made by the EU Border Assessment Mission
(EUBAM) to combating smuggling (especially from Odessa), which EUBAM monitors. On
the western border, in addition to the TTFSE measures, a variety of economic and political
factors have affected the direction and composition of trade after Romania's EU accession.
(There is no evidence of change in corruption, positive or negative, on the de facto border
with Transnistria - nor did the PPAR evaluation attempt to collect any such evidence.)

35.     On balance, however, there is evidence of some reduction in smuggling and
corruption and the connection to the TTFSE reforms is likely--although, once again,
quantification of the impact of the project is not possible.



INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS


36.   Three major developments have taken place after the closing of the project in
September 2007 but as a direct outgrowth of it:

0      Building on the initial plan of 2002, an institutional development plan for the MCS
       during 2009-201 1 was approved in August 2008 and the first steps have been taken to
       begin implementing it. Based on a detailed analysis of the internal and external
       environment-including a realistic identification of opportunities and threats--the plan
       provides a roadmap for organizational, personnel, and procedural improvements
       addressed at improving customs transparency, integrity, responsibility, and partnership
       with other border control agencies. The two priority actions under the plan are the
       completion of electronic data-processing and a single-window system at border posts.
       (See MCS, 2008 for details).
0      The integrated information system elaborated in the framework of "ASYCUDA
       World" has been implemented at all border posts as of 2009. The system ensures
       automatic record keeping of cross-border transport and trade in goods, as well as the
       calculation and collection of taxes paid at the border, with ensuing direct major
       impact on reducing bribery opportunities.
0      The single-window system has been introduced, under a program approved by the
       Prime Minister in March 2009 (Box 2).
                                                       63


        Box 2. The "Single- Window" System at Moldova's Border Posts

 The single-window system comprises a series of legal and regulatory measures to coordinate the activities of
 the various border control bodies, as well as implementing the automated system for data exchange among
 them. As a key institutional step, the Moldova Customs Service has taken over the responsibility for control of
 international auto transport of goods and passengers, from a state enterprise that has been abolished. Also, the
 management of the infrastructure at the auto border-crossing points has been transferred from the separate
 control bodies to the unified management by the MCS. For convenience of the traders and the public, a new
 link to the "ghigeul unit"-single window--system has been introduced on the webpage of the Customs
 Service, containing all relevant information.

 h:
  Moldova Customs Service


37.     Also, training in the new laws and systems has been provided to staff through courses
and seminars with the participation of the representatives of the concerned border agencies;
dissemination activities to inform the public and the business community have been carried
out. The new monitoring forms introduced, as per the 2008 Order, are being phased out and
replaced with a system of inputting information directly in the computer. The border posts
chiefs and customs officers find the new system easier and better, and it is already fully
operational at the Leuseni border post, and is being expanded to other posts.

38.      Finally, the MCS has established a new "consultative committee" on customs issues,                     .
with representation from the largest associations of brokers and other private sector
participants, meeting bimonthly, and has decided to establish similar committees in the
districts-which will meet more often to iron out practical problems.

39.     These innovations are too recent for comprehensive information on their results to be
available. However, the PPAR has reviewed the quality of their design and the initial
implementation, including at one border post. On that basis, as well as anectodal information
from traders, the initial results are promising and the prospects are reasonably good for
further sustained progress in reducing bribery opportunities and transaction costs at the
border. (The same cannot be said of the inland terminal, as mentioned earlier.)



EFFICIENCY
40.     The project efficiency was high. The trade facilitation benefits flow mainly from the
47% cut in processing time at the border between 2002 and 2006, which produced an annual
saving to users estimated at almost US$7 million as of 2007. The indirect benefits through
trade expansion attributable to the project can be roughly estimated at an additional 20
percent, or $1.4 million per year (as explained in the main text.) The fiscal benefits flow from
improved customs procedures and information systems, with an increase in collections from
US$183 million in 2002 to US$5 15 million in 2006. Customs own administrative efficiency
rose, as measured by the decrease in the ratio of customs cost to revenue collected, from
2.4% to 1.6%. The reduction in corruption at customs appears to have produced additional
benefits for the users, which surveys allow to estimate at about $3 million a year-although
of course only a fraction would be attributable to the TTFSE project. (Benefits to the
                                                           64


    Government from lower corruption are already reflected in the increase in customs revenue
    and should not be double-counted.)

    4 1.    Overall, even discounting for the approximations in the above estimates, this US$9
    million investment has had an economic rate of return of at least 50% during the project
    period -not including the future stream of economic and financial benefits from the
    permanent reforms put in place through the project (as shown by the additional
    improvements registered in 2007 and 2008).

    42.     The training component was particularly cost-effective in terms of the Bank's
    contribution, because the very modest $90,000 from the credit was complemented by in-kind
    contributions from the Chamber of Commerce (in the form of its personnel, vehicles and
    seminar facilities) valued at an estimated $200,000. With the 700 participants to the 36
    seminars conducted under the TTFSE project, the Bank contribution thus amounted to an
    average of under $130 per participant. Although benefits from training are notoriously
    difficult to quantify, the feedback from participants was highly positive.



    OUTCOME
    43.    The project's overall outcome is rated Satisfactory. The sub-ratings for each of the
    two development objectives are shown in Table 17.

    RISKS TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

    44.      The overall risk to development outcomes is negligible to low. The Moldovan module                         .
    of the regional customs website is comatose, but the MCS has expanded and improved its
    own national website. (See www.customs.nov.md) 38 The training and dissemination
    activities formerly undertaken by the Chamber of Commerce have been mainstreamed into
    the MCS. Three developments reduce the risk even further: the institutional measures


    3 8 In principle, maintenance and updating of the Moldovan module of the regional website should be assured by
    the AITA, which was responsible for it under the project -- but AITA does not have the funding. In any case, a
    regional website would require regular submission of information from all participating countries. The lack of a
,   regional mechanism for that purpose implies the lack of motivation for individual country entities to continue to
    maintain it, but finctioning national websites are a perfectly valid alternative.
                                                65


described earlier; the decision to continue monitoring customs performance; and the
determination of the new government to accelerate and deepen the reform process in all areas
- including particularly service delivery and public integrity.




BANKPERFORMANCE

45.    Bank performance was satisfactory.

46.     Quality at entry. Quality at entry is rated satisfactory, owing to good project design
and recognition of institutional and capacity factors. The risk assessment was satisfactory as
well, although it would have been even stronger with more emphasis to systemic governance
issues.

47.     Quality o supervision. Supervision was satisfactory. The Bank team worked
                  f
diligently and with high commitment and competence to support the government to help
achieve the project objectives. Minor reallocations of funds between the components -
particularly to increase the investment in IT and institutional strengthening of the customs
service were appropriate and responsive. Despite the advantage built into the fact that the
Moldova project could follow on the established track of the previous projects, Bank
supervision added an important element of support and encouragement


BORROWER
       PERFORMANCE

48.    Overall, borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

49.      Governmentperformance. Government performance was satisfactory. Indeed, were
it not for the insufficient attention to the localized problem of the Chisinau inland terminal, it
could be rated highly satisfactory - especially considering the acceleration of reform
implementation after project closing. The major reshuffling at the top of the MCS is strong
evidence of government seriousness. Also, the MCS has been strengthened by the
appointment of some higher-level officials committed to improving integrity and efficiency
in customs (including one previously active in Transparency International.)

50.     Implementing agencyperformance. By the time of the PPAR mission, the
consultants in the Moldova TTFSE PIU had left and could not be contacted, but the evidence
points to satisfactory performance. The MCS designation of the head of the transit division
to work with the PIU helped both the performance of the PIU and the linkage between the
project activities and the broader reform efforts. As noted earlier, fiduciary arrangements
were implemented well. IT procurement should be singled out as an example of good
practice. The contract was won under ICB by a major IT multinational firm, and the system
was installed in only nine months from contract signing to operationalization. Although the
system is off-the-shelf, it still required some adjustments, which were dealt with
expeditiously and successfully.

Annex C. Evaluation of the Trade and Transport
Facilitation Project in Serbia

Summary: Project Outcome and Lessons
1.      The TTF project for Serbia, supported by an IDA credit of US$ million equivalent,
was the seventh in the first series of TTF projects in eight Southeastern European countries.
It was approved in June 2002, was effective in January 2003, and closed in March 2007, after
an extension justified by the slow initial start and necessary to finalize the completion of the
information system. The objectives of the project were to reduce non-tariff costs to trade and
transport and reduce smuggling and corruption at border crossings. These objectives, the
strategy and general design were the same as for the other projects in the TTFSE Program,
but the weight of the components differed as also did important aspects of implementation
experience, as discussed below.



MAINFINDINGS


2.     Based on high relevance, efficiency and efficacy, overall project outcome is rated
highly satisfactory.

3.      After a slow stari, project implementation accelerated, with major achievements in
trade facilitation, revenue mobilization, integrity and administrative effectiveness in customs.
Serbian customs, at the turn of the century under the previous regime one of the most corrupt
and least efficient in the region, has achieved by 2009 levels of efficiency and integrity that
are among the highest in the Balkans (alongside Croatia and Macedonia) and compare
favorably to those in some current members of the EU. Most telling is the EU declaration in
October 2009 that Serbian customs were the most improved in Europe. The risk to the
development outcome is negligible to low. In addition to the project- and sector-specific
provisions of sustainability, the general theme sounded by all respondents is that Serbia is
determined to be a modern and respected country, part of Europe and part of the world. This
popular consensus is the best assurance of ownership and durability of reforms, including in
transport and trade facilitation and in public integrity. 39




39
  Other than some targeted assistance on the IT side, the potential for a follow-up project appears limited - nor
would it be necessary, given the situation of Serbia in general and Serbian customs in particular.
                                              69


LESSONS

4.      Most of the lessons learned are the same as for the other TTFSE projects, as discussed
under the overall Program Assessment. Three additional lessons specific to the Serbia
project are:

       Manage expectations. This well-known prescription for project success was not
       internalized in the early period of TTF implementation. The downside of the
       unrealistic expectations was manifested in, among other things, over-ambitious and
       failed attempts at introducing "cutting edge" information technology in customs.
       Be patient, supportive and flexible. Related to the above, the appropriate response
       to the inevitable let down from unrealistic client expectations is constant reassurance
       of the validity of the effort combined with flexibility of advice and concrete support
       for client requests. It is this posture by the Bank that was primarily responsible for
       Serbia staying the course after the initial disappointments and slippages, and set the
       stage for the subsequent major achievements.
       Not by bread alone. While the salary increase for customs staff was important to
       support the major reforms in trade facilitation and customs integrity, and enforcement
       of regulations, at least as important was the new sense of professional pride instilled
       in the customs staff - with each achievement reinforcing professionalism and self-
       respect, which in turn led to greater credibility vis-&vis the citizens and was
       instrumental for further progress.


The Project
OBJECTIVES

5.      The development objectives of the Serbia project are: (i) reducing non-tariff costs to
trade and transport and (ii) reducing smuggling and corruption at border crossings. They
were the same in the project appraisal document and the loan agreement and were not revised
during project implementation.



COMPONENTS AND COSTS

6.      Although the menu of project components was similar for all TTFSE projects, the
weight and definition of each component were tailored to the specific country needs and
conditions. In Serbia, the main cost element was for IT systems, but a sizeable sum was
dedicated to institutional modernization of the customs agency. (Table 18.) As in many other
cases, the IT component cost more than envisaged. The project was co-financed by the EU
Customs and Fiscal Assistance Office (CAFAO) and the US. The US assistance, however,
was curtailed midway through the project owing to an unrelated political issue.

* Data relate to the original project for Serbia and Montenegro, before the latter's independence in 2006.
However, Serbia itself accounted for almost 90% of project cost (exclusive of trade facilitation and program
implementation).

7.      Actual disbursements were close to the estimate, although the cost of the informatics
component was significantly underestimated, and disbursements under the institutional
modernization component were lower, The government contribution was only about half the
amount agreed at appraisal, but was supplemented by more intensive participation by
customs officials in project implementation, the cost of which also was lower than estimated
at appraisal.


Implementation Experience
8.      The project was designed just at the time of the change in political regime. (The first
identification mission for the Serbia TTFSE coincidentally took place when Slobodan
Milosevic was extradited to the Hague). The new political leadership and public managers
came in with a strong mandate to "break with the past", change the way everything worked
and shake the established practices. In some sectors, excessive expectations and unrealistic
hopes for quick success contributed to the early disappointing reform implementation
experience.

9.       Political instability was high in Serbia in the early years after regime change. This
entailed among other things frequent changes in the leadership of the Customs
Administration, with four Directors-General in 2002-2006, each with his own ideas and
priorities about customs reform. This lack of continuity at the top caused serious
uncertainties and delays-especially at the start of the project.

10.     Essentially, the year 2002-2003 was dedicated to preparing the legal foundation for
the reforms, and a hiatus followed in 2002-03 after the appointment of a new Director-
General and as a result of political issues. Disbursements were minimal and no meaningful
progress was being made. Thereafter, project implementation accelerated very rapidly -as
                                                        71


shown by the data on disbursements and, more importantly, by the trade facilitation
indicators.) With the emergence of these positive results, project ownership became strong
and the government embedded the project result framework into its own practices and
continues monitoring the performance indicators and reporting them regularly to the Bank to
this day, three years after project closing.



MONITORING EVALUATION
         AND

11.      The M&E framework for the Serbia TTF is similar to that of the other seven projects,
discussed in the Program Assessment. Briefly, one set of indicators monitored the time and
cost (including "facilitation" payments) of regional road travel; another addressed cost
effectiveness in customs and revenue mobilization; and a third measured the performance at
selected "pilot" sites. As in the other countries, the "pilot" sites accounted for the bulk of
total trade.40 The M&E design is rated substantial, and implementation and utilization are
rated high, and overall M&E substantial.

12.     A major improvement in the case of Serbia compared with the other TTFSE countries
was that customs calculated entry time as including procedures, including phytosanitary,
veterinary and other inspections required etc., whereas the other countries only include the
time to clear customs. (This makes the progress made even more noteworthy.) Monitoring
was systematic, with regular progress reports. Also, unlike some other countries, monitoring
was used as a basis for evaluation, interpretation of performance data, and formulation of
reform. A major contribution was made in all these respects by the US-funded external
adviser.

13.    Like Moldova, Serbia has continued to monitor customs performance after the end of
the TTFSE project, and reports regularly to the Bank office in Belgrade.

14.    Environmental and social safeguards The project was classified as Category C
under the Bank's safeguard policies, as it would have no impact on the physical and social
environment. No safeguard issues arose during project implementation.

15,     Fiduciary aspects. The procurement and financial management arrangements were
satisfactory and so was their implementation - with timely submission of the quarterly
financial reports and unqualified opinions rendered by the independent auditor. There were
shortfalls in the anticipated counterpart funding. However, owing to the increased in-kind
contribution by Serbian customs staff, no implementation difficulties resulted.

16. Some delays were experienced, in procurement as a result of staffing problems and in
    financial management from the departure of the FM specialist, but were promptly
    addressed by closer coordination with and assistance by Bank staff.


40 The sites were the Belgrade inland terminal, and the border posts of Batrovci (Croatia), Gradina (Bulgaria),
Horgos (Hungary) and Presevo (Macedonia). The Belgrade terminal is the largest and the border posts are
located along the Pan-European Transport Corridor Ten.

RELEVANCE
17.    Overall relevance is rated high, on account of high relevance of both the objectives
and the design.

18.      Objectives. The twin objectives of reducing non-tariff costs to trade and transport and
reducing smuggling and corruption were in line with Serbia's own strategy, and especially
the drive for closer relations and possible eventual membership in the EU. The project was
fully in keeping with the Bank strategy for the region, and with the common interest of the
international community in the improvement of policies and practices in Southeast European
countries and harmonization of their standards and norms with those of the European Union
- as expressed in the creation of the Stability Pact and the establishment of the trade
liberalization working group. The Transitional Support Strategy of 200 1, that underpinned
renewed Bank support to the then-Federal Republic of Yugoslavia after the end of sanctions,
listed the TTFSE as one of the priority investment projects with an impact on all four major
reforms to be supported by the Bank, the EU, and other major donors. 41 (See also Serbia
and Montenegro CPS, Nov 2004 and, for the continued priority on trade facilitation after the
project closing, the Serbia CPS of Nov 2007 covering 2008-201 1.)

19.     Modernization of Serbian customs started in 200 1, after the political change of 2000,
and the timing of the TTFSE project fit closely with the political economy developments.
Also, the Bank was the first organization to come in to help Serbia after the lifting of
sanctions, not only with funding but with advice and support, and the Bank staff became
practically part of the project team, in a genuine partnership.

20.   Design. The informatics component was the most important, in view of the obsolete
systems then in place; a substantial amount was dedicated to institutional modernization of
customs; and a deliberate decision was taken against investing in civil works.

2 1,    The risks were appropriately and realistically identified and the project was rightly
classified as substantial risk. That the most severe risks did not materialize is due mainly to
the political progress in the country and, to a minor but notable extent, to the mitigation
measures put in place through the project, and primarily the built-in participation of private
traders to counterbalance pressure from domestic pressure groups and the building of
financial management capacity and controls during project preparation. (The risk that some
of the cofinancing might fall through was mentioned, and when it did materialize with the
suspension of US advisory assistance, timely action by the Bank and the project
implementation team helped forestall damage to the project.)




41These reforms were: "(i) restoring macroeconomic stability and external balance; (ii) stimulating growth and
creating the basis for a sustainable supply response; (iii) improving social well-being of the most vulnerable and
building human capital; and (iv) investing in improved governance and effective institutions." (p.5.)

EFFICACY

22.     The project's overall efficacy is rated high, based on high achievement of both the
cost-reduction and corruption-reduction objectives.



Reducing non-tariff costs to trade and transport


23.     Trade expansion. Serbia's merchandise trade has expanded rapidly during the project
period and subsequently, as shown in Table 19. A 23% annual rate of increase in trade during
the project period 2002-2006 was followed by a 3 1% annual increase in the two subsequent

24.     It is of course impossible to quantify the proportion of Serbia's trade expansion to be
attributed to the trade and transport facilitation provisions of the project, in light of the many
other factors also contributing to that expansion (including the rehabilitation of major road
transport corridors.) The likelihood that the TTFSE contributed significantly is shown by the
reduction in clearance times and other indicators of the improvements in customs procedures
put in place under the project, discussed next.


25.     Tradefacilitation: Achievements during the project. Table 20 summarizes the main
results under the TTFSE indicators during the project period. (Exit times are included for the
sake of completeness, but are much less meaningful as indicators of customs performance, as
they depend mainly on what happens on the other side of the border, including both
procedural obstacles and infrastructural bottlenecks.) Average import clearance time at
borders was cut from almost two-and-a-half hours to less than one hour, and the rate of
physical examination of trucks was reduced from 26 to 8 percent 42

42
    An indication of the extent of the improvements is that Turkish trucks still use Serbian roads to travel to
Hungary even after Bulgaria joined the EU. Some observers even suspect the improvement in entry time is a
little too good to be true, since the time includes not only customs but also the other inspections that may be
required. While inaccuracies in reporting, accidental or deliberate, can never be excluded, neither the data nor

* Clearance performance at borders is the unweighted mean ofperformance at thefour "pi1ot"posts of
Batrovci, Gradina, Horgos and Presevo. The "Examination rate" is the percentage of trucks inspected,
which is expected to decline as a result of the introduction of risk analysis and information technology.


26.      In contrast with the experience in Moldova and some other TTFSE countries, the
progress at border posts was fully matched by the improvement at the Belgrade inland
terminal, where entry clearance time was reduced from a peak of almost four hours in 2004
to less than an hour in 2006, with comparable progress registered in the truck examination
rate. (A major explanation of the difference is the availability of much better physical
facilities in Belgrade than in Chisinau, including the critical factor of parking.) In the case of
Serbia, therefore, there is no concern that improvements at border posts may simply have
shifted the bottlenecks inland.

27.     Tradefacilitation: Achievements after project closing. Because there is a risk of
falsely attributing to the projects progress registered after their closing date but associated
with other events (or, conversely, slippages not due to any shortcoming in the projects
themselves), it is important to judge whether achievements occurring after the closing of the
projects were linked to reform measures taken during and as a result of the projects
themselves. This is generally the case of institutional development-intensive projects, and of
the long-gestating nature of the impact from transport and trade facilitation measures. A key
factor in that judgment is thus whether the measures undertaken as a result of the TTFSE
project have been sustained after its end. In Serbia (as in Moldova), this has been the case.
The Government continued after the closing of the TTFSE project to monitor performance of
customs so on the basis of the same performance indicators as the TTFSE itself, and take
appropriate action. (This demonstration of ownership is reinforced by the continued

the interviews of a variety of stakeholders suggest any systematic inaccuracy. Moreover, such inaccuracies
would have had to be consistently replicated from month to month, year to year, and post by post-consistency
that would not be easy to achieve. (Even then, if the margin of error, however large, remains relatively
constant, the change in the numbers reported would accurately reflect the real underlying change.) Finally, the
visit to both the "pilot" and "non-pilot" border posts did not reveal long lines of trucks waiting to enter the
customs area.
                                                    75


partnership evident in the regular voluntary reporting of the information to the Bank office in
Belgrade.) As Table 21 shows, the rapid gains in trade facilitation achieved during the project
period were largely preserved in subsequent years, with some slippage in entry clearance
time at Belgrade terminal. A slight slippage appeared to occur at the border posts in 2008
but, once again, as a result of a major increase in delays at both entry and exit at the Gradina
post on the Bulgarian border - with clearance time at the other three border posts improving
further to an average of about 30 minutes for entry and under three minutes for exit. In 2009,
progress resumed across the board, to just over a half hour on average for a truck to clear
entry into Serbia. Overall, these indicators of customs Performance compare favorably with
the other countries in Southeast Europe, including those that are members of the European
Union, as shown in the main text.

28.     Although entry clearance time is still longer than the 20-minute target, in hindsight
the target was unrealistic considering the need to take into account the time required for
police, phytosanitary and veterinary inspections - in addition to customs itself. (As noted,
Serbia calculates entry time as including all required inspections and not only customs.)
Conversely, the 20 percent target for the rate of trucks examined turned out to be
insufficiently ambitious considering the risk analysis put in place and the other facilitation
measures -- as shown by the much better performance achieved in practice.

Revenue and customs effectiveness

29.      The progress in revenue collection and customs administrative performance was
substantial. As Table 22 shows, between 2002 and 2006 customs revenue increased
fivefold, from US$567 million to $3.6 billion, and average revenue collected per MCS
employee jumped tenfold from,less than $200,000 to over $1.3 million. Although the
revenue increase resulted in large measure from the overall trade expansion experienced by
Serbia during the period and only in small part from the project reforms, it is strongly
indicative of the TTFSE impact that revenue collections per staff member increased much
faster than the value of imports per staff member, demonstrating much greater efficiency of
                                                76


collections, which was in turn related to the better enforcement of regulations and valuations
fostered by the project.

30.     It is not coincidental that the substantial 143% increase in average salaries for
customs staff took place during the same period as the six-fold jump in revenue collected per
staff member. The positive salary incentive, combined with the other measures to strengthen
accountability in the customs system, was critical to produce the revenue outcome. A classic
non-sequitur in debates on anti-corruption strategies is to presume that because very low
salaries are associated with high bribery, increasing salaries will reduce corruption. Common
sense as well as international evidence, instead, demonstrates that the only outcome of
raising salaries, without any other change in the incentive framework, is to . , . raise salaries.
Very low salaries may be sufficient for corrupt behavior, but are not necessary. However,
when salaries are increased in conjunction with institutional measures to strengthen
accountability and rule enforcement the impact can be powerful, as demonstrated in Serbia
by the large increase in the unit value of import declarations and the even more remarkable
increase in customs revenue collected per customs staff member.

3 1.    It is also noteworthy that the salary increase was partly enabled by the measures to
reduce employment - containing the total increase in customs cost and indirectly also raising
the skill and competence profile of customs personnel. Although no retrenchment was
explicitly called for in the project, the project targets for improving customs administrative
effectiveness did carry organizational implications which, in the case of Serbia, were
appropriately addressed by a combination of improved incentives and gradual reduction in
force.

Reducing corruption and smuggling


32,     The general climate. According to all sources, including the media, transparency in
government has gone up substantially in the last ten years, and the progress in reducing
corruption has been notable throughout the public sector. In contrast to earlier times,
corruption is no longer considered normal and is not tolerated--either by the citizenry or by
the political leaders (who are now accountable to the citizens). The most important factors in
this development have been liberalization and governance improvement - reinforced by a
generational change. The improvement of integrity in customs has been a leading contributor
to this major general reduction in public corruption. As a result, based on the mission
interviews, customs officers are now increasingly seen, and see themselves, as professionals.
This new sense of professional pride was asserted by every customs officer interviewed.

33.     As measured by the Transparency International (TI) Corruption Perception index,
Serbia has made significant improvements during the TTFSE project period and thereafter,
with the index improving from a low 2.3 in 2003 (and a 97 rank worldwide, lower than two
thirds of the countries surveyed) to 3.5 in 2008 -about the average for the TTFSE countries
and ranking 83rd out of 180 countries worldwide. Moreover, because perception typically
lags behind realities and the TI index is based on surveys conducted during the previous two
years, improvements in public integrity are systematically understated by changes in the TI
index. (McFerson, 2009.)

34.   In addition to the corruption perception surveys of TI, there are several important
examples of the Government's determination to improve public integrity:


   0   a number of very well-connected persons involved in skimming road tolls were
       indicted and, in November 2009, found guilty;
   0   the founder of the TI/Serbia chapter was appointed to head the public procurement
       agency;
   0   a person well-known as committed to transparency in government was selected as
       chief public information officer;
       partly as a result of the above, while the Freedom of Information Act was ineffective
       during the first couple of years after introduction, since 2007 it has been increasingly
       used and has made a real difference - especially in responsiveness to media requests,
       and a new law being considered in Parliament will have stronger enforcement
       provisions.'

35.    According to TI/Belgrade and media interviews, procurement is the main remaining
locus of public corruption in Serbia, with customs near the bottom.



36.    Corruption in customs. Under the Milosevic regime, corruption in customs was
wide-spread. According to a 2001 corruption survey conducted in the context of the project,
84 percent of Serbs believed that there was "much" or "very much'' corruption in customs
                                                       78


and three in four respondents considered that the majority of customs officials were
complicit.

37.     Since then, corruption in customs was reduced significantly. According to the BEEPS
survey, the percentage of businessmen who reported having to pay bribes at customs fell
from 24 percent in 2005 to less than 9 percent in 2008. (Owing to changes in BEEPS survey
methodology, it is not possible to compare pre-2005 and post-2005 results.) Quantifying
reductions in smuggling (previously associated to a major extent with the situation in the
neighboring Republika Srpska, a component entity of Bosnia-Herzegovina), is especially
difficult, but interviews with government officials, private business, and the media uniformly
conclude that smuggling was cut very substantially. However, this development should be
mainly attributed to the major overall improvement in the integrity of the public sector in
Serbia and positive political developments, and only to an undefined secondary extent to the
TTFSE project itself. It is also important to point out that corruption at the border is
different from corruption at customs, as Box 3 explains.

                                Box 3. Who Really Steals at the Border

 Although corruption in customs is a stubborn reality in most countries, corruption at Serbian customs tends to
 be systematically exaggerated in public perception. First, the shippers? practice of giving intermediary
 forwarding agents ?facilitation? money leads them to assume that the money is given to customs officers as
 bribes although it may be in fact partly or entirely kept by the forwarding agents themselves. Second, when
 travelers have to leave goods behind because of unwillingness to pay duties or infringement of regulations,
 they typically believe that the goods are appropriated by the customs officers-whether or not this is the case.
 (See Begovic et al, 2002.)

 Most importantly, corruption at the border must be distinguished from corruption in customs. Much of the
 bribery occurring at Serbian border posts has not involved customs officials, but phytosanitary, veterinary or
 other inspectors. In such cases, measures targeted at the customs service alone are unlikely to reduce
 corruption in cross-border trading. During its implementation, the TTFSE project did take this issue into
 account. Indeed, for this among other purposes the SCA has decided to measure entry clearance time as
 including not only customs but all border formalities and requirements.




38.    Among the several TTFSE measures, those most contributing to the reduction of
corruption and smuggling can be singled out as follows:


     0   introduction of risk analysis, which allows better detection of irregularities, by
         focusing inspectors? attention and customs resources on ?high-risk? shipments, while
         closing off a bribe opportunity from discretionary inspection of low-risk shipments;
     0   provision of border control detection equipment;
         regular dialogue established between customs and the private sector, which provided
         contestability as well as a venue for practical suggestions of improvement.

39.    However, by far the most important factor in sharply curtailing smuggling had
nothing to do with the TTFSE. Until about 2002, the border between Serbia and the
                                                          79


Republika Srpska in Bosnia-Herzegovina was very porous (in large measure owing to the
common political agendas and attitudes of the two regimes and, in some cases, the military
service of customs personnel on the two sides of the official border.) Since then, Serbia has
hardened its borders with the RS into real borders with real controls.

40.     Aside from smuggling, Transparency International/Serbia considers, along with other
sources, that major improvements in integrity have been registered in customs and at the
borders during the last six years. As a result, with public procurement rising to be the largest
source of corruption in Serbia, reported corruption in customs is far down the line (compared
to being at or near the top at the turn of the century), and accounts for only about one-tenth of
complaints, according to the Anti-corruption Legal Advice Center (ALAC) 43, The ALAC
has a "10- 10-10" rule of thumb for the incidence of complaints of corruption in customs: of
10 complaints of corruption a week, 10 percent concern customs, and 10 percent of these
show enough evidence to open a case. This means that just five investigations of corruption
in customs are opened by ALAC each year.

41.     The ALAC also notes that complaints of corruption in customs generally relate to
collusion between the shipping firms and the customs officers--since citizens rarely deal with
customs directly any longer. Because Serbs are still prone to believing the worst (considering
the not-so-old history), when the freight forwarder asks for a certain sum of money for
"facilitation"the client assumes the money is intended to bribe customs officers, although it
may simply be pocketed by the freight forwarder. But all interviewees agree that most
corrupt practices that were formerly routine have disappeared, as for example the
requirement that bus passengers disembark at the borders while customs officers "inspected"
(and lightened) their luggage. 44


Institutional developments


42.     Legal reforms. The first important step, after sanctions were lifted in 2000, was
Serbia's return to the TIR convention (Transport International Routier), and signature of the
related protocols with traders, truckers, etc.

43.     The most important reform supported by the TTFSE was passage of the new Customs
Code. (Delays in presentation of the Code to Parliament were responsible for the six-month
delay in the date of project effectiveness.) The new Code enabled harmonization with EU

43The ALAC in Belgrade was established in 2006 within TI/Serbia (which was itself founded in February
200 1.) ALAC centers were previously established in Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
44 Of course, complaints received by ALAC are only a fraction of total complaints, with other complaints
addressed to the customs service itself, or not raised at all. Also, other possibilities of corruption never come to
the surface when the state is the only injured party other than the state, and neither the bribe giver nor the bribe
receiver have an interest in complaining. For example, the law provides for a waiver of the customs duty on
automobiles imported by the disabled - who are a large number because of the casualties from the civil war and
the events in the late 1990s -- and the certification of "disability" is open to a certain degree of flexibility, at a
price. This is not a customs problem, per se, but underlines once more the need for cooperation among all
entities involved in cross-border trade and related transactions.
                                                      80


regulations and the introduction of selectivity through risk analysis. The very idea of
selectivity in inspections was a true revolution in the mindset of the customs administration,
which for forty years had been legally required to inspect every single shipment, and the
introduction of risk analysis had a major positive impact on customs facilitation and integrity.

44.     In addition to political instability and changes in leadership of customs, already noted,
the reason for the initial delays in project implementation was the need to set firmly in place
the new legal foundation and the accompanying regulations. By 2004, when this had been
accomplished, the reforms moved very fast. This is confirmed by the performance indicators
which, after the initial hiatus (and, for the Belgrade terminal, even a major step backward)
showed a very rapid improvement after 2004. (See Tables 20 and 21 .)

45.      The legal reforms and other institutional measures also made it possible for the
Government to adopt in January 2006 the new National Strategy of Integrated Border
Management-with three pillars: cooperation within customs, cooperation among border
agencies, and international cooperation. Before that date, the police was in control of the
borders; all agencies involved were on an equal footing and each had its own jurisdiction
(and thus accountability); and the incentives to cooperate were weak. Even after the National
Strategy was promulgated cooperation at the border left something to be desired, as
cooperation at headquarter levels was still not on firm grounds. This issue was addressed in
May 2009, with the formation of a Border Coordination Committee comprising the Ministers
of Health, Infrastructure, Interior, Agriculture and of course Finance. The significance of this
step is underlined by the fact that the committee is principals-only,

46.     Other steps. Other concrete steps that have been taken by the Serbian Customs
      Administration (SCA) include:

      0   The SCA organizational structure was modernized, with new organizational units
          established; in particular,
      0   a strong internal integrity department was created;
      0   a 24-hour citizen complaint phone line was set up in February 2010; 45
      0   electronic transmission of information on empty trucks, providing advance notice on
          which trucks are empty and thus an early warning when the electronic data do not
          match;
      0   Serbia volunteered as a pilot for the World Customs Organization (WCO) initiative to
          assure the integrity of persons working on customs--one of few countries to do so.
          (The initiative has been launched with a first seminar in February 20 10.)

47.     The IT issue. With the new legislation opening the door to selectivity and risk
analysis, putting in place the right IT systems in customs was critical. IT systems were totally
obsolete before the project and had been upgraded when the project closed. Getting there was
not easy, however. As noted, the political change after 2000 brought to power a new group
eager for change and determined to shake up all the old practices. The first IT director under
the new leadership at Customs was an IT expert, interested in cutting-edge systems and


'' The first such hotline was operational on the Bulgaria-Macedonia border as early as December 2005.
                                                        81


criticized by some for insufficient consideration of actual needs and realities. A more
conservative approach was followed by subsequent leaders, but lack of clear direction and
insufficient coordination led to some difficulties and delays in putting in place a functioning
system. (For example, the shift of responsibility for border control from the army to the
police was effected without coordinating with the IT departments. As a result, in some cases
IT equipment was purchased that was suitable for the army but was not compatible with the
police systems.)


48.     The electronic one-stop-shop system that was envisaged at the start to be introduced
quickly provides the integrated information in real time that can facilitate both trade and
regulatory enforcement. However, it is complex to implement and very challenging, as it
requires active cooperation across a number of border agencies, a solid understanding of
technology and strong leadership in place. These factors were not present at the start of the
TTFSE project. There is an argument that Serbia would have been better off with a step-by-
step approach beginning with picking one of the off-the-shelf computerized cargo clearance
packages that are available. Off-the-shelf software will perform with minor hassles and few
adjustments (as in the Moldova experience), but may not be easily adjusted if it is
inconsistent with proprietary systems, lacks flexibility and is somewhat of a black box.
Views on off-the-shelf versus customized IT packages differ among the experts. This
evaluation lacks sufficient competence to come to a conclusion on the general issue, but
concerning Serbia, the situation is clear. The attempt at "Big Bang" introduction of cutting-
edge IT systems was responsible for the initial delays (and, as noted earlier, almost led the
Bank to cancel the project). However, the SCA caught up after the change in leadership, and
particularly in the last two years, and effectively modernized IT systems and trained the
personnel--as verified among other things by IEG visits to the pilot border posts. While the
implementation of the full electronic "one-stop-shop" system integrating customs with all
other inspections is not yet complete, the IT systems in place in late 2009 are a vast
improvement over the previous IT systems and have contributed significantly to the customs
efficacy and integrity improvements discussed earlier.



EFFICIENCY
49.      The project efficiency is rated high.

50.     The PAD estimated at $35 million the net present value of the project. As of 2007, the
reductions in border processing time are estimated to have produced direct transport savings
in the order of $18 million per year as of 2007.46The indirect benefits from trade expansion,
as per the 20 percent lower-bound estimate based on the Venables methodology, add a
further $3.6 million, or a total of $21.6 million a year. (See the text for an explanation.) On
these accounts, the economic rate of return of the Serbia TTF can be estimated at 75 percent,

46
  Based on actual data, the cost of one truck for one day is US$350 (all-inclusive-fuel, depreciation, driver's
salary, etc.). Processing time at the pilot sites was reduced by 73% on average between the first quarter of 2007
and 2002 which, in light of the traffic statistics, entailed a saving of 5 1,500 truck days.

far higher than the original estimate in the PAD. Moreover, to these benefits should be added
the economic gains from the use of the laboratory equipment purchased through the project
and the positive impact of the information system rolled out throughout the country.

5 1.    The fiscal benefits from improved customs procedures and information systems and a
reduction in corruption opportunities include some portion of the six-fold increase in customs
revenue, from US$567 million in 2002 to US$3,561 million in 2006. The cost-effectiveness
of customs also rose, as shown by the halving of the ratio of customs cost to revenue
collected, from 3.5 percent to 1.5 percent. (The increased professionalization of customs also
contributed to the improvement in the overall efficiency and integrity of the customs service
and indirectly to the much improved business climate in Serbia, although these benefits
cannot be quantified.) 47

52.     The project's overall outcome is rated high4 satisfactory, based on high relevance,
efficacy and efficiency-as shown in Table 23,

RISKS TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

53,      The overall risk to development outcomes is negZigibZe to low. This assessment
confirms that the reforms and the progress are sustainable and the risk is minimal. Most
telling is the sustainability of the institutional arrangements put in place during the project.
After the end of the project, the government fully mainstreamed the PIT, and turned it into a
"Trade Facilitation Section" headed by the former project manager (a veteran of the SCA).
The Trade Facilitation Section receives constant demands from other units for advice on
change management and actual support. To meet those demands, as well as reduce the
dependence of that Section on the competence and institutional memory of its manager,
~




47 The conceivable counterfactual is that the informatics and trade facilitation reforms would have taken place
in any case, given Serbia's genuine interest in openness and modernization. Without Bank funding, advice and
support, however, if the reforms had been enacted they would probably have taken place much later and without
the same effectiveness.
                                                      83


 additional persons are being hired and trained. Already noted is the continuation by the
 Government of systematic and close monitoring of the TTFSE performance indicators and
 reporting to the Bank --entirely at the Government's own initiative.

 54.     As noted in the other project evaluations, the regional website is comatose. However,
 after teething problems, in 2009 Serbia's own website (www.carina.rs) has improved in
 "friendliness" and comprehensiveness; is available in English; and is updated weekly.


 BANK PERFORMANCE



     55.   Bank performance is rated satisfactory.


 56.     Quality at entry. Quality at entry was satisfactory, owing to strong project design,
 recognition of institutional and capacity factors, and a sound performance framework. The
 risk assessment was satisfactory as well, although the risk that some donor co-financing
 might fall through was not mentioned. (In the event, the halt to U.S. assistance caused some
 temporary disruption, albeit ably compensated by prompt intervention.)


57.     Quality o supervision. Supervision was highly satisfactory. The Bank team worked
                 f
diligently and with high commitment and competence to support the government to help
achieve the project objectives, Particularly noteworthy was the patience, encouragement, and
timeliness of interventions in response to the initial problems of project implementati~n.~~

58.     In 2004, the financing of the U.S. customs advisory team, responsible for helping the
SCA to monitor performance, was suspended when Congress made Serbia ineligible for US
assistance. The disruption could have been damaging as implementation was just picking up
speed at that stage, but through Bank intervention the EU CAFAO agreed to take on some of
the US team functions.


BORROWER PERFORMANCE



59.        Overall, borrower performance is rated satisfactory

~~




48 Two concerns have been raised by a key interlocutor: the lack of a resident Bank presence to supervise the
project, and the absence on the Bank team of persons with practical experience in customs. On hrther inquiry,
the conclusion is that resident supervision was not necessary, considering the frequency and hands-on
involvement of the supervision missions. Nor was it desirable, as it might have diluted capacity-building in
Serbian customs.) And practical experience in customs was abundantly provided through the close interaction
with veteran US customs officers.
                                                84


60.      Governmentperformance. Government performance was satisfactory, and would be
rated highly satisfactory except only for the early stumbles. Since then, Government        .
performance has been excellent in all respects, primarily in the SCA but also through the
support from the political leadership. Change has been evident and substantial, beginning at
the very top -- from a customs leadership oriented to rent-seeking and patronage to a
leadership determined to bring integrity and respectability to the customs service and taking
meaningful actions in that direction.


6 1.     Partly reflecting the different attitude and behavior at the top and partly from bringing
into the service younger talented professionals and giving them responsible positions, the
consensus (including private sector and other non-official opinion) is that both competence
and behavior of Serbian customs officials have changed substantially for the better over the
last five or six years. A generational change, too, appears to be in the making, with a new and
different ethos of public service and rejection of illicit practices considered normal and
inevitable by the older generation. .

62.     Implementing agency performance. Implementation agency performance has been
satisfactory. The Project Implementation Team (PIT) was set up in the SCA under a project
manager, responsible for procurement credit management and reporting functions, as well as
monitoring the implementation of progress at pilot sites. It was assisted by the public-private
PRO Committee to implement the trade facilitation component.

63.     In general, and again after the early stumbles, the PIT worked very well and fiduciary
arrangements were implemented smoothly and without problems, partly owing to the close
partnership with the Bank staff team and interface with the senior management of the Serbian
Customs Administration.

64.    As noted, at the end of the project the government fully mainstreamed the PIT
functions, by turning it into a "Trade Facilitation Section" headed by the former PIT project
manager.
