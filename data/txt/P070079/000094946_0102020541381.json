Its main objectives are to reduce\n            non-tariff costs to trade and transport, and, to reduce\n            smuggling, and corruption at border crossings. The\n            components include: 1) construction of buildings, and\n            canopies at the Raca border crossing, and an inland truck\n            terminal (Novi Grad). Additionally, weighing scales, and\n            laboratory equipment will be supplied, including the\n            corresponding training. Technical services should monitor\n            the performance of the country's Customs\n            Administration, while training to enhance inter-agency\n            awareness will be provided; 2) construction of border\n            stations at Izacic, and Orasje, reconstruction of inland\n            terminals, and information technology infrastructure.\n            Technical services will monitor the performance of the\n            Federation Customs Administration, while training should\n            enhance inter-agency cooperation; 3) conventional, and\n            distance learning training in logistics, and, international\n            freight transport, in cooperation with international\n            professional associations. Public-private partnerships will\n            be enhanced using a virtual forum, to facilitate trade\n            development; and, 4) regional, and national services,\n            supported by advisors in procurement, accounting, and\n            external auditing, including the establishment of a\n            financial management system, and training for project\n            management, and implementation."}, "docdt": "2001-01-23T00:00:00Z"}
