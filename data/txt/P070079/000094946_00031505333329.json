To prevent, minimize, or mitigate site\n            specific negative impacts, however, this environmental\n            management plan (EMP) and a set of mitigation measures have\n            been prepared. The major concerns about possible negative\n            site specific impacts associated with border crossings\n            relate to 1) emissions from vehicles waiting for custom\n            clearances; 2) drainage of disinfectants and spills of oils\n            and fuel; 3) waste disposal and loose garbage; and 4) site\n            disruptions caused by upgrades or relocations of utilities\n            or such infrastructure as buildings, parking/waiting areas,\n            and access roads. Specific actions to minimize any\n            potentially negative impact and promote institutional\n            development include liaising with environmental authorities\n            and reviewing and monitoring EMP compliance; staff training\n            and sensitization at each border crossing; certifying\n            acceptable practices and impact minimization, especially\n            storing and properly using disinfecting materials and\n            chemicals, and hazardous materials and garbage; harmonizing\n            regulatory requirements with European Union and\n            international standards; and incorporating environmental\n            plans in consultant contracts and project design."}, "docdt": "2000-10-20T00:00:00Z"}
