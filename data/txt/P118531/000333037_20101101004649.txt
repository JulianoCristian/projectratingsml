                                Republic of Indonesia
                 FOURTH INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
Borrower                Republic of Indonesia
Implementing Agencies   Ministry of Finance, Coordinating Ministry of the Economy, and Bappenas.
Financing Data          IBRD variable spread loan, US$ 200 million.
                        A single tranche operation that is the fourth in a programmatic series of four consecutive
Operation Type
                        multi-year Development Policy Loans (DPL) which completes the IDPL Series I-IV.
Main Policy Areas       Though Indonesia has achieved high levels of economic growth and macro-economic
                        stability, significant deficits in both productive and social infrastructure threaten to
                        undermine medium-term economic growth and poverty reduction. In this context, the
                        current operation seeks to address the inadequacy of Indonesia's infrastructure through:
                            Sustained budget allocations to infrastructure ministries.
                            Improved targeting of electricity subsidies.
                            A legal framework and analysis for improved electricity pricing.
                            Better expenditure planning and management for the expansion and maintenance
                                of national and sub-national roads.
                            A restructuring program for financially unviable Public Water Utilities (PDAMs)
                                and performance-based support for financially viable PDAMs.
                            Establishment and activation of the regulatory and institutional framework for
                                Public Private Partnership (PPP) transactions.
                            An improved legal and regulatory framework for land acquisition.
                            Strengthened efficiency and transparency in environmental management, public
                                procurement and internal audits.

Key Outcome             Since inception in 2006, the program has achieved the following outcomes as of 2010:
Indicators                 Nominal doubling of capital spending on infrastructure by national ministries over
                               the Indonesia Rupiah (IDR) 25 trillion baseline in 2006.
                           Nominal increase in sub-national allocations to infrastructure by 35 percent.
                           An increase from 44 percent to 53 percent in the proportion of electricity
                               subsidies allocated to the lowest income group of consumers.
                           Improvement in the quality of national roads from 82 to 86 percent in good or fair
                               condition and a 25 percent increase in road-lane km.
                           US$ 300 million of new water utility investment since 2007.
                           A PPP transaction tendered in compliance with Perpres 67 which attracted more
                               than 3 responsive bids.
                           A Government of Indonesia (GOI) agreement to terminate all non-financially
                               closed toll-road concession contracts signed before August 17, 2007.
                           46 percent of works contracts awarded within 45 days of bid opening.
                           Production of effective internal audit reports by the Ministry of Public Works
                               (MPW) Inspector General.

Program Development     The Fourth Infrastructure Development Policy Loan (IDPL) is the final operation in the
Objectives              four-loan series. The program aims to:
                            Increase the quantity and efficiency of Government spending on infrastructure
                               with reduced and better targeted Public Service Obligation (PSO), and
                               expenditure planning and budgeting;
                            Improve sub-national infrastructure services through increased sub-national
                               government spending and improved incentives;
                            Increase private investment through a fiscally sound, credible and transparent PPP
                               framework spurred by risk mitigating measures;
                            Enhance governance for infrastructure through improved land acquisition,
                               environmental protection, better procurement and improved audit processes.

Contribution to         A "Core Area of Engagement" of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY09-FY12 is
Country Partnership     "to increase the level and efficiency of public and private investment in infrastructure."
Strategy                All policy areas in the IDPL program contribute to this objective. The CPS envisages a
                        significant role for policy lending, with the amount dependent on policy progress. Under
                        the current scenario, policy lending in FY11 is expected to include US$ 650 million for
                        DPL7, US$ 200 million for IDPL4 and US$ 200 million for a second Climate Change
                        DPL.
Related Operations by   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Government of Japan (GoJ) are providing
Donor Partners          related but independent policy loans in support of the Government's infrastructure
                        reforms. The ADB's program includes loans in 2006 (US$ 400 million), 2008 (US$ 280
                        million), and 2010 (US$ 200 million). Japan's loans support the ADB's policy matrix,
                        with amounts of US$ 100 million approved in 2007 and 2009. An additional US$ 100
                        million is envisaged from the Japanese in 2010. The Bank team has maintained close
                        dialogue with ADB and GoJ to ensure the consistency of recommended policy measures.

Risks and Risk          Macroeconomic risk is low. Indonesia maintains a sound external position and debt
Mitigation              sustainability analyses indicate the country is poised to withstand various shocks.
                        However, as a financially open economy, foreign holdings in the stock market and
                        Government bonds expose Indonesia to business cycles and potential shocks. Moreover,
                        fiscal pressures posed by subsidies ­ particularly for electricity and fuel could become
                        unsustainable. Mitigating these risks requires good macroeconomic management,
                        crowding in of private investment and movement toward opportunity cost pricing to
                        reduce subsidies.

                        Corruption poses a high risk for realizing the benefits of increased infrastructure
                        investment. Procurement and internal audit reforms included as prior actions are a direct
                        part of the Bank's general anti-corruption efforts. IDPL prior actions also support
                        specific efforts toward greater transparency and accountability through improved
                        planning processes, publication of PSOs and greater competition in PPPs.

                        Limitation in Government capacity to implement reforms poses a high risk. Despite
                        commitment to reform at the highest level, the ability to translate the reforms to practical
                        achievements is limited in part by the implementation capacity of the bureaucracy.
                        Mitigation strategies include realistic prior actions based on actual reform progress and
                        mobilization of donor-provided technical programs.

                                         I. INTRODUCTION

1.        In the face of Indonesia's rising demand for infrastructure services, the Government has
committed to more investment and improved services in 2010 during the first year of the new
administration. To ratify the strong signal provided by commitments made in the President's 2011
budget speech, the Government is a devoting a higher share of GDP to infrastructure spending. On top
of a substantial 33 percent increase in the Government's spending on infrastructure as part of the 2009
fiscal stimulus package that was maintained in the 2010 budget, the Government proposed raising the
budget allocation to infrastructure a further 55 percent for 2011.

2.       In addition to allocating more money,                                     Fig. 1.1 National Budget (APBN) vs.

3.        Efforts have also advanced to ensure that the higher rates of public spending are effective,
crowd in the private sector and translate into improved service delivery. The Government redoubled its
broad-based reform program by taking difficult but important actions in key sectors during the past
year. Highlights include increased electricity pricing, better targeting of power subsidies, output-based
incentivizes for piped water services, the legal, institutional and financial framework to support
Public-Private Partnership (PPP) transactions and a draft land acquisition law.

4.       The Infrastructure Development Policy Loan (IDPL) series seeks to address the principal
causes behind the inadequacy of infrastructure as a constraint to Indonesia's growth potential. The
operation recognizes Government efforts to increase spending on infrastructure and deepen reform
efforts and serves as a platform for the reform dialogue between the Bank and the Government. The
four-year IDPL series sought to "mobilize systems and improve incentives for infrastructure finance,"
based on five specific areas of engagement: (i) national infrastructure (electricity and roads); (ii) sub-
national infrastructure (water); (iii) public-private partnerships (institutional framework); (v) land
acquisition; and (iv) cross-cutting governance issues covering, environment impact analysis, e-
procurement and internal auditing for the public sector.

5.      The value the IDPL series to the Government's efforts has been multi-faceted. The Bank's
contribution has brought three types of benefits to the reform process, as described in more detail
below.

        In terms of public expenditure, the IDPL series supported maintenance of public spending for
        infrastructure at the national and sub-national level. At the national level, expenditures in 2009
        were double the 2006 level (compared to IDPL targets of 25 percent) while expenditures at the
        sub-national level are estimated to have been more than 35 percent over the 2006 level and
        155 percent over the 2005 level (compared to IDPL targets of 20 percent).

                                                    7
        In terms of policy planning, the IDPL series has helped the Government align policy priorities
        at various sector and ministerial levels, and increasingly at the sub-national level, with broader
        strategic national objectives. In this regard, the emphasis on performance based approaches to
        public support applied in the roads and water sectors are important cases.

        In terms of policy coordination, the IDPL series helped coordinate key stakeholders: (i) across
        ministries, (ii) among levels of government, (iii) between the public and private sectors, and
        (iv) with civil society. By convening views and consolidating efforts, the program has been
        effectively implemented. Electricity pricing, improved water supply, and institutions for PPPs
        are illustrative examples of good policy coordination.

6.      The IDPL prior actions set out in the policy matrix found in Annex 2 manifest a deepened
engagement of the Bank as a key supporter of the Government agenda. As the final program in the
four loans series, IDPL4, focuses on the most important infrastructure reform achievements of 2010 as
"prior actions," marks the achievement of many IDPL performance targets (Annex 3), and supports
the culmination of a series of significant reform efforts. The following achievements are highlighted:

        Public spending kept up with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth and surpassed it at the
        national level with central allocations rising from 0.8 to 1.0 percent of GDP over 2006 ­ 2011;
        Electricity tariffs are being adjusted for the first time since 2003 in order to bolster sector
        finances, better target and reduce subsidies;
        Implementing regulations for a new electricity law are being prepared to enable unbundling of
        distribution to local entities and to allow more private sector involvement in the sector;
        The financial restructuring of Public Water Utilities (PDAMs), an output-based grant scheme
        and a commercial bank subsidization scheme have been activated and are being scaled up;
        Recent legal reforms are now facilitating land acquisition for infrastructure projects and a new
        land acquisition law is under discussion;
        Government Regulation (Perpres) 13 has improved upon Perpres 67 - a progressive law to
        govern infrastructure PPPs - by extending application to PPPs of sub-national governments;
        Two new institutions aimed at improving the availability of long-term financing for
        infrastructure PPPs, have begun operations;
        A Road Preservation Fund is being established to ensure adequate expenditures are made on
        operations and maintenance for national and sub-national roads;
        For better financial governance in the Ministry of Public Works (MPW), electronically based
        procurement and risk based internal auditing was launched at national and sub-national levels.

7.       The Government's program is also being supported by a parallel series of policy loans by the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), both of which
give recognition to the reforms being undertaken. As there is close coordination between the agencies
to ensure consistent messages, the World Bank, ADB and Japanese support helps to ensure heightened
attention to the most critical reforms while encouraging momentum across the broad reform agenda.

                                      II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

9.       Indonesia has made remarkable progress over the past decade in terms of macroeconomic and
political stability. Macroeconomic performance since the late 1990s has seen consistent output growth
and rapid decline in external imbalances. Increasing tax revenues have contributed to the decline in the
fiscal deficit. Increased growth has been grounded on increasing private sector investments, sustained
domestic consumption and generally sustainable external surpluses. In an environment of controlled
inflation and rising incomes, Indonesian citizens' living standards have improved and poverty levels
have fallen, although many remain close to the poverty line. In addition, as the result of a decade of
relatively successful political and institutional reforms, Indonesia in 2010 is a highly competitive,
decentralized electoral democracy. Governments at national, provincial, district and city level are
elected in free and fair contests, with an incumbent loss rate of about 40 percent (one of the highest of
any competitive democracy). A system of checks and balances between legislative, judicial, and
executive branches is increasingly in place, with no one branch of government able to dominate, and
few institutional outcomes `guaranteed'. Where power was once radically concentrated around the
presidency, it is now shared with the legislature, and where power was once concentrated in Jakarta, it
is now shared among 500 or so city, district and provincial governments.

10.      Indonesia was less affected by the global economic downturn of 2008-09 and by the first half
of 2010 the economy's growth patterns had normalized. Growth slowed sharply but remained positive
in the fourth quarter of 2008, at the depths of the global downturn, then incrementally recovered
through 2009. The economy then expanded by 4.5 percent over 2009 as a whole and is projected to
grow by 6 percent in 2010. The social impact of the crisis was also limited with few reports of layoffs,
and poverty and unemployment rates continuing to fall, while households' spending power was
supported by inflation slowing to decade-lows, although various food supply disruptions lifted
inflation back towards the previous decade's averages into mid-2010. Through the crisis, public
finances remained in good health, with a nominal deficit in 2008 widening to a smaller-than-projected
1.6 percent of GDP in 2009 and a similar or even smaller deficit likely in 2010. Public debt levels
continued to decline, ending 2009 at just below 30 percent of GDP. International ratings agencies
recognized the robustness of Indonesia's economy and strength of its public financial management,
upgrading their ratings of Indonesia's sovereign debt in 2009 and early 2010, in one case to just below
investment grade. The relative strength of Indonesia's economy has attracted surges of volatile
portfolio inflows, challenging macroeconomic policymakers.

11.      The outlook is for Indonesia's economic momentum to continue to build, with growth rising
to 6 percent in 2010, a little higher in 2011 and with scope for growth to average 7 percent by mid-
decade despite the weaker global outlook. These growth rates suggest ongoing progress in poverty
reduction, although this may be slowed if the surge in food prices in mid-2010 leads to a lasting return
to the previous decade's inflation rates. In the period 2010-14, budget expenditure is expected to
increase by more than 30 percent in real terms compared to 2005-2009 period (about US$500 billion
in 2008 prices) creating significant opportunities to improve public services. In order to seize these
opportunities, Indonesia will need more effective and accountable institutions that can translate
available resources into better development outcomes. This will be particularly important as Indonesia
embarks on a period of second generation reforms to provide, for example, more sophisticated services
in infrastructure, better education, and a sustainable health system. But this projection of rising growth
rates and improving social outcomes are contingent on the government aggressively progressing in
this agenda.

THE STATE OF THE INDONESIAN ECONOMY IN 2010

12.     Indonesia's economy continued to consolidate its recovery from the global economic and
financial crisis in the first half of 2010. The economy grew by 6.2 percent over the year to June 2010,
making it one of the fastest growing economies in the G20. By June 2010, quarterly growth rates were

                                                    9
higher than the previous decade's average growth and yearly growth had returned to pre-crisis levels.
Growth in the first half of 2010 was supported by robust private demand. The domestic economy
continued to outpace growth abroad leading to a muted contribution from the external sector. Growth
among Indonesia's major trading partners had begun to steady following solid increases in the second
half of 2009. Domestically, solid consumer confidence, moderate inflation for most of the first half of
the year and favorable financial market conditions supported demand.

13.      Indonesia's economic growth has been driven by private demand. Private consumption was
supported in the first half of 2010 from high consumer confidence and relatively low and stable
inflation for most of the first half of the year. Private investment in 2010 has also begun to recover.
Meanwhile, net exports subtracted from growth in the first half of 2010 as the domestic economy grew
stronger than economies abroad. Government consumption subtracted significantly from growth in the
first half of 2010 as a result of slow disbursements and the unwinding of the fiscal stimulus. On the
production side, the domestically-focused tertiary sector (communications, transport) contributed most
significantly to growth, and anecdotal reports suggest that some subsectors had reached capacity
constraints by mid-2010. Manufacturing accelerated at the end of 2009 and into 2010, although
continued to lag the rest of the economy. Agricultural output was affected by unusual weather patterns
and, for some sectors, smaller crop area, through the first half of 2010.

14.     Trade volumes continued to grow in the first half of 2010, although at a slower pace than in
late 2009. Higher volumes and higher commodity prices saw trade values also increase over the
period. However, the trade balance narrowed as imports grew more strongly than exports. In the June
quarter the current account surplus narrowed to USD 1.8 billion, from a peak of USD 3.6 billion in
Q4. The faster expansion in imports is due to relatively stronger growth in domestic demand compared
with external demand, combined with the stronger rupiah making imports relatively cheaper. The
current account surplus narrowed over the period, as the income deficit remained flat while the trade
surplus narrowed.

15.     After weakening sharply during the peak of the global financial crisis in late 2008, Indonesia's
financial markets recovered well and have out-performed since March 2009, apart from a brief
correction due to renewed global risk aversion in May 2010. In August 2010, the rupiah appreciated to
IDR 8,930 per US$, a three year-high, and a long way from the low of IDR12,500/US$ during the
peak of the financial turbulence in November 2008. The real effective appreciation of the currency
has been even stronger (over 28 percent since March 2009). Government debt markets have followed a
                                                             10
similar pattern, weakening drastically in late 2008 and early 2009 before recovering to historically
strong levels by early 2010. The spread on Indonesian sovereign US$ debt fell below global emerging
market averages for the first time in almost five years in mid-2009. Meanwhile, yields on 5-year
rupiah bonds were at record lows by early 2010, although still several percentage points above the
yields on other ASEAN nations' local currency sovereign debt. Large flows of liquid foreign capital
into Indonesian financial assets have driven much of this strengthening. Net foreign capital inflows
into Indonesia have amounted to US$11 billion year-to-date, despite US$5.7 billion of net capital
outflows in May caused by global turbulence, which weakened financial markets that month, but only
momentarily.

16.     Foreign reserves have more than recovered from the crisis, as Bank Indonesia allowed the
balance of payments surplus to widen and worked to slow and smooth the rupiah's appreciation. The
balance of payments surplus, reflecting the current account surplus and significant portfolio inflows,
saw Indonesia's foreign reserves rise to US$ 81.3 billion at the end of August 2010, US$ 20 billion
above the pre-crisis peak of July 2008 and US$30 billion more than their nadir in early 2009.

17.      In addition to these factors, a recovery in foreign direct investment has further supported the
balance of payment surplus. The Government's electricity generation crash construction program has
attracted much of this additional investment. US$ 4.9 billion was invested in Indonesia in the first half
of 2010, as much as all of 2009. With the portfolio inflows and ongoing current account surpluses this
lifted the balance of payment surplus to US$ 12.0 billion in the first half of 2010, near the total for
2009.

                                                                   Figure 2.4 After a brief deficit during the peak of the

18.      BI has held the stance of monetary policy since it ended its easing cycle in late 2009, and with
improving economic conditions and confidence lending has accelerated. Bank Indonesia cut its policy
interest rate 300 bps from December 2008 to August 2009, and held it at that level to September 2010,
relying instead of on the gradually appreciating exchange rate to dampen inflationary pressures and
adjustments in reserves ratio requirements to encourage lending. Commercial banks lowered their
lending rates by less than the policy rate, with average lending rates remaining above 14 percent into
mid 2010 but cut deposit rates more aggressively, creating the widest interest margins in the region.
This did not reflect weakness in the banking sector. Shorter-term secondary market interest rates have
tracked significantly below the policy rate. Earnings of major banks and various aggregate indicators
such as capital adequacy and return on assets suggest the sector overall remains robust and has been
                                                              11
little affected by the crisis or the rapid credit growth to mid-2008. In December 2009, commercial
banks' non-performing loan ratios fell to 3.3 percent and remained near that level through to mid
2010, well below the 2007 and 2006 averages of 5.6 percent and 8.0 percent respectively. The
robustness of the banking sector is driven by the top 15 commercial banks, which account for 80
percent of total assets, with indicators for the remainder of the banking sector less robust. After being
anemic through 2009, lending growth accelerated towards more typical levels by mid-2010, led first
by Indonesia's relatively under-developed consumer lending market, and broadening into a recovery in
new working capital and investment loans by June.

19.      Inflation, after slowing to a decade low in 2009, started accelerating in mid 2010 as consumer
prices were impacted by negative food supply shocks. Headline inflation accelerated sharply in June
and July 2010 due to an unusually wet `dry' season impacting first various spice and later rice prices.
Most increases are expected to be temporary and unwind following the Idul Fitri holiday period in
September 2010. Seasonal demand pressures surrounding the month of Ramadan coupled with
administered price increases in recent months, including electricity tariffs and vehicle registration, led
to a sharp acceleration in prices with the headline inflation rate at 6.4 percent in August -- the highest
in 16 months. Core inflation, generally unaffected by this volatility, continued to gradually pick up
and by August 2010 was at 4.2 percent. BI has not increased interest rates in response to higher-than-
expected inflation, but it has soaked up liquidity from the market through increased reserve
requirements that will enter into effect in November 2010.

20.      The Government's budget deficit in 2009 was lower than expected, at 1.6 percent of GDP.
Revenues in 2009 were 2.5 percent weaker than in 2008, reflecting the cuts in tax rates under the
Government's stimulus package (e.g. the corporate income tax rate was cut from 30 percent to 28
percent), slower nominal GDP growth, and the lower value of imports and exports with the decline in
trade flows and commodity prices. Revenues recovered in the final months of the year, due to a
significant pick-up in collections from gas non-tax revenues, as well as increased efforts by the tax
office to improve compliance of both firms and individuals. Line ministries' spending continued to
improve in 2009, and reached 95 percent of budget overall. Less was spent on fuel subsidies and
interest payments than had been budgeted, a result of low oil prices and a stronger rupiah,
respectively. Although spending on core programs improved, overall disbursements are still skewed
towards the end of fiscal year. Reforms in the budget cycle (e.g. improved procurement processes, and
new scope for budget carry-over) contributed to the higher budget realization than in previous years.
The bulk of the Government's 1.4 percent of GDP stimulus package was delivered as tax cuts, largely
disbursed instantly, while 96 percent of the stimulus spending (mostly for small-scale infrastructure)
was disbursed by the end of the year.

21.      Parliament approved a revised 2010 budget deficit of 2.1 percent of GDP, from an initial
projection of 1.6 percent, and the Government is proposing a 2011 deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP. The
2010 budget includes a small fiscal stimulus package, smaller than 2009's at IDR 36.3 trillion or 0.6
percent of GDP, and also mostly made up of tax cuts (including a lowering of the corporate tax rate to
from 28 percent to 25 percent). The upwards revision to the deficit largely reflects a higher projected
oil price (US$77 per barrel from US$65 per barrel in the earlier budget), which resulted in higher
energy subsidy costs and the central Government's revenue sharing obligations with sub-national
governments. The larger deficit also funds some of the incoming administration's new programmatic
spending priorities and can be easily financed from the Government's 2009 surplus. However due to a
slowing in disbursement rates and stronger-than-expected revenues , on 26 July, the Minister of
Finance announced that the budget deficit may actually be 1.5 percent of GDP, which is closer to the
World Bank's current projection of around 1.0 percent of GDP. Regardless, the Government has
enjoyed improved access to commercial debt markets in 2010, filling over half of its 2010 bond
issuance target by early June, at yields sharply lower and longer maturities than a year earlier. The
Government announced its 2011 budget proposal in mid-August, which projects a deficit of 1.7
percent of GDP. This is due to be presented to the Parliament in mid-September. The proposal

                                                   12
includes a significant increase in capital spending for infrastructure, signaling the Government's
efforts to address long-standing infrastructure bottlenecks affecting the country.

22.      The Government increased tariffs as of July 1, 2010 for most consumer categories, ranging
from no increase for the low income users to 18 percent for the higher use categories, with an intended
weighted average of 10 percent overall. The adjustment in the tariff schedule is expected to reduce the
electricity subsidy, provided that electricity supply costs do not rise by a greater amount. In addition,
given the distribution of the tariff adjustment across income categories, subsidy targeting is expected
to improve, as the higher tariff increase was applied to higher end consumers with poorer residential
customers in the 900 VA and below range seeing no change in their bills. PLN projects the share of
PSO for the poorer residential customers to rise from 42 to 53 percent while the share for Industry and
Business falls from 37 to 24 percent for 2010. The tariff adjustment is also accompanied by an effort
to simplify the complex array of special tariffs mechanisms in order to provide more uniform pricing
to customers of the same voltage category. Further increases in electricity tariffs have been proposed
for 2011 and 2012 with the aim of generating additional budgetary savings and improving the
financial footing of the energy sector.

INDONESIA'S ECONOMIC OUTLOOK IN 2010
23.     The outlook for Indonesia's economy remains solid; with the major uncertainty being
Indonesia's potential to raise growth rates to or above 7 percent by mid-decade. Indonesia's economy
is expected to grow by 6.0 percent in 2010, increasing to around 6.2 percent in 2011. Growth will be
supported by increased domestic demand offsetting stabilized or declining net exports. Private
consumption is expected to gradually accelerate, growing by around 5.2 percent in 2010 and 5.3
percent in 2011. Sectors focused on domestic demand (transport, communications, various consumer
and business services) are likely to continue to perform better than those more externally oriented
(manufacturing and resource-related), although this latter offer greater scope for upside surprises as
the investment climate improves. Investment is also expected to accelerate in 2010, stimulated by
increasing commodity prices, stronger credit growth and some return of foreign direct investment.
After 2009's strong performance, Government consumption is likely to grow more slowly than the
overall economy in 2010 before recovering in 2011, although core and developmental government
programs are likely to increase their share of overall spending. The overall macroeconomic situation
and policy framework, as well as prospects for both growth and continued prudent fiscal policy,
warrant continued support for Indonesia's structural and institutional reforms through DPL 7.

24.      Indonesia's relatively high and rising investment ratios, robust domestic demand and
improvements in the investment climate including through infrastructure projects are projected to
support faster growth in the face of the uncertain and possibly weaker external outlook. Trade growth
is expected to remain broad-based. Imports are expected to recover faster than exports, as the domestic
economy grows more quickly than Indonesia's export destinations; and production to meet the
ongoing recovery in non-commodity exports requires more imported inputs, leading to a narrowing of
the trade surplus. Combined with a widening in the income deficit due to increased profit repatriation
by oil and gas companies, the current account surplus is expected to narrow in 2010, before moving
into deficit in 2011. Nevertheless, the balance of payments surplus is expected to remain high in 2010,
as strong portfolio capital and direct investment inflows more than offset the narrowing in current
account surplus. The surplus is expected to narrow in 2011 as the current account moves into deficit,
while capital inflows remain firm. The annual inflation rate for 2010 is likely to be around 5.1 percent
as prices accelerate in the latter half of the year, as the pass-through from the stronger exchange rate
into retail prices completes, global commodity prices remain robust, and domestic demand continues
to strengthen. Into 2011, inflation rates are likely to further rise to 6.4 percent, given the recovery in
new lending and acceleration in the money base experienced since late 2009, and possible increases of
other administered energy prices (particularly retail gasoline). The longer-term outlook is highly
dependent on the conduct of policy by Bank Indonesia, although it is committed to limiting inflation to

                                                   13
around 5 percent and ensuring that levels adjustments in key regulated prices (notably energy) do not
translate into persistently higher inflation.

25.      While near-term risks to the outlook remain significant, it is still uncertain whether Indonesia
can achieve the pace of reform required to lift average growth rates above 7 percent. Developments in
Q2 2010 highlight the near-term risks to Indonesia's economic outlook posed by volatile capital flows
and uncertain trading partner growth. In addition, political developments since late 2009, in particular
the parliamentary inquiry on the bailout of Bank Century and its outcome, have raised some questions
about the timing and depth of future reforms and improvements in conditions for investors and firms,
with potential downside risks to investment conditions and growth, although it is unclear whether
these developments have significantly impacted financial market investors' perceptions. Over a longer
horizon, these developments raise the question of whether the Government can achieve the reform
agenda outlined in its newly released medium-term development plan (RPJMN 2010-2014) towards
achieving stronger and more inclusive growth.

THE NEW GOVERNMENT AND THE POLITICAL OUTLOOK
26.     The 2009 legislative election allowed the Democrat Party (PD) to triple its share of seats in
parliament, and the subsequent presidential election provided outright victory to the incumbent
President. The continuing, and in the case of PD rapidly growing, appeal of mainstream largely
secular-nationalist parties, accounting for fully 75 percent of the vote, is an important highlight.
Subsequently, in the presidential election in July 2009, the incumbent President Yudhoyono won an
outright victory in the first round. With close to 61 percent of the vote, the President easily surpassed
the 50 percent threshold rendering a second round of voting unnecessary. The President campaigned
mainly on a platform of continuing past policies and governing approaches, which resounded
positively with the electorate.

                                                                  14
27.      The President named his second United Development Cabinet in October 2009, which seems
likely to prove more effective than its predecessor. The cabinet includes representatives from most of
Indonesia's regions and ethnic groups, as well as several political parties. At the time of the
inauguration of the new administration, President Yudhoyono pledged to boost economic growth,
continue to fight corruption and strive to uphold the rule of law. Key cabinet members such as the
Ministers of Finance and Trade, together with the heads of state development planning (Bappenas) and
the investment coordination board (BKPM) are technocratic figures and, as such, there exists ample
scope for reform.

28.      Developments in several other key areas bode well for continued reform momentum. The
establishment of a new Presidential Delivery Unit (UKP4) increases the likelihood of effective
implementation of ministerial programs. In addition, the unit has also been tasked with pushing for
judicial reforms, a task that it seems to address with both energy and success. Having achieved the
bulk of the Government's first 100-day action plan, the President signed an ambitious Presidential
Instruction (Inpres) No.1/2010 on Accelerating Development, which contains a list of policy outputs,
together with timelines for completion and assignment of ministers responsible, thereby helping to
sustain reform momentum by giving a clear agenda for the rest of 2010. Concerns regarding the
momentum of the anti-corruption agenda surfaced over a struggle between the independent Anti-
Corruption Commission (KPK) and the national police. The resolution of the struggle in favor of the
KPK largely restored the public's trust in the Government's anti-corruption agenda.

29.     Reforms are expected to continue under the guidance of the new Minister of Finance.
Following the resignation of the former Minister of Finance, the President appointed the former Bank
Mandiri President Director as the new Minister of Finance in May 2010. The former minister's
resignation highlighted the political tensions created by the reform efforts. The appointment of the
new minister signals the Government's continued support for reforms and sound macroeconomic
management.

                   III.     THE GOVERNMENT'S INFRASTRUCTURE REFORM PROGRAM

   30.      Inadequate infrastructure currently acts as a constraint to Indonesia's growth potential and
   with it, efforts to reduce the nation's poverty. International experience draws strong direct linkages
   between infrastructure provision, growth and poverty reduction and Indonesia is no exception.1 The
   World Bank study, Making the New Indonesia Work for the Poor notes that "from 1970 onwards,
   large and sustained reductions in poverty in Indonesia have only occurred during periods of sustained
   economic growth." In turn, the lack of reliable infrastructure services is cited as one of the biggest
   constraints to investment and growth in survey's such as the ones conducted under the Bank's
   Investment Climate Assessments. Analytical work, notably the 2004 Bank study, Averting an
   Infrastructure Crisis, supports the survey results by identifying potential infrastructure investments of
   US$ 4.7 billion that could increase GDP by 2.4 percent. In sum, to realize Indonesia's goal of halving
   poverty by 2015 though 6-8 percent growth and increased access for the underserved, the Government
   estimates an additional two percent of GDP is needed per year for infrastructure spending.

   31.      Despite this importance, there was a significant decline in infrastructure investment as a share
   of GDP in the years following the Asian crisis which is only now beginning to recover. The decline in
   spending was reflected in a deterioration of services across many sectors.2 (see Figure 3.1)
   Widespread rolling blackouts and electricity load-shedding mobilized policymakers to examine energy
   sector issues that threaten the country's investment climate and quality of life. Investment in water and
   sanitation has long been insufficient to expand access to piped water or to develop sewerage systems,
   but has been particularly absent since decentralization began in 2001. Despite increasing public
   resources for transport needed expressways, mass transport systems and rural roads require resources
   which exceed today's levels.

   32.      Accordingly, the Government has assigned a high priority to infrastructure, and the role of the
   private sector in providing it. This position was first articulated during the 2005 Infrastructure Summit,
   where a strategic approach to the delivery of infrastructure services was announced. The three pronged
   strategy covered (i) sector reform to bring more infrastructure into the realm of commercial financing,


   1
     Assuming conservatively that infrastructure investment is a comparatively inequitable source of growth; the Social Analysis
   (Annex 6) indicates that a 2.4 percent growth from improved infrastructure would be associated with reduction in the poverty
   rate by more than two percent.
   2
     Total infrastructure investment fell from 8.2 percent of GDP in 1997 to a low of 2.2 percent in 2000.
                                                                           16
(ii) a public sector led approach to non-commercial areas such as regional backbones, rural roads and
remote communities, and (iii) private sector involvement in a range of commercially viable areas.

33.      These strategic discussions were followed by an Infrastructure Policy Package (IPP-2006) in
February 2006 which sought to (i) introduce competition where public monopolies exist, (ii) eliminate
barriers to entry for the private sector, and (iii) reposition the Government and its role of
regulator/operator. The IPP-2006 was reiterated on a yearly basis in 2007 and 2008 through two
additional infrastructure "policy packages" (Inpres 6/2007 and Inpres 5/2008). In 2009, in response to
the international financial crisis, the Government announced a stimulus package that included a
significant infrastructure component intended to be "timely, temporary, and targeted," with jobs,
readiness and focus on poorer regions as priority selection criteria.

34.      In the first 100 days of the second administration of President Yudhoyono, the Government
launched a new Inpres 1/2010 outlining an annual work plan based on infrastructure and connectivity
development objectives for 2010.3 At the same time, during the April 2010 Infrastructure Forum, the
Government highlighted specific infrastructure related targets, including: (i) 10,000 MW in increased
electricity generation capacity in phase I and 10, 000 MW in phase II of a new electricity investment
program (ii) 10 million additional piped household water connections4, (iii) 1000 km of toll roads and
improved national roads in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Sulawesi; (iv) new airports and rehabilitation of
existing airports; (v) improved telecommunications access for rural areas, and (vi) double track
railways in Java; and commuter railways in large cities.
35.      Achievements of the Government's program to date include specific successes to build upon
for the future as well as areas which require attention on the part of policy makers to either disband or
redouble. Most importantly, the significant decline in infrastructure spending which followed the
1997 Asian financial crisis started to gradually turn around. Rather than declining, spending on
infrastructure ­ overall and from the national and sub-national budgets - has kept up with GDP growth
and in the case of the national budget, exceeded it (Table 3.1). National and sub-national budget
spending (85 percent of which goes to transport), maintained a 1.8 percent of GDP5 share during the
program period and is expected to be maintained at that level in the 2011 budget.

  Relevant work programs from Inpres 1/2010 included the completion of trans-island toll roads, preservation of national
roads and bridges; increases in PPP funding for infrastructure; budgetary allocations for land acquisition; and increases in
energy generation, including generators, network connections and substations.
4
  Target coverage would increase to 70-80 percent in urban and 40-50 percent in rural areas by 2015.
5
  Budgetary allocations for infrastructure were around 2.3 percent of GDP at the peak in 1997.
                                                            17
36.      On the other hand, in the sectors dominated by SOEs and the private sector ­ energy and
telecom - the recent record of investment has been less stable, primarily due to fact that the sectors'
state owned and private corporations are responding to volatility in the markets abroad and at home.
At the same time, the telecom sector which accounted for a third of the infrastructure sector in 2009,
underwent privatization, shifting from SOE to private investment in 2005-076 In electricity, where an
SOE dominates, ongoing capacity constraints have continued, with investments having fallen from 0.5
to 0.2 percent of GDP from 2005-09.

37.      In addition to increased budgetary spending on infrastructure, the Government accelerated the
reform momentum with a three pillar approach to the provision of infrastructure services: (i)
strengthening financial management while reducing and better targeting subsidies, (ii) crowding in
private sector expertise and financing, and (iii) improving the enabling environment for infrastructure
spending, including safeguards for the management of social, environmental and corruption risks.
These pillars defined the broad outcomes identified under the IDPL series and supported by policy
actions in a number of sectors to contribute to those outcomes.

38.      In each of the three pillars, progress was made and a good foundation for additional reform
established. The Government started to address tariff reform and subsidies in cases where the
financial position of the providing entity is at stake, such as in the case of electricity and water. In the
area of private participation in infrastructure, (i) there has been a strong positive change on the part of
the public sector towards risk sharing, (ii) new sector laws in Road, Rail, Ports and Electricity7, opens
these sectors to competition and private sector involvement, and (iii) the financial and regulatory
framework for private sector finance has been established and fine tuned. There have also been major
efforts to improve land acquisition with a draft Land Acquisition Law, which was facilitated by the
processes surrounding the IDPL program. Environmental management and public sector governance
to mitigate risks associated with the provision of infrastructure services.

39.      These recent success are balanced by a recognition that some areas in the reform program for
infrastructure have developed more slowly than expected. Efforts to adjust sector structures in
response to the state moving away from operation and toward regulation have advanced unevenly.8
Sector reform has also encountered additional complications of decentralization in some areas,
whereby new power structures require time to become effective. On the private sector side, despite
improvements in the legal and institutional framework, a PPP financial architecture, only one actual
IFC advised transactions is poised to bear fruit in 2010 with the launch of a large power sector IPP.

40.      In the sections which follow, the sectors addressed by the IDPL Series are described in some
detail, focusing on the sector's desired outcomes over the medium term, the principal policy
challenges to those outcomes and the Government's current response to those challenges. The
electricity sector is strategically important as a principal determinant of the country's investment
climate and is dominated by an SOE taking up a substantial share of capital investment with some
investment in independent generation being made by the private sector. The road sector accounts for
a considerable share of public spending, and therefore is in need of better approaches to public
expenditure management at both the national and sub-national level. Similarly, the water sector is
sub-national in nature and related to a more efficient and effective way to provide public financing to
the entities required to delivers the services. Finally, governance structures and institutional support
covering both the private and public sector spending is the target of efforts covered by PPP
frameworks, land acquisition law, and fiduciary practices.

  Infrastructure expenditures by SOEs and the private sector were 3.7 and 2.0 percent of GDP in 1997, prior to the Asian
crises and 1.0 and 0.8% at the low-point following the crises.

  The Law No. 23 2007 on Rail replaced Law No 13 1992; The Law No. 17 2008 on Sea Transport and Shipping replaced Law
No. 21 1992; Amendment to Traffic & Transportation Law No. 22 2009; and Electricity Law 30/2009 replaced Electricity Law
15/1985.

   Unbundling of the power sector was halted by the Constitutional Court declaring the reform unconstitutional.

41.       Meeting the Growing Supply and Access Constraints. Due to system-wide capacity
constraints, many parts of Indonesia are experiencing power shortages. In the face of demand growth
exceeding 6-7 percent per year, the sector is only now starting to recover from the lost decade
following the East Asian financial crisis when investments were well below the levels needed to
ensure reliable supply. The tremendous pressure to keep pace with economic growth9 coupled with
little system expansion over the past decade has left the system with inadequate reserve margins. Thus
the specter of rolling blackouts and load shedding has mobilized the Government to take concerted
action in the sector for the first time in a number of years by placing investment in power generation to
expand capacity as one of the high priority pillars of its infrastructure revival program.

42.     At the same time, Indonesia faces an electrification rate of only 65 percent leaving around 85
       10
million people either without access to electricity or with unreliable electricity supply. To meet the
Government's target of electrifying 90 percent of the population by 2020, roughly two million new
subscribers will need to be connected annually, double the rate of the past few years. Even those with
power are often not getting it from the grid. PLN estimates that 15,000 MW is being consumed from
captive power generation. Others get electricity from the grid but through illegal connections.11

43.      Against these challenges is the long lead time in contracting and construction required to
install new capacity, some of which is only now being brought on line to address shortages from past
years of inadequate investment. The State Electricity Company's (PLN) current installed capacity is
around 25,600 MW with 22,000 MW of available capacity while and Independent Power
Producers (IPPs) have available capacity of an additional 4,300 MW (see Table 3.2). Since 2006, the
Government has been pursuing a "crash" program to procure another 10,000 MW of coal-fired power
plants to be operated by PLN. A second 10,000 MW program is envisaged, of which 50 percent is
planned to be from renewable energy sources. In all, PLN expects to invest on average an estimated
US$ 7 billion a year over the next 5 years (PLN estimates) and approach private investors to
encourage IPPs to scale up investment in the sector.

44.     While the investment in new capacity is urgently needed for the sector, the Government
recognizes that realizing the needed investment requires a series of energy sector reform outcomes
including: (i) reduction of, and better targeting of energy subsidies, (ii) a mechanism for tariff
adjustments in response to changes in costs, (iii) financial viability of PLN, and (iv) sector reform to
enable private participation in production and distribution of electricity. Steady, albeit uneven,
progress has been made recently in some of the key areas such as targeting of subsidies and price
adjustments, which signals a strong desire for reforms on the part of the authorities and lays the
foundation for a concerted reform effort in the coming years.

  The strong correlation between energy and GDP growth is observed by the fact that elasticity of electricity sales growth to
GDP growth was on average greater than 1.5 in the past 15 years.

45.      Reversing the Subsidy Trend. The Public Service Obligation (PSO) is a price "subsidy" to
consumers from the budget covering the difference between the cost of supply and the regulated tariffs
for different consumer categories. With oil's prominence in the generation fuel mix for power
generation and with the removal of subsidies for petroleum fuel in 2005, the PSO became sensitive to
movements in oil prices (Figure 3.2). In 2007, the PSO amounted to IDR 37 trillion (US$ 3.9 billion)
and jumped to IDR 79 trillion (US$ 7.2 billion) or 48 percent of total revenues in 2008. Lower oil
prices in 2009 led the subsidy to drop to IDR 54 trillion in 2009 (US$ 5.7 billion) or 37 percent of total
revenues. Based on the tariff increase for the second half of 2010, the subsidy is expected to decrease
to around IDR 45 trillion (US$ 5 billion) or 30 percent of projected revenues (including subsidy) for
the year (see Table 3.3).

     Based on the new tariff schedule and PLN estimates of costs and consumption levels for 2010

                                                              20
46.      The Government has been pursuing its reform goal of a better targeting of subsidies towards
the poorest segment of PLN's consumers through a two step process of public awareness followed by
tariff reform. The public awareness campaign began with the publication of the 2008 and 2009 PSO
subsidy distribution on PLN's website in order to inform the public of the opportunity costs related to
the poor targeting of the PSO subsidy began.

47.     The second, more significant step is that tariffs were revised for most tariff categories, ranging
from 0 percent for the poorer categories in the 900 VA and below range, to a maximum of 18 percent
increase for the more affluent, residential categories. While the intention was to reach an average
weighted increase of 10 percent overall, the adjusted schedule expected to improve the targeting by
increasing the share of PSO subsidy for the target group - residential customers with connections of
less than 900 VA - from 42 percent in 2009 to 53 percent in 2010. In addition Table 3.3 shows that
the subsidy to business and industry categories has fallen from 37.1 percent to 23.8 percent. Still,
there remains significant room for improvement, as subsidies are still offered to the more affluent
segment of the population, such as large industries, public buildings, hotels, and shopping malls.13

48.     The Government has also permitted PLN to include various schemes to allow for cost
recovery from some of its customers ­ particularly the peak, high volume and business users, which
has also reinforced the objective of reducing and better targeting the PSO subsidy. For example, as of
January 1, 2010, PLN has charged residential, business, and public customers in the `6,600 VA and
above' categories with electricity consumption exceeding 50 percent of the national average14, a tariff
based on the economic cost of production plus a margin. These customers currently represent 16
percent of revenues.

49.      Sector Reform to Improve Supply. Despite the clear rationale, need, and indeed opportunity for
tariff reform, the issue pertains to the mechanism and process for tariff adjustments. While the
Ministerial Regulation (Permen ESDM 7/2010) for the proposed increase in electricity tariffs from
July 1, 2010 was a step in the right direction, the price adjustment will not achieve full cost recovery.
In order to achieve cost recovery, additional tariff increases are proposed over time. However,
difficulties in effecting even a small increase in tariffs highlights the challenge the sector faces in
achieving reforms of increased supply and wider access, when the limited goal of covering costs is so
difficult to achieve.

50.      The demand and expectation that electricity should be provided with an implicit subsidy to
practically all but a few customer classes is in direct conflict with the need to reduce the amount of the
explicit PSO subsidy required from the budget. At the same time, PLN's financial viability and
investment requirements need to be assured in order for PLN to continue to provide electricity in a
reliable and predictable manner. The conflict among these positions has prevented the formulation and
introduction of a rational tariff pricing mechanism while rolling blackouts, have become more
frequent. The result has been to raise doubts about the long-term sustainability of this financial support
mechanism, both as a method to deliver access to power and as a way to target subsidies to the poor.

51.      Beyond these critical pricing and subsidy issues, an effective institutional restructuring and
strengthening of the sector is critical for facilitating the Government's ability to attract private finance
and improve the efficiency of the power sector. The Government began to pursue this objective
through decentralization, unbundling, corporatization, and restructuring of PLN as early as 1993 but
progress has been inconsistent and slow. Following the financial meltdown of the sector during the
East Asian financial crisis, the Government redoubled efforts to restructure the sector through a
revised Electricity Law No. 20/2002 that was intended to move the sector toward a competitive market


13
   Industries in the 200kVA segment receive 11 percent of the subsidy ­ the third largest allocation - claiming a need to remain competitive
in the global markets.
14
  The threshold for charging higher tariffs was for customers consuming electricity at 80 percent of the national average in
2009 while in 2010 the threshold was reduced to 50 percent.
                                                                    21
structure and increase private sector participation. Efforts were halted by the Constitutional Court's
annulment of the 2002 Law and the reform momentum was badly disrupted for years.

52.     In 2008, the Government began again to address the sector's issues first through some basic
reforms for PLN which had broader implications for the sector.15 In a key reform, PLN's restructuring
created regional business units to better manage PLN's operations including its supply costs that vary
by region. It is anticipated that this restructuring will facilitate the development of region-specific
costing while three "Government Regulations" for the new Electricity Law that are currently being
drafted will allow tariff regimes for different regions to respond to regional costs.

53.     For the medium term, PLN desires, as a result of better pricing policies to gradually move
away from its reliance on Government subsidies to become financially self-sustaining. It would like to
change its financial orientation from having liquidity as its main focus to having efficiency of service
as its key performance driver by 2012. To do so, PLN will need to stand on a stronger financial
footing and has proposed greater financial independence through a series of annual tariff increases
between 2010 and 2012. To further strengthen PLN's financial condition, the Government approved a
"margin" equal to 8 percent of PLN's costs in 2010 and PLN has proposed a similar 8 percent margin
for both 2011 and 2012.

54.      In terms of sector reform, the new Electricity Law Number 30, passed in September 2009, also
permits service provision by other qualified entities in line with the more decentralized governance
structure in Indonesia today. The Law also gives regional governments the ability to issue electricity
regulations and offers them the authority to set electricity tariffs within their jurisdictions. PLN would
forego the monopoly on supplying and distributing power while private investors and developers
would enter these markets and agree with regional governments to supply electricity in un-served
areas.16 The passing of the Electricity Law is an important step but the implementation mechanisms
have yet to be formulated through the proposed Government regulations. While the new Law is not as
far reaching as the 2002 Electricity Law in the flexibility afforded to PLN and the line ministry to
increase tariffs (Parliamentary approval is required) it allows a mechanism to charge the higher tariffs.
The Law also enables PLN to consider differentiated pricing based on regional supply costs, and
contemplates unbundling distribution to the private sector. Finally, the Law calls for a fund to support
the expansion of distribution to under-served and undeveloped areas including rural and frontier
locations.

ROADS
55.      More Roads Needed to Keep up with Demand. As road transportation accounts for the major
share of freight and passenger traffic, the coverage and quality of the multi-tiered road network are
both vital to Indonesia's competitiveness and poverty reduction objectives. However, congestion,
especially in urban area is a fact of daily life, as the development of road infrastructure is not keeping
pace with the rising demand. Demand for road infrastructure, on the other hand has been growing
faster than GDP for nearly a decade and can be expected to grow at 1­1.5 times the GDP growth rate,
at around 7-10 percent per annum.17 Both total and paved roads grew by only an average 3 percent per
annum from 2000-08, with the highest growth year in 2007 (Table 3.4). As a result, traffic congestion
has become a serious problem, especially on the arterial road network in Java with almost half of the
road network in Java and a higher proportion in Jakarta are considered congested.



15
   A new Board of Directors was appointed and PLN's Planning Unit was re-established to help improve the development of
investment projects and assist in forecasting the fiscal burden of PLN's subsidies.
16
   PLN's role as supplier of electricity under Article 33 of the Constitution (confirms the State as supplier of electricity)
remains unchanged. Implementing regulations have not been drafted and the leeway offered to regional governments to set
tariff has not yet been defined.

56.     Toll-roads have therefore also been a high priority in the development of an expressways
network, with the National Road Network Master Plan calling for almost 3,000 km of toll-road
expressways, compared with 700 km of expressways that currently exist and were constructed prior to
the 1997 financial crisis. However, before meeting this objective, the Government needs to address
both the stock of pre-1997 deals carried out under the old system, which need to be financially closed
or cancelled, as well as the flow of new toll-deals which have to be executed with transparency,
competition, and efficiency.

57.      Working to Preserve Road Assets. The highest priority for the Indonesian road network is to
establish a sustainable financing mechanism to preserve road assets. Government efforts have focused
on 34,000 kilometers (km) of national roads with some success. In 2006, almost a fifth (18.4
percent18) of these roads were in poor or bad condition, with the share reduced to 16.7 percent in 2008
and to 14 percent in 2010.

58.      On the other hand, at the level of provincial and district level roads, the percentages of
good/fair quality roads are much lower at 54 percent and 33 percent respectively, indicating the
difficulty of maintaining provincial and district level roads as compared to national roads (Table 3.5).
In remote areas in eastern Indonesia, where roads are still unpaved, the population is sparse, and traffic
demand is low, there is no all-season access. Around 15 million people in remote communities remain
without direct access to the all-season road network. This not only prevents contributions to the
economy, it inhibits poverty reduction efforts and access to basic services for villages, particularly in
Eastern Indonesia.

59.      While, at the national level, the objective of a high quality road network has been largely
fulfilled by budget availability, a more sustainable financing mechanism is being sought for the
preservation of all roads including sub-national, local and rural roads. To this end, amendments to the
Traffic and Road Transport Policy Law in 2009 provided for the establishment of a Road Preservation
Fund, for which implementing regulations have been prepared to establish funding sources,
governance arrangements and operating procedures. The Road Preservation Fund is being designed

18
   The Bank's Rural Investment Climate Assessment found evidence of severe underinvestment in road maintenance and a
rapidly declining road quality in the period since 1999. National figures suggest that between 2000- 2006, the share of
national and provincial roads in good/ fair condition fell to 16 and 26 percent, respectively.
                                                          23
with a separate administration and strong oversight arrangements, a purchaser but not a provider of
road services with revenues coming from charges related to road use. The fund will be available for all
roads, including sub-national roads with operating guidelines governance framework.

PIPED WATER
60.      Low Coverage of Piped Water from Years of Under-investment. Urban access to piped water
supply is declining as a share of the population. Currently only 15 percent of the population ­ 25
percent in urban areas - or about 27 million people - have access to piped water ­ an extremely low
level of coverage compared to countries at similar levels of income as Indonesia (Figure 3.3). Current
coverage levels also fall far short of the Government's targets of 32 percent of people connected to
safe water sources through piped connections and an additional 38 percent who would have access to
safe water sources through non-piped service, for a total of 70 percent with access to safe water.19 This
trend started at the turn of the century with recent evidence showing that the trend may even be
worsening.

61.      The state of the sector reflects rapidly declining equity in urban water utilities (PDAMs) as a
result of years of poor financial viability and low levels of sector investments. Investments declined
from an average of US$ 400 million in the 1990s to under US$ 45 million in 2005 - about one tenth of
what is needed to achieve the 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Present levels of capital
infusion only just keep pace with depreciation, thus assets are not being created to keep up with
Indonesia's growing urban population.

62.     Although the urgent need for capital investment is well recognized, the sector faces massive
bottlenecks in getting finance to flow. First, there is need to reverse the trend of poor cost recovery.
Because water infrastructure was initially financed using grants from the central Government, sub-
national governments were able to keep tariffs at deflated levels, which left utilities without adequate
resources to renew assets and eventually, affecting their operations. Second, years of poor cost-
recovery and the effect of the Asian financial crisis left PDAMs in distress. By 2006, 206 PDAMs
were in arrears with MOF for over US$ 400 million with outstanding principal of a similar amount.
Since on-lending from MOF was the only channel of financing, PDAMs were left without alternative
sources of funds when debts ballooned and restructuring was not put in place. Responsibility for
water services was decentralized to sub-national governments, but "Big Bang" decentralization of
funding and responsibilities exceeded expenditure capacities of local governments, who, despite
having borrowing capacity to finance investment plans, were reluctant or unwilling to do so.

63.   The Financial Revitalization Program for the Water Utilities. Recently, the national
Government has recognized the important contribution it can make to the sector's performance, even

19
   70 percent is the Government target for improved water access. The rest will remain without access to improved water, for
example use of unprotected wells, rain water harvesting, rivers and canals.

                                                            24
though service provision is the responsibility of local governments. In late 2008, the Vice President
focused the attention of the national Government on a clear target by announcing that the Government
would seek to provide an extra 10 million household piped water connections over five years ­
doubling the number of people with access to piped water. The current estimate of needed investment
is on the order of US$ 8 billion. In response, the Government announced a US$ 1.33 billion public
sector funding strategy consisting of three pillars: (i) financial restructuring, (ii) provision of long-term
loans, and (iii) output based aid in the form of grants. Each is described in more detail below:

         Debt Restructuring. In 2008, the MOF began to address a long-standing obstacle to the flow
         of finance to the sector. Regulations prohibit new borrowing by PDAMs if they or the local
         governments (PEMDA) who own them have arrears on debt on-lent by the central
         Government. To eliminate debt areas, the MOF started a scheme of debt restructuring for
         PDAMs and local governments (including the ability to intercept fiscal transfers to the local
         government, in the event that arrears recur). At the same time, MPW is helping PDAMs
         prepare the requisite business plans needed for debt restructuring.20

         Financing for Water Scheme. To encourage local bank finance to flow to the sector, the
         Government issued Perpres 29, which provides for a guarantee of 70 percent of funds
         borrowed by PDAMs from local banks, as well as interest rate subsidies. To be eligible to
         participate, a PDAM must be in the debt restructuring program or not have arrears to the
         Ministry of Finance; must have a full O&M cost recovery tariff; and must have a BPKP audit
         indicating that it is "healthy."

         Incentive Grants for Sub-National Governments. In 2009, the Ministry of Public Works
         (MPW) paid a IDR 580 billion (US$ 58 million) incentive to PDAMs who were current in
         their debt payments to MOF intended to connect 200,000 poor households through grants of
         IDR 1 million (US$ 97) available for each new piped water connection. In 2010, MPW
         updated and broadened its incentive scheme for connections to the poor to all sub-national
         governments through the Water Hibah.

64.      More Water Connections to Local Areas: The culmination of the program for financial
restructuring is to enable the PDAMs to increase water connections through more borrowing, renewed
investment and better business management. Some 155 PDAMs, who are "healthy" or have been
approved for debt restructuring, are now financially capable of borrowing and expanding of their own
accord. The next phase is to incentivize the process through the introduction of performance based,
output based aid (OBA) scheme that seeks results prior to transferring public funding. The new OBA
for Indonesia's water sector, (Water Hibah) will provide grants to sub-national governments whose
PDAMs provide new piped water connections to poor households. The grants will be between IDR 2-4
million (US$ 175-350) per connection, accounting for about a quarter of the estimated cost. The
initial phase is expected to pay against a total investment by sub-national governments of IDR 192
billion (US$ 19 million).

65.      Though the roll-out is proving slow, the schemes are strategically important from several
perspectives. First, the planned level of finance will contribute to expanded service coverage. Second,
by focusing on desired outputs, the scheme provides incentives to overcome a range of problems
arising in different PDAMs in order to reach the results on the ground. Third, by focusing on sub-
national governments rather than PDAMs, the scheme provides incentives to the entities with the
power to address the most important governance issues in the sector. Finally, the scheme provides
incentives to local governments to invest in own water utilities through grants and subsidized
assistance from the central Government, with the MPW more appropriately playing a verification
rather than implementation role.

20
   As of August 17, 2010, of the 175 PDAMs with arrears, 109 PDAMs 68 restructuring plans had been approved making
these PDAMs eligible for bank financing.

PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS

66.     Returning to a Slowing Global Market: Before the 1997/98 Asian Crisis, Indonesian PPP
projects did not benefit from a robust PPP framework, nor was Government risk associated with PPP
managed. Indonesia is now endeavoring to return to the PPP market which it exited following the
Asian Crisis, with a PPP framework and new institutions to manage and share risks. The first high
profile public-private dialogue was successful in sending strong messages to the international
community and global investors about the will of the Government to support the infrastructure agenda.
In addition to offering US$ 22 billion in infrastructure investment, the discussions covered strategies
and policies to improve infrastructure provision.

67.     Most importantly, Indonesia has developed structures to ensure that only one institution, the
MOF, can provide public support (either direct public funds or contingent liability support) and that all
PPPs are bid in a transparent and competitive manner ­ established through Presidential Decrees
Perpres 67/2005 and Perpres 13/2010. This is no small feat, given that most, if not all, of the old
`successful' PPP deals embodied the poor governance that characterized the Suharto years. But while
the new PPP framework has been cleaned up, Indonesia enters a deflated PPP market. Globally, after a
period of resurgence in 2005­2007, the PPP market softened considerably in 2008 with many projects
deferred or restructured due to the financial crisis. Many international banks have left the PPP market,
or reduced their focus on PPP, making access to finance more challenging.

68.     PPP Framework Established yet PPP Transactions Just Starting: The Government has made
good progress on its PPP framework, but progress on transactions has been slow. To date, there has
not yet been a PPP project that has been awarded and allocated Government support in accordance
with Perpres 67/2005. The Government is making efforts to address the short-comings in its PPP
framework through the following five ongoing initiatives:

          MOF - Single Provider of Government Guarantees. One of the key criticisms of the
          Government's PPP program prior to the 1996/97 Asian Crisis was the lack of coordination and
          regulation of the provision of Government support (in particular guarantees) for PPP projects.
          In response, President Yudhoyono instituted Perpres 67/2005, requiring that projects must
          satisfy a series of clear criteria before accessing such Government support. The Ministry of
          Finance has not provided Government support for projects not complying with Perpres 67.

          Resolving Backlog of Old PPP projects. The Government has made considerable progress in
          resolving the backlog of old PPP projects, particularly for toll roads awarded before 1997.21
          The Minister of Public Works issued a Ministerial Decree 6/2010 to assess, identify and
          terminate toll road projects which do not comply with the Government's policy as embodied
          in Perpres 67/2005 and Perpres 13/2010. This should unlock the potential for restructuring and
          completion of some toll roads, including the Trans-Java Expressway.

          Preparation of `Bankable' PPP Projects. PPP projects require significant commitment of
          resources and skills during project preparation and procurement, with an emphasis on
          improving the quality of feasibility studies prior to bidding. The Government has also made
          efforts to improve technical support through a US$ 35 million project development facility22



21
   The efforts of the Government include i) the creation of the Indonesian Toll Road Authority, BPJT, ii) the creation of the
Land Fund to pre-finance the land acquisition obligations of the private sector, iii) efforts to associate weaker concessionaires
with those more experienced in the sector, and iv) under Perpres 13/2010, for future toll road projects, land acquisition is the
responsibility of the Government, and will be provided before a toll road project is offered to the market.

         through the hiring of specific transaction advisors.23

         Extending and Refining the PPP Framework. The Government has made clear progress on the
         legal, institutional and financial framework for PPP since 2007 and is extending it as well as
         refining it. In particular, the Government recently issued Perpres 13/2010 which extends the
         application of Perpres 67/2005 to sub-national governments and state-owned entities
         providing additional support and clarity to the sub-national PPP agenda.

         Financial Architecture Ready to Be Launched. The Government has created two new
         financial institutions to support infrastructure financing. First, P.T. Indonesia Infrastructure
         Financing (P.T. IIF), a non-bank financial institution, will provide needed long term local
         currency debt for private infrastructure projects. In addition, the Indonesia Guarantee Fund
         has also been established, with a capital base of US$ 100 million, to arrange government
         guarantees for PPP projects.

69.     Though slow, some results are starting to show. For the first PPP project compliant with the
new Perpres 67 and 13, PLN hired IFC as a transaction adviser for the Central Java IPP. As a result of
the good enabling law and high quality project advisors, the project has been developed with global
good practice in mind and is likely to attract more than three viable bids by the end of 2010. The
success of the Central Java IPP will encourage the use of highly experienced, international transaction
advisers on future PPP transactions. Finally, while there are other potential PPP projects - a passenger
ship terminal, a bulk water conveyance project, potentially some small hydro IPPs and/or greenfield
geothermal IPPs, a deep water container port, an airport rail-link project, etc. Work is needed to
ensure that any and all PPP projects are well-developed and financially bankable.

LAND ACQUISITION
70.      An Action Plan to Help Provide Speed and Fairness to Land Acquisition. Acquisition of land
for public purposes has been a source of delay for infrastructure projects. Land acquisition associated
with infrastructure projects have been in the past associated with forced evictions and unfair
compensation for the affected people. Recognizing this, in 2007 the Coordinating Ministry of
Economic Affairs, facilitated by the IDPL process, empowered an inter-agency Land Working Group
(LWG) to review and resolve the key hindrances. Following two years of IDPL supported
implementation, a new Land Acquisition law has been drafted and circulated for consultation with
high level political support24 - a noteworthy achievement for the Government and the IDPL instrument
as it required the LWG to convene stakeholders, acquire technical input and achieve political support.

71.      Better Land Acquisition Processes Have Begun Even Before Laws Have Changed. Even
before the new act is adopted, the IDPL-supported Action Plan has achieved implementation of some
key aspects through regulation under a "fairer and faster" mantra.25 To be fairer regulation provides
for "land acquisition committees," appointed by local governments who oversee negotiations for land
acquisition based on independent appraisals of the land's market value.26 To be faster, regulation
specifies how land acquisition and construction can proceed once agreement on compensation is
reached for three quarters of the required land area or affected landowners.27

72.      New Draft Land Acquisition Law. The draft Land Acquisition Law is a break-through, but it is
still work in progress. After years of little to no engagement, the Bank is now working with the LWG
to assist in the consultation process for the draft Law. The consultation process is understandably

23
   A 2x1,000 MW power generation plant in central Java is being prepared with assistance of IFC advisory services.
24
   Consisting of two Presidential Regulations and a Regulation issued by the Head of the National Land Agency.

   BPN Regulation 3/2007, pursuant to Perpres 65/2006.
26
   Market valuations are a step forward for compensation rights as it usually exceeds "assessed taxation value."
27
   Compensation for a disputed part can be "consigned" to District Court for resolution while investment proceeds.
                                                            27
difficult, where stakes are high on all sides and the right delicate balance is difficult to achieve. The
draft Land Acquisition Law seeks such balance based on compensation for affected people and faster
dispute resolution. Key aspects include:

         Expanded eligibility of individuals for compensation from just those with legal rights to
         providing a basis for compensation for assets of those who do not have legal rights to land;

         Expanded process for public consultation in the compensation process for all involved parties;

         Due process for location decisions, requiring completed public consultations and agreement
         on compensation;

         Improved resettlement towards areas with better services and facilities;

         Independent, non-affiliated appraisal of affected land, buildings and other assets with the
         appointment done by both institutions seeking land as well as affected individuals;

         Local governance of public development plans with plan implemented by Government bodies
         local or by Government appointed domestic or foreign private sector;28 and

         Streamlined dispute resolution.

73.      While these are the stated goals, the next steps to be determined by BPN may include (i)
licensing requirements for independent appraisal bodies, (ii) calculation of economic losses and multi-
year payout for complex cases (iii) legal consistency between the proposed law and existing
regulations; and (iv) continued consultation on clarity, transparency of the processes and protecting the
interests of affected people.

MANAGING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
74.      Management of the environment matters to Indonesia's economic and social development ­
and to achievement of goals in infrastructure development.29 Inadequate water and sanitation
constitute the largest short-term cost to the Indonesian economy, estimated at more than US$ 7.6
billion in 2007 or almost 2 percent of GDP. The health impacts of outdoor and indoor air pollution
have been estimated in 2007 at US$ 5.5 billion per year. These environmental costs disproportionately
impact the poor. Spending for environmental purposes has doubled in recent years, but is still low
relative to overall spending, and does not reflect the high costs of environmental degradation.
Environmental revenue collection has been low and natural resources have been under-priced.

75.     Indonesia's environmental laws and policies are relatively strong, but implementation and
enforcement still need improvement. Many aspects of environmental management have been
decentralized, with some positive results through reputational programs, greater political will,
interagency collaboration, community empowerment, and integration of environment in spatial
planning. Indonesia also benefits from an active network of civil society organizations focused on
environmental issues. Challenges to improve performance remain, including inadequate standards and
enforcement, distorted incentives, weak empowerment and insufficient institutional capacity (as well
as specific sector issues with forestry, fisheries and natural resource management).


28
   Proposals are made by the Land Acquisition Committee and publically presented via local government offices, the central
Land Agency office, newspapers or online on at least two occasions to allow time for objections.
29
   The World Bank prepared a Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) in 2009 to highlight the underlying challenges and
opportunities for improving environmental and natural resource management. In addition, the GOI prepares a "State of the
Environment" Report each year (www.menlh.go.id). These two sources provide much of the analytical background for the
Bank's approach to addressing environmental issues in this IDPL.
                                                           28
76.       In recent years, the GOI has upgraded the legal framework for environmental management in
two key areas: solid waste management and environmental management and protection. The IDPL
program has focused on these two areas because of their relevance to the infrastructure agenda and
improving the quality of life for Indonesian citizens. These new laws have also been accompanied by
regulations, capacity improvements, and assessments. GOI also has important initiatives to restrain
utilities' pollution, reduce smoke and haze from forest and land fires, rehabilitate forests and degraded
lands, improve environmental management through the spatial planning process, and develop
environmental data and information.

77.      Solid Waste Management: A New Framework for an Old Problem. Only half of Indonesia's
solid waste is actually collected, up to a fifth properly disposed, and less than two percent is treated
(recycled or composted). About 85 percent of small cities and more than 50 percent of medium cities
dispose of their waste in open dumps. In 2008, the Indonesian Parliament passed Law No. 18 2008 on
Municipal Solid Waste Management to heighten attention to this issue and improve the requirements
and incentives for local governments to improve performance. The law aims to reduce the generation
of solid waste by encouraging communities to "reduce, reuse, recycle", and to improve the handling of
solid waste through improved separation of types of waste and processing prior to final treatment. The
law also requires municipalities to upgrade solid waste handling facilities, including landfills.

78.      The Ministry of Environment is preparing regulations (PP) to implement the law and has
consolidated legislative requirements into three packages: (i) waste handling, (ii) waste minimization
and (iii) management of special waste categories. The regulations have taken longer than expected
stemming from delays in finalizing the drafting. Government regulations on waste handling and waste
minimization are being prepared in advance of the regulation on handing special waste which needs
additional technical discussions. MPW plays a role in improving solid waste management and has
issued a Strategic Plan for the development of solid waste management (a road map for waste sector).

79.      Environmental Impact Assessment: New legal framework for the future. In 2009, the GOI
passed Law No. 32/2009 on Environmental Protection and Management. Under this law, the AMDAL
process (Analisis Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan) ­ the assessment of proposed activities with
significant anticipated impact on the environment ­ has become a stronger instrument for addressing
environmental pollution and degradation. The law requires completion of the impact assessment and
preparation of an environmental management and monitoring plan (UKL/UPL30) as a prerequisite for
the business licensing and environmental permit process (e.g., mining, building, and industrial
permits). (Previously, environmental requirements were not tied to business licensing processes, so
there could be gaps in implementation.) In addition, the law also includes provisions for licensing of
AMDAL commissions, certification requirements for AMDAL compilers and sanctions for non-
compliance with the AMDAL process.

80.      Strengthening the AMDAL process is important to ensure that the proper environmental
assessments are carried out to improve the design and sustainability of all infrastructure projects,
whether public or private. Indonesia has decentralized responsibility for environmental impact
assessment. All 33 provincial governments and 55 percent of kabupaten/kota governments have
AMDAL commissions. The Ministry of Environment has undertaken two surveys on quality of
assessments performed by the commissions and is undertaking measures to improve performance in
this area, i.e. through introduction of licensing of AMDAL commissions, the certification of AMDAL
compilers, and the establishment of an AMDAL training center.




30
   UKL/UPLs are environmental monitoring plans for activities with moderate environmental impact (Upaya Pengelolaan
Lingkungan (UKL); Upaya Pemantauan Lingkungan (UPL). For low expected impact, firms may submit special letters
(Surat Pernyataan Pengelolaan Lingkungan, SPPL) agreeing to manage and monitor.
                                                       29
GOVERNANCE IN PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING
81.      The Ministry of Public Works as the Governance Pilot. The MPW accounts for a considerable
part of the national government's public infrastructure investment program, including US$ 2 billion
per year delivered through the Directorate General of Highways (DGH) alone. Through its sheer size,
the exposure and measures to improve governance in MPW have a major direct impact and can also
demonstrate potential benefits through visible results.31

82.     Performance-Based Planning and Contracting to Improve Maintenance: To improve and
guarantee the level of resources dedicated to maintenance, the Government has moved towards
medium-term planning and budgeting through introducing a Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF) for 76 agencies. Performance based budgeting has also been introduced to include medium-
term timelines and output targets for each agency's activities. Comprehensive multi-year budgeting,
performance-based targets are instituted to ensure consistency in financial allocations.

83.       Procurement: The MPW has moved to strengthen procurement systems through a step wise
gradual introduction of various degrees of an e-procurement system.32 At the first level, the semi e-
procurement system publishes advertisements, provides bidding documents, answers queries and
notifies contract awards. The second level, the e-procurement plus system, formulated and introduced
by DGH, allows for all of this as well as the online submission of bids. Approximately 75 percent of
transactions use the system, mostly through semi-e-procurement and semi e-procurement plus. All
DGH national roads contracts are processed through the electronic system.33

84.      A key constraint to further automation are existing regulations concerning electronic
signatures requiring hard copies for the lowest three bidders to be submitted prior to contract award
causing a time consuming, error-prone and meaningless comparison of hard copies with electronic
submissions. The National Public Procurement Agency (NPPA) is planning for a presidential decree
to be issued within a year so that full e-procurement can be used with only electronic bid submission.

85.    Internal Audit: The MPW Inspectorate-General (IG) has a broad set of priorities covering
minimization of leakage, improved quality of public works and support for good project management.
The IG recognizes a need for more systematic risk assessment to support these objectives and the

31
   The MPW program examines risk in the full project cycle: from planning to design to bidding to payments to audit. In
particular, collusion remains a country risk from projects recently affecting donor-funded projects MPW is also planning to
pilot performance-based contracting for maintenance.
32
   The current system is considered an e-tendering system within the industry norms. However, since all GOI agencies use
the term of e-procurement, the terminology is maintained to avoid confusion.
33
   The DGH advisory team is responsible for guidance to tender committees, evaluating problematic procurement procedures,
recommending improvements and disseminating information on standard bidding documents.
                                                                    30
program to implement a Risk Based Internal Audit (RBIA) approach is the centerpiece. The program
was launched with pilots covering the provinces of Riau, Yogyakarta and East Kalimantan and another
six. Manuals are being prepared by a technical task force and an IG wide training program is in place.

86.     Oversight, Transparency and Disclosure. The MPW website provides a high standard of
information disclosure including the ministry's budget, planned roads and other works, the results of
all tenders including winners and losers and bid prices, audit reports, and quarterly financial reports
for World Bank projects. The Government has also piloted contract oversight with engineering firms
having greater authority and responsibility for successful delivery rather than just advisory services.

87.     Going Forward Toward Deepen Governance and Demonstration to Others. The MPW, and
DGH in particular, have relatively high procurement capacity but with significant room for
improvement in the area of management and oversight of procurement activities. Absence of
professional procurement management in implementing agencies, fragmentation of procurement
responsibility and weak procurement capacity are the most important impediments to improving
public procurement. In response, LKPP issued a decree to create procurement service units (ULPs) at
all implementing agencies (to be included in the Presidential Decree on public procurement). The
other areas in the work program are to help change regulations for e-procurement to become fully
online and for outreach to other agencies on risk based audit, internal controls, and audit reports.

                 IV.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

LINK TO THE INDONESIA COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
88.      The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), "Investing in Indonesia's Institutions", was
discussed by the Board of Executive Directors in September 2008. It covers the period FY09-FY12. It
recognizes Indonesia's emergence as a more confident middle-income country and repositions the
World Bank's modest but strategic partnership role in supporting a country-led development strategy
and the Government's own core programs and policies. Continuing and deepening the long-standing
focus of the Indonesia program on governance, the strategy recognizes that more effective public
institutions are the key to better development outcomes in the future.

89.     The IDPL series addresses many of the core areas of engagement set out in the CPS. For
example, support of better environment for private sector development; support of public sector
governance through enhanced public financial management and governance. In support of the CPS
goal to strengthen decentralized local governments and institutions to increase the impact of public
spending, the IDPL series seeks to now build on initial success at the sub-national level in the area of
improved water and sanitation, by supporting the Government's strategy on sub national connectivity
across the archipelago.

COLLABORATION WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS
90.     In assessing Indonesia's suitability for policy lending, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the World Bank in Indonesia consult regularly on macro-economic and sector issues. The Bank
coordinates closely with the Fund in its regular post-program monitoring and Article IV missions. In
addition, the Bank, the Fund and development partners have worked closely on the Public Financial
Management (PFM) agenda. The separate macroeconomic DPL series provides a platform to push the
reform agenda in areas where both institutions are working.

91.      The World Bank, the ADB, and the Government of Japan are all supporting the Government's
infrastructure reform program, and there is close coordination between all three development partners.
The ADB and Japan have a separate but related series of policy loans, focused on a large subset of the
Government's reforms. The reforms being recognized by the Bank's IDPL series are a smaller subset
of the Government's reforms, focused on areas of high priority to the Government, and where the
Bank is closely involved in dialogue with the Government.

92.     The Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program (IRSDP) is a cluster of three policy-
based sub-program loans, supported by the ADB and the Government of Japan. The ADB's loan
timing is November of 2006, 2008 and 2010. The Government of Japan's loans follow the ADB's
loans with a few months delay. The World Bank was closely involved in preparation of the IRSDP.
The ADB's first two IRSDP loans were for US$ 400 million and US$ 280 million respectively. The
Government of Japan has provided parallel policy loans in March 2007, and February 2009, each for
US$ 100 million. The ADB is providing a US$ 200 million ISRDP3 loan in 2010 to coincide with
World Bank's IDPL4; and JBIC will provide US$ 100 million in co-financing.

93.      The IRSDP program is organized into three themes (i) cross-sectoral reforms, including the
institutional and policy framework for private-sector participation, measures to mobilize long-term
finance for infrastructure, and the delineation of responsibilities of national and local governments in
infrastructure provision; (ii) sector-specific reforms in roads, ports, airports, railways, electricity, oil
and gas, water supply and sanitation, and telecommunications, addressing sector planning, cost
recovery, competition, independent regulation, market access and prevention of misuse of market
power, and reform of subsidy policies; and (iii) facilitation of preparation and execution of well-
structured PPP transactions. There is regular dialogue between the Bank, the ADB, and the
Government of Japan to ensure consistency of policy messages.
                                                    32
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
94.     The IDPL series is complemented by existing and proposed World Bank Group infrastructure
operations which, in addition to expanding infrastructure networks and promoting household access to
services, address high priority sector-specific institutional issues.

95.      Historically the Bank played an important role in the energy sector, but pulled back
substantially in the aftermath of the Suharto era. More recently, significant effort has been made to re-
establish a strong engagement in the sector, with a particular emphasis on renewable energy. The
current portfolio includes the Java-Bali Power Sector Restructuring and Strengthening Project,
helping PLN to improve efficiency and reliability, the Domestic Gas Markets Development Project,
helping to expand natural gas as an alternative to coal, and the Power Transmission Development
Project, to augment and improve the reliability of the transmission grid in Java and Sumatera. Projects
currently being prepared include a loan for a hydro-electric pumped storage project on the Upper
Cisokan River and a geothermal renewable energy development project. While the IDPL engages with
high level policy makers on issues of the overall level of tariffs and subsidies, the engagement
obtained at the project level is fundamental to the implementation of any eventual reforms in subsidies
and tariffs, as well as wider technical and commercial reforms.

96.     The Bank has played a similarly important role in the development of Indonesia's roads, but
the project pipeline has slowed in recent years with difficulties experienced in respect of governance.
The current portfolio includes the Second Eastern Indonesia Road Transport Project and the Strategic
Roads Improvement Project. A Western Indonesia National Roads Improvement Project and a Road
Maintenance Preservation Fund Project are under discussion. The IDPL series provides a forum for
engagement on governance issues within the Ministry of Public Works, which may over time ease
some of the difficulties experienced with the Bank's road projects.

97.     To help address the chronic problems in piped water, the Bank has one project, the Urban
Water Supply and Sanitation Project, which supports investments in three PDAMs. In addition, there
are two GPOBA output-based grants for Jakarta and Surabaya. Bank engagement in the sector has
been primarily through trust-funded technical assistance activities. For many years PDAM debt arrears
have acted as a legal barrier to Ministry of Finance approval for on-lending of Bank funds to most
PDAMs. The debt restructuring reforms recognized in IDPL2 are a significant breakthrough for
potential lending into the sector, while the output-based grants (hibah) for PDAMs recognized in
IDPL3 should provide incentives to sub-national governments to improve the flow of finance to
PDAMs. Following the IDPL policy discussions, a strong pipeline of investment projects to increase
water connections has been established and will likely come to fruition in the near future.

98.      In support of the PPP program, the Bank and IFC are jointly investing in the Indonesia
Infrastructure Finance Facility. This operation provides long-term financing for private sector led
infrastructure projects and is timely given the financing difficulties for private infrastructure
investment as a result of the global financial crisis. The Ministry of Finance Risk Management Unit
has also recently launched the Indonesia Guarantee Fund to provide public sector contingent liability
support for PPP projects. In addition, the IFC is providing advisory services to PLN to develop a 2 x
1,000 MW IPP in Central Java.

LESSONS LEARNED
99.     The initial design of the IDPL program reflected World Bank experience in the design of
policy loans, in Indonesia, and across the globe. Some of the principal lessons from international
experience are set out in Box 4.1. The lessons learned over the past years relating to Indonesia and to
the IDPL program suggest the usefulness of the IDPL dialogue in advancing new ideas with key
policy makers, as well as the importance of regular dialogue on the triggers, both to maintain
momentum and to refine agreement on policy content. At the IDPL's inception in 2006, the conditions
                                                   33
facing the sector dictated that the IDPL series support modest steps for strategically important
outcomes in the infrastructure sector. While the program supported outcomes which were at the crux
of the sector's challenges, performance targets for these areas and the policy actions to support them
were kept at relatively conservative levels by design, thereby contributing positively to a new and
growing confidence in the nascent partnership between the Government and its donor partners, to
build on for the future

                 Box 4.1 Application of Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
The IDPL program embodies reforms which have been at the center of the Government's own program with
strong Government commitment to reforms. In such areas, the IDPL dialogue is used to make suggestions for
improvements in the way in which the Government works towards its own objectives. In some areas, the IDPL
dialogue has been used to advance reforms which were not initially within the Government's main program. In
such areas, the IDPL has been instrumental in convincing key policy makers of the need for action.

Principle 2: Agree up front with Government and partners on an accountability framework
The policy matrix represents an agreed framework by Government and the Bank, involving considerable overlap
with ADB and JBIC. The matrix reflects considerable discussion and agreement within Government regarding
responsible ministries and agencies accountable for the triggers.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The policy matrix entails a subset of key reform measures that are part of the Government's broader
development program. Although the Bank is engaged in dialogue across a number of infrastructure policy issues,
many policy actions are left outside the scope of the IDPL to take into account country circumstances. Trigger
satisfaction has been supported by a range of technical, analytical and lending assistance provided by or
coordinated with the World Bank Group.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
Prior actions for the IDPL are refined over time, drawing on indicative triggers established the previous year.
The list of 11 prior actions for 2010 is focused on ensuring results for the strategically important areas that are
critical for achievement of the program's reform outcomes.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to performance-based support
Regular missions are conducted to discuss with the Government progress towards each year's indicative triggers.
The IDPL loans are made annually, coinciding with the Government's fiscal year, in order to enhance
predictability of financial support.


100.     In support of the vital nature of strong Government ownership and committed counterparts,
the IDPL was flexible within a framework, and allowed reforms to accelerate over the program as the
Government became more committed. On balance, the program has taken stronger than expected
steps in its final year laying the basis continued progress toward the reform outcomes for years to
come. In the end, the program exceeded the relatively modest expectations established at the outset of
the IDPL series. Moreover, as the package of noteworthy achievements taken are as whole, form a
comprehensive, irreversible and strategically important set of reforms, the IDPL I-IV can be
considered as a basis for expansion. The IDPL program has been therefore helped ensure Government
ownership through strong dialogue, broad engagement and a client driven program. Areas such as
power and land reform were not contemplated at the outset of the program.

101.     Constant collaboration and dialogue between the Government and the Bank has been
important to client ownership of an IDPL program that fosters transformational change. The Bank's
strong field presence continued to facilitate constant collaboration and dialogue with the Government,
                                                       34
not only on the IDPL but also on other engagements that provide synergies with the DPL. The
collaboration also allows for a degree of flexibility to ensure sustained Government ownership while
maintaining the programs development objectives.

102.     Finally, IDPL is only one instrument among many that are available in a multi-faceted
engagement, and the choice of instrument should be contingent on the issue, the political context and
the institutional circumstances. This is particularly applicable in the Indonesian case because of the
size and scope of the World Bank program in Indonesia. Large teams are working closely on a daily
basis with Government counterparts at often very senior levels on a wide range of issues from public
financial management and trade and investment, finance, public expenditures and poverty. In this
context, good internal coordination and exploitation of synergies is a must.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
103.      The analytical underpinnings of the IDPL program were set out in the IDPL1 Program
Document. Chief among them is a major cross-sectoral World Bank report, "Indonesia, Averting an
Infrastructure Crisis: A Framework for Policy and Action", published in 2004, and substantially
adopted by the Government. The update of cross-sectoral analysis of critical infrastructure issues was
part of the 2007 Public Expenditure Review and an Infrastructure Public Expenditure Review is
currently underway. In 2008, the Bank commenced a study looking at issues of land acquisition, in
support of the IDPL program and in 2009, launched three studies on energy tariffs and subsidies,
comparing international experience and providing recommendations on better targeting for Indonesia.
Finally as analytical underpinning for future IDPL series, a connectivity study was launched to
identify priorities to integrate Indonesia as a whole, focusing on intra-island, inter-island and
international connectivity issues. In addition, in partnership with JICA and AusAID, additional sector
specific work on ports, railways, and shipping are underway.

   V.    THE PROPOSED FOURTH INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

IDPL SERIES OVERVIEW
104.    The Government's infrastructure revival program seeks to unblock hindrances to economic
growth, increase access to basic services and economically connect the vast archipelago and the IDPL
series has played an important role. The Bank, along with ADB and JICA, supported the
Government's program through a series of yearly loans. The fourth IDPL completes series and lays
the foundation for a deepening of the program into areas where results are beginning to show, while
expanding into new, equally strategic and urgent areas in support of the Government's new
connectivity agenda.

105.     Through the multi-year, multi-sector, performance based approach, the IDPL program has
contributed to the policy dialogue in each of the policy areas by encouraging various arms of
Government at different levels to identify and integrate key infrastructure needs into own policy and
administrative priorities. The IDPL process helped the Government identify and overcome key policy,
institutional and financial bottlenecks in the sector and convene various stakeholders involved in the
development of infrastructure policy and its implementation. In doing so, the IDPL provided a vehicle
for the Government and its donor partners to actively strategize on ways forward based on regular
assessments of infrastructure needs, sector challenges and program performance.

106.     At the IDPL's inception in 2006, the conditions facing the sector dictated that the IDPL series
support modest steps for strategically important outcomes in the infrastructure sector. While the
program supported outcomes which were at the crux of the sector's challenges, performance targets
for these areas and the policy actions to support them were kept at relatively conservative levels by
design, thereby contributing positively to a new and growing confidence in the nascent partnership
between the Government and its donor partners, to build on for the future.

107.     The organizing theme of the IDPL series was to raise the amount, quality and efficiency of
public spending on infrastructure while crowding in private participation in the sector, particularly in
the financing aspects, to help fill the country's infrastructure gap. The reform objectives supported by
program, as specified in the Policy Matrix (Annex 2) centered on (i) an increased level of
infrastructure financing from the national and sub-national budgets on their own and in partnership
with the private sector, (ii) improved efficiency and governance in public spending, for both public
and private sector entities, (iii) better pricing and subsidy targeting for electricity and (iv) improved
governance frameworks for land acquisition, public procurement and environmental management.

108.     Overall, progress under the IDPL program has been satisfactory. The Government's
infrastructure program has advanced across a broad front of reform areas, and as the reform
momentum accelerated during the life of the program, in some areas, (i.e. power, water, roads),
exceeded the relatively modest expectations established at the outset of the IDPL series. Moreover, as
the package of noteworthy achievements taken are as whole, form a comprehensive, irreversible and
strategically important set of reforms, the IDPL I-IV can be considered as a basis for expanding the
program of infrastructure support. Particular achievements can be seen in the following areas:

        The Government has resisted and reversed the tendency to limit infrastructure spending as
        actual spending at the national and sub-national levels surpassed the modest IDPL targets.

        An increased proportion of budget allocations that is spent effectively and efficiently.

        Significant sector level reforms in electricity, roads and piped water establishing important
        frameworks which are ready for deepening and scaling up in key sectors.

                                                   36
        Tangible progress in the launching of key enabling frameworks governing PPPs has been
        made, such that two new financial institutions are now ready for business.

        The sensitive but critical area of land acquisition has advanced with the drafting a new, land
        acquisition act which seeks faster but fairer disposition of land acquisition cases.

        Progress has been made in regulations governing better environmental management,
        particularly of solid waste and governance improvements in MPW centered on performance
        based budgeting, internal auditing and on-line public procurement.

109.     Performance targets for the program, (Annex 3) designed to measure progress on reform
outcomes, show a mixed picture of higher than expected advances in some areas and less than
expected targets in others. Indicators measuring public expenditures targets were all surpassed as were
related indicators covering road construction and quality ­ given the nature of public expenditure. On
the other hand, while private sector commitments to the country were higher than expected, progress
on formulating well structured PPP transactions has been much slower than expected. In some the
areas of significant progress has been made, yet targets are only been partially, met. This is the case
for (i) subsidy targeting in PLN PSO, where the subsidy going to lower income households was 57
percent in 2010, as compared to the 70 percent target, (ii) improved governance and efficiency of
public procurement, and (iii) long term investment in PDAMs.

IDPL4 OVERVIEW
110.     The IDPL series comprises four individual, yearly loans which serve as milestones to
periodically recognize reform actions taken by the Government, and adjust policy actions to better
meet the program's reform objectives. As the fourth and last loan in the series, IDPL4 prior actions
represent the final actions in the series to reach the development outcomes envisioned at the start of
the series. Therefore, based on achievements both, (i) in implementing important policy actions during
2010 toward key reform outcomes and (ii) the accelerating reform momentum recorded by the
Government under the program, overall progress under the IDPL4 is deemed to be satisfactory.

111.     The underlying philosophy that the program accompanies supports the Government's program
and disburses based on overall progress, which-given the complexity and institutional nature of the
reform agenda may in some cases run ahead or fall behind expectations, or need clarification in the
face of developments. Therefore, indicative triggers specified agreed in principal under the previous
year's operation (IDPL3) have been adjusted to better reflect the most recent actions taken by the
Government to advance IDPL reform outcomes and reflect three substantive reasons: (i) the
Government has gone farther than expected or improved upon the approach, (ii) the wording has been
clarified to accurately reflect the current situation on the ground, and (iii) the Government has taken
actions but has not gone as far as expected.

112.     On balance, the program has taken stronger than expected steps in its final year laying the
basis continued progress toward the reform outcomes for years to come. In four of the eleven triggers,
the wording has been strengthened to recognize the fact that the Government has gone farther than
expected. In two policy triggers - E-Procurement and Environmental Regulations - progress has been
in the right direction, but at a slower than expected pace. In the case of PPP, the scope of the proposed
reform has widened but achievements on the ground lag earlier expectations. The others four prior
actions underwent slight rewording to reflect current realities on the ground and ensure that the
wording of the prior action was fully aligned with the Government activity. Table 5.1 below provides
specific detail on the adjustments to IDPL3 Indicative Triggers as they become IDPL 4 prior actions
with some attention to the progress in meeting original triggers along with the rational for adjustment.

THE WAY FORWARD: SUPPORTING THE CONNECTIVITY AGENDA

113.     President Yudhoyono, on numerous occasions, has stressed the importance of `domestic
connectivity' throughout Indonesia to foster economic development and inclusive growth. Improved
domestic connectivity would help to lower costs and prices in outlying regions as well as enable
nationwide productivity increases. Infrastructure development is a prerequisite for strengthened
linkages and thus a key driver of the connectivity agenda. The program of infrastructure support for
connectivity has two areas of focus: (i) creating links between regions (inter-island connections), in
particular transport links like shipping, ports and airports, linking the islands in the most cost effective
and sustainable way; and (ii) strengthening capacity within regions (intra-island connections), such as,
local roads and access to electricity and water services, and linking rural areas to growth poles.

114.   The Government is exploring various designs for a program which emphasizes the "financing
for connectivity" theme and is seeking strong partnership arrangements among principal donors
(ADB, JBIC, AusAID, World Bank). In particular, based on an assessment of each area's strategic
importance and probability of success, the Government desires to build on ongoing reforms where
achievements are likely, and expand into areas aligned with the new dimensions of the connectivity
agenda such as sub-national and inter-island dimensions of infrastructure provision.

115.    Building on policy areas initiated under the IDPL series, the following five areas have a strong
potential to achieve results based on the readiness of robust analysis, articulated sector strategies and
an effective counterpart dialogue.

        Pricing mechanisms for electricity which enable cost adjustments and regional differentiation
        of tariffs in order to promote cost recovery and enable the unbundling of power distribution.
        Determination of tariffs based on regionally differentiated cost of supply would represent an
        early but critical step in the overall reform of the sector which foresees private participation in
        distribution as well as generation. The new Electricity Law contemplates differentiated
        pricing with regionally differentiated tariffs based on supply costs coupled with region-
        specific subsidies through provincial governments in order to better price the cost of energy
        and encourage entry by the private sector. The implementing rules and regulations will be
        formalized through the drafting of three Government regulations.

        Activation of the Road Preservation Fund for Provincial/Kabupaten roads. Rural roads
        contribute to inclusive growth through access for rural communities to basic services and
        markets, by connecting rural areas to growing urban areas and by linking the major growth
        poles on each island. Since decentralization in 2001, around half of the public investment in
        the road sector goes directly to local governments who manage 82 percent of the total
        nationwide road network. Despite the increase in budget allocations, the quality of sub-
        national roads network falls due to inadequate maintenance ­ in large part due to the financing
        availability for road maintenance. The Road Maintenance Fund is a good first step which now
        needs to be operational zed in order to maintain a momentum for the reform.

        Output-based incentives for local governments to expand piped water connections. Investing
        in water and sanitation is essential for Indonesia's growth and competitiveness. With the
        financial restructuring of the PDAMs, the sector is now ready for scaling up to focus on the
        number of water connections. The performance-based approach to public support, piloted
        under the "financially viable PDAM" pilot, is proving to be an innovative approach capable of
        directly increasing the number of water connections.

        Draft of a new Land Acquisition Law. There has been significant progress in reforming land
        acquisition procedures, through a new law that increases reliance on independent appraisal as
                                                    41
        the basis of valuation, rather than tax assessments; permits land acquisition funds to be
        consigned to a court pending resolution of disputes, and increases the supply of independent
        appraisers and land surveyors. The measures appear in practice to have accelerated land
        acquisition processes, an important objective of infrastructure reforms.

        Strengthening of AMDAL practices. The Government is continuing to improve AMDALs
        quality by introducing competency criteria for AMDAL compilers and obligations for
        AMDAL Review Commission to determine the allocation of licenses. The Environment Law
        provides for the prosecution of AMDAL violators. Draft regulations to implement AMDAL
        law are under public consultation, while five ministerial regulations mandated by the Law are
        being prepared covering awarding of licenses; competence certificates for compilers;
        AMDALs in business activity transition periods; environmental audits; and UKL/UPL.

116.     The new areas which are being considered as part of the Government's connectivity agenda
are in the areas of sector policies for rail, shipping and ports, and outcome-driven subsidy policies.
Perpres 13/2010 has established the Government's platform to support local PPP by applying the
Government's PPP policy to sub-national projects while the Law on Sea Transport and Shipping
(17/2008) sets the scene for private sector construction, operation and maintenance of ports. To
support intra-island connectivity, programs could focus on:

       Developing project and acquiring temporary/contracted expertise regional ports, and other
       regional transport solutions;

       Ensure multi-modal connections between roads, rail and ports to create an integrated transport
       system for freight and passengers on Java;

       Revitalize railway services with an initial focus on passenger services (the development of
       freight rail makes more economic sense in commodity rich islands off Java);

       Connecter feeder rail lines from sub-urban to metro centers require rehabilitation and
       expansion to facilitate passenger access to work and to reduce urban congestion; and

       Opening the inter-island shipping sector to private participation and competition.

117.     There is a moderate risk of policy capture of the "connectivity" strategy by regional
development concerns. Policies aimed at equitable growth ex ante, rather than equity outcomes
through ex post redistribution policies could derail a sustainable approach to the infrastructure
development within the connectivity agenda. In this regard, there is as yet no consensus within
Government on how to tackle the connectivity agenda, with one school pushing for regional and
equitable development and another focusing on agglomeration and economic geography ­ based
growth. To mitigate these concerns, the Government will be supported with analytical and technical
work demonstrating some of the benefits of a connectivity agenda based on a strategy of raising
competitiveness through improved domestic integration and lower transportation costs ­ specifically
in the case of shipping, ports and rail. Further and more intensive dialogue is poised to commence.

                              VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
118.     In general, the policy actions supported by the operation do not have significant adverse
poverty and social impacts. A more comprehensive review of the poverty and social assessment of the
period leading up to and covering the IDPL program is provided in Annex 6. The IDPL program is
intended to lead to increased investment plans over the next several years, which in turn will take
several years to induce construction and delivery of infrastructure services. Overall, the poverty and
social impacts of increased infrastructure investment will be positive, through the benefits of induced
economic growth, and through the direct provision of and increased access of the poor to much needed
infrastructure services, such as piped water, electricity and roads.

119.    Potential negative impacts include traffic accidents associated with increased road usage,
social dislocation and inadequate compensation for infrastructure related land acquisition, and
potential price increases for electricity and water services. Electricity prices will remain stable for the
lowest user categories, and thus, for most of the poor, electricity price hikes will have little direct
impact. Moreover, with better targeted subsidies, the poor may actually benefit from improved PSO
targeting. Water tariffs may also increase, though tariff increases would be local government decisions
and would vary by location. To the extent that tariff increases restore the capacity of PDAMs to invest
and extend coverage to the poor who currently lack piped service, the poor will benefit as they are
offered an alternative to self-supply of dubious quality and often higher cost.

120.    Recent years have seen increased efforts by the police to improve reporting of accidents;
increased efforts by various cities to improve public transport which may assist in reducing road
accidents (about 60% of which involve motorcyclists); and World Bank roads projects included
measures to promote improved design standards, helping to reduce the cause of accidents. The Bank is
engaging with the Government through the Land Working Group to address issues associated with
land acquisition, including social dislocation and inadequate compensation. The recent history of
Indonesia's treatment of fuel price increases suggests a capacity to balance the negative impacts of
price increases against other social benefits through democratic processes, and to introduce
compensation where appropriate.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
121.    Generally, policy actions supported by the operation do not have significant adverse impacts
on the environment. Successful implementation of the IDPL program is likely to lead to increased and
improved infrastructure services, with both positive and negative environmental consequences. Annex
7 describes the nature and likelihood of these potential effects, and reviews the Government's capacity
to deal with these effects, and the measures being put in place to strengthen this capacity.

122.     Indeed, many of the reforms supported by the IDPL program will help to improve
environmental outcomes. Potentially higher electricity prices can promote energy conservation, but
also run the risk of an increase in the use of fossil fuels, e.g. for cooking purposes. The improvement
of water and sanitation services, promotion of a `3R' concept (reduce, reuse and recycle), sanitary
landfills, and improved AMDAL processes (improved Environmental Impact Assessments and
reviews of EIAs) are all reforms with positive environmental effects.

123.    Potential negative environmental effects may arise from the increased infrastructure
investment sought by the IDPL, which must be accompanied by rigorous environmental management
processes. Potential negative effects include changing the natural landscape, increased emissions of
greenhouse gas and other pollutants due to increased fossil fuel based electricity generation capacity,


                                                    43
  increased ambient air pollution from traffic, and local environmental impacts associated with
  construction works for all forms of infrastructure facilities.

  124.    The IDPL program recognizes the national Government's initiatives to improve municipal
  solid waste management. Indonesia's largely uncontrolled disposal of solid waste has become a
  growing threat to the quality of water, air, and land. The Government's new municipal solid waste
  management law (Law no 18/2008) is an important effort to improve the situation. Management is the
  responsibility of national and sub-national level governments, but the district/municipality level is
  responsible for determining the locations for interim disposal sites, integrated solid waste
  management/processing sites and/or final disposal sites as well as regular monitoring and evaluation
  on closed disposal sites. MPW provides infrastructure support and the Ministry of Environment
  provides norms, standards, procedures and criteria for municipal waste management. Three
  governmental regulations on waste minimization, waste handling and the management of special
  waste categories are under preparation in this regard.

  125.    The IDPL program also recognized the need to improve the quality of AMDALs and capacity
  to conduct AMDALs at the national and local level. Submission of the amendment to Law 23/1997 on
  environmental management to improve the implementation and enforceability of the AMDAL process
  was a prior action for IDPL3 (fulfilled by issuance of Law No 32 2009) and is considered the most
  important step by the government to protect and manage the environment. Now an application for an
  environmental permit must be accompanied by the AMDAL or UKL/UPL. The regulation is currently
  being prepared to implement provisions related to issuance of environmental permits.

  IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
  126.   The monitoring and evaluation framework for the IDPL Program was discussed in the IDPL 1
  Program Document, was slightly revised in IDPL2, and is summarized in Table 6.1. The year by year
  monitoring of the performance indicators is shown in Annex 3.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS, DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
127.    Indonesia has made significant changes in the way its public finances are managed and in
increasing transparency and independent oversight. In almost all areas of PFM, a sound regulatory
framework is now in place. Advances have been made in budget preparation, Government accounting
standards have been formally established and are being adhered to in several respects to produce
comprehensive annual financial statements and the external audit function has made significant
progress in the last few years. However, internal controls in the execution of budget by spending
agencies need improvement. There is no Government-wide Government Financial Management
Information System (GFMIS) yet which provides information for budget management at all levels of
national government. Weak controls in budget execution processes have the potential of jeopardizing
gains from reforms introduced in other areas of PFM.

128.      The PFM reform agenda remains broad-based and continues to focus on (i) improving results-
orientation in state budget planning and development, (ii) improving budget and treasury management,
(iii) strengthening monitoring and evaluation of public expenditures and programs, (iv) improving the
public procurement systems, and (v) improving Government accounting and audit functions. In sum,
the agenda is designed to improve how revenues are raised, how funds are allocated, used, and
accounted for ­ both at the central and at the regional level.

129.   The details of the PFM program are discussed in Annex 8 of the program document. The
IDPL program is being further supported through strengthening PFM systems of Ministry of Public
Works (MPW) through (a) introduction of e-procurement and (b) strengthening the office of Inspector
General. The details of these actions are discussed in the section on Policy Area IV ­ Environment,
Procurement and Public Sector Financial Management.

130.   The Borrower is the Republic of Indonesia and this operation is a single-tranche IBRD loan of
US$ 200 million that would be made available upon loan effectiveness, as all policy actions supported
by the loan would have been completed prior to Board presentation. For the IBRD loan, the
Government has confirmed that Indonesia would borrow this amount as a Variable Spread Loan
(VSL) in US$ currency with annuity repayment schedule linked to commitments.

131.     Loan disbursement follows standard Bank procedures for Development Policy Lending. The
loan amount will be disbursed into a foreign currency account of the Borrower at Bank Indonesia that
forms part of Indonesia's official foreign exchange reserves. The equivalent Rupiah amount will be
transferred to the Borrower's General Operational Treasury (SBUN) account used to finance budget
expenditures. The Borrower will provide to the Bank a written confirmation that this transfer has been
completed, and provide to the Bank any other relevant information relating to these matters that the
Bank may reasonably request. Disbursements of the loan will not be linked to any specific purchases
and no procurement requirements have to be satisfied, except that the Borrower is required to comply
with the standard negative list of excluded items that may not be financed with Bank loan proceeds.
Ongoing discussions with Government on the overall reform program in the infrastructure being
supported by this DPL will form the basis for reporting on substantive policy issues.

132.    The foreign exchange control environment is assessed to be generally satisfactory. The
country is no longer subject to the Extended Arrangement from the IMF. Bank Indonesia (BI) was last
subject to the transitional procedures under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy in 2002. That
assessment recommended remedial action to address a number of vulnerabilities in the audit
arrangements of BI. The main recommendations have been implemented, including the establishment
of an independent audit committee at BI and the publication of BI's audited financial statements.
Audited financial statements for BI for 2009 have been reviewed by the BPK and contain an
unqualified opinion. Given that the foreign exchange environment does not present a significant risk,
a separate annual audit will not be required for this operation.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
133.     Macroeconomic Stability (low risk). Despite indications of a sound external position and debt
sustainability analyses there are macroeconomic risks. Indonesia is poised to withstand various shocks
to the exchange rate or interest rate as debt-to-GDP ratios have declined from 30 percent to 35 percent,
foreign reserves have increased to above US$ 81.3 billion and the country has gained access to
bilateral and multilateral swap arrangements to bolster liquidity. Indonesian corporations are believed
to be reasonably well diversified financially and not significantly leveraged. However, Indonesia is a
financially open economy and there are significant foreign holdings especially in the stock market and
Government bonds. A significant depreciation could affect some corporations and result in rising
NPLs and erosion of bank capital. A prolonged recession with continued risk aversion episodes may
pose challenges from a balance of payments perspective. Mitigating these risks requires good
macroeconomic management, cooperation between Bank Indonesia and economic ministries and
crowding in of private investment.

134.    A secondary risk to macroeconomic management is fiscal pressure posed by subsidies ­
particularly for electricity and fuel. At present, an increase in world prices would translate into an
increase in the subsidies paid by the Government. The mitigating measure would involve moving
toward opportunity cost pricing as determined by the market to enable a major effort to reduce
subsidies.

135.     Corruption (high risk). Infrastructure investment is vulnerable to corruption at all stages of the
project cycle, posing risks that the full development potential of increased infrastructure investment
will not be realized. It also poses reputational risks for the Bank through association with
infrastructure expenditures under the IDPL series. Risk mitigation is not simple and is being addressed
on a number of fronts, including by the IDPL program itself. The procurement and internal audit
reforms included as triggers are a direct part of the Bank's general anti-corruption efforts. IDPL
triggers also support specific efforts toward greater transparency and accountability through improved
planning processes, publication of PSOs and greater competition in the development of PPPs.

136.    Government Capacity (high risk). The IDPL-supported reforms have involved various
government ministries/agencies, with varied performance across different agencies. Nevertheless, the
overall commitment and ownership to reforms is strong, and the CMEA has performed very well in
ensuring consistent and effective cross-ministerial coordination. The IDPL program has also helped to
strengthen various institutions across the IDPL pillars. These efforts are also complemented by other
Bank instruments, including investment projects, technical assistance and AAA, which partly address
concerns related to institutional capacity of the agencies involved in the IDPL program.

Baseline:                    No PPP transactions needing Government support were tendered in
                             compliance with Perpres 67/2005 in 2006.
Latest information:          Progress on transactions has been slow due to the global financial conditions,
                             but certain achievements over the past 18 months indicate a likely transaction
                             near-term. Bids are expected by the end of 2010 for the Central Java IPP with
                             other PPP projects likely to materialize in the near term.

Baseline:                     16 toll road concessions were signed before August 17, 2007.
                             Latest information: The toll roads have achieved limited progress, despite
                             the fact that many of them date back over ten years. During the past three
                             years, GoI has tried to encourage existing concessionaires to comply with
                             their obligations or terminate them. MPW issued Ministerial Decree 6/2010
                             on Continuation in the Provision of Toll Roads to resolve the backlog.

                             0.5 percent of GDP in 2005.
Latest information:          The World Bank's Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) database
                             indicates that financial commitments to private infrastructure commitments
                             increased to 0.7 percent of GDP in 2006 and 1.1 percent in 2008. 2009 data

                             AMDALs at national and local leveliv (MOE).
Baseline:                    Limited actions to address existing AMDAL known weaknesses, and lack of
                             technical and financial capacity for review, approval and monitoring of
                             AMDAL functions at local level.
Latest information:          The Ministry of Environment is undertaking several measures to improve the
                             quality of AMDAL reviews undertaken by local governments. Recent
                             legislation vclarifies AMDAL objectives and outputs, strengthens procedures
                             for Environmental Protection Plans (RKL/RPL) and establishes clearer
                             standards for environmental permits at national and local levels.vi

Baseline:                    Few if any construction/works contracts funded by APBN were awarded
                             within 45 days of bid opening in 2006.
Latest information:          In 2009-10, 45.7 percent (2,495 of 5,463) of construction/works contracts
                             funded by APBN were awarded within 45 days of bid opening.

Indicator 13:                Production by MPW Inspector General of relevant and effective internal
                             audit reports ­ including identification of weaknesses in control systems

                             sanctions ­ and timely implementation of the reports' recommendations.
Baseline:                    Inspector General audit reports lacked systemic recommendations on
                             weaknesses in control systems, and focus instead on recording individual
                             lapses or failures.
Latest information:          RBIA has been launched in 9 provinces producing audit reforms which were
                             traditionally carried out on an ad hoc basis and did not properly account for
                             risk.



iv Improvement is defined by: (i) better definition of the objectives and expected outputs of public involvement/consultation
in AMDAL; (ii) strengthening of existing procedures for RKL/RPL by requiring a detailed SPDL to be produced within the
first year of operation; and (iii) progress to establish minimum standards of operation for local governments covering
institutional, human resources, and budgetary requirements, linked to incentive systems for good performance.
vLaw No. 32/2009 on Environmental Protection and Management
vi These include ministerial decrees No. 7/2010 on the certification of AMDAL compilers, No. 13/2010 on regulations of
environmental plans and certificates; No. 14/2010 on regulations for the documentation of ongoing activities without existing
environmental regulations; and No. 15/2010 on the regulation of licenses for the AMDAL assessment committees

        ANNEX 4: IDPL4 PROGRAM PERFORMANCE IN MEETING PRIOR ACTIONS

1.      The expanded program takes into account the extent to which the prior actions for the IDPL4
loan have been met, along with an assessment of the performance targets for the four-year program as
a whole. In the case of IDPL4, there is no area which is not being implemented, and all actions can be
deemed as irreversible with minimal risk for backsliding or abandonment.

POLICY AREA 1: NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE

Prior Action 1: Government maintained the proposed 2011 APBN allocation for national
infrastructure at least thirty percent (30%) over 2007APBN level.
Evidence of Achievement: President's budget address to Parliament August 17, 2010 and budget
APBN proposed submissions.
2.       The final budget approval by Parliament is pending, but preliminary amounts for 2011 show
that the proposal for the forthcoming year will far exceed targets. From the GOI commitment for 2011,
evidenced by doubling budget allocations, concluded that an irreversible revival in public
infrastructure spending from the key national agencies has been witnessed for the period.

3.      The monitoring indicators examine the actual amounts invested during the IDPL program and
have increased by 106 percent from IDR 24.8 to 52.1 trillion from 2006 to 2009 ­ far above the
program's admittedly conservative target of 25 percent and dominated by expenditures of two
agencies - the Ministry of Public Works and the Ministry of Transport.

4.        The legal instrument requested for the IDPL4 is the APBN 2011, issued on 17 August 2010.

Prior Action 2: Government issued a Ministerial Regulation (Permen ESDM 7/2010) which adjusts
electricity tariffs in order to reduce and better targeted PSO subsidies.
Evidence of Achievement: Ministerial Regulation (Permen ESDM 7/2010) on tariff rates and their
distribution across user categories, PLN's letter dated October 4, 2010 on PSO, and Minutes of
Meeting of DPR Commission VII.
5.      Parliament approved the new tariff schedule effective July 1, 2010 which envisioned an
increase in tariff for most consumption categories - ranging from 0 to 18 percent - the first such
increase since 2003. Therefore, the IDPL notes that reforms in the power sector have gone farther
than expected and the IDPL4 prior action was adjusted accordingly to recognize these stronger actions.

6.        The distribution of the tariff increase across consumer categories was approved initially
through the issuance and approval by Parliament (DPR) of a Ministerial Regulation (Permen ESDM
7/2010) and in doing so, the Government took strong, positive steps toward the objective reducing and
better targeting the PSO subsidies to lower income households. However, as a result of strong
lobbying by industry groups, MEMR was asked by Parliament to consider the capping of industrial
tariffs at 18 percent.

                                                   61
7.       Still, despite the intense lobbying by industry, tariff reform has momentum. While only a tariff
study was envisioned at the time of IDPL3, by the time of IDPL4, a tariff adjustment had been
approved - to encourage investment in generation, transmission, and distribution as well as to lower
and better target subsidies.i Therefore, the proportion of subsidies received by residential customers
that consume less than 900 VA, is expected to increase from 44 percent in 2007 to 53 percent in 2010
- lower than the program's 70 percent target, but a major step toward reversing earlier trends.

8.       A tariff adjustment along with the higher margin afforded to PLN in 2010 should also improve
its financial capacity (all costs remaining equal or becoming lower) particularly for meeting its capital
investment requirements under the second phase of the 10,000 MW crash program. At the same time,
based on PLN's own study and technical advice from the Government's development partners,
including the Bank, options to introduce regional pricing and cost recovery are being examined.

9.       The required legal instrument for IDPL4 is the Ministerial Regulation (Permen ESDM 7/2010)
on tariff rates and their distribution across user categories.

Prior Action 3: Government prepared the MPW medium-term plan and submitted the MPW budget
based on medium-term budget estimates.
Evidence of Achievement: Medium-term plan and budget submission of the MPW to the MOF, letter
dated July 22, 2010
10.      MOF and Bappenas have been working with MPW and other line ministries to implement
planning and budgeting reform with MPW a leading Government body in the implementation of these
efforts to define objectives, outputs and measured achievements of ministerial directorates. Activities
with the MPW have been ongoing under the IDPL1-4 series since IDPL3 and have followed the GOI's
five year development plan (RPJMN) and the yearly Government work plans (RKP). The RPJMN was
outlined in Presidential Decree 5/2010 and the 2011 RKP was outlined in Perpres 29/2011.

11.     The MOF and Bappenas sent a joint letter to line ministries that outlined the reforms and
included five comprehensive annexes: unique restructuring programs and activities for each line
ministries related to their budgeting and planning; implementing procedures for the reforms;
implementing procedures for formulating Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs) based on
the RPJMN; template documents for all future budgets; and timelines of implementation deadlines.

12.     The Directorate-General of Highways (DGH) of the MPW prepared a draft work program that
included objectives and outputs, based on the Government yearly work plans (RKP). These included
performance-based budgeting frameworks for the first time. While multi-year budgeting has not yet
been institutionalized, annual budget allocations from MOF are considered performance-based
through a process whereby MOF is satisfied that budget requests are based on the medium term plan,
which itself is based on technical planning of the agency. The MPW medium-term plan and budget
submission, submitted to MOF in August 2010, outlines plans up to 2012 and 2013, in the form of
baseline estimates allowing for fiscal variations on an annual basis.

13.      The required legal instruments for IDPL4 are the submission of medium-term plans and
budgets by the MPW to the MOF and Bappenas, dated July 22, 2010. Additional background
information includes: a circular letter from the MOF requesting from line ministries all planning and
budgetary documents; Perpres 5/2010 on the establishment of GOI five-year development plans;
Perpres 29/2010 on the Government Work Plan (RKP); and Permen MenKeu 104/2010 on Guidelines
for the Preparation and Review of Government Budgets and Work plans.


i
  The Government's current approach to tariff adjustments would also potentially encourage energy conservation as PLN
would charge residential, business, and public customers in the 6,600 VA and above category who consume electricity at
rates above 50 percent of the national average, a tariff based on the economic cost of production plus a margin.
                                                         62
Prior Action 4: Draft Government Regulation and draft Presidential Regulation establishing a Road
Preservation Fund which covers national and sub-national rods, and defines the source of funding
submitted for inter-ministerial consultation.
Evidence of Achievement: Transmission for inter-ministerial consultation of Draft Government and
Presidential regulations establishing Road Preservation Fund, Draft Government Regulation and
Draft Presidential Regulation.
14.     The establishment of a Road Preservation Fund is at an advanced stage with the two draft
regulations establishing the Fund under inter-departmental consultation. The first establishes sources
of funding, drafted as a Government Regulation (PP) and the second that outlines procedures and
practices for the management, organization and governance of the RPF- a Presidential Regulation.

15.      Whereas the original idea of the Road Preservation Fund - created under the Traffic and
Transportation Law - was to cover only national roads, the Government has expanded the coverage to
all roads, and thereby exceeded original expectations at the time of IDPL3. The revised wording of
the IDPL4 prior action incorporates the need for a Road Preservation Fund to service a wide range of
roads, including those at the sub-national level and thereby reflects a stronger policy trigger.

16.     The required legal instrument for IDPL4 is a circular ministerial letter (Letters dated August 6,
9 and 10, 2010) from the MPW seeking inter-ministerial consultation of two draft regulations on
funding and management of the Road Preservation Fund.

POLICY AREA II: SUB-NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE

Prior Action 5: Government enacted Perpres 29/2009 which provides for a Government support
regime to assist financially viable PDAMs access long-term loans.
Evidence of Achievement: Perpres 29/2009.
17.     In 2010, 155 PDAMs were assessed as "healthy" (compared with 37 in 2005) through
financial restructuring Presidential Regulation No. 29 2009 was signed to provide credit enhancement
to loans for PDAMs from participating national commercial and regional development banks for
financially viable PDAMs. The scheme improves on Government-channeled financing by engaging
with private sector capital and expertise.

18.     For 2010, MPW allocated US$ 5 million to support the interest rate subsidy and two national
banks have earmarked US$ 400 million. Two PDAMs have received long-term loans through the
scheme, while another 7 are expected to materialize in the calendar year, pending review of the
guarantee by the Government committee. This number, plus three PDAMs that received loans through
MOF on-lending and another two that had borrowed commercially outside the Presidential Regulation
regime, is 11 short of the 25 which were targeted under IDPL-3.

19.     Going forward, assistance to the sector will be focused on programs of output-based fiscal
incentive (Water Hibah) for local governments to expand piped water connections for poor
households. More than 250,000 new connections are expected to be made through incentives paid by
the MPW to local governments, both through the Water Hibah and its precursor program; and about
US$ 660 million in additional investments were made by national government, local governments and
PDAMs from 2007-2009.

20.     Similarly in the water sector, the IDPL prior action was strengthened to reflect the fact that
while a number of PDAMs have been and are being financially restructured, the Government has gone
far beyond simply ensuring PDAMs receive loans, as envisioned under IDPL3. Currently, the
Government has formulated and initiated an innovative approach to future public support for PDAMs


                                                   63
through performance-based schemes: (i) guarantee/subsidy scheme for commercial bank lending; and
(ii) an output-based Hibah grants mechanism to increase connections as laid out in Perpres 29/2009.

21.    The required legal instrument from IDPL4 is Perpres 29/2009 on Government support regime
to PDAMs. Additional background information includes the accompanying guidelines to Perpres
29/2009, which are the Permen PU 21/2009 on Guidelines for Assessment of Feasibility for
Investment in Water Supply Development.\

POLICY AREA III: PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS

Prior Action 6: Government enacted Perpres 13/2010 which amends Perpres 67/2005 by extending
application to projects of sub-national governments and state-owned enterprises.
Evidence of Achievement: Perpres 13/2010.
22.      Results are emerging in Public Private Partnerships (PPP). The Government developed an
enabling environment to scale up and leverage public sector support for private sector financing;
established the PPP financing architecture; and provided much-needed technical assistance.
Transactions should now materialize. IDPL4 recognizes the extension of the governance framework
for PPP transactions to state-owned enterprises and to sub-national governments.

23.     Perpres 67/2005 is the Presidential Regulation that governs the procurement of infrastructure
PPPs. While providing an important governance framework for PPP transactions, it was unclear
whether it covered public support to projects of sub-national governments and state-owned enterprises
(SOE). Therefore Perpres 13/2010 amends Perpres 67/2005 by clearly extending its application to
projects proposed by sub-national governments and for SOEs. Perpres 13 has paved the way for
Government support to a number of new PPP transactions, for example the Central Java IPP, proposed
by PLN the electricity SOE. Lenders are demanding a guarantee of PLN payment risk, which can now
be provided under Perpres 13.

24.     The required legal instrument from IDPL 4 is Perpres 13/2010.

Prior Action 7: Infrastructure Guarantee Fund (IGF) established including staffing of senior
management and draft operating procedures.
Evidence of Achievement: Evidence of establishment, hiring of senior management and copy of draft
IGF operating procedures.
25.      The CEO of the IGF is now in place and is actively managing and marketing the Fund. More
staff has been hired over the course of 2010. The MOF officially announced the operationalization of
the IGF on May 11, 2010.

26.     The required legal instrument for IDPL4 is (i) Government Regulation 35/2009 establishing
IGF and Ministerial Decree No. 523/KMK.06/2009 appointing directors and (ii) a copy of draft IGF
operating procedures.

Prior Action 8: PT Indonesia Infrastructure Finance (PT IIF) has been staffed and business license
awarded.
Evidence of Agreement: Copy of awarded application of PT IIF business license and evidence of
hiring of senior management.
27.     The shareholders agreements for PT IIF were signed in January 2010, with all capital
commitments from shareholders. The CEO for PT IIF has been appointed and is now in position. PT
IIF was officially launched on 9 August 2010.


                                                 64
28.    The required legal instrument for IDPL4 is (i) Business license (MOF Decision No. KEP-
439/KM.10/2010); and (ii) IIF letter to Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs, dated September
17,2010, evidencing of hiring of senior management.

POLICY AREA IV: ENVIRONMENT,                      PROCUREMENT            AND     PUBLIC      SECTOR
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Prior Action 9: Draft Government Regulations on waste handling and waste minimizing circulated for
intra-ministerial consultation.
Evidence of Achievement: MoE letter to Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs dated September
30, 2010 indicates that internal consultations completed, draft Government Regulation on Waste
Minimizing and draft Government Regulation on Waste Handling.
29.      With issuance of Law No 18 2008 on municipal solid waste management, the Ministry of the
Environment (MOE) is obligated to prepare governmental regulations to implement the law.
Subsequently, MOE consolidated the 11 regulatory actions mandated by the law into three proposed
Government regulations, covering waste handling, waste minimizing and the management of special
waste categories. In June 2010 discussion, the MOE indicated that it would achieve the trigger of
`Adoption of Government regulations on waste handling, waste minimizing, and the management of
special waste categories', with the evidence of achievement as the submission of draft regulations to
the State Secretariat.

30.      Progress has been delayed by prolonged internal consultations between the MOE and other
involved ministries. Two draft regulations were submitted to the Ministry of Law and Human Rights
for inter-ministerial consultation, but the regulation governing the handling of special waste will be
ready in 2011. The consultative process result in a stronger and more widely accepted regulatory
framework that can be implemented more readily, but has caused a less than expected achievement in
the definition of the legal framework governing solid waste.

31.     The required legal instruments for IDPL4 are the draft Government regulations on waste
handling and waste minimizing as submitted for intra-departmental consultation.

Prior Action 10: Used `semi e-procurement' system for at least 75% of all MPW national level
procurements above IDR 50 million and issued a Circular Letter requiring the use of `semi e-
procurement' system for in at least twenty three Provinces.
Evidence of Achievement: MPW Circular Letter No. 12/SE/M/2009 and 03/SE/M/2010.
32.      The MPW has steadily increased its use of electronic procurement in daily operations at the
national level. The e-procurement system has also run into the obstacle of Presidential Decree 80 that
requires the manual submission of hard copies for all procurement bids. This regulation prohibits the
complete shift towards `full electronic procurement'. As a result the trigger was reworded for clarity,
to reflect the fact that the MPW has adapted by introducing `semi electronic-procurement plus', which
allows for the electronic submission of documents but still requires the bidder to submit hard copies of
document. This was mandated in Ministerial Decree 3/2010.

33.     As of 2 August 2010, 74.7% of all submitted contracts to the MPW for national level
procurement have been done via `semi e-procurement' or `semi e-procurement plus', and `semi e-
procurement plus' was implemented in 10 provinces. These include all six provinces in Java (Banten,
DKI-Jakarta, West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta, East Java) and four provinces outside of Java
(Riau, South Kalimantan, Gorontalo and Bali).

34.     The required legal instruments for IDPL4 are the Ministerial Circular Letters.


                                                  65
Prior Action 11: Launch of Risk-Based Internal Audit (RBIA) programs in nine provinces with staff
training programs in place.
Evidence of Achievement: Internal MPW audit report and working papers for nine provinces and a list
of training programs and names of participants.
35.       The Inspectorate-General (IG) of the MPW past year's activities focusing on two subject areas
in the area of internal audit and the Prior Action focused on critical areas of reform where there was a
strong momentum in the inspectorate: (i) introduce modern risk-based auditing; and (ii) enhanced
training programs; RBIA is considered to be single most critical reform in the office of the IG and in
2009 and 2010, the IG launched RBIA programs in 12 provinces and implemented staff training
programs for MPW officials on RBIA standards. Enhancement of auditors' skills is also considered
critical if the office of IG is to be reformed and audit trainings were completed in 12 provinces instead
of nine.

36.     The audit reports and working papers for nine provinces were completed using the RBIA
approach. A systematic risk analysis has been done in collaboration with the respective DGs and the
focus in these nine provinces has moved from an ad hoc approach to audit coverage to audit of areas
considered to be high risk. The audit reports and working papers describe how this determination of
risk was done. IG, MPW has also made significant progress in training its staff through the Institute of
Internal Auditors (IIA) workshop in Jogja, in Brisbane, Australia to participate in a peer learning
exercise with Queensland Public Works Department and in Manila. The IG plans held an all staff
training in August 2010 to discuss the lessons that can be drawn through various trainings and the
work that has been done on risk based internal audit and how it feeds into the work program of the IG.

37.       The required legal instruments for IDPL4 are audit reports for nine (9) provinces, as well as a
list of training programs and names of participants.

                                ANNEX 6: POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

CURRENT STATUS OF INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES FOR THE POOR

1.      The positive impact on poor people of policy reforms supported by the IDPL series can be
broadly categorized along two dimensions. First, by relieving infrastructure bottlenecks to growth,
reforms will increase average per capita incomes, including the incomes of poor people. Second, by
increasing access to infrastructure, policy reforms supported under the IDPL are likely to have a direct
impact on the wellbeing and incomes of poor people. Caveats to this broadly positive picture concern the
timing of likely impact, negative externalities of infrastructure rollout likely to have a particular impact on
the poor and possible reforms of infrastructure pricing.

2.      Due to data limitations it is impossible to forecast all conceivable impacts of infrastructure
reforms on the poor, specifically the impact of potential tariff changes (other than the PLN tariff increases
referred to later in this annex) on consumption behavior and expenditure. Thus this annex will be more
useful as a benchmark for future monitoring and will present overall poverty data on electricity, water and
roads currently and changes over time. This will give a baseline of how connectivity has changed over
time. That is to say the change experienced "organically" in the absence of IDPL reforms (which to date
have not had any poverty or social implications), against which the impact of the current and next series
of DPL reforms can be measured by looking at the rate of change between 2010 and 2015. Furthermore
the way the various national surveys are structured means that there are certain data limitations, which are
explained in a technical note below. i

3.       While the country's underlying economic indicators are strong, and the poverty headcount has
fallen to the pre-crisis level, poverty reduction remains a critical challenge in Indonesia. Today, 13.33 %
of the total population (and 16.56% of the rural population) lives under the poverty line (set nationally at
IDR 211,726, and IDR 192,354 in rural areas, per capita expenditure per month)ii. In addition, there are
large regional disparities in the poverty level, with some districts exhibiting poverty rates of over 50%.
Matching such disparities in income are disparities in quality, price, and access to infrastructure. While
the proportion of non-poor households with access to all-year passable asphalt roads is 78%, only 70% of
poor households have access to such roads. The problem is particularly acute for the rural poor, where
only 60% of poor households have access to all-year passable asphalt roads. In fact, only 60% of all
villages nationally have access to asphalt roadsiii (Table One). Furthermore, lack of road maintenance,
particularly in rural areas, is a considerable issue in this sector. While the national road network is in good
condition, with 95% paved and 88% in good to fair condition, much of the district and village road
network (that most used by rural poor) is in poor to bad condition. This has a significant effect on the
livelihoods of poor people and access to services such as education and health care.

4.     Access to water infrastructure services in Indonesia is currently very low and very regressive.
The poor consume almost 70% less water than the non-poor, and rural households consume 42% less than

i
    For electricity, the National Socioeconomic Surveys (Susenas) of 2004 and 2009 provide data across poor/non-poor and
urban/rural categories on the level and changes in the level of connection over the past 5 years; types of connection; expenditure
on electricity as a percentage of total average monthly expenditure; and variations in access across provinces. For Water
(PDAMs), Susenas provides data on households who have access to metered (thus we assume it is provided by PDAM) piped
drinking water, but this does not include piped water for other uses. The IFLS (using the 2000 and 2007 series) sample is only
83% representative (not nationally representative like Susenas) and data is only collected every 7 years (not annually like
Susenas) so it will not be able to capture short term changes. We created an index to reflect households who have access to piped
water for drinking and for other uses. For roads, PODES (village level survey) is available for 2003, 2005, and 2008 and provides
data on villages' and poor/non-poor households' access to passable asphalt roads, and PLN electricity.

urban households, although all households spend on average about 2% of their month expenditure on
water (Susenas 2009). IFLS data gives us a better proxy for access to piped water in general, although
again this would include piped water from PDAM and other sources, so this figure might slightly inflate
access to PDAM water specifically. According to the most recent IFLS (2007), 23% of households had
access to piped water, 12% of the poorest quintile compared to 35% of the richest quintile.

5.     Susenas and IFLS tell a very different story regarding change in access to piped water over time:
while IFLS shows a 3% increase from 2000 to 2007, Susenas shows a 7% decrease from 2004 to 2009,
with the biggest change among urban and non poor households. Given that Susenas measures access to
drinking water source this could mean that the wealthier and urban households are shifting from drinking
piped water to drinking bottled water, refill water and retail piped water, which as a group have increased
by 24 percentage points from 2004 to 2009.

6.      Twenty-three percent of households pay for water including both piped water and from other
sources (bottled water, wells/pumps, vendors, etc), 24% of the non poor and 11% of the poor (Susenas
2009). The cost of household connections varies considerably depending on location and distance from
water source, from IDR 300,000 to IDR 1,000,000 (Jakarta). Water companies are subsidized. While the
average level of Operations and Maintenance (O&M) cost recovery is 90% there is considerable regional
variation. The national average for full O&M cost recovery is IDR 3,244/m3 while the average tariff is

                                                    72
IDR 2,951/m3. For Area 1 (Java Island) full cost is IDR 3,352/m3 while average the tariff is 3,302/m3,
for Area 2 (Sumatra Island) full cost is IDR 2,978/m3 while average tariff is IDR 2,271/m3, for Area 3
(Kalimantan & Sulawesi) full cost is IDR 3,505/m3 while average tariff is IDR 2,807/m3, and for Area 4
(Papua, Maluku, NTB, NTT and Bali) the full cost is IDR 2,519/m3 while average tariff is IDR 2,069/m3.
Both O&M cost recovery and tariffs have increased over time, tariffs increased by 76% from 2006 to
2009, while subsidies decreased by 77% over the same period.iv

7.       Official household access to electricity was approximately 55% in 2005, although informal
connections are common, raising access rates.v According to the IEA the electrification rate in 2009 is
65%. According to Susenas 2009, 89% of the population has access to PLN electricity, 90% of the non-
poor and 81% of the poor.vi The increase in connections has been minimal, and practically the same for
poor/non-poor and urban/rural households. While access to electricity has increased from 85% to 89% in
the past 5 years, it has increased at approximately the same pace: only 1% more for the poor than the non
poor. The greatest gains for the poor and rural households have been in quantity used: the average
quantity used has increased the most amongst the non-poor (66%), and the rural households (55%).
Average monthly expenditure on PLN electricity for poor households is IDR 25,443 compared to IDR
57,838 for non poor households, representing 3% of total monthly expenditure for both ­ which has not
changed since 2004. This would imply that the poor are increasingly benefiting from more electricity.

THE POVERTY IMPACT OF REFORMS SUPPORTED UNDER THE IDPL SERIES

8.      All of the reforms embodied in the IDPL are intended to support economic growth and aggregate
welfare through improvements in the quality, efficiency and reach of infrastructure provision. In
particular, a key objective of the IDPL series is to restore national infrastructure expenditure, tariffs and
subsidies to a more appropriate level. Previous analytical work by the World Bank has suggested that
inadequate investment in infrastructure is already acting as a bottleneck to growth, so that increased
investment could be expected to give a substantial boost to GDP (Box A6.1).

9.       The poverty elasticity in the decade before the crisis (1987-96) was -0.7, with variation of -0.5 to
-1.0 using three year periods, see table below. The elasticity in the decade after recovery from the crisis
(2000-10) has been -0.9, but with variation of -0.1 to -1.8 using three year periods (2006 saw a large
increase in poverty due to food and fuel price shocks, which lowered the elasticity in 2005-08). Thus, 2.4
percent additional per capita GDP growth (above baseline) due to infrastructure-driven investment would
reduce the poverty head count rate by an additional 2.2 percent at an elasticity of -0.9, or in other words,
if sustained for five years, an additional 1.5 percentage point fall, given 2010's poverty rate of 13.3
percent. However, if infrastructure-driven growth is assumed to be less equitable, a lower rate of
reduction would be expected.

10.      Recent growth has been as effective at reducing poverty as that before the 1997-98 crisis,
although many households remain near the poverty line. Between 1980 and 1999, the bottom quintile of
the income distribution saw consumption rise at rates faster than average. In the years immediately after
the crisis, the bottom quintile has seen considerably slower than average income growth, while in the
second half of the 2000s growth rates were near the average.vii The poverty rates have improved despite
the sharp increase in the cost of living of poorer households especially after 2004 with the large increases
in global and local food prices, and stagnant agricultural output in the first part of the decade. Despite
these improvements in the official poverty rates, many households remain near poor. Almost half of the
population consumes less than 1.5 times the national poverty line.

11.      The poverty elasticity of growth is significantly lower in rural regions of Indonesia than in
urbanized regions (-0.5 in Papua compared to -2.5 in Java/Bali, for example). Declining expenditure on
maintenance of and investment in infrastructure may have played some role in slowing agricultural
growth and reducing the ability of rural people to benefit from continued growth in services ­ increasing
transport costs faced by farmers and consumers as well as reducing access to markets. Prior to the 1997
crisis, over 7% of GDP was spent on infrastructure investment, and has declined to below 3% in 2000,
and since then has only recovered to just under 4% of GDP in 2008. The Bank's most recent Rural
Investment Climate Assessment found evidence of drastic underinvestment in road maintenance and
rapidly declining road quality in the period since 1999. National figures suggest that between 2000 and

                                                                74
2006, the percentage of national and provincial roads in good or fair condition has fallen 16% and 26%,
respectively. A return to higher investment and maintenance expenditure in infrastructure may be one
factor in restoring the pro-poor impact of growth. At the same time growth in more remote rural areas,
where a higher share of the population is poor, may be less pro-poor as it employs fewer people and draw
on more outside resources, such as the mining industry in Papua, relative to more densely populated and
urban areas, such as on Java.

12.      International experience also indicates strong direct linkages between infrastructure service
provision and poverty reduction. Reliable, affordable and cost-effective provision of infrastructure
services can help in improving health and education outcomes (reducing levels of child mortality from
water borne diseases, respiratory illnesses, better access to schools and clinics) and indirectly in reducing
the fiscal burden of governments to create space for other expenditures. Improved access to reliable
infrastructure services can also increase the general welfare of poor households through reductions in the
opportunity costs associated with finding imperfect alternatives to meet essential needs.

13.     Indonesian experience matches this international pattern. Making the New Indonesia Work for
the Poor suggests that better access to roads and telecommunications "are associated with significantly
lower poverty." Access to an all-year passable road is associated with a 7.7% increase in consumption in
urban areas and a 3.1% increase in rural areas. This is even higher for certain areas such as Papua where
it reaches over 20%. Overall the number of villages with access to asphalt roads has increased by 21%
from 2003 to 2008, and villages with access to PLN has increased by 10%.

14.      Better quality improves the pro-poor impact of infrastructure. Improved quality roads, measured
by a proxy of higher average speed traveled between village and provincial capital, raises per capita
expenditure, with an elasticity of 0.06. Infrastructure can have a particularly dramatic effect on non-farm
earnings in rural areas. The Bank's Rural Investment Climate Assessment concluded that the percentage
of rural household income derived from non-farm enterprises was more than twice as high in villages
where there were no blackouts as in villages suffering blackouts more than weekly. And non-farm income
was more than twice as high in villages with a concrete or asphalt road as in those connected only by a
dirt road (See Figure 1 on constraints to rural enterprise identified by surveyed entrepreneurs).

15.     According to the 2008 WSP Report: Economic Impacts of Sanitation in Indonesia, water piped
from other sources costs an average of IDR 21,200, water purchased from vendors costs IDR 47,700/m3,
packaged or bottled water costs IDR 326,600/m3. In comparison the average cost for PDAM water at IDR
2,951/ m3 is significantly more affordable, and would continue to be even if PDAMs were charging the
recovery rate, which is on average IDR 3,244/ m3. The costs of inadequate water and sanitation are
substantial and the health and environmental costs in cities are especially high. Overwhelmingly, both
poor and non-poor households do not have access to networked (piped) water and sanitation. They pay
considerably more than networked consumers per liter of water. And they do not benefit at all from a
system that starves PDAMs of investment resources in order to subsidize consumption. An analysis of
access to piped drinking water (Susenas 2009) across the country by poor/non-poor and by urban/rural
shows that there is considerably higher variation by location than by poverty level. Access for the poor
and non poor are shadow each other fairly consistently across the country. While access in urban areas is
on average 18%, it is significantly lower for most rural areas, on average 5%. This would suggest the
need for geographical targeting for expanding connectivity.

16.     While access to electricity has increased at approximately the same pace for the poor and non
poor, there has been a dramatic increase in electricity usage among the poor (see Table A6.5), however
the poor are still concentrated in the lowest capacity categories (450 and 900 VA) and the "no meter"
category: while half of the poor users are in the 450 VA category, one third are in the "no meter" category


                                                     75
­ probably through informal connections with neighboring households. According to the Rural
Investment Climate Assessment, 87% of those currently without access to electricity mentioned the high
cost of connection as a barrier to access compared to 4% who mentioned high monthly bills. This would
explain the increase in the percentage of "non-metered" users and particularly amongst the poorest: from
21% to 30% over the past 5 years.

17.      According to a World Bank analysis of access to electricity across the country and by urban/rural,
there is considerably higher variation by location than by poverty level. While access for the poor and non
poor are fairly consistent across the country, access is particularly low in NTT and other eastern
Indonesian provinces. While access in urban areas is on average 97% (Susenas 2009), it is significantly
lower for most rural areas.

spent on electricity subsidies, about 56 percent of which flowed to households and the remainder to
commercial, social, industry, public buildings, and other users. Among households, the rich benefit most:
they are more likely to be connected to the grid; they tend to use more electricity, and, for all but the
highest-spending category, enjoy higher subsidies per unit of electricity used.

19.     The proposed electricity tariff increases will not affect the poorest users who are concentrated
primarily in the lower capacity range. As indicated in table 3.3 of the main document, the two lowest
capacity categories (450 VA and 900 VA) represent the largest share of electricity use by residential
consumers (13.4% and 13.1% respectively in 2009) and capture the highest share of the PSO subsidy
(24.2% and 17.4%). This is estimated to increase to 30.2% and 22.7% respectively with the prospective
PSO subsidy changes, and PLN estimates of costs and consumption levels in 2010 - which is shifting
the subsidy emphasis from industry and business over to low income households. This would suggest a
progressive tariff and subsidy scheme.

20.      Reforms supported by the IDPL will play a role in extending access, through increasing
infrastructure investment at the national and local level. Several IDPL reforms are focused on supporting
the Government's strategy to increase household access to quality services, including rural electrification
and access to piped water. Network expansion particularly in the water sector will reduce the regressive
quality of existing infrastructure access, although international experience suggests that the poorest and
remotest sections of the community are usually the last to be connected. Policies addressing sub-national
governments' incentives to invest in infrastructure may also, in time, improve the provision of rural roads
and piped water. And support for more rational pricing should help target (needed) subsidies at those
households that are most in need ­first, those unconnected to networked services and, second, the
connected poor.

POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE REFORM AND INVESTMENT

21.      Caveats are necessary to this broadly positive picture. First, the welfare effects of many of the
IDPL policy reforms are likely to take a decade or more to be realized. While it is to be hoped that
improved maintenance supported by better planning and operations may help preserve the quality of
infrastructure over the short term, many of the policies supported by the series are intended to improve
governance over the next few years, which will induce new investment plans, which in turn will induce
infrastructure construction. The process of road construction may yield some benefits in terms of
employment alongside some social dislocation. But only when construction of new infrastructure is
completed do the full benefits begin to be realized.

22.     A second caveat regards potential negative impacts of infrastructure expansion. Notwithstanding
the many social benefits of improved infrastructure, there may be some social costs associated with
expanded infrastructure investment. The negative externalities of expanded infrastructure reach and use
often fall disproportionately on the poor. Poor people suffer from the impacts of related pollution
(including particulate and NOx exposure from transport and energy) as well as from traffic accidents.

                                              Box A6.2: Traffic Accidents
Indonesia is experiencing a growing road safety problem with 30,000 fatalities occurring annually, and an estimated
annual level of injury above 1,000,000. With rapidly growing motorization, mainly through motorcycling, this
situation is highly likely to deteriorate further in the immediate future and with further road construction. Fatality
rates per 10,000 vehicles in 2004 were 8 times higher in Indonesia than in Australia, and more than twice the level in
Malaysia. 90% of all road casualties in Indonesia are in the economically productive 15 to 50 year old age group.
Total annual costs of road crashes in Indonesia (in 2002) are estimated at IDR 35 trillion, corresponding to 1.9% of
GDP and 9.9% of the value of total national expenditure on investment in physical assets.

23.      Land acquisition associated with road construction may have adverse social consequences.
Regarding land acquisition in particular, Indonesia's current standards of compensation do not meet
World Bank standards, particularly with respect to the loss of livelihood. This situation could change with
the passage of an expected new land acquisition bill in the Indonesian Parliament. The Government
continues to review the draft for legal consistency between the proposed law and existing regulations; and
for clarity, transparency of the processes and protecting the interests of affected people. Nevertheless,
for the time being even land acquisition under World Bank projects has had a mixed impact. Indonesia's
land acquisition systems do not provide compensation for relocation to those without formal title. The
IDPL reforms which envisage improved compensation standards may help to mitigate the adverse social
consequences.

                                   Box A6.3: Land Acquisition and Relocation
A review of the land acquisition and resettlement operations associated with the World Bank's Indonesian lending
operations found that during FY00 ­ FY04, the portfolio had 15 projects involving land acquisition and resettlement,
which affected approximately 20,000 households. Urban and transport sector projects accounted for nearly 85% of
the affected households. Almost all projects that involved resettlement were sectoral investment projects, which
typically consisted of large number of subprojects with relatively small, localized resettlement impacts. A larger
proportion of affected households were urban households engaged in small business, artisan trade and unskilled
labor. Common resettlement measures consisted primarily of cash compensation for acquired land and replacement
housing in case of displacement. Follow-up review found that nearly two thirds of the households moved to
relocation areas moved out of these sites eventually for want of livelihood opportunities.

24.      A third, but only partial, caveat regards pricing reform. Given the cost of installing a piped water
connection, piped water may not be an economically feasible option for the poorest rural households even
if investment levels increase and prices are rebalanced from connection charges towards usage charges.
The average household expenditure per month is IDR 1,930,000 (Susenas 2009). The latest estimates of
the cost of connection for piped water can range from over IDR 300,000 to IDR 1,000,000, representing
up to almost half of average monthly household consumption. For the poorest households, whose average
monthly consumption is IDR 870,000, these fees are prohibitively high.

25.      The timing of changes, if any, to electricity subsidies and pricing has not been specified in the
IDPL reforms, but measures calling for their review have been included. This is with the aim of reducing
their regressive impact. Upward electricity tariff revisions would adversely affect those who already have
connections, but would help to expand the connection rate in the event that tariff increases were to lower
the budgetary impact of PSO subsidies that would accrue as a result of the additional connections,
particularly in the eastern provinces where poverty rates tend to be higher. Over the coming 4 to 5 years,
the Government is committed to expanding access to new users, in particular households, and to
streamlining the tariff structure with a view towards gradually increasing tariffs for each category of user.

                                ANNEX 7: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

OVERVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN INDONESIA

1.     In 2009, the World Bank published a Country Environmental Analysis for Indonesia. The
document provides an overview understanding of environmental issues, with an emphasis on climate
change as a key cross cutting issue. The CEA also discusses costs of environmental degradation,
governance and constituency building as key challenges. i

2.       Environmental management remains a challenge for Indonesia. Over the past decade, many
aspects of environmental management and natural resource management have been decentralized to
the local level. Natural resource management and environmental quality are now more dependent on
local leadership, institutional capacity and willingness to conform to national standards and
regulations. The current picture across Indonesia is mixed, with some regions demonstrating
commitment to sustainability, while others are opting for exploitation with short-term gains. Greater
local control has had positive aspects through reputational programs, greater political will, interagency
collaboration, community empowerment, and integration of environment in spatial planning. At the
same time, decentralization has revealed obstacles to good environmental management, including:
inadequate standards and enforcement; distorted incentives; lack of community empowerment; and
insufficient local government implementation and enforcement capacity. Also, awareness about the
expected negative environmental impacts of unmanaged and exploitative development and the
mechanisms for stakeholders to hold government agencies accountable for their performance are
weak. Environmental considerations have only been integrated weakly into planning and programming
processes, especially in the area of public investment and in regional plans for land and resource use.

3.       Inadequate environmental management and growth without attention to environmental
outcomes and costs ­ poses a challenge for Indonesia that hurts the poor and the economy. The
economic consequences of climate change represent the highest potential cost to Indonesia's economy
in the long term, amounting to annual losses of between 2.5 and 7.0 percent of GDP by the end of the
century. Significant economic losses are also caused by other types of environmental degradation,
especially deforestation, soil depletion, and coastal/marine degradation. Inadequate water and
sanitation constitute the largest short-term cost to the Indonesian economy, estimated at more than $6
billion in 2005 or more than 2 percent of GDP. The health impacts of outdoor and indoor air pollution
have been estimated at $4.6 billion per year or about 1.6 percent of GNI. In total, environmental
degradation costs are likely to grow in the future and are currently on par with the average annual
growth rate. These costs are disproportionately borne by the poor who are more vulnerable, more
exposed and less able to cope with the impacts of pollution and resource degradation. Climate change
has the potential to exacerbate these impacts and costs.

4.       Indonesia's spending for environmental purposes was low for the decade prior to 2006, but
has begun to increase substantially in recent years. Environmental revenue collection has been low
and natural resources have been under-valued. Fuel and electricity subsidies enhance over-
consumption, burden the budget and benefit higher income groups, while making it difficult for
renewables to compete. Legal and financial incentive structures are not very effective in curbing
illegal logging, but recent changes in the deforestation rate show some progress. Policy distortions in
fishing and mining have contributed to unsustainable harvesting patterns and illegal mining activities.
Conflicting sector-based regulations and national laws, including those involving decentralization,

contribute to the weak implementation. Environmental fiscal reform is one approach to address these
distortions through the use of taxation and pricing instruments to raise revenues, but also to provide
incentives for more sustainable behavior. The Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Finance are
now developing the capacity and tools for wider application of environmental fiscal reform with
assistance from the German and Danish governments.

5.       There is an impressive set of laws, policies, programs, and national as well as local institutions
that are responsible for environmental and natural resource management. In recent years, the GOI has
upgraded the legal framework for environmental management in two key areas: solid waste
management and environmental management and protection. These new laws have also been
accompanied by regulations, capacity improvements, and assessments. The GOI also has important
initiatives to restrain utilities' pollution, reduce smoke and haze from forest and land fires, rehabilitate
forests and degraded lands, improve environmental management through the spatial planning process,
and develop environmental data and information.

6.       In 2009, the GOI passed Law No. 32/2009 on Environmental Protection and Management.
Under this law, the AMDAL (Analisis Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan) process ­ the assessment of
proposed activities with significant anticipated impact on the environment - has become a recognized
instrument to measure environmental pollution and degradation. Under the Environment Law, both
AMDALs and UKL/UPLii are required for the awarding of the environmental permits ­ now as
prerequisites for development activity permits (e.g., mining, building, and industrial permits). The
SPPLiii in lieu of AMDALs are necessary for activities where there is low anticipated impact. The law
placed AMDAL in a stronger position as one of the instruments for minimizing pollution and
environmental degradation. The law requires completion of the impact assessment and preparation of
an environmental management and monitoring plan (UKL/UPL) as part of the business licensing and
environmental permit process. In addition, the law also includes provisions for licensing of AMDAL
commissions, certification requirements for AMDAL compilers and sanctions for non-compliance
with the AMDAL process. Indonesia has decentralized responsibility for environmental impact
assessment. All 33 provincial governments and 55 percent of kabupaten/kota governments have
AMDAL commissions.

7.       In 2008, the GOI passed Law No. 18 2008 on Municipal Solid Waste Managementiv to
heighten attention on this issue and to improve the requirements and incentives for local governments
to improve performance. The law aims to reduce the generation of solid waste by encouraging
communities to "reduce, reuse, recycle", and to improve the handling of solid waste through improved
separation of types of waste and processing prior to final treatment. The law also requires
municipalities to upgrade solid waste handling facilities, including landfills. The MPW also plays a
role in improving solid waste management and has issued the Strategic Plan for development of solid
waste management (road map for waste sector) to support sub-national governments to improve the
infrastructure facilities to manage municipal solid waste.

8.      From a climate change perspective, land use change and forestry are the largest source of
Indonesia's globally significant emissions. However, fossil fuel GHG emissions are rising rapidly
(though per capita emissions are low). After land use change and forestry, manufacturing industry is
the largest source of carbon emissions, the transport sector is the largest user of liquid fuels and
petroleum is currently the main contributor to CO2 emissions. Even assuming a decrease in energy

    Only half of Indonesia's solid waste is actually collected, up to a fifth properly disposed, and less than two percent is
treated (recycled or composted). About 85% of small cities and more than 50% of medium cities dispose of their waste in
open dumps.
                                                              83
intensity, emissions from energy consumption could triple by 2030 from 2005 levels on a business as
usual path (as estimated by IEA 2007).

9.      In the future, fossil fuel emissions will continue to grow and may exceed forest and land use
emissions, if those are brought under control. Thus, the energy sector is an important for moving
toward a lower carbon development path. Under the Government's power generation program, a first
phase of 10,000 MW of capacity has been commissioned in recent years, mainly from coal-fired
plants. A second 10,000 MW program will rely more on geothermal and renewable energy sources.
Indonesia has the world's largest geothermal energy reserves and has other renewables (hydropower,
wind, solar, and biomass). Mitigating these emissions will require more realistic energy pricing, a
better enabling environment to develop renewable energy resources, and greater efficiency in the
industrial, power, manufacturing and transport sectors.

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF IDPL4 OPERATION

10.     OP 8.60 (Development Policy Lending) mandates the Bank to determine whether policies
supported by the operation are likely to cause significant effects on the country's environment, forests
and other natural resources or to have significant negative poverty and social impacts, especially on
poor and vulnerable groups. The environmental review for IDPL 4 is contained in the following matrix
and discussed briefly here. The IDPL 4's operation is based on a focused set of prior actions achieved
in 2009.

11.     The tools consulted to perform a quick analysis of "likelihood of significant effects" were (i)
Assessing the Environmental, Forest, and Other Natural Resource Aspects of Development Policy
Lending ­ A World Bank Toolkit (2008), (ii) Policy and Institutional Reforms to Support Climate
Change Adaptation and Mitigation in Development Programs ­ A Practical Guide and the (iii) Good
Practice Note on Environmental and Natural Resource Aspects of Development Policy Lending.
Further analytical support to analyze GOI's capacity to mitigate identified potential negative effects
have been derived from the Indonesia Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) (WB 2009).

12.     Based on this review, environmental effects will generally be positive or neutral and
contribute to achieving generally desired aims of many development and research agencies. This
environmental review of operation addresses the current IDPL4 program.

POLICY AREA 1: NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE

13.      Sustained budget allocations to infrastructure ministries are likely to have little impact on the
environment, per se. Unsustainable budgets can reduce the efforts to monitor and control
environmental performance. The adjustment of energy tariffs and energy conservation can have
significant effects. The legislature (DPR) is considering a 10 percent average tariff increase for PLN
effective July 1, 2010, which is a step toward an improved pricing regime. Indonesia has long
recognized that price increases can lead to hardship among the poorest households, if unmitigated.
Fortunately, the GOI has previous experience (in 2005 and 2008) of using a cash transfer system to
poor households to mitigate the transitional impact of higher prices. This system has worked well in
the past with fuel subsidy cuts. In addition, the price increase will be implemented by the issuance of a
Presidential Decree that will have the effect of reducing and better targeting PSO subsidies to lower
income households, thus mitigating the potential adverse effects to poor households. The
Government's approach to tariff adjustments will likely also encourage energy conservation.
Environmental effects assessed to be positive.
14.     The Government is considering a mechanism that would collapse categories and lower, over
time, the number of high income consumers that would benefit from subsidies. This approach should
encourage high income consumers to undertake energy conservation measures, reducing demand and
                                                   84
associated pollution and GHG emissions. The tariff increase will also improve PLN's financial
condition and all other things remaining equal, raise its borrowing capacity for meeting its capital
investment requirements under the second phase of the 10,000 MW crash program, of which 30-40
percent will be derived from renewable energy sources, leading to lessened reliance on fossil fuels and
reducing associated GHG emissions and other pollutants. Environmental effects assessed to be
positive.

15.     There is a likelihood of potential negative effects where new road construction leads to
deforestation and access to previously inaccessible tracts of land. Better road conditions can lead to
increased traffic, increased greenhouse gas as well as other toxic tailpipe emissions. The AMDAL
instrument should provide protection against the conversion of high conservation value forest for road
development. Improving road conditions can also decrease emissions where poor conditions are
obstructing traffic flow and leading to repeated decelerations and accelerations. Environmental effects
assessed to be neutral.

POLICY AREA 2: SUB NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE

16.     Increasing the share of Indonesians with access to piped drinking water from 18% to 32%
through focused programs of output-based fiscal incentives (Water Hibah) for local governments will
have significant environmental health benefits through provision of safe drinking water and decreased
prevalence of water borne diseases. Environmental effects are assessed to be positive.

POLICY AREA 3: PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS

17.      Promoting Public Private Partnerships can lead to positive environmental impacts through
promoting increased efficiency in energy consumption and logistics. No negative environmental
impacts foreseen, as long as an adequate framework is implemented to ensure that environmental
regulations are respected and that there is capacity to enforce the regulations, for example avoiding
accidental or deliberate dumping of wastes in port operations. Environmental effects are assessed to be
neutral.

POLICY AREA 4:             LAND      ACQUISITION,         ENVIRONMENT            AND     FIDUCIARY
RESPONSIBILITIES

18.     Indonesia's largely uncontrolled disposal of solid waste has become a growing threat to the
quality of air, water and land. Thus the GOI's new municipal solid waste management law (18/2008)
is an important effort to improve the situation. The environmental effects of improved waste collection
and reduced open dumping of waste are assessed to be strongly positive. As the law places
responsibility of solid waste management implementation to the districts and municipalities, their
capacity plays an important role in the overall success of the law. Potential threats to good waste
management at local level can include bad site selection of interim and final disposal sites, possible
corruption issues in waste pickup and handling and uncontrolled dumping into landfills. The AMDAL
instrument should provide an increased level of certainty against poor site selection and lead to better
managed landfills. Cities and municipalities will, however, likely continue to experience problems in
waste management due to insufficient funds for waste collection as well as for infrastructure facilities
including drainage system, roads and leachate treatment pond. Environmental effects are assessed to
be positive.

                        ANNEX 8: PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

BACKGROUND AND ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

1.      The IDPL-4 operation sets out to provide general budget support to the Indonesian
Government for various infrastructure initiatives and will be executed through the Government's
public financial management (PFM) systems. In order to assess the attendant fiduciary risks with
respect to the proceeds of this operation, Annex 8 summarizes the current state of these systems as
well as ongoing reform efforts to further enhance them.

2.      Performance of Indonesia's public financial management systems was last comprehensively
measured in 2007, when a PEFA assessment was conducted for the first time in the country. Results of
this assessment, as updated in 2008, then reflected a mixed picture with strengths and weaknesses.
Key strengths pertained to transparent and comprehensive budget documentation, a well defined
budget process with both executive and legislative adhering to the schedule, a budget classification
which complied with international standards and a strengthened external audit function. Weaknesses,
on the other hand, were identified across some dimensions of budget execution such as financial
reporting and internal controls.

3.       However, the assessment acknowledged the concerted reform efforts among key stakeholders
of the budget process ever since the political transition in 1998 and especially the PFM White Paper in
2001. It highlighted the sound regulatory framework that had been put in place for almost all PFM
areas, the major reorganization that had taken place at the Ministry of Finance, the advances that had
been made in budget preparation such as instituting a unified budget, and, even in the area of budget
execution, the good progress that had been achieved in the development of a Treasury Single Account
to strengthen cash management. All these efforts were said to have contributed to relatively strong
PFM systems in some areas and left one optimistic about others.

4.      The Government's commitment to reform continued to be strong also in the past three years,
and the reform agenda has been evolving continuously around all pillars of the budget system - most
recently under a newly elected Government and an even more recently appointed new Finance
Minister. Its main objectives have thereby remained the same. They are commonly described as: (i)
improving results-orientation in state budget planning and development, (ii) improving budget and
treasury management, (iii) strengthening monitoring and evaluation of public expenditures and
programs, (iv) improving the public procurement systems, (v) improving Government accounting and
audit functions, and, last but not least, (vi) civil service to improve the quality and performance of the
workforce. We are including also reforming (vii) debt management and (xi) governance and anti-
corruption. To what extent more recent efforts have impacted on actual PFM systems quality will be
evaluated soon in a PEFA repeat assessment, currently envisaged for late 2010. But the below
descriptions of ongoing reform activities might be indicative for the direction developments have
taken, and Indonesia's successful mastering of the recent economic crisis surely tells us that it must
have been the right one.

5.       The commentaries below draw on recent economic and sector work undertaken by the World
Bank and other development partners. Besides the aforementioned PEFA assessment, we have taken
into consideration the findings of a joint Bank-Fund mission on Strengthening Budget Management
undertaken in June 2008, the results of a previous joint Bank-Fund mission on Budget Reform
Priorities reported to Government in June 2007 and the September 2008 update of the ROSC on Fiscal
Transparency in Indonesia from 2006 (IMF Country Report No. 08/298, Selected Issues; Indonesia).
Most importantly, however, insights on latest reform progress were derived from the ongoing policy
dialogue and advisory services that have been provided through GFMRAP and the associated PFM
Multi-Donor Trust Fund. In addition, GMFRAP supervision missions took stock of reform progress in
2009 and 2010.

REFORM PRIORITIES: ACHIEVEMENTS, CHALLENGES AND THE WAY AHEAD

6.       Improving Results-Orientation in State Budget Planning and Development. As indicated in the
2008 PEFA report, substantial advances have already been made in Indonesia's budget preparation
process since the passing of the Law on State Finances in 2003. The introduction of a unified budget
in 2005, which combined the previously separate recurrent and development budgets, has had a
significant impact on overall budget transparency. The 2008 budget included some important steps
towards a more policy based budget by linking budget allocations more closely with the Government
Work Plan (RKP) - resulting for the first time in some significant budget reallocations. In addition, the
2008 budget included for the first time projections for major budget aggregates for two out years
following the fiscal year. However, it remained uncertain what use would be made of these
projections, in particular whether they would be used as reference in setting budget allocations in the
years following the budget years. Generally, the PEFA report indicated that more work needed to be
done to implement Performance Based Budgeting (PBB) and a Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF) in order to ensure that policy orientation and fiscal sustainability would become an integral
part of the Indonesian State Budget, as prescribed by the Law on State Finances No. 17/ 2003. The
MTEF was issued a long a joint MOF and BAPPENAS manual on PBB in June 2009 along with pilot
projects for six line ministries. There were also revisions to existing program structures that gave
clearer organizational structures and more accountable lines to measure program performance. These
are currently being implemented in the 2011 budget.

7.      The 2011-budget is also the first year of implementing a detailed MTEF. Ministries have
prepared budget estimates for two years following the fiscal year (2012 and 2013) and incorporated
them into the budget documentation presented to Parliament in August (though Parliament will not be
appropriating funds beyond the fiscal year). MOF regulation No. 104/2010 concerning the completion
of budget submission or RKA-KL templates for 2011, contains detailed guidelines for preparing these
forward estimates at the level of components. In May and June 2010, a number of workshops for all
line ministries were conducted to socialize these new concepts, templates and the changes to the RKA-
KL application. The Government is aware that this is an exercise that will have to be continued going
forward, such as for the 2012 budget.

8.       The Government also recognizes that PBB-MTEF implementation needs to be strengthened
further. For the near term (1 year) there is a need to improve the quality of program structures and
performance indicators and to fine-tune the existing MTEF and costing system. For the medium term
(2-4 years) the focus of budget reforms should gradually shift towards (i) developing a PBB-driven
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system and related concepts (see also point 2), such as a concept of
how performance information could impact on budget allocations in the future, (ii) enhancing capacity
to conduct a range of modern budget analytical techniques in accordance with PBB and introducing
the appropriate change management and organizational arrangements, and (iii) strengthening the link
between budget and bureaucracy reforms, in particular the link to performance management. A joint
roadmap to address the above points and to help plan and sequence budget and planning reforms going
forward is currently being developed by MOF and BAPPENAS, with assistance from World Bank
advisors.

9.      In terms of legislative oversight, the Parliament's (DPR) new role in shaping the state budget
and in overseeing budget processes was institutionalized in Law No. 27/2009. According to this law,
two new arrangements were implemented by DPR with regards to budget preparation and oversight
procedures in 2009. Firstly, the former Budget Committee became the Budget Board (Badan
Anggaran) and a permanent entity of DPR responsible for the endorsement of the state budget.
Secondly, the State or Public Finance Accountability Board (Badan Akuntabilitas Keuangan Negara)
was established as a permanent entity of DPR to review audit results of state financial reports prepared
by the Supreme Audit Agency (BPK). Though not mandated in the law, preliminary planning started
also for the establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO), which is intended to provide
                                                   89
support for the implementation of the budget function of Parliament through providing data,
information, analysis and research needed by the members of Parliament in their discussions of the
annual state budget. Beyond these new institutional arrangements, the House of Representatives
(DPR) will continue building capacity through legislative budget review measures; general capacity
development for budget analysis and PBB and MTEF; and external audit follow-ups to ensure
executive accountability.

10.     Improving Budget and Treasury Management. Though significant advances have been made
on the budget preparation side, in-year expenditures continue to deviate from plan. This spending
pattern is of concern because project implementation is disrupted by an adverse cycle, and under-
spending on capital expenditure constrains increases in infrastructure investments. However, Indonesia
remains committed to smoothing budget implementation and execution through modernization of the
treasury system. Most of the regulations to support the implementation of the State Treasury Law of
2004 have been implemented while others are being finalized.

11.     The design and implementation of an automated treasury payment and budget preparation
system (Sistem Perbendaharaan dan Anggaran Negara, or SPAN) is in hand. SPAN, as a cross-
cutting reform, will increase the timeliness, reliability and transparency of budget disbursement and
reporting as well as improve the capability of managers in the efficient management of public
resources. Business process improvements in the area of budget formulation and budget execution
have started and are expected to be completed within the next 4 months. The change management and
communication aspects related to the implementation of SPAN will be addressed from the last quarter
of 2010 till the completion of the pilot phase. The SPAN turnkey implementation vendor has
commenced the configuration of the COTS application software and commenced work on site
preparation for installation of servers and Data Recovery Centre.

12.     The Treasury Transformation Directorate, which will focus on SPAN implementation, is
working closely with the Business Process Consultants and the SPAN turnkey provider to define and
configure the future treasury processes. The SPAN project is being closely monitored by a special
advisor to the Finance Minister through weekly meetings, and, emerging issues and risks dealt with in
a timely manner. Ministerial decrees establishing a project governance system for SPAN have been
implemented. SPAN is projected to become operational in the central treasury beginning 2011, and
then rolled out to the KPPNs and pilot line ministries starting 2012. It will then replace the multitude
of financial data processing applications currently used by Government institutions.

13.      Cash management has improved significantly with the continued implementation of the
Treasury Single Account (TSA), and since 2007 the TSA for expenditure management has been made
operational in all MOF Treasury offices. The TSA system has been extended to cover revenue
collection bank accounts which are now swept daily to the TSA. MOF and BI have already signed an
agreement providing for payment of interest on Government cash balances held in the TSA with BI.
Interest is also collected on cash balances held in petty cash bank accounts of spending units through a
system of "pooled" balances computed daily. However, the periodic census of Government bank
accounts continues to report a number of accounts still outside the coverage of the TSA. The Treasury
is taking steps to review and incorporate most of these bank accounts into the TSA in a phased
manner.

14.      Cash flow forecasting has been rudimentary and the poor quality of cash forecasts is one of
the factors resulting in year-end bunching of expenditures. The accelerated draw down of Government
cash balances in December perpetuates wasteful procurement practices and also impacts monetary
policy. To improve cash planning in the spending units and improve cash forecasting data, the
Treasury issued detailed regulations on cash forecasting in November 2009. The Treasury has also
developed and rolled out application software to assist spending units in implementing the new
regulations. Training and socialization for all Satker in the implementation of the new regulations and
                                                  90
software is on-going. A joint WB-IMF assessment of GOI's Asset and Liabilities Management (ALM)
carried out in mid-2009 indicated that the uncoordinated management of the gross asset-liability
portfolio of the GOI and BI could lead to substantial risk to the overall balance sheet. The risks need to
be mitigated through optimization of borrowing and better reserve management.

15.     Strengthening Monitoring and Evaluation of Public Expenditures and Programs. To ensure
more effective development planning and policy making an improved capacity to analyze the
efficiency of public spending is essential. Several analytical pieces have been produced in the last few
years, and efforts by BAPPENAS and MOF, especially through the IPEA initiative, to improve the
quality of public spending and the delivery of public services should be further supported. One
important aspect going forward will thereby be the development of an underlying Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) system that would bring together and interlink Government financial data and
performance information, and so provide a basic framework and reference tool for more performance-
oriented budget analysis and policy making, in line with the principles of PBB and MTEF reformi.

16.      Efforts to develop such an M&E system are already underway, and the objective is to have a
fully functioning M&E system in place for the next RPJMN. This will require the establishment of
procedures to retrieve performance data and the design of reporting as well as ensuring that
performance data is measurable and of high-quality. Performance information, was, as mentioned
above, for the first time developed by all ministries for their respective programs and activities in the
form of outcome and output indicators in 2009 and implemented with both the 2010 -14 RPJMN and
2011 budget. Quality of this information needs to be further reviewed, and the idea is to conduct a
yearly evaluation exercise of the performance information provided by line ministries to enhance their
quality incrementally over time. A final M&E manual for the line ministries on how to formulate and
report performance information is then, as aligned with the next RPJM schedule, envisaged for 2013.
The Deputy of Performance Evaluation (DPE) at BAPPENAS is currently taking the lead on this
agenda and has just recently initiated efforts to review the new performance information and the
development of a reporting system, with one Directorate assigned particularly to the `development of
overall monitoring evaluation systems and methods of reporting'. (An M&E counterpart unit at DG
Budget of the Ministry of Finance is currently under planning.)

17.      Improving the Public Procurement System. The past few years have witnessed improvements
in the public procurement environment. Keppres No. 80/2003 provided a national public procurement
regulation that meets most of what is generally regarded as accepted international practice, including
basic principles: transparency, open competition, economy and efficiency. This decree also paved the
way for establishing a regulatory body for public procurement. With the introduction of Keppres No.
80/2003, a previous certification ("pre-qualification") process for suppliers/ providers of goods and
services was, in most instances, abandoned by the Government. Keppres No. 80/2003 also established
the basis for sanctions, complaint-handling and requirements for certification of users. Perpres No.
106/2007 was signed in December 2007 establishing an independent agency, the Lembaga Kebijakan
Pengadaan Barang/Jasa Pemerintah (LKPP) or National Public Procurement Agency, that is
responsible for sustainable, integrated, focused and coordinated planning and development of
strategies/policies/regulations associated with the procurement of goods/works/services using public
funds. This institution reports directly to the President of the Republic. In addition to the Chairman,
who heads LKPP, and an Executive Secretary, there are four departments, each headed by a Deputy
with responsibilities for (i) Strategy and Policy Development, (ii) Monitoring, Evaluation and


i
 Such a system would not only be crucial for PBB and MTEF reform but would also assist the Ministry of State Apparatus
Reform in evaluating the performance and accountability of government institutions, the Special Working Unit of the
President (UKP4) by providing a substantive context by which to evaluate achievement of short-term (bimonthly) physical
program outputs, and, the individual line ministries in efforts to improve their programs, activities, and self-assessment of
internal monitoring and evaluation systems.

                                                            91
Information Systems, (iii) Human Resources Development, and (iv) Legal Affairs and Settlement of
Objections.

18.       While Kepres 80 was a welcome development for the country, the public procurement system
still has significant deficiencies in its regulatory and, more importantly, implementation aspects. There
has been slow progress in the development of procurement regulations anchored by a law; slow
progress in the development and use of standard tools in terms of bidding documents and users
manuals; collusion and corruption practices in the bidding process as well as concerns over the
efficiency of the compliant mechanisms and sanction measures are still significant. However, the most
significant deficiency is the absence of professional procurement management and weakness in
procurement capacity in implementing agencies, especially at the provincial and district levels.

19.     This is supported by the findings of some analytical tools and reports such as the self-
diagnostic assessment conducted by the GOI in 2007 using the Base-Line Indicators (BLIs) tool
developed under the World Bank and OECD Development Assistance Committee Procurement Round
Table initiative. The assessment of the BLIs presents a "snapshot" comparison of the actual system
against the international standards or the "model system" that the BLIs represent. Baseline bench
marking of Indonesia's procurement system in June 2007 showed it scoring 62.5 percent for the
Legislative and Regulatory Framework (PILLAR I), 55 percent for Institutional Framework and
Management Capacity (PILLAR II), 59.3 percent for Procurement Operations and Market Practices
(PILLAR III) and 69 percent for Integrity and Transparency of the Public Procurement System
(PILLAR IV) in comparison with recognized international standards. While the establishment of
LKPP should increase the overall score for Pillar II, the assessment indicates that there are significant
areas that need improvement.

20.     The LKPP is currently moving on parallel tracks through expansive legislative and regulatory
reform processes as well as efforts to improve public procurement functions and capacity building.
Indonesia's legal framework for public sector procurement can best be strengthened by anchoring it
with an overarching consolidated and comprehensive national public sector procurement law at the
highest level that (i) establishes the fundamental principles and procedures applicable to all public
sector procurement, (ii) establish clear responsibilities for a permanent procurement management
function within implementing agencies(iii) amend other laws that refer to public sector procurement
and ensures that such a law has the necessary authority in a decentralized environment. LKPP is
currently working on two tracks: the preparation of a new procurement law and the revision of
Keppres 80 to be issued under a new Perpres. As an interim measure, LKPP has finalized a new
Perpres to replace Keppres 80. The main reason for this revision is to improve the current Keppres
such as including references to the establishment of Procurement Service Units (ULPs) by 2012 and
use of national standard bidding documents as well as other improvements. This new Perpres has been
submitted to the President office and is in the final round of consultation and is targeted to be issued in
third quarter of 2010 and to be effective starting January 2010. While Keppres 80 requires certification
of all procurement committee members, the current certification process does not support the
development of procurement capacity while the current ad-hoc nature of managing procurement does
not allow for building sustainable knowledge within implementing agencies.

21.     E-procurement. The Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Communications and Information
and the City of Surabaya have all been at the forefront in the development of e-Government
Procurement (e-GP) technology. The LKPP is currently taking the lead on the implementation of e-GP
in Indonesia at a national and sub-national level. The semi e-procurement system in MPW has handled
around 60% of all planned procurement activities for 2010 with a total of 6,500 contracts and a total
value of 1.5 billion USD. The Minster of Public Work has recently issued a decree requiring the use of
semi e-procurement in all MPW procurement in 23 provinces and the use of e-procurement plus
(allowing electronic submission of bids) in ten provinces in Java, Riau, South Kalimantan, Bali, and
Gorontalo. To date, agencies have been constrained in allowing submission of only electronic bids
                                                    92
on-line due to the existing regulations. The interpretation of the current legislation on public
procurement requires the submission of a hard copy in addition to electronic submission for final
verification. In practice, the lowest three bidders still have to submit hard copies. This will require
verification of the hard copy with the electronic submission leading to possibilities of errors and
delays. This is not a good practice and does not qualify the system as a full e-procurement. To address
this LKPP is in the process of preparing a presidential decree organizing e-procurement and expects
that it will be issued within a year. Once effective, agencies can then use the full e-procurement with
only electronic submission of bids. It will also be critical for GOI agencies to agree on a roadmap for
the development of e-GP in the country, setting the roles of the different stakeholders, and the
responsibility for ensuring minimum inter-operability and core data standards for the various e-GP
providers to comply with.

IMPROVING GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTING AND AUDIT FUNCTIONS

22.      Accounting and Reporting on Budget Execution. BPK has given a `qualified' opinion on GOI
financial statements for 2009. This is the first time that GOI annual financial statements have come
out of a `disclaimer' status in the last five years. In the past, even though the aggregate Government
Annual Financial Statements have been prepared in a timely manner, they continued to receive a
`disclaimer' audit opinion from the external auditors. The major qualifications in the audit report
relate to mismatch between budget classifications and the realizations, problems in assets management
and under-recording of pension funds. BPK also identified some key internal control weaknesses in
GOI functioning.

23.     The annual financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis and there is a plan to move to
full accrual accounting for line ministries and sub national Governments by 2015. The accounting
standards for accrual accounting have already been drafted and are currently undergoing a review
process. The next step would be to issue a regulation detailing a framework of the system including a
sequenced time frame for development of business processes, accounting policies and chart of
accounts. The business processes, accounting policies and chart of accounts are expected to be
completed by 2012 to start pilot implementation in 2013.

24.      Internal Controls and Internal Audit. The PEFA assessment of 2007/8 classified weaknesses
in control execution as a significant risk to reforms introduced in other areas of PFM. The internal
audit function in the country was classified as fragmented and characterized by weak capacity. Key
reform priorities in the area of internal control and internal audit therefore are: (a) roll out of SPAN;
(b) implementation of the COSO control framework and (c) rationalization and strengthening of
internal audit function of GOI.

25.      On internal audit, the quality of audit by inspector generals (IGs) in line ministries and in local
Government inspectorates remains sub-optimal with little focus on risk-based audit. Lack of trained
and skilled auditors and scale of the country with local government inspectorate auditors in over 500
locations makes the task of reforming the internal audit function in the country really challenging. It is
important that a central agency assumes the role of coordination of internal audit function in the
country. A presidential decree regulating Government Internal Audit Systems as required by article
58 of Government Regulation No. 60/ 2008 that is currently being drafted by BPKP is expected to
address this issue. However, the decree has to undergo an elaborate consultation process and is
expected to be issued only in 2011. Meanwhile, some of the IGs in line ministries, including MOF
and MPW, have embarked on a significant modernization of their functions. The IGs of both MOF and
MPW have adopted a risk-based approach to internal audit and are engaged in a review of technical
skills of their staff and technical guidance available to them.



                                                    93
26.     External Audit. A peer review for BPK that was conducted by the Dutch Court of Auditors in
2009 came out largely positive. According to this review, BPK had made major strides in its mandate,
capacity and practices in the last five years. The Dutch Court of Auditors commended BPK on
improving the quality assurance system in the institution, on its effective communications strategy,
comprehensive standards and guidelines for auditors, and a well defined code of conduct. The report
noted the significant growth in the budget, the number of staff and the number of regional officesii.
The report also identified some areas for improvement, mainly the need to improve the readability of
audit reports and the quality of analysis in the audit. However, the peer review concluded that BPK
was on the right track and had made major improvements in its functioning in the last five years.

27.      A new BPK Board took office last year. BPK is now starting to work on a new strategic plan
for the period 2011-15. The new strategic plan would reflect both lessons from the peer review and
the vision of the new Board. The Bank is supporting the preparation of the new strategic plan, which
will be supported by a detailed implementation plan through grant assistance. BPK has bilateral
arrangements with many other SAIs, including bodies from Australia, the Netherlands and Norway,
that have helped BPK in procuring specialized skills in many areas and acquiring technical skills in the
area of performance audit. BPK has been able to submit the audited financial statements within 5
months of the end of the fiscal year for the past five years. BPK also submits interim audit reports to
the Parliament every six months.

CIVIL SERVICE REFORM

28.      In late 2006, the Ministry of Finance initiated the Bureaucracy Reform Initiative (BRI).
Through this initiative it has focused on reforming organizational structures and standard operating
procedures (SOP) and on reforming HRM policies and practices to adhere to the established reform
objectives: i) to create a clean, professional and accountable state apparatus and ii) to create an
efficient and effective bureaucracy so as to provide high quality public services. Ministerial decree
number 30/KMK.01/2007 outlines the reforms in detail. A key element of the BRI has been to
increase staff pay through an additional allowance, a budget allocation for which is approved annually
by Parliament.iii

29.      The BRI has lead to many important outcomes in MOF: professional quality of new staff has
improved and accountability is better enforced including strengthened work discipline; corruption has
decreased in spite of backlashes within DG Customs and within DG Tax; performance of staff has
improved and key performance indicators have been introduced at the level of echelon 1 units
including signed performance contracts for the responsible managers; and service delivery has been
simplified and speeded up within DG's with client relations. Amongst the most important
achievements are the improvements in efficiency of SOPs and the reduction of direct non-transparent
interaction between MOF officials and members of the public; revisions to job descriptions to better
reflect professional requirements and responsibilities; new grading schemes to improve promotions;
higher allowances linked to additional pay grades to increase take-home pay of MOF officials;
performance-based management and improved human resources management; competency-based
training and more rigorous selection processes; and permanent Project Management Units in the DG
Tax and in DG Treasury.

ii
    The number of BPK staff has risen from 2854 in 2004 to 5556 in 2009. The annual budget for FY 10 us IDR 2.02 trillion
compared to IDR 234 billion in 2004.
iii
    Note: The BRI was deemed so crucial that when approving the extra allocation for the first time in 2006, the Parliament
decided to expand the BRI to the Supreme Audit Institution (BPK) and the Supreme Court on a pilot basis. In 2007, the
National committee for Bureaucracy Reform was set up to coordinate reforms among institutions and provisions were
included in Law 17/2007 on Long and Mid-term Planning mandating all 73 central government institutions to implement BRI
before the end of 2011 in support of which MenPAN has issued regulations and voluminous guidelines related to the reform
process.

                                                           94
30.     In April 2009, the Minister of Finance announced the second chapter of BR. Human capital
development and information system for human resources are key priorities. In connection with
previous reforms, other issues also materialized and more areas were identified as targets for reforms
for the second chapter, such as an inherent redundancy created by overstaffing and low quality of
some staff.

31.      In the same year, the Bureaucracy Reform was defined by the new Government as the no. 1
priority among 11 reform priorities. As part of the 100 days program, MenPAN was assigned to
develop a new Grand Design and Roadmap for Bureaucracy Reform, which is intended to replace the
previous concept but which largely should build on the BRI as designed by the Ministry of Finance.
However, the Grand Design is expected to include some important changes of the old concept; the
most important ones related to sequencing and quality assurance of reform outcomes.

32.     In May 2010, a national Steering Committee chaired by the Vice-President and including the
Ministers of Finance, MenPAN, and Home Affairs, the three Coordinating Ministers, the Head of
UKP4 and some eminent persons was formally established. With this new structure in place, the
policy making responsibility for and monitoring of implementation of continued bureaucracy reform
has moved from the Ministry of Finance, where it was invented and initiated, to the center of
government, where the responsibility has to be for reforms to have national impact.

33.     However, it is important to continue the reform process within the Ministry of Finance. In line
with existing policies and plans, and building on the progress achieved so far, the Ministry should
pursue the second chapter of reforms, which would include inter alia strengthening or renewing
corporate values to support professionalism, integrity and accountability; professionalizing HR
functions and providing opportunities for professional certification of HR staff; strengthening
professional career paths and reform rotation practices; fostering open recruitment policies; develop a
talent management system to identify and prepare future leaders; improve the new grading system and
reform the allowance distribution; prepare policies and proposals for right-sizing allowing more
radical restructuring policies; and pursue the analysis related to a possible establishment of one or
several agencies under the Ministry.

DEBT MANAGEMENT

34.     During the previous DPL and IDPL series, two major initiatives in debt management were
implemented: a clear debt management strategy which was publicly announced and a newly created
DG for Public Debt Management (DGDM), with a risk management oversight function for both
domestic and external debts. By 2010, the Government had also successfully reduced its debt-to-GDP
ratio to approximately below 30 percent from the peak of over 90 percent in 1999, with only a
minimal increase through the exchange rate volatility and stimulus spending associated with the global
financial crisis. These positive developments have been matched by marked improvements in the
quality of the Government's domestic and external debt reporting, with the Ministry of Finance and
Bank Indonesia now issuing a joint publication and the World Bank reviewing with a view to
upgrading its rating of the quality of Indonesian official Government and external debt statistics.

GOVERNANCE AND ANTI-CORRUPTION

35.      The public has expressed a strong demand for more accountable Government, as indicated in
the re-election of the incumbent Government for its strong anti-corruption platform. Shortly following
the reelection, the President responded by creating a special unit called UKP4 (Presidential Working
Unit for Supervision and Management of Development), chaired by the highly respected Kuntoro
Mangkusubroto, to reduce bottlenecks ­including governance related issues - in management and
development and to expedite delivery of government programs. Among its priorities is the acceleration
                                                  95
of civil service and tax reforms, and processes are already underway to deliver on this mandate. The
Law on Access to Public Information is passed and declared effective, and the public is hopeful that
the provisions of the law will bring about more transparent and accountable services.

36.      Under the new Corruption Court law, the Special Anti Corruption Court is now created in
seven provinces under the auspices of the Supreme Court, with the plan to replicate it in all provinces
and then districts. This is taking place despite a 2006 Constitutional Court ruling, according to which
the Special Court ­ previously trying cases investigated and prosecuted by the Corruption Eradication
Commission (KPK) ­ was considered unconstitutional since it was seen as creating a dual criminal
justice process for corruption cases. The Special Court has thereby maintained its original composition
­ with ad hoc judges in the judicial panels - and will try all corruption cases prosecuted by public
prosecutors or from the KPK. This however, raises a different concern that the Supreme Court has to
recruit and train highly qualified ad hoc judges designated in the 7 locations, and there is a fear that the
lack of quality in resources may affect the credibility of the Special Court.

37.     In terms of corruption investigation, the pace had been slow. Following the public row
between the Indonesian National Police (INP) and the KPK over the authority of performing some
investigatory authorities, high profile investigations have been stalled. Two KPK commissioners were
arrested by the INP for `abuse of power', and the KPK was left with a serious gap in leadership, which
drove the President to step in and appoint temporary commissioners. A presidential team, called
`Team 8' was established to examine the case and decided that the allegations were not substantiated.
Then, at the request of the two Commissioners, the Constitutional Court ordered the playing of a set of
recordings of tapped phone conversations, which revealed that the case charged against the two
Commissioners was engineered.

38.      There have been allegations in the Indonesian press over the existence of a `judicial mafia'
involving a wide range of judges, lawyers and Government officials. In response the Government
established a high profile special task force (`Judicial Mafia Eradication Task Force) to identify issues,
coordinate and recommend solutions. Some judicial mafia practices also were uncovered in the INP
and Attorney General's Office, and reforms are underway for some judicial institutions, though many
are questioning the effectiveness of the task force. The KPK, with the restoration of its two
commissioners, is now picking up the pace by investigating high profile cases in the Ministry of
Health and Social Affairs. The Government also started to strengthen the KPK by starting the selection
process for the new Chair of the KPK. The Selection Committee will make a final selection of two
candidates to be submitted by the President to Parliament. With the new Chair elected, the public is
hopeful that the KPK will reassert its proactive fight against corruption.

39.      The Constitutional Court, on the other hand, has demonstrated its strong role in resolving
political disputes ­ which is critical particularly in the disputes laden with money politics at the time
of local elections. There is a strong public expectation that the rulings may reduce the practice of
election rigging in local elections. As the Government has demonstrated its commitment to fight
against corruption and to promote reform, the success of its strategy depends on a combination of both
strong enforcement and rigorous institutional reform. With the creation of a high profile Presidential
unit and task force, serious efforts have to be made to ensure that reforms are sustainable beyond the
terms of the ad hoc unit and task force and that recommendations made by the two are effectively
applied.

KEY AREAS FOR FUTURE ATTENTION AND CONCLUSIONS

40.    In sum, for the period ahead, the following will be key areas for attention and monitoring for
Indonesian PFM.
         Ensuring coherence and momentum in PFM reform.
                                                    96
         Deepening the reforms of the central Government budgetary systems to ensure policy
         orientation and medium term planning in budget preparation with a particular focus on
         improving the quality of performance data, fine-tuning the existing MTEF and costing
         system and developing a PBB-MTEF based M&E system.
         Ensuring greater integrity and more effective management of public funds through further
         extension and fine-tuning of the TSA, increasing the quality of cash forecasting procedures
         as well as automation of the treasury payments system, including the review of the chart of
         accounts and related business processes and strengthening PUSINTEK as the shared IT
         services provider.
         Enhancing the Government's budget analysis capacity, primarily by developing a
         consolidated M&E system that integrates financial and non-financial data in accordance
         with PBB principles and streamlines and consolidates information of the complex M&E
         environment.
         Improving the public procurement system by developing a consistent legal framework
         through anchoring it in an overarching and consolidated national procurement law that
         regulates all principles and responsibilities in public procurement, by building the
         procurement management function as well as the capacity of procurement committee
         members based on a comprehensive human resources development strategy, and by
         improving transparency in the procurement process, for example, through the development
         of a national e-procurement system.
         Ensuring relevant and reliable financial reporting by strengthening human resources in
         Government accounting and reporting, especially at the line ministry level and especially
         with regards to accrual accounting.
         Strengthening the internal audit function in the country by rolling out the treasury payment
         system as planned, implementing the COSO framework, conducting capacity building for
         Government inspectorate auditors, especially with a view to risk-based audit, and
         identifying an agency to assume coordination of the internal audit function.
         Detailing and implementing BPK's strategic plan 2011-1015 for improving the quality of
         external audit reports.
         Continuing civil service reform in the Ministry of Finance in the context of the second
         chapter of the national bureaucracy reform initiative.
         Keeping up the debt management strategy and the advances in the quality of debt reporting.
         Developing a coherent and well-focused strategy for corruption prevention within the state
         administration and ensuring its sustainability beyond the terms of the ad hoc task force.

41.      All these reforms are being actively considered by the Government, and, as indicated further
above, implementation plans are either being developed by the Government or implementation is
already underway. The capacity to centrally monitor these and other reforms has already been
established at the Secretary-General's office of the MOF (PUSHAKA). However, Indonesia would
benefit from a coherent reform plan or strategy to ensure proper phasing and coordination of PFM
reforms. This would also allow for enhanced monitoring and accountability within the GOI and thus
provide additional momentum and direction to reform efforts. To this end, it is currently being
discussed at MOF whether the PFM MDTF Annual PFM Strategy Note, currently a document drafted
yearly to guide and inform the management and execution of activities of the PFM Multi Donor Trust
Fund, into a more elaborate and official Government strategy.

42.     Management of Foreign Exchange. The foreign exchange control environment is assessed to
be generally satisfactory. The country is no longer subject to the Extended Arrangement from the
IMF. Bank Indonesia (BI) was last subject to the transitional procedures under the Fund's safeguards
assessment policy in 2002. That assessment recommended remedial action to address a number of
vulnerabilities in the audit arrangements of BI. The main recommendations have been implemented,
including the establishment of an independent audit committee at BI and the publication of BI's
audited financial statements. Audited financial statements for BI for 2009 by BPK contain an
unqualified opinion.

43.      In almost all areas of PFM, changes in the legal and regulatory architecture are now largely
complete and the momentum has shifted towards implementation of new PFM practices. Advances
have been made in budget preparation with the introduction of MTEF and PBB; Government
accounting standards have been formally established and are being adhered to in several respects to
produce comprehensive annual financial statements; and the external audit function has made
significant progress in the last few years. However, internal controls in the execution of budget by
spending agencies need improvement. These weaknesses in financial management and accountability
continue to be gradually addressed through the PFM reform program discussed above, and
development partners are actively engaged in this process. Overall, the trajectory of reform is in the
right direction, and, most importantly, the Government continues to demonstrate high commitment in
completing the planned reforms. The reforms when implemented will further reduce the level of
fiduciary risks. Taking this into consideration, the Bank assessment team does not propose putting in
place any additional fiduciary arrangements for this operation.
