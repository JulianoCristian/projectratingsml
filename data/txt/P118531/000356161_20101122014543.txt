The Executive Directors approved the Fourth Infrastructure Development Policy Loan in the
amount of US$ 200 million equivalent to the Republic of Indonesia on the payment terms and
conditions set out in the President's Memorandum (R2010-0255).

improve efficiency in infrastructure spending ­ especially electricity, roads, water and sanitation
services. Directors noted that the operation is consistent with the current Indonesia Country
Partnership Strategy, as well as the strong linkages with previous IDPLs. The need to address
civil service reforms and capacity building measures for public officials was also emphasized.
Directors also welcomed anti-corruption efforts and called for inclusion of lessons learned into
successive IDPLs.
