integrated urban transport system in the\n            metropolitan region, rehabilitate subway lines, and transfer\n            current transport systems to the State government, while\n            promoting private sector participation for such systems.\n            Project components call for: 1) investments in\n            infrastructure, and equipment supply to rehabilitate the\n            West line of the Metrofor subway system, and complement the\n            South line. This component will also rehabilitate, or build\n            as necessary, transfer stations to serve between the subway,\n            buses, autos, and non-motorized modes of transport. Project\n            management, and supervision will be financed to assist the\n            Project Coordination Unit, and with detailed engineering\n            designs, respectively; and, 2) institutional, and policy\n            formulation to support the decentralization from the Federal\n            Government to the State, and the subsequent concession of\n            Metrofor to the private sector. Technical assistance will be\n            provided to strengthen the Regional Transport Coordination\n            Commission, and, to prepare an integrated transport policy,\n            land use, and air quality management strategy, to meet\n            quality targets, through sound cost-recovery tariffs, and\n            subsidy policies."}, "docdt": "2001-11-06T00:00:00Z"}
