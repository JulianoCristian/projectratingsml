                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Road Infrastructure Agency (RIA) canceled the procedure for hiring consulting services for project management support for Operational Programmes for Transport and Regional
                         Development. Furthermore, RIA decided to drop this consultancy from the project because some activities, such as the institutional assessment of RIA and the review and
                         improvement of project management manuals, envisaged to be performed under the services, had been undertaken in the mean time with RIAs own resources, and RIA has
                         increased the absorption of respective funds under OPT and OPRD.
