                                RESTRUCTURING PAPER




SUMMARY

1.     The proposed project restructuring does not entail any changes to the project's
development objectives.
2.        The proposed project restructuring is necessary for the following two reasons:
     a.      To reflect the Government's new priorities with regard to the absorption of
             European Union (EU) funds. The full and timely utilization of grants available
             to the road sector in Bulgaria under the Cohesion Fund and the European
             Regional Development Fund over the period 2007 ­ 2013--more than EUR 1
             billion--is at a critical junction. Without urgent actions to streamline program
             preparation and implementation and to provide sufficient counterpart funding,
             Bulgaria is to lose some of these funds. The Prime Minister requested by letter
             to the World Bank President that Bank assistance in the road sector should
             focus on EU funds absorption, and this was confirmed in the Memorandum of
             Understanding signed on August 10, 2010 between the Prime Minister and
             World Bank President.
     b.      To improve project implementation performance. While more than 80 percent
             of loan proceeds have been committed (30 percent disbursed), the budgetary
             restrictions imposed in 2010 combined with the delays experienced early on
             during the project's life make it impossible to complete all project activities
             before the current Loan Closing Date of June 30, 2010. Budgetary restrictions
             have been imposed on public investment programs due to the impact of the
             global financial crisis on Bulgaria's fiscal position, and to the Government's
             fiscal policy aimed at keeping the budget deficit under control in compliance
             with EU's budget deficit targets. This implies longer implementation periods
             for most contracts under the project.
3.      The major modifications being proposed are: (i) changes to project components
by expanding the scope of "Component 2: Institutional Development" and focusing it on
the absorption of EU funds, and reducing the scope of "Component 1: Rehabilitation of
selected roads" to reflect the reduced budget for the project which impacts the project's
financing plan; (ii) extending the Loan Closing Date by 24 months to enable full
completion of the expanded Component 2 and of all ongoing road rehabilitation works
under Component 1; (iii) reallocation of Loan Proceeds between Disbursement
Categories to reflect the proposed changes to project components, and increase the



                                              1
percentage of expenditures to be financed from loan proceeds; and (iv) modifications of
outcome and impact indicators to reflect the proposed changes.


PROJECT STATUS
4.       Good progress has been made with regard to the institutional development
objective of the project: the development of the Road Management System--a key
institutional development activity under the project--is completed. Bulgaria now has a
fully functional system and trained experts to monitor the condition of road infrastructure
and to improve the use of available funds for road maintenance and improvement. This
objective is supported by "Component 2: Institutional Development" which has been
progressing very satisfactorily.
5.      Progress has been made with the road rehabilitation development objective and all
construction work contracts under the project have been awarded, leading to the
commitment of more than 80 percent of the loan (30 percent disbursed). However, the
budget constraints imposed in 2010 and 2011 make it impossible for Road Infrastructure
Agency (RIA)1 to implement the project in accordance with the plan discussed during the
Midterm Review of the project conducted in October 2009. Due to the impact of the
financial crisis on the state budget and to the Government's budget deficit targets for
2010, restrictions were imposed on the project's budget and works contracts that started
prior to 2010 were stopped in early summer 2010, and those that were signed and about
to start in 2010 were postponed indefinitely. Road rehabilitation works would need an
additional two construction seasons to be completed.
6.     Little progress has been made in implementing the road safety component, despite
the development under the project of a national road safety action plan. RIA has now
made some progress with the preparation of specific activities related to accident black
spot improvements. However, the budget situation in 2010 prevented RIA from
launching any additional road safety activity.


PROPOSED CHANGES
COMPONENTS

7.      Component 1: Rehabilitation of Selected Roads. The scope and size of this
component are proposed to be reduced in order to reflect the reduced budget for the
project in 2010 and 2011 which impacts the financing plan for the project and prevents
RIA from starting some road rehabilitation works and complete them even with the
proposed extension to Loan Closing Date.
8.     Under the proposed change, 307 kilometers of roads would be rehabilitated under
this component compared to the initial target of 450 kilometers described in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) and in the Loan Agreement. Until June 30, 2010, contracts
have been awarded for the rehabilitation of 392 kilometers of roads (after modifications
1
    Currently, the Loan Agreement refers to National Road Infrastructure Fund.


                                                      2
of the scope of works from the original 450 kilometers). Therefore, contracts
corresponding to about 85 kilometers (out of 392 km), i.e. lots 5, 6 and 7 for which works
have not started, are proposed to be cancelled. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the proposed
modifications.

9.      Component 2: Institutional Development. This component has been
progressing satisfactorily, and it is proposed that it be expanded and focused on the two
first sub-components goals as described in the PAD and in the Loan Agreement under
Part II.1: (i) strengthen the internal management and operations related to the road sector;
and (ii) improve road sector planning, programming, budgeting and program
implementation with particular focus on road programs funded from the Cohesion Fund
and the European Regional Development Fund. The aim of the expanded activities is to
help with the full and timely utilization of EU funds available to the road sector in
Bulgaria, and accelerating the preparation, approval, implementation and disbursement of
these funds. It is expected that the above proposed areas of support to start in mid 2011
and to span over a period of 24 months.
10.    Specific additional activities will include the provision of consultancy services to
provide advice on EU funds implementation, including the review of current status of the


                                                3
EU supported Operational Program for Transport (OPT) and Operational Program for
Regional Development (OPRD) and the support to streamline and standardize preparation
and implementation of projects. These services will also help strengthening the internal
management and operations of RIA and the Ministry of Regional Development and
Public Works (MRDPW), by identifying institutional constraints within RIA and the
MRDPW hindering the effective implementation and management of the programs, and
improving road sector planning, programming, budgeting, and program implementation.
They will also directly provide technical services to strengthen RIA and MRDPW's
directorates in charge of management of EU-funded road projects and support practical
preparation of EU-funded road programs for the period 2010 ­ 2020.
11.     Under this Component 2, it is proposed to cancel the small subcomponent related
to "Support to RIA to enhance its financial management capacity through the provision
of technical advisory services, training and equipment and the carrying out of studies".
This subcomponent was initially envisaged in order to enhance RIA's financial
management system. Since project appraisal, RIA has implemented--outside of the scope
of the project--an upgrade of its financial management system.
12.    Component 3: Road Safety. No change is proposed under this component.


FINANCING

 Project Costs


13.     As a result of the proposed changes in Components 1 and 2, the revised project
costs are as indicated in Table 3 below.


           Table 3: Project Costs by Component (EUR million with VAT)

      Total Project Costs                       144.00            105.62


 Financing Plan, Disbursement Arrangements, and Reallocation of Loan Proceeds


14.   With the reduced project cost, and in order to provide flexibility to the
government during the years following the financial crisis, it is proposed to keep the loan
amount unchanged--i.e. EUR 90 million--and to decrease the share of financing from




                                            4
the Borrower2. The increase in the share of Bank financing is reflected in an increase in
the percentage of expenditures to be financed from loan proceeds as shown in Table 4
below.

                      expenditures to be financed from loan proceeds

    (1) Of expenditures including VAT.
    (2) The percentages come into force for payments upon the effectiveness of the proposed
    amendment to the Loan Agreement.


CLOSING DATE

15.    It is proposed to extend the Loan Closing Dated by 24 months to enable the full
completion of the expanded Component 2 and of all ongoing road rehabilitation works
under Component 1. The proposed Loan Closing Date would be June 30, 2013. This
extension would enable the Borrower to complete the road rehabilitation works and
achieve a satisfactory outcome in the expanded institutional development component.
This will be the first extension of the Project.

PROCUREMENT

16.    The Procurement arrangements will remain unchanged, except that the applicable
Guidelines shall be the most recent versions, i.e., "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits, May 2004, Revised October 1, 2006 & May 1, 2010" for
procurement of goods, works and non-consultant services, and "Guidelines: Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, May 2004, Revised October 1,
2006 & May 1, 2010" for selection of consultant services.

2
  The estimate of the Borrower's contribution in the Project Appraisal Document is EUR 54 million. The
revised estimate of the Borrower's contribution will depend on the effectiveness date of the proposed loan
amendment (i.e. the date when the new percentages of disbursement become effective). As of March 31,
2011, the cumulative Borrower's contribution was EUR 13 million.


                                                    5
IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE

17.      A revised implementation plan has been reviewed and agreed and it would allow
full utilization of project funds and the completion of project activities currently in the
procurement plan.


RESULTS/INDICATORS

18.     Modifications to outcome and intermediate outcome indicators are proposed in
order to reflect the proposed changes to the components and to make consistent the
definition of the outcome indicators in the PAD. Details of the proposed changes are in
Annex 1. More specifically:
   o Targets for outcome indicators related to total number of kilometers rehabilitated
     will be reduced.
   o Additional indicators are added to measure the results achieved in relation with
     the expanded Component 2.
   o The definition of the outcome indicators related to the percentage of Class I, II,
     and III roads to be rehabilitated included in the "Arrangement for results
     monitoring" in the PAD is proposed to be substituted with the definition of the
     same indicator as described in the "Results Framework" table in the PAD. This
     change is necessary because the network-wide targets included in the table on
     "Arrangement for results monitoring" may include impacts of other ongoing road
     rehabilitation programs in Bulgaria.



APPRAISAL SUMMARY

19.     Component 1 still represents about 90 percent of the project in terms of costs, and
the road sections under this component represent a subset of those included in the PAD.
The economic evaluation undertaken during project appraisal using HDM-4 remains
relevant and the actual bid prices have not shown overall a marked difference justifying a
lower rate of return for the investments (actual bid prices are in average 4 percent lower
than the PAD's cost estimates).

         IRI means International (Road) Roughness Index. The relationship between road condition and IRI is discussed and presented in Annex 3 to the Project Appraisal
       Document.

         The new targets are revised to take into account both the new length of roads to be rehabilitated under the restructured project, and the updated statistics on network
       size, classification, and condition as follows: Motorways: 466 km, Class I: 3,207 km, Class II: 3,909 km, Class III: 11,621 km (total: 19,203 km) (Source: Consultant
       Report: "Development of a Road Management System and Design of Pilot Contracts for Performance-Based Maintenance and Management of Roads", June 2010).

         The reduction in Vehicle Operating Cost in response to improved IRI is obtained from the Highway Development and Management model (HDM-4). Inputs for
       HDM-4 will be adjusted so as to account for improvement in road condition only.
