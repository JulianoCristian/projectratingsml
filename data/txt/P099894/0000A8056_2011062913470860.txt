                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project activities related to road rehabilitation works and road safety have accumulated delays that were exacerbated in 2010 due to budgetary restrictions imposed on the Road
                         Infrastructure Agency. Project activities related to institutional development have been successful leading to the development of a Road Management System under the project.
