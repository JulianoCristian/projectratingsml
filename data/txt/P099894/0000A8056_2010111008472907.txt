                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the proposed project would be to assist Bulgaria to reduce road transport costs by improving the condition and quality of its
                         roads                               network during the first years of EU accession.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         - While most loan funds have been committed, the state budget allocated to the implementing entity is not sufficient to cover all project expenditures that were initially envisaged for
                         2010. This budget situation is having an impact on the scope of works that could be implemented in 2010, and delays are expected in the implementation of works contracts under
                         the project.
                         - Very good progress has been made on the institutional development activities under the project with the completion of the development of the Road Management System.
