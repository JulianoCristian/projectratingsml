Financial Sector\n            Development Policy Loan Project for Egypt were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low to negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: reforms have\n            been undertaken after a process of close and continuous\n            consultation with all stakeholders. This participative\n            process with wider involvement not only encouraged a more\n            informed evaluation of underlying content of policies but\n            also enhanced the credibility of policies and generated\n            expectations that the reform process will be sustained.\n            Reasons advanced for the inability to fully implement the\n            financial sector reform measures in the past did include the\n            lack of public support for the measures, and the need for\n            strengthening public sector banks prior to their\n            privatization. The one-tranche operation, as opposed to a\n            programmatic loan, aiming at the first phase of the\n            financial sector reform program was effective. It responded\n            effectively to the needs of the authorities by providing\n            them timely support based on clearly established prior\n            actions. It provides quicker feedback and momentum to the\n            reforms that enables follow up and making early adjustments\n            if necessary. It allows continuity in the dialogue with the\n            authorities. Single tranche operations define benchmarks\n            based on information available at the time of implementation\n            and not on some future developments which might not\n            materialize. Moreover, the well defined policy matrix owned\n            by the government and endorsed by the Bank and partners is\n            an essential implementation roadmap for the authorities to\n            move the agenda forward."}, "docdt": "2007-02-21T00:00:00Z"}
