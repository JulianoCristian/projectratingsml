1.      Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1.    Context at Appraisal

Macroeconomic Framework

The overall performance of the Egyptian economy--a necessary condition to developing a sound
financial sector--has continued to improve in 2005. Results are reflected in an accelerating
economic growth rate, improved market confidence, strong capital inflows, stability in the foreign
exchange market, significant increase in international reserves, decreases in inflation rates, and
expansion in the stock market. Since 2004, the government has undertaken various and wide-
ranging measures, including tariff cuts, reduction in tax rates, floatation of the exchange rate,
privatization of state-owned enterprises, and reforming the financial sector.

The restored confidence associated with recent reforms, along with favorable external conditions,
has led to improved economic performance. Growth has been reviving since 2004, and real GDP
grew by 5.1 percent in fiscal year 2005 compared to 4.2 percent in 2004, after a low growth rate
of 3 percent during 2001­03. The large current-account surplus and low international
indebtedness help insulate the economy from external shocks. The current account surplus was
US$2.9 billion in 2005, accounting for 3.3 percent of GDP. Inflation fell from 18.2 percent in
October 2004 to 3.7 percent in March 2006. However, the government budget deficit, though
declining, remains relatively high, about 8 percent of GDP.

The Bank team found that the overall performance of the Egyptian economy--a necessary
condition to restore a sound financial sector--was underpinned by a satisfactory macroeconomic
policy framework, but with lingering concerns about long-term fiscal sustainability, which would
fade away only if the annual growth rate was sustained at 5 percent at least. The outlook for
growth in Egypt was better than it was during the past few years, partly because of high
expectations from anticipated reforms and improvements in the investment climate associated
with the new government.
Overall, the macroeconomic framework was supportive to financial sector reforms.


Sector Background

The financial sector in Egypt has been, over the past decade and a half, the subject of reform
efforts. These reforms aimed at financial liberalization to develop more effective financial
instruments, strengthen the system infrastructure, and enhance competitiveness through increased
private participation. The sector was subject to various legal and regulatory reforms. However,
despite these positive steps, the financial system in the late 1990s continued to face significant
challenges given the low levels of competition, large non-performing loans (NPLs), relatively
high intermediation costs, limited innovation and dominance of state ownership. Non-bank
segment was characterized by underdeveloped bond market, insurance,, thin trading in equities,
and underdeveloped mortgage markets.

The political and economic context at appraisal of this operation was conducive. The reformist
cabinet that took office in July 2004 set a major agenda of macroeconomic and structural reforms.
An integral component of this comprehensive reform program was the Financial Sector Reform
Program that was endorsed by the President in September 2004 for implementation over 2005­
2008. This endorsement set the stage for the Ministry of Investment and the Central Bank of
Egypt (CBE) to embark on implementing this reform program aimed at addressing the identified
vulnerabilities, enhance the performance of the banking sector, as well as developmental non-



                                                  1

bank financial institutions, including the insurance sector, the capital market, and the mortgage
industry.     Underpinning the whole program was also a major effort at strengthening the
regulatory capacity and supervisory framework.

In this regard, lending further credence to the authorities' determination to see the reforms
through, sweeping executive measures--uncharacteristic of the consensus-driven Egyptian
establishment--were taken with the appointment of a new CBE's Governor, new management at
all supervisory and regulatory bodies, including Egyptian Insurance Supervisory Authority
(EISA), Capital Market Authority (CMA), Mortgage Finance Authority (MFA), and the Cairo
and Alexandria Stock Exchange (CASE). The newly established Ministry of Investment was
given oversight for all non-bank financial institutions. In parallel, new management was
appointed for the state-owned banks and insurance companies.

Rationale for Bank Involvement

The World Bank Financial Sector Development Policy Loan (DPL) was the ideal instrument to
support the government's financial sector reform agenda. The DPL was consistent with the
objectives agreed in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) endorsed by the Board on June 16,
2005, in particular under its first strategic objective to strengthen the capacity of the financial
system to facilitate private sector development. A high case lending scenario was also envisaged,
which included two quick-disbursing loans to support financial sector reforms, considered central
to improving the climate for private sector development.

The Egyptian authorities valued the Bank's expertise in financial sector reforms and requested the
Bank's support of the program. Bank involvement built upon years of earlier policy dialogue with
the Egyptian authorities particularly in the context of the 2002 joint IMF-World Bank Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) as well as through four "FIRST Initiative" projects
sponsored by the World Bank.1 In parallel to DPL, the World Bank was also supporting the
housing sector policy reforms through a Mortgage Market Development Project, which helped
reinforce the objectives of the proposed financial sector operation.


1.2.      Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The main development objective of the operation was to build a more resilient and competitive
financial sector with a sound banking system and insurance industry that could contribute better,
in the medium-term, to the provision of modern and effective financial services. The operation
would support the government in implementing the first phase of the Finance Sector Reform
Program. The operation would help achieve this objective in particular by locking in a set of
irreversible policy measures.

To this effect, World Bank operations seeked to:(i) strengthen the domestic banking system
inter-alia by divesting fully state-owned banks shares in joint venture banks, privatizing one of
the large state-owned commercial banks, defining a framework to implement institutional,
operational and financial restructuring of the remaining public banks, and consolidating and
merging small banks in an over banked market; (ii) develop the contractual savings system and
restructure the insurance industry so it can play an effective role in the management and transfer
of risk and mobilization of long-term savings; and (iii) strengthen the regulatory and supervisory


1 The FIRST Initiatives are: (i) strengthening the capacity of the banking supervision department at CBE;
.(ii) strengthening the existing credit information department at CBE; (iii) establishing the private credit
bureau and making the necessary regulatory, legal and institutional changes; and (iv) modernizing the
payments system at CBE.

framework for banks and non-bank financial institutions to ensure compliance with international
standards and effective enforcement.

These outcomes were to be measured by key indicators: (i) completing an independent full
financial due diligence of all state-owned commercial banks; (ii) starting the process of
institutional, and operational restructuring of the three state-owned commercial banks; (iii)
agreeing on a schedule for a scheme to settle state-owned enterprises' (SOEs) non-performing
loans (NPLs); (iv) consolidating and reducing public ownership in the banking sector through
divesture of state-owned banks shares in 13 of joint venture banks and bring Bank of Alexandria
to the point of sale; (v) appointing an investment bank as advisors to carry out the due diligence
for the state-owned insurance companies, and recommending a restructuring and privatization
plan; (vi) adopting a strategy for restructuring and privatizing state-owned insurance companies;
(vii) implementing a FIRST funded technical assistance project to assist insurers and EISA to set
MTPL (`ACT") claims provisions accurately; and (x) building the supervisory and regulatory
capacity of the banking and insurance sectors.


1.3.     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

The PDO and the key indicators have remained the same during the life of the project.


1.4.     Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The DPL was designed to support policy reforms in the following three areas: (i) strengthening
legal, regulatory and supervisory framework in banking and insurance; (ii) institutional and
operational restructuring of state-owned banks; (iii) financial restructuring of state-owned banks;
(iv) reducing public ownership in, and control over, banking sector institutions; (v) restructuring
state-owned insurance companies; and (vi) strengthening the fiduciary framework for public
financial management and corporate financial reporting. These key policy areas were identified
from the 2002 FSAP and the follow-on dialogue between the authorities and the Bank.


1.5.     Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

The policy areas were not revised during the life of the project.


1.6.     Other significant changes

There were no significant changes made to the project from the design stage to the completion of
the operation.

  approvalIn addition given the comprehensiveness of the financial sector reform agenda,
  Parliamentarians spent far more time than usual discussing the reforms supported under the DPL
  before finally approving the loan on April 15, 2007. A legal opinion was submitted to the Bank
  on April 30, 2007 and the loan was declared effective on May 3, 2007.

2.2.    Major Factors Affecting Implementation


Adequacy of Government's Commitment

Strong government's commitment to the reform program was key to the success of the operation.
The presence in the new cabinet of a core group of credible reformers, including the Ministers of
Investment, and the Governor of CBE sent an unequivocal signal to investors and the donors'
community that Egypt is seriously committed to move towards a private-led economy. They
designed a comprehensive program of reforms, moved swiftly to recruit highly qualified and
experienced professionals in the market specially for the purpose of implementing the banking
and non-banking sector reforms. The successful implementation also benefited from an enhanced
communications and consultation process through the new strategic partnership between the
Egyptian authorities and the Bank during the formulation of the CAS.              This involved a
constructive dialogue with the authorities based on the principle of mutual commitment between
the Egyptian authorities and the Bank, through a policy compact, whereby the Bank commits to
support the reform process (not just specific ad hoc measures) in Egypt and the government
commits to continuing along an agreed upon reform path.


Soundness of Background Analysis

The design and implementation of the Financial Sector Reform Program and DPL was
significantly enhanced by the analytical work carried out in 2002 in the context of the FSAP, the
follow-on policy dialogue, and the successive FIRST Initiatives which helped greatly clarify the
capacity building needs. The experience that the World Bank has gathered in development policy
lending in the financial sector was used by the authorities to guide the design and implementation
of the program. USAID and the European Union (EU) have also supported analytical work on
reforming and restructuring the financial sector.


Assessment of the Operation's Design

The design of the operation was well thought out. The operation was a one-tranche operation to
support the government in implementing phase I of the Financial Sector Reform Program. At the
preparation stage there is the option of having a programmatic operation amounting US$ 1 billion
or a two operations amounting to US$ 500 million each, aiming at implementing the reform
program. At the Operational Committee (OC) meeting, a decision was taken to proceed with two
operations, aiming at supporting the government in implementing the two phases of the
government program, which was consistent with the CAS which envisioned two financial sector
operations (FY 2006 and FY 2008). Two separate operations were considered more underpinning
to irreversible policy measures, as disbursement will occur upon the realizations of up front
specific actions under each phase. This would in turn ensure stringer government's commitment
to the comprehensive implementation of the reform program.

Despite the complexity of the reform program and the number of organizations involved both
domestically as well as outside donors, the policy areas were well identified and narrowly
focused; and reforms were sliced into two stages according to their degrees of priority. The
Egyptian government has repeatedly indicated its appreciation of the Bank's integrated delivery
of assistance, and has requested the operation as a mean to improve program design and to
enhance discipline in reform implementation. The perception that the Bank is prepared to remain
engaged in the reform effort helped the dialogue and made the Bank a privileged partner.

Given the multifaceted nature of the financial sector reform effort, donors' contributions were
needed. In this context, the authorities sought assistance from other donors to complement that of



                                                 5

the Bank to help them implement this comprehensive and substantive reform program. Given the
World Bank's experience, it chose to address banking sector reform while the worked on the
supervision and regulatory framework. A large assistance and training program for banking
supervision was put in place by the European Central Bank (ECB). USAID provided assistance
to the financial sector reforms under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the
Government of Egypt in mortgage finance and the insurance sector, and the IMF was concerned
with exchange rate and monetary policy management.

Having the presence of many donors itself posed a challenge which led the Egyptian government
to put in place an innovative approach to donors support by making it clear that it wanted the
Bank to lead the coordination of donors' support to financial sector reform to avoid overlap and
address key issues on a timely and priority basis. To this end, a Financial Sector Donors Sub-
group was formed to coordinate efforts related to both technical and financial support provided to
the government.

Furthermore, the innovative approach followed by the Bank and other donors gave the authorities
the flexibility needed to decide on how best to manage the privatization of the Bank of
Alexandria and reduce state ownership in the joint venture banks without unduly imposing
conditionality that could have undermined their bargaining power. The benchmarking approach
helped implementation by focusing on results. In the end, the privatization of Bank of Alexandria
transferred seven percent of the banking deposits while the divestiture of state-owned banks
shares in joint venture banks, which is more than 95 percent complete, transferred about 20
percent of system deposits to private hands.


Relevance of Risks Identified

Risks identified at appraisal (political, social, fiscal, and governance) were relevant and have been
well managed as mitigating factors were embedded in the design of DPL. To mitigate the risk that
social, political and stakeholder opposition would weaken government resolve as had happened in
the previous efforts to reform the financial sector, the government decided to communicate
regularly and in a transparent way the objectives of the reform program, its expected outcomes, to
show that consumers will in the end gain from such reforms. There was also a much better
communication of the government's financial sector reform program to the various
stakeholders--parliamentarians, media, and political parties. Contingency financing in terms of
voluntary early retirement and compensation schemes were planned to alleviate the resulting
social burden. In addition, the program included staff training and skills upgrading for employees
whose current profile did not readily fit in the organization chart of the restructured financial
institutions.

The risk to fiscal sustainability from the added burden of bank restructuring (fiscal cost of the
settlement of NPLs, tax settlements, and the cost of compensation packages) on an already tight
fiscal position was correctly identified and adequately managed. Indeed, the government was
able to mobilize significant privatization proceeds of the sale of state-owned bank shares in joint
venture banks, the sale of state owned enterprises (law 203 companies) and other public entities,
which were then used as planned to partially offset the cost and reduce its potential negative
impact on the fiscal position.

The risks associated with governance were also correctly identified. To minimize the likelihood
that state-owned banks may revert to the old lax management and lending practices that are at the
root of their current problems, recapitalization by the government was made conditional on the
state banks agreeing upon a plan of operational, institutional and financial restructuring which in



                                                     6

turn was made contingent upon, and was to be implemented in step with the progress of the
capacity building program and restructuring plan designed to strengthen the banks governance,
and overhaul their lending and risk control practices, within a timeframe agreed with the Bank.
Full implementation of the institutional and operational restructuring was to remain under close
CBE supervision (acting on the owner's behalf) throughout the restructuring period.

Risks related to the implementation of the program of reforms were rightly judged low because of
the strong dialogue and broad agreement on the substance and design of the operation, the
continuous dialogue with official counterparts and thorough adequate supervision of the DPL, as
well as the Bank's recognition for the need to proceed diligently with the reform program. The
financial sector dialogue conducted in Egypt between the 2002 FSAP and the preparation of this
operation allowed for differences between the authorities and the World Bank to be narrowed
down, and for a common view to emerge on a number of priority sector policy issues and
orientations with clear objectives and a transition process to reach them. These were largely
embodied in the government Financial Sector Reform Program.                 There has been a broad
agreement on the substance and design of the operation components, the scope of World Bank
assistance, and the need to proceed diligently with the reform program.


2.3.    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization


(i)     M&E design

A set of qualitative and quantitative intermediate outcome indicators were defined to monitor
progress towards the achievement of the Program Development Objectives (PDO). The M&E
framework was established during the design of the DPL for the clear purpose of monitoring
progress against the agreed upon benchmarks as outlined in DPL the Operational Policy Matrix
(see Annex 4) but also to help design the second stage of reforms to be supported by the
forthcoming DPL II. These indicators were selected in agreement with government counterparts,
taking into account the availability of data, their relevance and feasibility.

Qualitative operational expected policy outcomes were selected to monitor the progress in the
execution of the Financial Sector Reform Program, and the operation, including: (i)
implementation of the strengthening of the supervisory and regulatory authorities of banks and
insurance industry; (ii) progress in the operational, institutional and financial restructuring of
state-owned banks and insurers; and (iii) strengthening the fiduciary framework for public and
financial management, and corporate financial reporting. Quantitative indicators were selected in
areas where data was available, such as: (i) reduction in NPLs of state-owned enterprises in state-
owned banks as of June 2004 by 1/3rd by June 2007; (ii) reduction in public ownership of banks
from 65 percent in June 2004 of banking sector deposits to 51 percent by June 2007; and (iii)
consolidation of the banking sector, evident in the reduction in the number of operating banks
from 57 in June 2004 to 40 in June 2007.


(ii)    M&E Implementation

Apart from some difficulties in obtaining up-to-date data on the NPLs, data availability was
adequate to follow up on the policy dialogue initiated during preparation of the operation. The
program was jointly implemented by the Ministry of Investment and CBE. The Ministry had the
overall responsibility for implementing the measures related to the non-bank financial sector,
while CBE was the Executing Agency for the aspects of the program dealing with the banking
sector.  Within the CBE, a Bank Reform Unit (BRU) was set up as the focal point for
implementation of banking reforms. The BRU, headed by a Sub-Governor, a former international



                                                   7

banker, is staffed with highly qualified and experienced professionals, many of whom were
specially recruited for the purpose of implementing the banking reform program.

The overall status of the government's program was well monitored during the supervision
missions to ensure that the reform program was on track, and highlighting pending issues to the
authorities throughout the process to ensure that all expected and agreed on outcomes are met. In
addition, the supervision missions also provided the Bank with the opportunity to continue the
policy dialogue with the institutions involved in the program implementation, and to ensure the
deployment of staff and consultants able to advise the government in all of the policy and
technical areas pertaining to the reforms.


(iii)   M&E Utilization

Armed with the information collected from the first ever independent financial due diligence, of
the state owned banks, the Bank in coordination with the BRU was able to follow up on the
implementation of the plans to restructure the state-owned bank and enhance their governance
structure. Specific indicators were designed and monitored through meetings with the state-
owned banks' management to monitor progress in cleaning up the balance sheets, upgrading their
IT systems to prepare them for the new competitive, and risk management environment. The
Bank's supervision mission's discussions with the BRU and the state-owned banks also helped
the Bank's supervision mission staff also monitor progress in implementing these restructuring
plans and discuss the next reforms which are going to be supported by the forthcoming DPL II.

Similarly, at the Ministry of Investment, sub-units were established to ensure the effective
implementation of the various reforms related to the non-bank financial sector. A Steering
Committee on Insurance Reform was established by Ministerial decree and included the
Chairman of EISA, the resident Technical Advisor to EISA, and one senior executive each from
the four public sector insurance companies. The Steering Committee, in turn, set up small
restructuring units within each of the public sector insurance companies, whose mandate included
ensuring proper communication of the envisaged reform measures to the companies' staff in
order to ensure their commitment and effective participation in the program implementation
process. Measures related to the capital market and the mortgage sectors were implemented by
the regulatory authorities, the CMA and the MFA respectively, under the overall supervision of
the Ministry of Investment.


2.4.    Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any)

The government's achievements under DPL I are sufficiently encouraging for the Bank to prepare
a follow-up operation in response to the government's request of December 2, 2006. In this
context, the second DPL of US$500 million would support the authorities' implementation and
partial funding of the costs of the second phase of the reform program. Reforms envisioned
include strengthening the domestic banking system inter-alia by further reducing public
ownership through divesting public sector in joint venture banks, continuing the institutional,
operational, and financial restructuring of the state-owned banks, settling the remaining non-
performing loans (NPLs) of the state enterprises and the private sector, encouraging further
consolidation and merger of small and weak private banks through stronger capital requirements,
and adequate provisioning.

Phase II of the reform program would also include a comprehensive agenda for the development
of non-bank financial institutions and securities markets, with the objective of building a more
diversified and balanced financial system, capable of providing the broader range of financial
services to a wide range of clients while managing risks effectively. This would include the


                                                 8

restructuring and privatization of the insurance industry, the promotion of investment and pension
funds, the strengthening of securities regulation, and improvements of the institutional
infrastructure for the financial sector, focusing on information infrastructure (credit bureau, and
credit registry), payments system, and the establishment of specialized commercial courts.

The follow up DPLis expected to be presented to the Bank's Board by May 2008.


3.       Assessment of Outcomes


3.1.     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The DPL objectives were to "The main development objective of the government financial sector
reform program, and of the proposed World Bank operation, is to build a more resilient and
competitive financial sector with a sound banking system and insurance industry that could
contribute better, in the medium-term, to the provision of modern and effective financial
services" (DPL PAD, para.39). These objectives were adopted considering that the country had
undertaken important measures to build a more resilient and competitive banking system, through
consolidation and reduction of public ownership. Numerous foreign banks entered the market
which enhances competition. The merger of the three state-owned insurance companies led to the
evolvement of a stronger and better performing company. However, credit to GDP declined in
this period of reform--from 68 percent in 2003 to 52 percent in 2006, as banks contained lending
and increased their holdings of government securities, but this is a typical development in a
period of large-scale restructuring and privatization. This ratio is expected to recover, as the
reforms implemented under DPL and those to be supported under the forthcoming DPL II, as well
those related to improving the investment climate, encourage private investment and a more
competitive financial system to finance it.

The design of the DPL was highly aligned with the country's priorities and CAS.

They continue to be relevant at ICR preparation as;
          The 2005 CAS's first strategic objective was to "strengthen the capacity of the
             financial system to facilitate private sector development".
          The DPL fits well within the mandate given to the new cabinet to reduce poverty and
             improve living standards.
          Financial sector reforms are demonstrably linked to growth and poverty reduction.
             They are fundamental to reforms in other sectors, including private sector
             development, infrastructure, housing and social policies.
          Strengthening financial infrastructure acts as a steady promoter of growth and
             reduces the frequency and cost of financial crises.
          Preventionoffinancialcrisesisessentialtopovertyreduction.
          The DPL objectives remain those that will be pursued under the forthcoming
             DPL II; this was foreseen at the start of the design of the DPL in 2004 as
             building a competitive financial system is a medium term endeavor which
             needs years of reforms and implementation to fulfill the objectives fully.

Thus, the relevance of objectives, design and implementation is considered satisfactory,
based on: (i) the consistency of the program with government and Bank priorities; (ii) quality of
the design, with a clear focus in the resolution of the deleterious problem of NPLs and
strengthening of the legal, regulatory and supervisory capacity of the banking and insurance



                                                   9

sectors; and (iii) adequate implementation, that resulted in increased sustainability of supported
reforms as evidenced by the continuation of the reform program which will be supported by
another DPL; by increased private sector interest in Egypt (FDI doubled to US$6 billion between
2003-2004 and 2005-06 and again to US$11 billion in 2006-07) suggesting favorable market
perceptions about Egypt's overall macroeconomic and structural reform program, including the
financial sector reform program.


3.2.     Achievement of Program Development Objectives


Achievement of Development Program Objectives is considered satisfactory

Key achievements in the banking sector that are the direct result of the reforms implemented
under the DPL included: (i) preparation of the fourth largest state-owned bank, Bank of
Alexandria, for privatization and selection of an international sales advisor; (ii) divestiture of state
bank shares in 13 of the 17 joint venture banks; (iii) consolidation of the banking sector--the
enforcement of stricter prudential rules resulted in the exit of small and weak banks through a
series of mergers, and acquisitions, and reduced the overall number of banks from 57 in 2004 to
40 in 2007; (iv) completion of independent financial due diligence of all state-owned commercial
banks in line with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), showing the extent of the
poor quality of the state-owned commercial bank portfolio; (v) development of a strategy for the
resolution of NPLs of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) vis-à-vis state-owned commercial banks,
with defined resources from privatization proceeds; (vi) settlement of more than 30 percent of
NPLs of SOEs,2 and settlement of 46 percent of the non-SOE's NPLs in state-owned banks with
total collection accounting for 12 percent of those NPLs; (vii) inception of the operational
restructuring of the state-owned commercial banks in three critical areas (human resource
development, risk management, and information technology); and (viii) adoption of a detailed
program for capacity building in banking regulation and supervision.

On the divestiture of state-owned bank shares in joint venture banks only 13 out of the 17 joint
venture banks have been sold.3 However these 13 banks included the four largest, and accounted
for 94 percent of the total market value of state-owned banks ownership in joint venture banks,
and for more than 22 percent of deposit market share. It is worth noting that in three of the
remaining joint venture banks the state-owned banks have negligible share holdings, namely,
Egyptian Saudi Finance Bank (5.3 percent), Egyptian Workers Bank (9.8 percent), and Cairo
BNPP (4.8 percent). State-owned banks holding in the fourth bank namely the Export
Development Bank of Egypt amounts to 34.5 percent yet its divesture would require amendments




2 In this context, all of Bank of Alexandria public enterprise NPLs, in an amount of US$ 1.2 billion
equivalent were settled in cash in February 2006.
3State-owned banks shares in joint venture banks were sold to private interests in 13 banks, namely: the
Egyptian American Bank (33.8 percent public ownership), National Société Générale Bank (18.7 percent),
Cairo Barclays Bank (40 percent), Misr America International Bank (48.9 percent), Misr Romania Bank
(33.3 percent), Egyptian Commercial Bank (9.8 percent), Suez Canal Bank (5 percent), Misr International
Bank (25.9 percent), Commercial International Bank (CIB) (18.9 percent), Misr Iran Development Bank
(30 percent), Delta International Bank (10.2 percent), Cairo Far East Bank (19.6 percent), and Alexandria
Commercial & Maritime Bank (5 percent). The sale process is underway in the remaining 4 joint-venture
banks, namely: Egyptian Saudi Finance Bank (5.3 percent), Egyptian Workers Bank (9.8 percent), Cairo
BNP Paribas Bank (4.8 percent), and Export Development Bank of Egypt (34.5 percent).

to its by laws that is taking some time4, the Banking Reform Unit at CBE is currently working on
the divestiture of those four remaining joint venture banks.

Main achievements in the non-banking sector that are the direct result of the reforms
implemented under DPL included: (i) initial progress in restructuring the state-owned insurance
companies. The authorities are working on developing restructuring and privatization plans for
the insurance companies with the support of BNPP--the consortium leader. The process has
been facilitated by the establishment of the Insurance Holding Company in July 15, 2006 by
Presidential Decree 246 of 2006, and the appointment of its chairman and board in September 6,
2006; (ii) preparation of a development plan to enhance the supervisory capacity of insurance and
private pensions in transition to a risk-based supervisory regime at the EISA with funding from
USAID, as a result of which the capacity of the insurance and private pension supervisor has been
strengthened, and is in transition to a market based system incorporating a risk-based supervisory
regime; (iii) excellent progress was made in the Motor Third party Liability (MTPL) reforms
through the endorsement of a time-bound MTPL reform strategy by the Cabinet in December
2006, the establishment of a MTPL working committee, and actuarial assessments have been
carried out by Milliman; (iv) the Insurance Law 10 of 1981 was reviewed to suit a market-based
rather than a state-owned sector, and new draft law was prepared and reviewed by the Bank
team.; and (v) Stamp Law of 2006, with stamp duty dropping overall by 50 percent and being
removed altogether for life insurance--one of the key recommendations put forward by the 2002
FSAP. Inter ministerial agreement has been reached on increasing MTPL premium rates by
decree.


Progress has been evident regarding strengthening the insurance and private pension
supervisory capacity. Capacity building at EISA is underway, and it initiated the Supervisory
Development Plan (SDP), which has progressed well. EISA completed a Supervision Manual and
a Letter of Intervention, and has also conducted a supervision test of their risk based supervision
model at AIG and Allianz--two foreign insurance companies operating in Egypt and worldwide,
with well established experience in the risk based approach to supervision. The Insurance
Holding Company (IHC) has been established and a Chairman has been appointed, which has
enabled EISA to focus on regulatory and supervisory reform. EISA has put in place a new IT
environment that will ultimately establish online connection with the insurance companies it
supervises and regulates so as to minimize reaction time.

Notable progress has been made in the SDP. SDP has been updated and improved. The
implementation team has been formed (with support from USAID funded project). Stamp
duty reduction amendment issued and implemented in July 2006 (reduced by 50 percent from
20 percent to 10 percent for general insurance). For life insurance the duty was reduced from 4
percent to 1 percent for the company share and from 3 percent to 0 percent for the policyholder.
In addition, the law concerning MPTL was passed in June 2007 and an executive regulation was
issued in August 2007. Rates on MPTL were increased and a new rate list was issued and was
effective as of September 2007. These new measures will take the MPTL business to a break-
even situation. There will an annual rate review based on the technical results.


Non own use real estate of state-owned insurers has been transferred to a specialist assets
management company under the holding company, and the liquidation program has begun.
Misr Real Estate Asset Management (MREAM) was established in February 2007 and held

4Selling state-owned banks shares in the Export Development Bank would require an amendment of its
bylaw, to be approved and decreed by parliament as the law governing its establishment was enacted by
parliament and stipulates state-ownership of 75 percent.



                                                    11

its first General assembly in July 2007. The Board of Directors has been formed and the
company's bylaws have been approved. The general assembly of each State-owned Insurer
(SOI) met on November 13, 2007 and approved the full transfer of real estate from the SOIs
to MREAM. MREAM is currently working to liquidate assets according to a predetermined
time frame.


On the insurance sector, although major progress has been made in identifying the financial
status of the MTPL system and underlying causes of deficiencies, amending MTPL law was
delayed. While all the relevant Ministers accept the urgent need for MTPL reform, the quantum
of any price increased needed to put the system back into balance (up to 6 times current prices)
raises serious transition issues, including the likelihood that permanent cross subsidies will be
required and that price increases will have to be phased in over a number of years. In addition,
there is not universal agreement that unlimited cover should be removed. During supervision the
Bank provided considerable background on coverage and premium setting systems in other
countries, and in particular pointed to an international trend to require minimum rather than
unlimited coverage for both physical damage and injury claims.

Although a number of achievements in the insurance sector have been made, some
intermediate outcomes in DPL are still behind schedule. A draft Corporate Brokers Law was
prepared but given that it needed strengthening, it was agreed with the Bank that it would be
reviewed for further amendments before it is presented to the Parliament. EISA is reviewing
Insurance law 10 of 1981 to this effect. The amendments will also include an increase in
minimum capital for insurance companies from LE 30 million to LE 100 million. Ministry of
Investment expects to submit this law to Parliament during December 2007 ­January 2008.

On strengthening the Fiduciary Framework for Public Financial Management and Corporate
Financial Reporting, achievements directly related to DPL, include: (i) strengthening the public
financial management--with better controls over revenues and expenditures and availability of
aggregated financial information. The Ministry of Finance established a single treasury account,
which addressed the issue of cash management through the issuance of Law 139 of 2006. This
will lead to better cash management, which has implications for enhanced controls over
expenditures. In addition, Egypt has strengthened the framework aiming at enhancing corporate
financial reporting--with better compliance with international standards and codes. An action
plan was developed and agreed on with the Ministry of Investment and the CMA to enhance
corporate financial reporting; and on July 2006, a Ministerial Decree was issued to adopt,
effective January 2007, translated International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Finally, while in some cases the impact of the actions taken might take time to be felt, in others it
is clear that actions supported by the DPL resulted in appreciable improvements as shown by the
medium term outcome indicators.

     State control of the banking sector was reduced as indicated by the share of the banking
         system deposit under state control or influence which declined from 65 percent in 2004 to
         51 percent in June 2007. This was due to the privatization of Bank of Alexandria, the
         fourth largest state-owned commercial bank, and the divestiture of the state-owned banks
         shares in 13 of the joint venture banks.
     The stock of NPLs by state-owned enterprises at the state-owned commercial banks was
         curtailed by over 60 percent falling from L.E 26 billion to L.E. 10 billion. The stock of
         private sector NPLs was also significantly reduced through the work out unit created at
         the state-owned banks with a recovery rate of 22 percent, of which 85 percent in cash.




                                                 12

     Provisioning of state-owned banks was improved as shown in the ratio of provisions to
         NPLs which increased from 42 percent and 32 percent in 2005 for National Bank of
         Egypt and Bank Misr respectively to 55.9 percent and 57.6 percent in 2006.
     The increase in capital requirements and stricter compliance enforcement rules have led
         to a vast consolidation in the banking sector that led to a fall in the number of banks
         operating in the sector from 57 in June 2004 to 40 in June 2007.


3.3.     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating for DPL is "satisfactory". Planned reforms were implemented, some
(such as the privatization of Bank of Alexandria) ahead of time and are achieving their key
objectives of restoring soundness in the banking sector. Significant institutional and operational
strengthening has been carried out in the state-owned commercial banks and insurance
companies. While the government is pursuing its reform agenda, the impact of the measures taken
under DPL is perceptible: (i) state control in the banking sector has been appreciably reduced
through privatization and divestiture; (ii) the supervisory and regulatory framework is more
robust than it was before the reforms were launched; (iii) the large stock of NPLs has been
significantly reduced and provisioning boosted resulting in sounder state-banks balance sheets;
(iv) state-owned banks are undergoing a comprehensive restructuring that will enhance their
operations and profitability, will enable them to operate as pure commercial entities, and will
reduce drastically the likelihood of future claims on the government budget; and (v) new laws
have been introduced and others amended to remove significant constraints on the development
of the insurance sector (Stamp Duty Law and MTPL Law).


3.4.     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts and Social Development

Though the DPL did not have explicit social development outcomes as objectives, clearly the
shift from public to a more market-oriented financial system is expected to have a direct and
positive impact on growth, employment, and crisis prevention, while also increasing access of
various social groups, including the poor to financial services. The privatized Bank of Alexandria
has already increased its outreach in rural areas through mobile banking services outputs,
increased ATMs, and is moving into the SME finance market.

Restoring the soundness of the state-owned insurance companies and increased competition in the
sector will enable the industry to provide better quality products at a more reasonable cost. This
combined with the sharp reduction in stamp duty levied on insurance premia will lower the cost
of insurance for Egyptians and ease access to insurance in a country where penetration is very
low. The measures aimed at addressing the soundness of the private pension funds and
strengthening of the supervisory function of the pension system will ensure that the interest of
retirees are protected in the future and that their savings are well managed.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The DPL had, and will continue to have, a substantial institutional development impact in the
financial sector even though it was a single-tranche project. The policies supported by the
program are fast transforming the Egyptian financial sector. Substantial capacity building
provided to CBE, and EISA are modernizing these institutions while introducing state of the art
risk management tools and IT systems and will lead to the emergence of a robust supervisory and



                                                   13

regulatory capacity in the country.

The comprehensive operational and institutional restructuring of the two largest state-owned
commercial banks is modernizing these banks and enhancing their operating environment thereby
contributing to enhancing their capacity to increase intermediation and improve savings
mobilization. Substantial staff training sector wide, in and outside Egypt, will have a long lasting
impact and will develop a pool of financial skills hitherto not readily available in Egypt thereby
contributing to the sustainability of the reforms.

    Not applicable

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low to Negligible

The risks to development outcomes which were well identified at appraisal remain low to
negligible. Three sources of risks were identified at that point: (i) political feasibility and
macroeconomic framework; (ii) building credible and independent regulators; and (iii) state
banks reverting to old lax management practices after recapitalization. After closing the
operation, the risk to the Development Outcome is considered Negligible to Low since the
mitigating measures envisaged in the Program Document are still in place.

        (i) Political feasibility and macroeconomic framework: Nearly two years after appraisal,
        commitment of the government towards the reform program continues to be strong and
        focused on implementation as evidenced by their request for a second operation to support
        the second phase of reforms. In addition, despite some criticism of the privatization of
        Bank of Alexandria by the media, most agree that the privatization was a success, brought
        in more revenues than expected, with the privatized bank leading change in modernizing
        access to financial services. The labor layoffs were also well managed through the
        implementation of early and retirement programs.

        (ii)  Building credible and independent regulatory authorities.        The credibility and
        independence of the regulator is the base upon which a resilient financial system may
        emerge and prosper. This risk relates to the authorities' ability, within the program
        timeframe, to build the capacity and implement the strengthened regulatory and
        supervisory framework. These risks are being adequately managed through the strong
        donor driven capacity building initiatives discussed earlier and the Government's
        commitment to continuing to benefit from ECB's existing technical assistance. The
        protocol agreement for a two year technical assistance program will end in December
        2007. ECB was asked to submit a draft report on a successor assistance program to be
        discussed between CBE, EU and Ministry of International Cooperation in Egypt.

        (iii) Recapitalization without privatization is considered a serious risk for fiscal waste at
        best, such unconditional financial support may provide bank management with the wrong
        signal to pursue their past and costly lending practices. To reduce such a risk, the
        Government is still committed to proceed with the recapitalization of these banks only



                                                 14

        upon the satisfactory implementation of their operational and restructuring plan. Full
        compliance is being closely monitored by CBE (acting on the owner's behalf) and the
        Bank.


5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance


5.1.    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

Bank performance is rated as highly satisfactory at entry. The project team paid particular
attention to ensuring high quality at entry for this operation. The Loan identification and design
were consistent with the CAS, and the recommendations put forward by the 2002 FSAP. In terms
of design, a single-tranche operation was chosen to support the government in implementing
Phase I of the Financial Sector Reform Program. This ensures comprehensive completion of all
reform measures envisioned at the first phase. Main components of the operation were developed
from the recommendations of 2002 FSAP.

     The Bank was instrumental in taking full advantage of a window of opportunity
        presented by the reformist government that led to this major progress on financial sector
        reforms outcomes.

     Sound preparatory and analytical work, strong policy dialogue and good working
        relationships with government counterparts, high level of consultation with market
        participants, and Bank expertise led to the design of an operation which took into account
        the need to build regulatory capacity, and manage the key risks (political, social, fiscal,
        and governance) that could derail implementation.

     Close coordination with the active donors in the financial sector work, namely USAID,
        the EU, AfDB and the IMF to help the government build the necessary capacity to
        implement the program.

     The Bank set a clear results based framework which included reaching an irreversibility
        step in the privatization process of the Bank of Alexandria, and agreeing to subjecting
        recapitalization of restructured state owned banks to implementation of the financial,
        institutional, and operational plans before taking the operation to the Board.

     The insurance sector witnessed significant reforms through the adoption of a
        comprehensive restructuring strategy for the insurance sector, the establishment of the
        Insurance Holding Company, the issuance of the Stamp Duty Law and MTPL Law.

In addition, the Bank rightly identified the principal risks to which the financial sector was
exposed and ensured that the FS DPL Program would address those risks which were related to
the most vulnerable areas of the financial sector, the banking and insurance sectors.


(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Bank supervisory performance is rated as satisfactory. The Bank conducted two supervision
missions, in addition to the regular monitoring of the progress in the field. The policy dialogue
continued with official counterparts on both the implementation of the reforms under DPL but
also on new areas of reforms which the government wanted to seek advice on. Period monitoring



                                                 15

of the implementation of the reform program and the operation was done regularly from the field
by the task manager, in addition to the periodic supervision missions. These missions provided
sound technical advice to the authorities. For example, the team was strengthened with experts
that provided substantive comments and input in the drafting of some laws and amendments to
existing ones before their presentation to parliament. The missions followed up on progress on
the agreed monitoring indicators and discussed results with the Ministry of Investment and CBE
as well as other counterparts in the sector. These supervision missions had their terms of
reference extended to the preparation of the follow up operation DPL II.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The rating of satisfactory is based on the following considerations: (i) the project was very well
designed, its PDO was in line with the CAS and the Bank's priorities, the intermediate indicators
were relevant, helped focus the supervision, and helped inform the design of the second stage of
reforms; (ii) the Bank was aware of the challenges involved in seeking the reduction of the state's
ownership of financial sector assets and addressing the restructuring of major financial
institutions so it adopted a flexible results based framework and a risk mitigating strategy, in
consultation with the authorities, who remained committed to the implementing the reforms; (iii)
from identification to closing, the team was extensively involved in a policy dialogue with the
authorities and independent counterparts, collaborating to ensure that the ultimate goal of this
operation - to assist Egypt in strengthening the enabling environment for financial intermediation,
resource mobilization and risk management, and increasing private sector role and participation
in the provision of financial services- would be achieved; and; (iv) the project team and the
country office developed an optimal level of cooperation that played a key role in the success of
the operation.

The combination of clear and focused policy actions supported in PL with sustained
dialogue before and after the loan was approved and disbursed, during supervision and
preparation of other operations, resulted in a constructive interaction with counterparts,
strengthening sustainability of the policies supported by DPL in the process.

QAG rated the DPL satisfactory (2) overall. Strategic, relevance and approach was rated as
highlight satisfactory (1). QAG Panel praised the "sound preparatory work, drawing effectively
on prior studies, and the country team's good working relationships with government counterparts
and linkages to other donors enabled the Bank to take advantage of a window of opportunity for
progress on financial reform." It also acknowledged that the work was fully in line with the
recommendations of the 2002 FSAP and the current CAS (approved in 2005). The Bank chose to
work on banking sector reform, given its experience in this field. QAG congratulated the Bank
Team for its ability to take full advantage of a window of opportunity presented by a reformist
government and on actually being associated with a concrete result.


5.2.     Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

From the design to implementation stage, the government was in the "driver seat" seeking advice
from the Bank where needed to implement its strategic reform agenda. The authorities remained
focused on the success of the Development Objective as they saw its importance in fulfilling
ultimately through the financing of a private sector let investment strategy, their growth and



                                                 16

improvement of Egyptians living standards. In this context, the Government took the initiative to
seek support from other donors according to their respective comparative advantage, and was
keen on ensuring good coordination between the various partners. The decision to request the
Bank to play a lead role succeeded in getting the best out of each donor's support and avoided
waste that comes from unclear donors mandate and overlap. The donors coordinating committee,
chaired by the Bank, also helped the Government address key financial sector issues on a timely
and priority basis.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Implementing agencies

Ministry of Investment (MOI)                Satisfactory
Central bank of Egypt (CBE)                 Satisfactory

The Ministry of Investment and CBE are the two agencies responsible for the design and overall
implementation of the operation. The Minister of Investment and the Governor of CBE, his two
deputies, and the CBE Banking Reform Unit staff in charge of the implementation of the reforms,
were instrumental to the success of this operation. They were systematic in the way they went
about the design of the blueprint for the reforms, and seeking advice from the Bank and other
donors, at judicial junctures to keep the implementation moving and get support and advice when
they encountered major challenges. The reporting and coordination of actions between the
concerned agencies was efficient and timely throughout the life of the project resulting in a
successful operation that went far beyond compliance with identified intermediate outcomes as
one can see during the follow on operation that is under preparation. Their availability and
knowledge of all the program benchmarks allowed for a timely presentation to the Board of the
operation and for an effective implementation of the FSDPL reform agenda before project
closing.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The rating of satisfactory is justified by the following:

     The GOE demonstrated a clear ownership of the project. The respective responsibilities of
        the MOI and the CBE where clearly defined reducing to a minimum the opportunities for
        overlapping or misunderstanding.

     The reform program reflected a clear and complete vision of needs of the financial sector.
        It was complete, comprehensive, articulated around the most important issues and
        sequenced according to priorities.

     The GOE was very instrumental in keeping the momentum of the financial reform agenda
        and the operation alive. This was no small task given the comprehensiveness of the reform
        and the scope of the project.


6.      Lessons Learned

(i)     Prior Analytical work (FSAP), strong commitment to reform from the government,
support from development partners through policy dialogue and technical assistance,
synergies between donors, and flexibility in implementation of the reforms, are critical to
success.



                                                   17

The 2002 FSAP helped lay a credible blueprint for the design of the DPL, which in turn made
easier the implementation of the reform program, and coordination of donors' assistance around
the realization of this blueprint. The operation was based on the principle of mutual commitment
between the Egyptian authorities and the Bank, a policy compact whereby the Bank commits to
support the reform process in Egypt and the GOE commits to continuing along the reform path
rather than micromanaging the reform process and imposing conditionality that undermines the
credibility of the reformers with their domestic constituency. Trusting reformers who demonstrate
commitment to reform and giving them the necessary flexibility to implement these reforms is
key to success of reforms. Given the multifaceted nature of the financial reform effort, the
contribution of many donors was needed. Since most components of the reform are inter-
connected, the coordination of these efforts becomes critical. The Bank team made an excellent
decision, given its experience, to focus its dialogue and assistance to addressing the restructuring
of the banking and insurance sectors, the EU and ECB to work on the supervision and regulatory
framework, the USAID to provide assistance in mortgage finance and the regulatory environment
for the insurance sector, the IMF to focus on exchange rate and monetary policy management,
and the AfDB to join the overall effort through co-financing. Strong communications between
the World Bank team, the Government, and these donors helped cement a solid partnership based
on comparative advantage.

This best practice partnership framework is among the key success factors of this operation.
Indeed, the respective responsibilities were clearly defined, including giving the authorities the
flexibility needed to implement the reforms. Since the Egyptian government had a clear vision of
what needed to be accomplished, cooperation and coordination of support were the best approach
rather than constant "hand holding" and double guessing of the authorities' intent. The success of
the operation required the right balance between flexibility in the implementation and pro-activity
in providing technical assistance and guidance where needed. In this respect, the approach
followed under this DPL can be considered best practice and one that may benefit other
operations outside Egypt.


(ii)     Consultation and effective communication strategy with the stakeholders can
mitigate opposition to the reforms

Reforms have been undertaken after a process of close and continuous consultation with all
stakeholders. This participative process with wider involvement not only encouraged a more
informed evaluation of underlying content of policies but also enhanced the credibility of policies
and generated expectations that the reform process will be sustained. Reasons advanced for the
inability to fully implement the financial sector reform measures in the past did include the lack
of public support for the measures, and the need for strengthening public sector banks prior to
their privatization.


(iii)    The design of the operation as a single tranche DPL proved to be a suitable
instrument for the Borrower and the Bank

The one-tranche operation, as opposed to a programmatic loan, aiming at the first phase of the
Financial Sector Reform Program was effective. It responded effectively to the needs of the
authorities by providing them timely support based on clearly established prior actions. It
provides quicker feedback and momentum to the reforms that enables follow up and making early
adjustments if necessary. It allows continuity in the dialogue with the authorities. Single tranche
operations define benchmarks based on information available at the time of implementation and
not on some future developments which might not materialize. Moreover, the well defined policy
matrix owned by the government and endorsed by the Bank and partners is an essential
implementation roadmap for the authorities to move the agenda forward.

7.       Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners


(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

The Egyptian government praised the Bank's operation in supporting the government in
implementing its ambitious Financial Sector Reform Program, which entails strengthening the
institutional framework and the overall environment for better financial intermediation; resource
mobilization and risk management; and increasing the role of the private sector. Regarding
borrower's performance, the operation witnessed a series of reform measures that aimed at
developing a sound financial sector, such as, the reduction in NPLs, the consolidation of the
banking sector, and the divestiture of public shares in joint venture banks. The government also
acclaimed the team's remarkable deal of diligence and technical support throughout the
operation, in addition to the close coordination and dialogue (see Annex 2).


(b) Donors and Cofinanciers

Donors that are actively involved in the financial sector work, include, USAID, EC, and AfDB
have commended the World Bank's financial sector work, and especially the DPL. Various
donors and international institutions have been providing support for the implementation of the
government's Financial Sector Reform Program through the provision of technical assistance, and
analytical work on reforming and restructuring the financial sector. This required effective
coordination, which the Bank took leadership in. A Financial Sector Donors Subgroup, chaired
by the World Bank was formed in mid 2005, to coordinate efforts related to both technical and
financial support provided to the government and to ensure that borrowed funds are used in the
most effective manner. This cooperation led to mutual design and agreement of conditionality
issues that all donors agreed were essential for financial sector reform. In addition, donors were
able to do a much better job of leveraging resources, both loan and technical assistance, when
coordination is effective.


(c) Other partners and stakeholders

Stakeholders commended the operation and its positive impact on enhancing competition and
shaping a more sound financial sector in Egypt. Private banks indicated that the Bank's operation
ensured timely and adequate implementation of the Financial Sector Reform Program. Both local
and foreign banks greatly appreciated the consultations that were conducted during the design of
the operation. State-owned banks and state-owned insurers in particular praised the Bank for
reviewing draft Terms of References for the undertaking of Comprehensive Independent Audit of
State-owned Commercial Bank; Institutional and Operational Strengthening of State-owned
Commercial Bank; and Restructuring and Privatization of State-owned Insurers. These Terms of
References helped in guiding financial institutions in the implementation of the restructuring
programs.

Introduction:
With the appointment of a new cabinet in July 2004, the Egyptian Government has embarked on
a comprehensive program of macroeconomic and structural reforms. A key pillar of this
comprehensive effort is the "Financial Sector Reform Program (2005-2008)".This program aims
at creating a sound and diversified financial sector, capable of contributing to Egypt's growth
performance and providing access to financial services to a much broader segment of the
Egyptian population. The main components of this program include the empowerment of the
private sector in the provision of financial services, the development of effective bank and non-
bank institutions providing a wide range of financial services, and the strengthening of financial
infrastructure and the regulatory and supervisory framework. This entails strengthening the
institutional framework and the overall environment for better financial intermediation, resource
mobilization and risk management.

The World Bank's Financial Sector Policy Loan (I) was effected to evidence the continuing
support to the Egyptian Government's economic reform efforts.

I. Assessment of the operation's objectives, design, implementation, and operational
    experience:
    The operation's objective targeted at supporting the government in the implementation of the
    first phase of its ambitious financial reform program. The program pillars called for:
    ·    Reforming the Banking Sector
    ·    Restructuring the Insurance Sector
    ·    Deepening the Capital Market
    ·    Developing a well-functioning Mortgage Market
    ·    Activating other Financial Services

    The operation's design and implementation was agreed to be as a single disbursement of the
    full amount of the loan amounting to US$500 million. This came into effect in view of a
    series of reform efforts that have been concluded, including:
      (i)    Completion of state-owned bank financial due diligence by independent auditors in
               accordance with international financial reporting standards (IFRS).




                                                 21

     (ii)     Adoption of a viable, time-bound, operational scheme, for the settlement of non-
              performing loans owed by public enterprises to state-owned banks.

     (iii)    Agreement on a framework for institutional and operational restructuring of the
              remaining two state-owned commercial banks (National Bank of Egypt, and
              Banque Misr-Banque du Caire).
     (iv)     Appointment of an international investment bank to advise on, and help implement,
              the proposed merger of Banque Misr and Banque du Caire.
     (v)      Continued progress in the program of divestiture of state-owned bank shareholding
              in joint-venture banks as reflected in the sale of public sector shares in twelve joint-
              venture banks.
     (vi)     Process of privatization of Bank of Alexandria, through the sale of 75% to 80% of
              the bank to a strategic investor, is on track, the bank having been brought to the
              point of sale as signified by the receipt of non-biding indicative bids from qualified
              potential buyers.
     (vii)    Adoption by the Governor of the CBE, and start of implementation, of a detailed
              program for capacity building in banking regulation and supervision.

     (viii)   Adoption by the Chairman of EISA and start of implementation of the development
              plan to enhance the supervisory capacity of insurance and private pensions in
              transition to a risk based supervisory regime.

       (ix) Submission by the Minister of Investment to the Prime Minister of draft insurance
              sector reform laws regulating stamp duties on insurance premia, brokers, and motor
              third party liability.
       (x)    Appointment of an investment bank to advise on the restructuring and privatization
              of the insurance sector, and to conduct the requisite due diligence process.
       (xi) Preparation by the steering committee for the insurance sector of a detailed
              proposal to set up a state-owned insurer holding company.

II. Assessment of the outcome of the operation against the agreed objectives:
   The loan objectives were satisfactorily met as reflected by the strengthening of the
   institutional framework, the overall improvement of financial intermediation, resource
   mobilization and risk management, and the increasing private sector role and participation in
   the provision of financial services to support real economic growth.

   These developments are further confirmed by the up surge in the financial sector's growth
   from 5.3% in FY 2005/2006 to stand at 7% in FY 2006/2007which in turn lead to an
   impressive improvement in growth performance, as indicated by the GDP growth rate of
   7.1% during fiscal year 2006/2007. Specific economic policies and reforms included:
   ·   On the monetary side, the initiation of a dollar inter-bank system together with
          preparations for an inflation targeting mechanism that have stabilized the foreign
          exchange market and contributed to a significant increase in international reserves to
          USD 31.5 billion by end of November 2007.
   ·   Trade reforms that have lowered average tariff rates and reduced the number of tariff
          bands during September 2004 and 2005, complemented by the setting up of qualified
          industrial zones and a free trade agreement with Turkey and Russia. These measures
          have contributed to an impressive growth of exports, from USD 10.4 billion in
          2002/2003 to USD 22 billion in 2006/2007.
   ·   Fiscal reforms that entailed cutting corporate and personal income tax rates by almost
          50% in June 2005 and reducing tax holidays. This resulted in the expansion of the tax


                                                 22

          base from 1.2 million people to 2.4 million in the first year and 3.1 million in the
          second year, resulting in an increase in tax revenues by 17% in the first year, and 40%
          in the second year. These measures were accompanied by further restructuring of the
          government budget and reductions of the energy subsidies through revisions in the
          prices of diesel and other fuel prices in July 2006, contributing to the reduction of the
          budget deficit from 8.2 % of GDP in 2005/2006 to 7.5% of GDP in 2006/2007.
    ·   Legal and regulatory reforms to streamline investment procedures, accompanied by a new
          management of the General Authority of Investment and Free Zones. These measures
          contributed to the doubling of private investment figures in 2006/2007 to L.E. 96
          billion, or the equivalent of 14% of GDP. Foreign direct investment also increased
          substantially from 6.5% of GDP in 2005/2006 to 9% of GDP in 2006/2007.

III. Evaluation     of    the borrower's own performance during the preparation and
    implementation of the operation, with special emphasis on lessons learned that may be
    helpful in the future:
    The operation witnessed a series of reform measures that focused on developing a sound
    financial sector. The majority of the concluded reforms were thoroughly discussed with the
    World Bank on various occasions. Moreover, they mostly converge with the FSAP 2002
    recommendations.

    The banking sector reform efforts included an ambitious plan for privatization and
    consolidation of the sector. Through a series of acquisitions, mergers, and revoking of
    licenses of non-compliant banks, the number of banks and branches of foreign banks was
    reduced from 57 in 2004 to 40 in June 2007. The privatization program was very successful
    and progressed ahead of schedule with more than 94% of the total portfolio of Joint Venture
    holdings divested by early 2006, including the four largest holdings namely, NSGB, MIBank,
    EAB and CIB. This was coupled with the Government of Egypt successful privatization of
    one of the four state-owned commercial banks, namely Bank of Alexandria (BoA) through a
    strategic sale of an 80% stake to the Italian banking group San Paolo (which later merged
    with Intesa to form Intesa San Paolo) in October 2006. These divesture transactions are
    expected to bring enhanced management practices, new technologies, and additional capital
    to the financial system through higher levels of strategic private participation.

    The SOE's NPLs'problem was also addressed through a clear timelined strategy that was set
    for full settlement of SOE's outstanding NPLs to public banks. The settlement process should
    be completed, as stated in the Government's Development Policy Letter, within the 2005­
    2008 time frame of the `Financial Sector Reform Program'. The allocation of sales proceeds
    of Bank of Alexandria (LE 9.1 billion) was paid in cash by the Ministry of Finance in
    December 2006 partially settling SOE's NPLs owed to NBE, Bank Misr and Banque du
    Caire. Accordingly, the outstanding SOEs' NPLs declined from LE 26 billion in June 2005
    to LE 10 billion in February 2007 (reduction of around 50 percent). The remaining
    outstanding is to be fully settled by the end of 2008.

    The operational and institutional restructuring of the two commercial state owned banks
    (NBE and Banque Misr) through an in depth capacity building program is being implemented
    and is on track.

    The capital market has grown significantly, as indicated by the increase in equity market
    capitalization from about 40% of GDP in 2004 to more than 90% of GDP recently, as well as
    the sharp increase in the turnover ratio from 20% to 50% in the same period. The retail
    investor base has also expanded significantly, due primarily to large public IPOs, and today


                                                 23

   more than 1.5 million Egyptians own shares of listed companies. We are encouraged by
   these indicators, although we are also aware that much remains to be done to build a solid and
   diversified capital market.
   Moreover, the housing finance market witnessed significant progress in various fronts
   relating to registration fees, efficiency of procedures for land registration, property valuation,
   access to long-term credit and cost of funding. Five mortgage finance companies in addition
   to more than 10 banks now operate in the market and around EGP 1.9 billion have been
   extended as mortgage finance loans as at September 2007.

IV. Evaluation of the performance of the Bank, any co-financiers, or of other partners
   during the preparation and implementation of the operation, including the effectiveness
   of their relationships, with special emphasis on lessons learned:
   The World Bank's performance during the operation was on the overall highly satisfactory.
   The operation witnessed a close coordination and communication with the relevant bank
   officials, and a special acknowledgment should be given to the efforts of the field team,
   especially the Task Team Leader during the preparation and supervision.

   The team showed a remarkable deal of diligence and technical support for the responsible
   authorities through out the operation. The presence of the TTL on the ground during
   supervision provided effective communication and ensured all required and expected
   intermediate outcomes where duly met.

   The World Bank also conducted a close coordination efforts with other donors who are
   actively involved in the financial sector reform including the EU, USAID and African
   Development Bank (AfDB). These efforts have contributed to the smooth availing of US$
   500 million as a parallel financing from the AFDB to this operation.

V. Description of the proposed arrangements for future operation of the project:
   As a result of the successful cooperation with the World Bank in the preparation for and
   disbursement of DPL I, the Egyptian Government is keen on further cooperation with the
   World Bank on the second phase of its Financial Sector Reform Program.

            Annex 3: Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Donors that are actively involved in the financial sector work, include, USAID, EC, and AfDB
have commended the World Bank's financial sector work, and especially the DPL. Various
donors and international institutions have been providing support for the implementation of the
government's Financial Sector Reform Program through the provision of technical assistance, and
analytical work on reforming and restructuring the financial sector. This required effective
coordination, which the Bank took leadership in. A Financial Sector Donors Subgroup, chaired
by the World Bank was formed in mid 2005, to coordinate efforts related to both technical and
financial support provided to the government and to ensure that borrowed funds are used in the
most effective manner. This cooperation led to mutual design and agreement of conditionality
issues that all donors agreed were essential for financial sector reform. In addition, donors were
able to do a much better job of leveraging resources, both loan and technical assistance, when
coordination is effective.


Donors have benefited from the analytical work that was undertaken by the Bank, especially the
2002 joint IFM-World Bank FSAP. Most of the recommendations put forward by the FSAP were
used in drafting the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the government of Egypt
and USAID. All major elements required for financial sector reform as identified by the FSAP
were used in drafted the conditionality that appears in the MOU. Moreover, technical assistance
to support the financial sector reforms was jointly discussed, designed and deployed, with USAID
and EC, with an understanding that the different donors would support various activities, but
attempting to promote complimentarily. For example, the audit TOR for public sector banks was
reviewed and endorsed by the WB where USAID is providing funding for audits. The European
Central Bank and the EC funded projects provided technical assistance to CBE banking
supervision, restructuring assistance for NBE and Bank Misr, whereas USAID provided technical
assistance to the CBE in areas such as information technology, as well as to the insurance sector.

From the USAID perspective, the strong relationship with the Bank was unique in that it was
mutually reinforcing.     USAID acknowledges such close cooperation that helped them in
designing assistance strategies to effectively respond to the needs of Egypt. They appreciated the
sharing of information and the close contact to advance in addressing major constraints. This
close working relationship helped to ensure that activities of respective organizations did not
conflict with each other. Both parties had a common objective to support the government of
Egypt's efforts to implement financial sector reforms. It is much easier for USAID to provide
long-term technical assistance rather than long-term finance, whereas the World Bank is well
positioned to address financing issues, a key component to help the authorities implement their
financial sector reforms. Supporting common objectives helped the government in advancing
with its reform agenda. This was really a three-win situation for the World Bank, USAID and
most importantly for the government of Egypt.


AfDB provided parallel financing to the Financial Sector Reform Program, of an equivalent
amount of US$500 million. The AfDB appreciates the Bank's efforts in processing such a large
operation. Their project document was largely based on the Bank's analytical work and the
preparation work that was done. The World Bank and AfDB have conducted joint appraisal
mission, in which the Bank took a leading role in the policy dialogue, and in the identification of
triggers on banking and insurance sector. Overall, donors have commended the Bank's efforts in
moving forward with the implementation of the Financial Sector Reform Program, and in
ensuring synergy in the policy measures supported by the various donors, and effective use of
resources.
