             FOURTHPOVERTYREDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                         PROGRAMSUMMARY


Borrower:          Burkina Faso.

Amount:            SDR40.9 million(US$60 millionequivalent).

Terms:             IDAterms with aforty-year maturity, includinga grace periodoften
                   years.

Description:       The proposed poverty reduction support credit (PRSC-4) is the
                   fourth in a series o f operations supporting the implementation o f the
                   PRSP, in line with the Bank's strategy presented in the 2000 CAS
                   and the 2003 CAS progress report. Consistent with the four strategic
                   pillars of the PRSP-accelerating     broad-based growth, promoting
                   access to social services, increasing employment and income-
                   generating activities for the poor, and promoting good governance-
                   PRSC-4 supports the implementation o f key reforms to accelerate
                   growth and income creation, improve social service delivery, and
                   strengthen budget management and governance. Under the growth
                   and income creation component, the operation supports reforms in
                   the cotton, telecommunication, and energy sectors as well as the
                   labor market to lower factor costs, increase productivity and favor
                   new investments. The second component of the credit includes
                   policies in the education, health, and water sectors to build
                   infrastructure, lower the cost of services, improve service quality,
                   and reinforce monitoring and evaluation. The third component
                   encompasses policy measures to strengthen budget execution,
                   procurement,      budget    control,  public     sector  performance,
                   decentralization, and environmental management.

Benefits:          The proposed credit offers benefits in creating the economic and
                   institutional environment for the sustained implementation o f
                   reforms to accelerate growth, reduce poverty, and improve key social
                   indicators. PRSC-4 underpins the government's objective to
                   maintain a sound macroeconomic environment by providing
                   necessary external resources for the execution of the government's
                   2004 budget. PRSC-4 thereby supports the implementation o f the
                   poverty reduction strategy laid out inthe PRSP and the latest PRSP
                   progress report. The reform program supported by PRSC-4 is
                   expected to help the government in achieving the objectives under
                   the PRSP and make progress toward reachingthe MDGs, namely to
                   lower the incidence of poverty, increase school enrollment and
                   literacy rates, reduce child and maternal mortality, increase access to
                   safe water, and strengthen the sustainability of development efforts.

Risks:             The risks for the operation arise from the country's external
                   vulnerability,   vested interests,   weak     capacity,  the political
                   environment, and, to a more limited extent, fiduciary safeguards.


                                       Vi

                        Burkina Faso's vulnerability to external shocks, notably the
                        fluctuation of export prices, instability in the region, and the lack of
                        predictable aid could undermine macroeconomic stability, hamper
                        the implementation of the budget, and threaten the achievement o f
                        program objectives. Moreover, vested interests could stall reforms
                        aiming at increasing the role of the private sector in the economy,
                        notably in the cotton and energy sectors. Institutional risks for
                        program implementation remain due to               important capacity
                        constraints in conceiving, executing, monitoring, and evaluating
                        government programs. Political risks for program implementation
                        arise from the upcoming presidential elections, which could reduce
                        the capacity and focus ofthe administrationto implement the reform
                        program. Finally, although fiduciary risks have been reduced
                        significantly through reforms under previous PRSCs, some residual
                        risk remains due to the limitedcapacity of ex-post control agencies
                        inverifyingthe applicationof laws and regulations governing public
                        expenditure, especially as regards procurement contracts. The
                        different risks are mitigated under the credit through (i) strong
                                                                                      the
                        track record o f the government in adapting to external shocks
                        through adjustment o f non-priority expenditure and the delivery o f
                        the credit in the first half of the budget year; (ii) embedding of
                                                                              the
                        structural reforms in a medium-term framework and the fact that
                        measures are taken before credit approval, reducing the influence o f
                        vested interests to hold up reforms; (iii)systematic strengthening of
                        the monitoring and evaluation capacity under the credit and

                                       I. INTRODUCTION

1.      The proposed fourth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-4) in an amount of Special
DrawingRights (SDR) 40.9 million, equivalent to US$60 million, is the fourth operation in a series
o fpovertyreductionsupport creditsand grants disbursed annuallysince 2001 As the previousthree
                                                                                  .'
PRSCs, PRSC-4 offers critical financial support for the implementationofthe government'spoverty
reduction strategy outlined in its 2000 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and three annual
PRSP progress reports (PRSP-PR) since then? The proposed credit is a cornerstone of the Bank's
assistance strategy for 2003-04 presented in the Country Assistance Strategy progress report (CAS-
PR) and will be the first in an expected new series of three programmatic operationsto support the
implementationof the revisedPRSP in 2004-06.3PRSC-4 has been designedas an interim operation
based on the 2003 PRSP-PRto give the authorities sufficient time to finalize the revisedfull PRSP
for the period2004-06 in early 2004. The new CAS, scheduled for Boardpresentation in fiscal year
2005, as well as potential hture PRSCs in 2005-06will build on the new policy fiamework spelled
out inthe revisedPRSP.

2.       The government has continuedits satisfactory record of policy implementationin 2002-03,
As outlined in the 2003 PRSP-PR and the Joint Staff Assessment that were discussed by the
ExecutiveBoards of the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in March 2004,
Burkina Faso has made good progress in implementingits PRSP. The Boards considered that the
PRSP and the progress report provided a solid basis for hture concessional lending. At the same
time, the IMF Boardalso completedthe first review under the programfor 2003-06supported under
the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). Regarding specific performance indicators
("triggers") for the PRSC-supported program outlined in the PRSC-3 program document, the
government has met all but one fully or in substantialparts, and the progress made to date warrants
the move to PRSC-4. The proposedoperationfollows on PRSC-3 within a 10-monthperiodto better
align disbursementswith the Burkinabkbudget cycle, which follows the calendar year.

3.      PRSC-4 would offer benefits in sustaining an environment likely to enhance growth
prospects over time, improve key social indicators, and deepen reforms of political and economic

institutions. External resources provided through PRSC-4 would be essential for the smooth
executiono fthe government'sbudget in a stable macroeconomic environmentand the pursuit ofkey
PRSP objectives. The program measures supported by PRSC-4 and summarized in the Letter o f
Development Policy (Annex 1) include reforms aiming at reducing factor costs; enhancing
productivity, notably in rural areas; improving basic social services; and strengthening budget
performance and control. The programmaticBank support under the PRSC is complementaryto the
PRGF-supportedprograms ofthe IMF(Annex 2).

4.       The PRSC-supportedprogramoutlinedinthis document has been fully alignedwith the draft
donor harmonization framework developed at the occasion o f the PRSP revision. Donor
harmonization is centered on the government's priority action plan (PAP) that accompanies the
revisedPRSP. The PAP includes a set of measures and results indicators, which providethe unique
framework to assess progress made in implementing policies and achieving results. All donors
providingbudget support will draw their disbursement criteria from the PAPmeasures and indicators
as well as the assessment of macroeconomic policiesbythe IMF.

5.       The PRSP process and the series of PRSCs continue to benefit from a variety o f analytical
work. Ongoingwork includesa globalpublic expenditurereview(PER), a povertyassessment, a pro-
poor growth study and a gender assessment. Jointly with the IMF, an updated Accountability
Assessment and Action Plan (AAP) on the tracking of poverty expenditure under the Heavily
Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative has been prepared in April 2004. A new country
procurement assessment report (CPAR) and a country economic memorandum (CEM) are planned
for 2005 and 2006, respectively.


             11.     RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK

6.        Burkina Faso's economy is characterized by its low per-capita income o f about $250 in
2003, very limited human capital, high vulnerability to external shocks owing to its dependency on
cotton production, and strong dependence on external aid. As a result, progress in improving living
conditions has been slow and fragile, and Burkina Faso continues to rank very low on the United
NationsDevelopmentProgram(UNDP) HumanDevelopmentIndex?

7.       The political environment in Burkina Faso remains stable. A small group of mostly former
military personnel was arrested in October 2003 and is currently being tried for conspiring to
overthrow the government, but this coup attempt is considered to be an isolated event. The
government headed by Prime Minister Paramanga Ernest Yonli that was appointed after the May
2002 legislative elections remains unchanged in most positions after a small cabinet reshuffle in
January 2004 involvingthe MinistriesofDefense, Information,andEnvironment.The governmentis
supported by the parliamentary majority of the party of President Blaise Compaore. Opposition
parties, after gaining more than 40 percent o f the seats in the National Assembly in 2002, have
successfully used their parliamentary representation to publicly challenge the government and
promote their political agenda during the past two years. Presidential elections are scheduled for
2005 and the incumbentPresident, in power since 1987 and previouslyelected in 1991and 1998, is
expectedto present himselffor a new 5-yearterm.5

8.       Burkina Faso has successfully maintained a stable macroeconomic environment, as
evidenced by its satisfactory track record under the fourth successive program supported by an
arrangement under the IMF's Poverty Reduction and GrowthFacility (PRGF). On June 11,2003, the
IMF Executive Board approved a new three-year arrangementunder the PRGF for Burkina Faso in
an amount equivalent to SDR 24.1 million to support the implementation o f the government's
program in 2003-06. The IMF's Board completed the first review under the arrangement on March
19, 2004 (Annex 7). BurkinaFaso hasreachedthe completion points under the original and enhanced
HIPC Initiatives in June 2000 and April 2002, respectively, and was granted debt relieftotaling more
than US$550 million innet-present value terms, including a topping-up at completion point.

                                A. RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

9.       Growth and inflation. In late 2002 the Burkinabt! economy was subjected to a severe shock
as a result o fthe political crisis inneighboring C8te d'Ivoire. The crisis ledto a closure o fthe Ivorian
border and cut off Burkina Faso and Mali from their main trade route through the Abidjan harbor,
which is connected to Burkina Faso by rail. Instead, trade had to be channeled trough harbors in
Ghana, Togo and Beninand over the road network. At the onset o fthe crisis, government and donors
expected a negative impact on growth and employment and an acceleration o f inflation due to (i)
difficulties in mobilizing sufficient transport capacity to assure delivery o f inputs; (ii)the
impossibility to find other customers after the disappearance o f the Ivorian market; and (iii)higher
transport costs. Overall, real growth for 2003 was originally projected at 2.6 percent and average
inflation at 4.5 percent.

10.      The confluence o f several events and supportive government policies allowed Burkina Faso
to avoid much o f the negative impact o f the Ivorian crisis on economic growth. Exceptional rainfall
resulted in a strong expansion of cereal production (17 percent), and the government's subsidy to
offset higher transport prices for fertilizers facilitated the strong growth in cotton production (23
percent), which reached a record level o f 500,000 tons. Livestock producers quickly reoriented their
sales to Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria, and avoided much o f the crisis impact. Overall, primary
sector growth is estimated at 9 percent in2003.

11.      The secondary sector adapted quickly following a liberalization o f road transports and the
revival o f traditional trade links with Ghana and Togo. Aside from a few units in Bobo-Dioulasso,
near the Ivorian border, most industries were able to avoid the negative effects o f the crisis by
opening new trade channels with Ghana, Togo, and Benin. The government jointly with the cotton
company facilitated the increase intransport capacity by allowing foreign trucks to pick up goods in
Burkina Faso, a practice that had beenpreviously prohibited. Overall, industrialproduction benefited
from strong demand and picked up by 7.5 percent in 2003. Combined with a strong growth o f
electricity output after the completion o f a new generator and sustained growth o f construction and
public works, secondary sector growth is estimated at 7.3 percent in 2003. In addition, the tertiary
sector benefited from the marketing o f the good 2002-03 cotton harvest and i s projected to have
grown at about 4 percent.

12.      Taken together, real growth in 2003 much exceeded expectations and reached 6.5 percent,
The good economic performance and abundant cereal production to some extent also mitigated the
difficult social situation created by the return o f people o f Burkinabt! origin from CBte d'Ivoire in
2002 and 2003. Inflation remained subdued, after an initial spike in late 2002 and early 2003, as a
result o f the decline in food prices toward the end o f 2003. Average inflation rates were below 2
percent in2003.

13.       Fiscal developments. The 2003 budget was executed smoothly notwithstandingchallenges
resulting from uncertainties about external disbursements. Overall revenues exceeded targets by
CFAF 7 billion on account of large nontax revenuea6The higher nontax revenues are largely


  Burkina Faso also faces a shortfall of about CFAF 6.5 billion in compensation payments by the West-African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) as a result o f difficulties o f the WAEMU in collecting contributions
from member countries.

explained by a strong increase in dividends paid by public enterprises following both good economic
performance and stricter control o f their management. However, significant shortfalls in budget
support diminished the government's capacity to fully execute capital expenditure and the
maneuvering room for reducing the carry-over o f unpaid commitments between budget years. The
latter declined nonetheless in 2003 by CFAF 2.3 billion, excluding the HIPC account, following an
effort to close budget operations early and remove commitments from the expenditure circuit by the
end o f the year. The external financing shortfalls resulted from the late collection o f certain
performance indicators, which were the basis o f some o f the envisagedbudget support. In addition, a
lendingoperation originally designedas a single tranche operation was split into two tranches. HIPC
debt relief also fell significantly short of initial projections as a result of lack o f participation o f
certain creditors and the appreciation o f the CFA franc vis-his the US-dollar. Despite continuing
difficulties in fully committing spending out o f the special HIPC account-CFAF           29.8 billion were
committed compared to originally planned CFAF 55.6 billion-the                  government reduced the
remaining stock o f uncommitted HIPC reliefto about CFAF 27 billion.'

14.       Monetary and external developments. For 2003, the pick-up o f cotton exports both in
quantity and in value is projected to have resulted in an 18.7 percent increase in export values.
However, the positive impact on the trade balance is counterbalanced by the strong import growth
(8.5 percent) resulting from both higher economic growth and the higher cost o f transport services.
Overall, the current account deficit (excluding current official transfers) is projected to have
stabilized at about 12 percent o f GDP. Monetary developments, which mirror the fiscal and external
projections, show a small increase in Burkina Faso's net foreign reserve position at the regional
central bank (BCEAO) while foreign asset holdings o f commercial banks declined. Credit to the
economy grew by 10.5 percent in2003,

15.       Growth and inflation outlook. According to the latest projections underthe macroeconomic
program, Burkina Faso could continue to grow at a pace o f about 5 percent in 2004. Main sources o f
growth would be a sustained expansion of industrial production, utility services, and trade, reflecting
in part the increased demand for consumer goods following the marketing o f the exceptional 2003
cotton crop. The latter would also contribute to transport and trade services growth. By contrast,
primary sector expansion, notably agricultural output, i s expected to be modest with a return to
regular rainfall patterns. Inflation will likely remain low at less than 1percent in 2004 as the decline
infood prices takes full effect on annual inflationrates.

16.       Sustaining high growth rates in the medium-term will crucially depend on raising
productivity and investment rates. Intheir draft PRSP for 2004-06, the authorities target more than 6
percent growth in 2004-06 to significantly reduce income poverty in the medium term. However,
these growth rates will be difficult to attain without significant increases inproductivity, especially in
the rural sector, and will require higher private sector investmentrates. In2001-2003, growth inthe
primary sector has been driven to a large extent by the expansion o f agricultural surfaces in light o f
improved rainfalls, as exemplified by the development o f cotton production that resulted
predominantly fiom larger surface areas (see Annex 8). These growth rates cannot be sustained over
a long horizon unless they are accompanied by mechanization and higher fertilizer use to increase


'In  Burkina Faso, HIPC resources are channeled through a special treasury account. Spending allocations in the
special account can be carried over betweenbudget years.

productivity and maintain soil fertility.' Overall, the economy would need to generate investment
rates closer to 30 percent to accelerate growth, and given the already high share o f government
investment, these higherrateswould needto come from more private investmentactivity.

17.      2004 budget and financing requirements. The National Assembly approved the 2004
budget in December 2003. As a result o f the close integration o f financial programming with the
budget exercise through the early preparation o f the Medium-Term ExpenditureFramework (MTEF)
in 2003, revenues and budget allocations voted by parliament closely mirror those of the
government's macro-financial program that is supported by the IMF's PRGF. Reflecting the better
growth performance and the projected improvements in revenue collection, 2004 revenues are
located between the base case and the high case o f the MTEF with a significant increase in the ratio
of tax revenue to GDP ratio. Moreover, although some additional resources from MTEF
contingencies were allocated to the foreign affairs, defense, and security ministries, overall budget
allocations for key ministries such as basic education, health, agriculture and infrastructure, match or
exceed those in the base case o f the MTEF. In addition, many priority sectors received additional
allocations from the relief under the HIPC Initiative. Overall, the budget therefore reflects the
priorities o fthe PRSP and respectsthe MTEF allocations for PRSPpriority sectors.

18.      Residual financing requirements o f CFAF 40.4 billion for 2004 (Table 2) would be covered
by the proposed fourth PRSC (CFAF 35.1 billion) and the disbursements under the IMF's PRGF

(CFAF 5.3 billion). The residual financing gap has been establishedafter taking into account pledged
program support by other multi- and bilateral creditors and donors for a total o f CFAF 47.7 billion,
including the European Union (EU), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and several bilateral
donors o f the budget support group (France, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland). For 2005, residual
financing requirements are more substantial since several bilateral agreements, most importantly the
agreementwith the EU, will needto be renewed after adoption o fthe revised PRSP.

19.      External and monetary projections. The marketing o f the record cotton harvest o f 500,000
tons combined with a firming up o f cotton lint prices in international markets are expected to boost
exports by 11percent in 2004. As a result o f a counterbalancing increase in import values, the current
account deficit (excluding current official transfers) is projected to remain at about 12 percent in
2004. Under this scenario, net foreign assets would be stable, and credit to the economy is projected
to rise by 8 percent in 2004.

                                      C. POVERTY-GROWTHDYNAMICS

20.      New household data gives a fresh picture o f poverty trends in Burkina Faso. During April-
July 2003, the National Instituteo f Statistics and Demography (INSD) conducted the third household
survey after 1994 and 1998. The survey data was collected at a time and with a methodology that is
comparable to the 1998 survey. In the context o f the PRSP revision, INSD issued a first analysis o f
the data basedon a newpoverty line that was establishedat CFAF 82,672 (about US$160). Basedon
this poverty line, 46.4 percent of the population were estimated to be poor in 2003. Compared with
poverty headcount indices o f 45.3 percent in 1998 and 44.5 percent in 1994, these figures appear to
indicate a worrisome persistence o fpoverty despitethe positive results achieved since 1994 inraising
growth rates and stabilizing the macroeconomic environment. However, given the positive per-capita
growth rates between 1998 and 2003 and the decline in income inequality, as signified by the decline
of the Gini coefficient from 0.53 to 0.506, the poverty developments as measured by the analysis o f
the household survey appear to be inconsistent with the increase in per capita income measured by
the national accounts.

21.      A preliminary analysis of the new poverty data inthe context of a multi-donor financed pro-
poor growth study and the Bank's poverty assessment shows that the comparability o f poverty data
over time is affected by both the construction o f expenditure measures and the choice o f the
consumption basket for the calculation o f the poverty lines. In 1998 household expenditure
aggregates were increased by 12 percent, presumably to account for seasonality, whereas a similar
upward adjustment was not made in 2003. Moreover, the 1998 poverty line contained about 70
percent food items, whereas the 2003 basket only contains about 50 percent food items. Both the

upward revision o f 1998 expenditure data and the increase o f non-food itemsto calculate the poverty
line during a period o f declining food prices would tend to understate the decline in the poverty
headcount between 1998 and 2003. A preliminary analysis using the authorities' poverty line and a
variety o f time-consistent expenditure measures shows that, although the level o f the poverty
headcount varies depending on the expenditure aggregate used, all time-consistent measuresresult in
a decline in the poverty rate o f 4-5 percentage points during 1998-2003. Although such a decline
between 1998 and 2003 appears unsatisfactory to make quick progress toward the Millennium
Development Goal (MDG) o f halving poverty between 2000 and 2015, it is more consistent with the
growth and population dynamics observed since 1998.

22.     Analytical work i s underway, in close collaboration with the authorities, to explore data
comparability issues and the composition o f consumption data in 1998 and 2003. Further data
analysis is necessary to better understand the poverty-growth dynamics and draw pertinent
conclusions for economic policy. This analysis will be undertaken in the context o f the ongoing pro-
poor growth study and a new poverty assessment. The Bank is also continuing its collaboration with
the authorities for modeling micro-macro linkages with the poverty analysis macroeconomic
simulator (PAMS) to allow forward-looking simulations o f poverty dynamics based on the
macroeconomic projections and reassess the growth and inequality developments under alternative
policy scenarios.

23.     Another trend revealed by the 2003 household survey is the rapid urbanization combined
with an increase in urban poverty. In 2003, more than 20 percent o f the population lived in urban
areas, compared to about 14percent in 1998. The urbanization processis accompanied by an increase
inurban poverty, as poorer and less educatedsegments ofthe populationmigrate from rural to urban
areas without being integrated into the formal labor market. This development is also reflected inthe
significant increase in the size o f the urban population working in the informal sector or being
unemployed. Labor market issues will be deepened hrther in a planned labor market study that will
be undertaken by Bank staff in 2005. The poverty assessment under preparation also points to the
vulnerability o f the poor to exogenous shocks. The 2000 drought likely reduced rural consumption
and wiped out poverty gains in rural areas after the 1998-99 recovery o f agricultural production. By`
the same token, the returnmigration of some 300,000 people ofBurkinabhorigin following the crisis
inCGte d'Ivoire is estimated to have increasedboth urban and ruralpoverty rates.

24.     Taken together, the early results o f the household survey underscore the need for improving
the quality of growth. Benefitsofthe ruralpopulationfrom growth are limitedand fragile, and urban
poverty is on the rise with an increasing number o f unemployed and informal workers. These
findings also support the thrust o f the government's poverty reduction strategy to reduce poverty in
rural areas through improved agricultural productivity, better market access, and reduced
vulnerability to climatic conditions; and to fight urban poverty by creating better conditions for
investments in small-scale industries and services through a reduction in factor costs and a better
business environment.

          111.    IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2000 PRSPAND BANK SUPPORT


                             A. PRSPIMPLEMENTATION            IN2000-2003

25.     PRSP implementation remained satisfactory in 2002-03. In March 2004, the Executive
Boards o f the Bank and the IMF examined the latest PRSP progress report, the third since the
inception o f the PRSP in May 2000. With a view to the revision o f the PRSP in 2003-04, the 2003
progress report summarizes achievements in 2000-02 and outlines policy objectives for 2003-04 in
an annex. It was subject to regional consultations before being validated by a high-level seminar
including representatives o f government, civil society, the private sector, and the donor community.
The Executive Boards considered that the progress report presented a candid and well-documented
picture o f PRSP implementation in 2000-02. They noted the broadly satisfactory implementation o f
policies under the four strategic PRSP pillars: (i)accelerating broad-based growth; (ii)promoting
access to social services; (iii)increasing employment and income-generating activities for the poor;
and (iv) promoting good governance. Executive Directors encouraged the authorities to use the
opportunity o f the PRSP revision to define a more comprehensive framework for growth-enhancing
policies, develop closer analytical links between budgetary policies and results, and strengthen the
role o fthe PRSPas an integrative framework for sectoral policies.

26.     Despite the broadly satisfactory record o f policy implementation, the 2000 PRSP did not
fully reach original objectives. Under the first strategic pillar, the government maintained a stable
macroeconomic environment and growth reached 4.5 percent on average despite different challenges
such as the 2000 drought, the 2002 legislative elections, and the crisis in Cijte d'Ivoire since late
2002. However, growth fell short o f the original PRSP target o f 8 percent for 2002-03, and, as noted
above, the latest household survey shows at best modest improvements in poverty rates and living
conditions. Without additional efforts to raise growth rates and channel more o f the growing income
to the poor, the income-poverty MDGmay not be reached.

27.     In the social sectors, the second PRSPpillar, the government successfblly launched the ten-
year basic education development plan (PDDEB) and the national health development plan (PNDS)
(Table 4). After a slow start, the increase in schooling infrastructure and teachers under the PDDEB
i s having a strong impact in 2003, with a large increase in first-year admission rates and overall
schooling rates. The challenge is now to remove the existing bottlenecks to school construction and
to further improve the quality o f instruction. Ifthe recent strong increase in first-year admission rates
were sustained during the coming years, Burkina Faso would be on track to meet the MDG for
primary school enrollment. In the health sector, the vaccination campaign that was launched in the
late 1990s was continued and most PRSP targets for vaccination rates have been met, despite
occasional difficulties with vaccine supply. There has also been a modest pick-up in health center
usage rates, but further efforts as regards resource flows to health centers and health center staffing
are necessary to improve health care coverage and quality. The results of the 2003 demographic and
health survey (DHS) will be available soon to verify the impact o f health spending on the maternal
and child mortality MDGs and review policies inthis area. Significant improvements have also been
made in increasing the supply o f drinking water, and almost 70 percent o f the population have now
access to safe water, compared to 42 percent in 1998, putting Burkina Faso on track for the
respective MDG. However, these figures hide important differences between urban and rural areas,
with the latter requiring significant additional investments and improved policies to create a
sustainable environment for water management.

28.        As regards the third PRSP pillar, which focuses on raising income for rural activities and
vulnerable groups, progress i s more difficult to ascertain as few pertinent indicators are available.
Under the PRSP, numerous measures to increase agricultural productivity and access to financing
have been taken. However, as noted earlier, the improvements in productivity thus far have been
modest, including in the cotton sector, and rainfall patterns remain the predominant determinant o f
agricultural output. Raising effectiveness o f rural development spending to increase the benefits o f
growth for the rural population is one o fthe key challenges for attaining the income-poverty MDG.

29.        A variety of important policy reforms have been undertaken in the area o f governance, the
fourth PRSP pillar. These have, inter alia, resulted in improvements in budget formulation,
execution, and control, and laid the groundwork for the deconcentration and decentralization o f


                                                                10

public services. As preliminary results o f an ongoing PER show, priority spending has risen under
the PRSP and priority sectors have been protected to a much larger extent than in the past from
budget cuts. Treasury accounts balances are available on a monthly basis, and the budget execution
reports through 2001 have been evaluated by the Supreme Audit Court and the National Assembly.
However, not all o f the PRSP indicators for budget management, such as the time neededto proceed
from verification to payment, have seen improvements over the pre-PRSP values. Further
improvements inthe speed and quality o f budget execution, for which recent reforms have paved the
way, need to be made to increasethe impact o fthe budget. Inaddition to public expenditure reforms,
the government reinforced governanceaspectsby establishing a HighAuthority for the Coordination
of the Fight against Corruption in2002 that became operational in2003.

30.      Under the 2000 PRSP, great strides have been made to define a monitoring framework for
PRSP implementation. With the support o fthe national poverty observatory (ONAPAD), the original
set o f indicators has been refined, and a list of indicators for the revisedPRSP has been adopted after
broad consultations with stakeholders. The major challenges are to perpetuate the collection o f
information by providing sufficient budget financing for data collection, and to improve the capacity
for the evaluation o f results on the basis o f indicators and statistics. The latter would strengthen the
quality of program budgeting and underpinthe annual PRSPprogress reports.

                                B. BANKSUPPORT UNDERTHE 2000 CAS

31.      The Bank's November 2000 CAS is closely aligned with the PRSP. It supports PRSP
priorities through a variety o f instruments with the specific objectives to (i)support policies and
programs aimed at improving the supply side o fthe economy to allow for sustained, broad-based and
export-oriented growth; (ii)improve public finance management to increase the flow o f resources to
poverty-reducing activities; and (iii)ensure that the allocation process and public spending goals
place special emphasis on social services. The strategic thrust o f the CAS was confirmed in the
March 2003 CAS-PR, which extended the CAS for 18 months to give the government sufficient time
for the revision o fthe PRSPbefore the adoption o fa new CAS.

32.      The CAS and CAS-PR provide for several Bank instruments to support the PRSP. PRSCs
take an important place in the support strategy and represented about 30 percent o f the proposed
lendingprogram under the original CAS and more than 50 percent under the CAS-PR.' PRSCs were
intended to support the implementation o f cross-cutting policies that would (i)support PRSP
objectives to raise growth perspectives in a stable macroeconomic environment; (ii)increase access
to and quality o f basic social services, with a PRSC-focus on the health sector; and (iii)       improve
public sector management with a particular emphasis on budget management reforms. Under the
CAS, PRSCs were complemented with several sectoral interventions approved in fiscal years 2001           -
03, notably (i)a competitiveness and enterprise development technical assistance project under the
first PRSP pillar; (ii)a basic education project supporting the implementation o f the PDDEB, an
HIV-AIDS disaster response project, and a Ouagadougou water supply project under the second
PRSP pillar; and (iii)a community-based rural development project and a transport project with
focus on rural roads in line with the third PRSP pillar. In addition, the Board approved in March
2004 a statistical capacity building operation (STATCAP) for Burkina Faso. For fiscal years 2004-
05, the CAS-PR lendingprogram includes, inaddition to PRSCs, an energy investmentoperation, an
urban investment and decentralization project, a rural diversification and marketing project, and a



  The PRSC-share is inflated by two PRSCs inFY04.

capacity-building project. Overall, the Bank's portfolio balances budget support through PRSCs with
operations meeting specific large-scale infrastructure investments needs (water, transport, urban),
community-based interventions (rural, HIV-AIDS), and targeted technical assistance and capacity
building(competitiveness project, STATCAP).

                 C. STOCKTAKING OFBANKSUPPORTTHROUGHPRSCSIN2001-03

33.     A first series o f three PRSCs was designed in 2001 to support the government in
implementingkey reform under the PRSP's strategic pillars. The PRSCs-developed                   inline with the
policy framework of the PRSP and on the basis o f the rich body o f analytical work-focused                on two
broad areas: public sector reform and governance and sectoral policies for the poor. The first
component, reflecting objectives o f the first and fourth PRSP pillar, included measures to strengthen
the budgetary process, improve auditing functions, revise procurement regulations, deconcentrate the
budget, and reform the civil service. The second component, based on PRSP pillars 2 and 3,
incorporated measures to improve service delivery in education and health and strengthen income-
generating agricultural activities. The selected measures to improve economic management and
social service delivery were considered to be essential to reach PRSP objectives.



                                      Box 1: PRSC Stocktaking Workshop

    A stocktaking'workshop to discuss experiences with the PRSC in2001-03 took place inOuagadougouon
    March 22-23, 2004. The workshop included participants from a variety o f government institutions,
    private sector and civil society. The Minister of Finance and Budget introduced the main themes in his
    opening speech-the      government's interest in receiving predictable budget support for PRSP
     implementation within a medium-term programmatic framework; the importance of predictability of
    budget support; the integration of sectoral ministries into the PRSC; and the importance to harmonize
    donor interventions. Participants in four plenary sessions underlined the overall good experience thus far
    with the PRSC instrument in offering reliable support for PRSP implementation through the budget and
    welcomed the efforts to align PRSCs more closely with the budget cycle. They noted the risks linked to a
    variation of PRSC amounts in case of unsatisfactory progress. Participants from line ministries, in
    particular the Ministry of Health, described the difficulties encountered in switching from a project
    approach to budget support. The health ministry was finalizing a long-term health-sector development
    program when the first PRSC was approved and sectoral policymaking and monitoring tools still needed
    to be developed. Moreover, health ministry staff underscored the practical problems arising from
     insufficient budget allocations for implementing measures included in the PRSC matrix. Donor
    participants presented the complex issues in harmonizing budget aid and timing and the efforts
    undertaken inthejoint budget support group (SBC-CSLP), noting that the main approaches using either
    policy actions or indicators as disbursement criteria were complementary. Several participants from the
    government and civil society wondered whether disbursement criteria should not be filly harmonized,
    and government representatives explained how the government intends to lead the process of further
    harmonization. Participants in general believed that under the second PRSP and a new PRSC series the
    government should focus on improving capacity and analytical tools to better program and evaluate
    budgetaryspending; andto process the information generated by the collection o f statistics and indicators
    more regularly.



34.     The year 2003 markedthe end o fthe first cycle o f three PRSCs, giving an opportunity to take
stock ofthe experience with Bank support to the PRSP through this instrument. To this end, Tables 5

and 6 summarize the key actions supportedby the first three PRSCs and outcomes and impact related
to the original results framework. loBank staff also launched a participatory stocktaking exercise,
jointly with the authorities, during a March 2004 seminar with participants from the Ministry o f
Finance, line ministries, the donor community, and the private sector (see Box 1). A stocktaking
report summarizing the major experienceswith PRSCs inBurkinaFaso is under preparation.

35.     Overall, a large set of actions have successfully been implemented in the past three years
under the PRSC program. Keyreform areas include:


    0   Budget formulation, to ensure a close link between the budget and PRSP objectives.
        Significant progress was made in mastering the preparation o f global MTEFs. Their full
        integration into the budget preparation cycle in 2002-03 led to increasing realism o f revenue
        targets and improved the budget arbitration. Moreover, program budgets linking PRSP
        objectives with budget allocations were established in all key ministries. Budget formulation
        in several sectors (education, health, infrastructure, rural development) also benefited from
        public expenditure reviews, which have been piloted since 2003 by a PER supervision
        committee.
    0   Budget execution, to make service delivery more effective. Burkina Faso fblly
        operationalized a computerized expenditure management system in 1999-2000. The system
        captures all domestically financed expenditure at the different stages o f the expenditure
        process (engagement, liquidation, mandatement,paiement) and allows to closely monitor the
        execution o f the budget and the level o fpayment obligations. Moreover, the legal framework
        was created to delegate credits to regions and provinces and to deconcentratethe issuance o f
        payment orders in order to accelerate delivery o f basic services. Since 2003, a pilot extension
        of the expenditure system to the second-largestcity, Bobo-Dioulasso, has been effective.
    0   Procurement, to improve efficiency of public expenditure. Roles for the different
        ministerial departments were clarified by the government. A new procurement code was
        adopted in May 2003, new procurement manuals and forms were drafted, and a capacity
        buildingplanwas drawnup.
    0   Budget reporting and good governance, to ensure efficiency of spending and fight
        corruption. The government caught up with its legal obligation to submit budget execution
        reports to the audit court for the years 1996-2001. To strengthen external controls, an
        independent Supreme Audit Court was created and made fully operational in 2002. The
        National Assembly also adopted a new organic budget law in 2003, aligning national law
        with the WAEMU directive. Moreover, the CFAA was finalized and its recommendations
        were integrated into the new budget management reform plan (Plan d'uction pour le
        renforcement de la gestion budge'taireor PRGB) adopted in July 2002. A good governance
        plan was prepared and a HighAuthority for the FightAgainst Corruption was created in2002
        and staffed in 2003.
    0   Civil service reform and decentralization, to improve service delivery. The development
        of the computerized civil service payroll and salary management system (SIGASPE) was
        finalized. The government instituteda new personnel management system based on mission
        letters and performance reviews. The framework for the role and attributiono fgovernors was
        adopted to implement the decentralization laws.

0 Policy monitoringand evaluation, to ensure that policies are well targeted.A new list of
  PRSP monitoring indicators was prepared in 2002 to expand the list o f indicators in the
  second annual PRSP progress report. A participatory poverty assessment and a new
  household survey were conducted in 2003.
0 Education,to raise schoolenrollmentrates and reduce illiteracy.Inpreparing for the roll-
  out o f the PDDEB, a number o f measures laid the ground to achieve a significant increase in
  supply o f education services at sustainable expenditure levels. These measures include the
  end o f automatic hiring of graduateso fteacher training colleges (ENEP) into the civil service
  and the preparation o f delegation o f human resource management decisions to the regional
  level. The government continued the preferences in terms o f school supplies for the 20
  provinces with the lowest enrollment rates, increased the number o f schools with sanitary
  facilities, and provided sufficient financing for the expansion o fthe education sector through
  the national budget. According to the latest available tracking survey, the estimated average
  cost o feducation per child increased 5.4 percent in2002 but remains below the level in 2000.
0 Health, to fight maternaland child mortality. A new national health development strategy
  was adopted in 2001 guiding the health sector policies. A vaccination campaign was
  successfully implemented.Prices o f essential generic drugs were reduced through a reduction
  of the profit margins o f the National Drug Procurement and Distribution Company
  (CAMEG) in 2002, and tracking surveys conducted as part o f the PRSPprocess indicate that
  the measure resultedin a 15-30 percent decline ofthe cost of standardmedical interventions.
  A list of prices for key medical services and 3 pediatric drugs was published in 2003. The
  government also hired additional health staff to increase staffing levels in health centers.
  Moreover, to increase funds on the health district level, 66 petty cash accounts (rkgies
  d'avance)were created in2003.
0 Rural development, to raise growth rates and create income. A strategy for the opening
  of the cotton sector was prepared. As a first step, the legal monopoly o f SOFITEX was
  removed and an action plan for the opening o f the sector for private investors was
  established. Bidding documents for two zones representing about 15 percent o f total
  production were prepared and technical pre-qualification procedures were launched in 2003.
  Several studies for the diversification o fcrops were also undertaken.
0 Environment, to ensure sustainable development. A national plan for training in
  environmental issues was adopted and the different role o f actors in this area was clarified.
  Environmental safeguard procedures were disseminated and joint ministerial instructions
  were issuedon the application o fenvironmental assessments.

36.     Supported by the satisfactory record o f policy implementation, the government reached most
outcomes targeted under the first PRSC series (Table 6). However, some o f the impact o f the policies
was smaller than the results framework had originally envisaged. This finding reflect the
considerable lag in translating certain policy outcomes into impact and the fragile environment
characterized by limited capacity for policy analysis. The results o f Table 6 can be summarized as
follows:


    0   The stable macroeconomic environment with low inflation and moderate growth was
        achieved. Further data analysis i s needed to ascertain to what extent poverty targets were
        indeed achieved to give direction for future policies.
    0  Budget managementand procurementregulationshave been strengthened significantly in
       2000-03. Budget preparation has been improved and linked better to objectives, the
        computerized budget management system has been extended to one region, the government
       regularly accounts for budget execution to the Supreme Audit Court and the National
       Assembly, and procurement regulations have been overhauled. Execution rates for social
        sector budget stayed high. Nonetheless, the size o f deconcentrated budgets in health and the
        execution rates in the education sector could be improved further. Additional reductions in
        the time neededto issue payment orders and o f the unit prices of publicly procured goods are
        also desirable. Despite publication o f budgets and budget outcomes, control through the
        public remains constrained by low capacity.
    0   Primary school enrollment ratesrose sharply since 2001 and exceeded 50 percent in 2003.
        However, given the high level o f adult illiteracy, it will take more time to significantly reduce
        the illiteracy rate and especially the illiteracy rate for women.
    0   Vaccinationratesand healthcenter frequentation increased in line with targets, reflecting
        the success o f the vaccination campaign and the price reductions for medication and care.
        The ultimate impact on child and maternal mortality rates is not yet known since the results
        o f the Demographic and Health Survey are not yet available.
    0   Inthe rural sector, ruralroads were built, selected financingwas made available, and cereal
        production increased substantially following abundant rainfalls. However, the impact o fthese
        policy measures on agricultural productivity, diversification and rural incomes has been
        limited thus far, reflectingthe considerable lag between policy actions, changes to economic
        incentives, and measurable changes inagricultural production and output.

(Figure 1). The latter was subject of a donor roundtable on March4-5,2004 in Ouagadougou and is
expectedto be presentedto the ExecutiveBoardin mid-2004.Althoughpolicyactions under PRSC-4
build on the 2000 PRSP and its progress reports as did previousPRSCs, the operationestablishes a
new framework for Bank support, as outlined inthe programdocument for PRSC-3. It follows three
thematic pillars: (i)growth and employment creation; (ii)human resource development; and (iii)
good governance. Table 7 summarizes the measures implemented under this framework prior to
PRSC-4.Future PRSCs in 2005-06, which would be alignedwith the revisedPRSP and its priority
action plan, would follow the same pillars within a coherent three-year policy framework. The
revisedPRSP would provide the monitoringand resultsframework for the current operationand the
anticipatednexttwo PRSCs (Table 8).

38.      PRSC-4 follows on PRSC-3 within a periodof 10months to better align disbursements with
the budget cycle, in line with government requests. As preliminary work conducted under the
ongoing PER reveals, in 1999-2002 on average 60 percent of disbursements o f budget support
arrived in the last quarter, hamperingefficient budget management. Movingthe approval of PRSCs
from July to April-May would permit earlier disbursements and provide resources to the budget in
the second or third quarter of the calendar year, allowing faster commitment and execution of
investmentspending.'

39.      The proposed credit aligns itself closely with the 2004 budget that was adopted by the
National Assembly in December 2003. The government's budget respects the MTEF ceilings for
priority sectors and reflects the financialtargets ofthe program supported by the IMF. It continuesto
give priority to the social sectors, agriculture, and infrastructure, in line with PRSP priorities. As in
the past, allocationof HIPC resources in 2004 is made through the specialaccount, but in contrastto
earlier years the allocationo fthe HIPC account has beenincludedinthe 2004 budget law.

40.      The fourth PRSC is in line with on-going donor efforts to harmonizetheir support. Several
bilateral donors offering budget support as part of a budget support group (soutien budge'taire
conjoint au cadre strate'gique de lutte contre lapauvrete' or SBC-CSLP) agreedwith the World Bank
in January 2004 on a revised framework for collaboration. The framework gives the government's
PRSP Priority Action Plan (PAP) a central role in measuring progress and defining disbursement
criteria. The latter can be drawn from PRSP policy actions, PRSP indicators, and an assessment of
macroeconomic performance by the IMF. The new framework overcomes the previous conflict
between policy-baseddisbursement criteria used by the World Bank and the African Development



'IWorld Bank credits and grants to BurkinaFaso needto be approved by the NationalAssembly, which usually is
out o f session between end-May and mid-September. Bank approval of PRSCs in April-May would allow to
introducethe credit for approvalbytheNationalAssembly beforethe summer break.

Bank and indicator-based criteria used by bilateral donors by placing them under a unique and
coherent framework. Discussions are underway with the government to formally define the
relationship between the emergingenhanced budget support group and the government in the context
o f a revised memorandum of understanding.

41.      The PRSCs are embedded in a series of analytical work conducted by the government, the
World Bank and other donors (Figure 1). Complementing studies by the government and other
donors, the Bank will complete in the next months a global public expenditure review (PER), a
poverty assessment, a gender assessment, and a livestock study. It has also continued its technical
assistance in macroeconomic modeling in 2003-04, in collaboration with the German technical
assistance agency (GTZ). A new CPAR and Integrated Framework are expected for next year. An
updated HIPC-AAP has been prepared with the IMF in 2004, and the IMF is providing continued
technical assistance in tax and customs administration and statistics. The donor community has
supported the government through a review o f the public expenditure management reform plan
(PRGB), diagnostic work and technical assistance in public expenditure management and tax
administration, poverty analysis, as well as through studies aiming at improved management o f
sectoral programs and public utility services.

42.      As outlined in more detail below, the government has made satisfactory progress in
implementing the PRSP and the related reform program. A matrix and triggers for the proposed
PRSC-4 were agreed upon before negotiations for PRSC-3. Eight out o f eleven triggers were met
fully, one was mostly met and is expected to be fulfilled within the next weeks, and one was met
partially. The single trigger that could not be met relates to the nomination o f governors and the
adoption of the applications texts for the decentralization laws (TODs). Although all application texts
were drafted, changes to the decentralization framework by the National Assembly in August 2003
and longer-than-expected inter-ministerial arbitration procedures related to the financial impact o f
deconcentration and decentralization have delayed their adoption. As a result, the nomination o f
governors, which could have repercussions on the composition o f the government and the National
Assembly, was delayed to a politically opportune moment in 2004. The government remains
committed to nominate governors and expects to finalize the adoption o f the remaining
deconcentration and decentralization texts during 2004. The impact o fthe delay o fthe nomination o f
governors on PRSPtargets is limited in2004 given that the governors would only play a small role in
budget execution and the size o f deconcentrated allocations has been set for 2004. However, the
nomination o f governors would still be an important signal for the deconcentration o f government
authority, strengthen regional directorates in the budget planning process, and give rise to a further
increase indeconcentratedbudget allocations in 2005.

                           B. GROWTH EMPLOYMENT
                                           AND                    CREATION

43.       The fourth PRSC supports under its first component several measuresofthe first and
third PRSP pillar aiming at accelerating growth rates and creating employment, particularly
in rural areas. As outlined above, sustained high growth rates will depend on raising
agricultural productivity and creating employment opportunities in both rural and urban
areas. The government's poverty reduction strategy therefore includes measures to improve
management o f the rural economy, enhance investments in the cotton sector, diversify the
rural incomes, and increase market access. As regards enhancing competitiveness, the
government has focused on lowering factor costs, in linewith the findings o fthe 2001 growth
and competitiveness study undertaken by the government with the World Bank.l2

44.        Cotton. The government opted in 2001 for opening the cotton sector to new
investors. The cotton sector has been traditionally in the hands o f the single parastatal,
SOFITEX, which controls agricultural extension services for the cotton sector as well as the
ginning and marketing of the output. SOFITEX has been managed in exemplary fashion and
has succeeded in increasing cotton production from 240,000 tons o f seed cotton in 1999 to
500,000 tons in 2003, despite the difficulties for transporting fertilizers and cotton fiber that
arose from the Ivorian crisis. However, to reduce risks for the country stemming from
dependency on a single large operator and entice additional investment in the sector from
abroad, the government decided in 2001 to sell the exploitation rights and agro-industrial
assets in two zones in the central and the eastern part o f Burkina Faso. These zones account
together for about 15 percent o f cotton production. The new investors inthe two zones would
have the opportunity to take over existing ginning plants and further develop and intensify
cotton production.l3A successful introduction o f new operators would also increasepressure
on the traditional operator to continue its good management inorder to maintain the rights for
the exploitation of its other cotton zones. New investments and strong management in the
cotton sector would underpin the PRSP objectives of raising growth and creating rural
incomes.

45.       The government has pursuedthe implementation of its action plan to open the cotton
sector in 2003-04 and the related trigger was mostly fulfilled. Under prior PRSCs, the
government had lifted the cotton trade monopoly o f SOFITEX in 2001 and launched the
technical bidding process in May 2003. The invitation o f technical bids generated
considerable interest and bids were evaluated in August 2003. However, one o f the
companies that was not retained during the pre-qualification process launched a complaint
before the process could be formally concluded. To ensure full compliance with the bidding

Economy and Finance o f Burkina Faso and The World Bank, 2001. For a summary of the study, see Box 2
o f the program document for PRSC-3, Report No. 25782-BUR.
l3 During the transition, the new operators would pay the same prices for seed cotton as the traditional
operator and take over the agricultural extension services. Poverty and social impact analysis would be
conducted for anticipated changes of the regulatory framework once the transition has been successfully
managed. It would in part build on existing micro-simulations of the poverty impact of cotton and the new
householdsurvey. See also Burkina Faso, Groupe de travail sur les microsimulations and Projet conseiller
au ministere de l'kconomie et des finances (GTZ) :Application des micro-simulations :ttude de l'impact

rules, an arbitration commission o f the Ministry o f Finance and Budget reviewed and
eventually rejected the complaint in November 2003. Therefore, the Council o f Ministers
could approve the pre-qualified bidders only in January 2004.14 Pre-qualified bidders were
invited in February to submit financial offers, and bids were opened on April 6, 2004. After
approval by the Council o f Ministers, winning bidders will be invited for negotiation in
April-May 2004. The delays encountered in late 2003 did not allow bringing the two zones to
the point of sale by March-April as originally planned. The signing of sales agreements for
the cotton zones is now expected for June-July 2004, in time for the 2004-05 cotton season,
and progress will be monitored under future operations.

46.      In the context of the sale of two zones, all ginning plants of the SOFITEX have
undergone an environmental audit. It was largely concerned with evaluating the impact o f
cotton lint on workers and the neighboring population. The audit was validated in March
2004 and includes a plan to mitigate the environmental impact, a list o f environmental
parameters for monitoring performance, and the respective methodology. Winning bidders
for the two zones will need to comply with national environmental regulations and the audit
provides them with a cost estimate for o fcomplying with safeguards before the conclusion o f
the salesprocess.

47.      Rural development policies and diversification. The government completed the
work on the new rural development strategy in 2003 and it was adopted by the Council o f
Ministers in early 2004. The new strategy will underpinthe rural development policies under
the revised PRSP. In 2003, the government also continued the preparation of studies on
diversification. The studies on oilseeds and on fruits and vegetables were finalized. It is
expected that the results o f these studies will be distributed through workshops and help
develop diversificationpolicies, including under a Bank project on agricultural marketing and
diversificationthat is under preparation.

48.      Telecommunication.According to the growth and competitiveness study, high costs
o f telecommunication services, especially for fixed line connections and international calls,
reduce the attractiveness o f Burkina Faso for investors and hamper the more rapid growth o f
services. Currently, only 5 fixed lines exist for 1000 Burkinabk and expansion o f
telecommunication services by itself could be an important source o f growth. To accelerate
investments in the telecommunication sector and lower telecommunication costs, the
government decided to privatize the national operator ONATEL. Competition for the state
company already exists inthe fast-growing cellular phone market, and the telecommunication
sector is regulated by an independent regulatory agency (ARTEL) ensuring interconnection
with the state-owned fixed lines under fair conditions. Similar to the experience in
neighboring countries, the privatization o f ONATEL is expected to provide additional
investments for the expansion o f the cellular and fixed networks, and to create efficiency
gains that would bring down further the cost o f fixed line service and international service. In
a first phase o f the privatization, 34 percent o f the stock would be transferred to a private
operator and a further 10 percent and 7 percent would be transferred in two future steps
depending on the operator meeting the minimal requirements under the sales agreement.
Twenty percent o f shares would be sold onthe regional stock exchange.




l4Two biddersfor the central zone and three bidders for the eastern zone were pre-qualified.


                                                  32

49.     The privatizationprocess for ONATELhasprogressedwell and the respectivetrigger
was fulfilled. The formal privatizationprocess for ONATEL began in May 2003 with the
pre-selectionprocess that was concluded inJuly 2003. The following preparationof bidding
documents took longer than originally expected since the government needed to give
certainty to potential investors about the steps involved in obtaininga majority of shares in
the second and third stages. The bidding documents were finalized in December 2003,
followed by a period during which pre-qualified investors received information about
ONATEL. Financialbidswill be receivedby end April 2004 and the winning bidder will be
invited for negotiationsafter a formal decision by the CouncilofMinisters, expected for late
May2004.

50.     Energy. Burkina Faso suffers from high energy costs, which contribute to the
reduction o f competitivenessof existing enterprises and hamper the development o f small-
and medium scale transformation of agricultural products. The high electricity costs reflect
the small scale of generating activity, and the high cost of importedpetroleum fuels, which
continueto be subsidizedby the government. Inorder to bringdown energy costs inthe long
run and diversifypower supply, the government intends to improve the management of the
sector, modernizethe generating equipment and extend the interconnectionof the Burkinabt:
grid with the Ivoriangrid to Ouagadougou. Marginalcosts of power from CBte d'Ivoire can
be more than 30 percent lower than thermal power produced by SONABEL, the public
enterprise responsible for power generation, transmission, and distribution. However, even
after the interconnection, the lower cost of Ivorian power could not be passed on to
consumers in the near and mediumterms as they would be initially outweighedby the high
capital costs related to the investment in new transmission lines and new thermal power
plants replacing obsolete equipment.The government also intendsto open the capital of the
government-owned petroleum distribution company, SONABHY, for private investors to
increase the efficiencyo fpetroleumimportoperations.

51.     Progress in definingthe government's electricity and petroleum sector strategies has
been slow andthe respectivetrigger has beenmetonly inpart. The slow progress already had
an impact on mobilizing foreign financing and forced the government in 2003 to raise
financing on domestic markets to purchase new generatingfacilities inthe face o f increasing
peak demand and deteriorating equipment. The diagnostic study on the electricity sector
underpinningthe decisionon the sector strategy was originally submittedto the Ministry of
Energy in mid-2003 but was returnedto the consultant for development of hrther options.
The exchanges continued until end-February 2004 when the study was finalized in
consultation with Bank energy experts. The Council of Ministers subsequently adopted the
electricity sector strategy on March 24, 2004. Under the retainedstrategy, the sector will be
split intwo segments. Inthe first segment a new state-owned company will be createdto take
over the production and transmission equipment and the related debt obligations of
SONABEL. SONABELwill become a managementcompanyto supervise energy production
and distributionand will be turned over to private ownership in 2005. The second segment
will be covered by the rural electrification find and be managed jointly by the central
government, non-governmentorganizations,the private sector, and local governments. Under
the existing law fiom 1998 new operators can already enter the generation market as
independentpowerproducers.

52.     Given the delay in the decision on the electricity sector strategy, the accompanying
study on the necessary legal and regulatory reformscould not yet be finalized. The adoption


                                              33

o f the reform by the Council of Ministers is expected for mid-2004, and the passage in the
National Assembly for Fall 2004. The strategy for the evolution of the petroleum sector was
discussed by the Council o f Ministers on March 31, 2004. It involves opening o f the capital
o f SONABHY for private investors. The Council o f Ministers instructed the relevant line
ministries to finalize the strategy for adoption. The next steps in reforming both energy and
petroleum sectors would be pursued under futureBank operations.

53.      Labor market reforms. As noted inthe 2001 growth and competitiveness study, the
formal labor market in Burkina Faso suffers from rigid labor laws that discourage formal
sector employment and investment. As part of the overall reform program, the government
sought to review the existing labor code in light o fexperiences abroad and to discuss possible
reforms with both unions and employer organization. After tripartite discussions were
concluded, the Ministryo f Labor has pursued the work on the revisions to the labor code and
expects that the changes will be adopted in 2004. Inthe meantime, the process was launched
for preparing a comparative study o f labor markets. This study will generate information and
an action plan to guide the revision o f application texts for the labor code expected to be
adopted inlate 2004.

                           C. HUMAN     RESOURCEDEVELOPMENT

54.      Education.The ten-year basic education development program (PDDEB) for 2001-
2010 defines policies and activities aiming at increasing enrollment and primary graduation
rates. The program includes steps to (i)increase access to basic education through supply and
demand interventions such as the increased supply o f teachers, school infrastructure, books
and equipment; (ii)improve the quality o f education and reducing repetition rates by
providing instructional materials, training teachers and increasing the effective number o f
teaching time to reach 780 hours; (iii)lower opportunity costs o f sending children to school;
(iv) improving the management o f schools by involving parents and community leaders; and
(v) strengthening the capacity for decentralization and budgetary support through financial
and procurement management and monitoring o f the education system. The implementation
o f the PDDEB, notably its large investment component, is supported by a variety o f donors
and an IDA project. PRSC-4 supports selectedpolicy reforms under the PDDEB and ensures
the integration ofPDDEBobjectives withthe government budget.

55.     Interms o fthe specific education policy measuresunderPRSC-4, the implementation
to date has been largely satisfactory. The 2004 government budget incorporates a 13.5
percent increase in budgetary resources, excluding foreign financed investments, for the
MinistryofBasic Education and Literacy (MEBA) combined with a large allocation ofHIPC
resources. However, MEBA needs to remove bottlenecks in executing the budget to
effectively equip schools with teachers and materials given the large increase in first-grade
admissions. The transfer o f responsibilities for the hiring o f new teachers to regions and
provinces has been completed in 2003. Each job is attached to a region and a retained
candidate loses his position if he leaves his region o f assignment. Provinces receive their
candidates from the regional pool. However, until the appropriate framework for the division
o f responsibilities between the center and the regions and provincial units has been put in
place, salaries continue to be paid at the center and the centralized Ministry o f Civil Service
executes key personnel acts, requiring at times that new teachers travel to Ouagadougou to
regularize their appointment. The increase in the effective hours o f teaching time that was
targeted under the PDDEB has not yet been verified by surveys as planned, however. As


                                               34

regards the implementation o f the system o f sub-cycles to reduce the bunching o f repeaters at
the end o f each two-year cycle, the measure has been introduced with the 2003-04 school
year and was subject to a first verification duringthe PDDEBreview mission inMarch 2004.
Finally, the MEBA has prepared a draft sectoral MTEF on the basis of the analysis
undertaken for the PDDEB and the Education For All (EFA) Initiative. However, additional
work will need to be done to include the Ministry o f Higher Education (MESSRS) and
prepare a sectoral MTEF for the entire education sector. With increasing demand for primary
education, a financial framework is required that takes into account the investment needs for
students passing from primary to secondary education infuture years.

56.      Health. The national health sector development plan (PNDS), which dates from 2001
i s the principal reference point for policies implemented under the PRSCs. The PNDS aims at
improving health infrastructure and quality o f care to increase access to and usage o f health
care, and to ultimately lower child and maternal mortality rates in line with the respective
MDGs. PNDS is supported by several United Nations organizations and bilateral donors.
PRSCs are the primary tool o f Bank support to the health sector. PRSC-4 supports selected
measures to strengthen policy and budget implementation, improve health services and lower
their cost, and strengthen the linkages between health sector objectives, budgets, and
monitoring o f results.

57.      The 2004 budget for the Ministry o f Health is in line with the 2004-06 MTEF
adopted in March 2003. It includes an increase in the health budget (excluding foreign-
financed investment spending and interministerial expenditure for utilities) by about 6
percent. Although the increased budget allocation is consistent with the MTEF, the health
ministry has had more difficulties than the MEBA to retain its relative share inthe budget as
a result o f competing priorities. These difficulties result in part from the more indirect link o f
health sector spending with outcomes, calling for additional efforts to improve evaluation o f
program budgets inthe health sector.

58.      The government has continued its policies to lower the cost o f primary care and
medication and the respective trigger has been fulfilled. The free distribution o f vitamin A
capsules to fight malnutrition has continued during the vaccination days for polio, given that
the latter were not discontinued as originally expected. The general health inspectorate has
verified the application o f the 2003 circular setting prices for selected medical services and
medication. The verification report was finalized in March 2004 and shows that the tariff
structure is applied inmost districts evaluated but that many do not have the official text. Ina
few districts, which applied lower fees, there was confusion as to whether they would need to
raise their fees to the level indicated in the health ministry circular. The Ministry o f Health
intends to issue clarifying instruction based on the recommendations o f the report. The 2004
budget includes resource allocations for materials and services to support the new price
structure for medical services and medication adopted inFebruary 2003.

59.      As regards personnel management, the government has pursued the deconcentration
process and the studies o f health worker motivation. New health workers are now assigned
directly to regions and health districts. However, salaries continue to be paid centrally until
the adoption of a legal framework for transfer o f personnel to the regions, and health
workers, in contrast to newly hired teachers, do not lose their position if they leave the
region. The studies conducted by the health ministry and the WHO as regards ways to
improve the motivation o f health personnel to serve in remote areas have been finalized and


                                                35

validated by a workshop in November 2003. Nonetheless, an action plan still needs to be
defined, jointly with the Ministries of Finance and Civil Service, to implement key
recommendationsofthe studies startingwith the 2005 budget.

60.     Both size and management of deconcentrated credits have been reviewed under
PRSC-4. Deconcentrated credits were raised by 10 percent under the 2004 budget law,
ensuring that the share of deconcentrated budgets as part of the total budget will rise. The
Ministry of Health also proposed a formal monitoring mechanism to ensure deconcentrated
credits quickly reach their beneficiaries. Performance of petty-cash accounts (rdgie
d'uvunce), which were intendedto replace quick-disbursingaccounts under the closed IDA
projects, was disappointing in 2003. In order to ensure better performance in 2004, a joint
committeeofthe MinistriesofHealthandthe Treasury will be createdto regularlyreviewthe
performanceofthese accounts andtake early correctivemeasures.The ongoingBank PER is
also studying the performance o f deconcentrated credits in the health sector to give further
adviceon howtheir functioningcanbe improved.

61.     First steps have been taken to prepare a sectoral MTEF. Health ministry staff has
followed training and studied the work done in other Sub-Saharan African countries on
sectoral healthMTEFs.Exchangeswith Bank staff and other donors are under way to finalize
the preparationof the MTEF by mid-year.The sectoral MTEF is expected to be an important
instrument for the monitoringand evaluationofPNDS implementation.

62.     The government adopted and implementeda formal monitoring mechanism for the
PNDS in 2003 and met the respectivetrigger. The PNDS did not have a formal monitoring
and evaluationsystem to underpinand broadenthe reviewsofthe PRSP, andthere was a lack
of systematic integration of the PNDS objectives into the budgeting exercise. In 2003, the
government instituteda formal monitoringcommittee for the PNDS, which adopted a set of
monitoring indicators in November 2003. The first meetings of the committee, which
includes several donors in the sector, have strengthened the monitoring o f policy
implementation and reinforced the exchange of information and collaboration. A first joint
bi-annualreview, includinganalysisof budget executionand disbursements, progress in key
indicators,andjoint governmendpartnerfieldvisits, took placeinMarch2004.

63.     Water, Water management is an important issue for poverty reduction given the
country's dependency on rain-fedagriculturalactivityand the concentration ofurbangrowth
inareas with limitedwater supply. To meetrisingwater demands, the Bank and other donors
are supporting large infrastructure investments in Ouagadougou under a joint investment
project.PRSC-4 complements the investmentthroughselectedpolicy measures aiming at the
development of a medium-term strategy for sustainable water management, including in
secondary cities and ruralareas.

64.     The government has completed several steps in defining its policy agenda in the
water sector for 2005-06.An actionplanto reachthe MDGs ofhalvingthe number ofpeople
without access to safe water by 2015 was drawn up and validatedand will also lay the basis
for the strategy featured in the revisedPRSP. In the area of water management, the general
directorate ofwater decidedto defer the preparationof an actionplanto create private-public
partnership to a later date in 2004, in collaboration with donors. The administrationjointly
with the water company ONEA took steps to reduce the government's water bill by verifying

the eligibility of all users who claimto be part ofpublic administration. Fraudulent users now
needto be eliminated from the administration list. The government is also verifying the water
network inall public buildings to reduce leakagesduring2004.

                                    D. GOODGOVERNANCE

65.     Budget formulation. The 2004 budget, which lays the foundation for support to the
PRSP through PRSC-4, was adopted by the National Assembly in December 2003. The
government made further improvements to the budget managementprocess that resulted in a
close integration o f financial programming with the actual budget process. The MTEF
adopted in April 2003 closely matched the financial program agreed with the IMF, and was
integrated into the May 2003 budget circular. Program budgets for 2004 that were adopted by
the Council o fMinisterswere preparedbasedon these ceilings for eachministry.

66.     The 2004 budget adopted by the National Assembly reflects the PRSP priorities and
MTEF ceilings and the trigger has been fulfilled. The 2004 budget is based on a resource
envelope that i s between the base case and high case o f the MTEF, following the positive
macroeconomic developments in 2003. Overall allocations for priority ministries, notably
basic education, health, agriculture, and infrastructure match or exceed the base case o f the
MTEF allocations. Allocations of HIPC debt relief through the 2004 special account, also
have been made to PRSP priorities, notably basic education, health, promotion o f women,
justice and energy.

67.     To strengthen the effectiveness o f government operations, the government has
revitalized the PER process in 2003 and decided to undertake reviews for higher education
and justice ministries in time for the 2004 MTEF exercise. The review o f higher education
has been completed in March 2004 and the review o f the justice ministry is expected to be
completed in April 2004. The PER process is beingpiloted by a committee presided over by
the permanent secretary of the secretariat for the monitoring of financial policies and
programs (SP-PPF). The government's efforts as regards the review o f expenditure are being
complemented by the Bank's PER addressing global budget allocations, budget processes,
and selectedspending issues ineducation and health.

68.     Budget execution. In continuing the program o f prior PRSCs, PRSC-4 supports
several key measures to further enhance the information systems on budget execution and
accelerate execution o f spending. One o f the longstanding objectives is the integration o f
more current information on foreign-financed investment into the computerized expenditure
framework (CID) to improve up-to-date information on budget execution and allow the
analysis o f overall spending activity. This analysis is particularly important for the largely
foreign-financed investment spending in priority areas on which information is often
available only with long delays. However, despite the interconnection o f the department
responsible for foreign disbursements, the directorate general for cooperation (DGCOOP),
withthe CID and several training sessions since the late 1990s, little progresshas beenmade
to date with integrating foreign-financed investments in the CID. The Minister o f Finance
therefore demanded technical assistance from the IMF's Africa Technical Assistance Center
(AFRITAC). The AFRITAC report recommends to improve data collection and procedures
and notes that the foreign-financing module i s outdated and would need to be reprogrammed
to allow integration o f data into the CID. The government intendsto follow through with the
AFRITAC recommendations in 2004-05.


                                              37

69.       The government has continued the preparation for a computerized revenue
information system. The objective o f the system is to ensure both a timely recording and an
exchange o f information between different revenue collecting agencies. A consultant has
been identified who is conducting his work in several stages. The first stage, an analysis o f
existing computer systems, has beencompleted. The second stage, the concept for a potential
connection o f these systems was largely completed in the first quarter o f 2004. The
preparation o f the software will be undertaken during a third stage that will last until end
2005.

70.       The government linked four additional regional capitals to the CID and the respective
trigger was fulfilled. The measure is necessary for ensuring timely payment o f
deconcentrated credits and essential for hrther increases o f these credits and the
deconcentration process as a whole. With the connection o f four more regional capitals to the
CID, the whole expenditure process can now be completed in the region. It is expected that
deconcentrated budget procedures will result over time in faster delivery o f local services and
execution o f a larger share o fthe budgetoutside the center.

71.      Procurement.PRSC-4 buildson the procurement agenda developed under the CPAR
and implemented under prior PRSCs to improve the transparency o f public procurement
processes and ensure government resources are used efficiently. The adoption o f a new
procurement decree and standard texts in 2003 profoundly reformed the procurement
framework. The manuals and standard texts for the new decree were validated during a
workshop in January 2004 and submitted for finalization. PRSC-4 focuses on implementing
the newdecree andcompleting the legaland administrative framework.

72.      The General Finance Inspectorate (IGF) has verified in early 2004 the application o f
the new decree for a sample o f contracts and the trigger was fulfilled. IGF found that overall
the provisions of the new decree have been respectedbut that deviations occur, inparticular
when goods are received. It recommended that the Minister of Finance reminds staff of the
pertinentprovisions and suggesteda revision o fthe ministerial arret6 to better define the role
and tasks o f the technical subcommission o f the commission charged with the attribution o f
procurement contracts. The verification by IGF will be complemented by an external audit,
financed by the EU, o f procurement contracts in 2001 and 2002. The audit has begun in
March 2004 and will give additional information as regards possible weaknesses in public
procurement.

73.      The government has pursued procurement reforms under PRSC-4. To this effect, the
procurement reform committee drafted a new decree for leasing contracts and concessions to
complete the May 2003 decree, which concerned only public purchases. Bank staff is
currently assisting the procurement reform committee with the finalization o f the decree,
which is expected to be adopted during 2004. The ministries in charge o f water and
infrastructure have also taken steps in elaborating arrQtCs for the conditions for the issuance
and withdrawal o f accreditation for bidding on public works contracts (water, roads,
construction). For water, an interministerial committee i s charged with the work, and for
roads a consultant was contracted, whose work was validated in March 2004. The process i s
still in the stages o f consultation with the private sector and will take additional time before
completion. Under the budget management reform plan (PRGB), the government intends to
prepare a computer application for procurement management that could be linked to the
expenditure managementframework. Inthis respect, technical staff has been hiredin2004 to


                                                 38

connect the central directorate for procurement (DCMP) to the CID and conceive an
application for procurement processes in the CID that will eventually allow to follow the
status o fprocurement contracts inthe system.

74.      Budget management and control. The implementation of key PRGB measures in
this area was satisfactory and the trigger has been met. Measures aim at increasing
transparency o f budget operations and deepening ex-post control. An important step forward
was taken with the implementation o f a new budget classification consistent with the
directives o f the West-African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) in 2004. The new
classification will allow presenting the budget according to a functional and economic
classification and will improve the analysis o f budget priorities and economic impacts. The
concomitant changes to the budget and the CID required a large effort o f the general budget
directorate (DGB) inthe secondhalf o f 2004.

75.      The treasury (DGTCP) made great strides in regularly preparing treasury account
balances. Since March 2003, monthly account balances are being prepared 45 days after the
end o f each months using the government's integrated accounting software (CIE). The
overall account balance for 2002 was finalized in December 2003. With the monthly
preparation o fbalancesthe treasury will also inthe future be able to acceleratethe production
o f final account statements (comptes de gestion) and plans to finalize them at the time annual
budget execution reports are submitted to the Supreme Audit Court. In the meantime, the
government cleared the backlog on final account statements for the period before 2001.

76.      The government is also continuing its efforts to ensure a regular closing of budget
operations at year-end to reduce the payment overhang between budget years. In 2003, a
special effort was made to clean the budget system o f all commitments that had not reached
the payment order stage. In November 2003, the Minister of Finance issued the standard
circular with the timetable for the closing o f budget operations. The financial services took
special care to remove commitments early from the expenditure circuit to quickly reduce any
overhang. As a result, despite the shortfall in external disbursements, the stock o f
commitments for which payment orders were not yet issued, excluding those for HIPC
spending, declined by CFAF 2.3 billion.

77.      As regards an accounting system for government property, the government has
prepared an action plan but not yet begun its implementation. With the successful
improvements o f ex-post accountability, the government will turn its attention to this issue in
order to improve the effectiveness o f government activities and protect public property. The
staff o fthe general state inspectorate (IGE) has been reinforced in 2003 and 2004, but further
reinforcements of control services are needed to improve ex-post controls. Notably IGF will
require staffing increases to meet the growing demand o f participation in audits o f donor-
financed projects. The Council o f Ministers instructed relevant ministries in March 2004 to
complete the work on a new statute for control service staff.

78.      Public sector reform and decentralization. The PRSC series supports selected
measures in civil service management and decentralization to improve the effectiveness o f
the public administration and local service delivery. As regards personnel management, the
government reissued guidelines for the application o f merit-based evaluations and
promotions in 2003 after their initial application had been subject o f confusion. The database
o f the electronic personnel management system (SIGASPE) has been checked and entries


                                               39

have been verified and corrected so that SIGASPE is now consistent with the database o f the
Ministry o f Finance's salary division. However, maintenance o f the system remains difficult
because o f shortages in equipment and frequent departure o f sufficiently skilled computer
experts. An action plan for deconcentration to line ministries has been developed but given
the limited resourcesit does not yet include aroll-out ofthe systemto the regions.

79.     The decentralization agenda has seen further changes of the overall architecture and
the trigger on the implementation ofthe region was not yet met. To advance the agenda, the
Ministry of Interior and Decentralization spearheaded the effort to comprehensively define
the architecture of deconcentration and decentralization, and the Council o f Ministers
adopted decrees to specify the role o f governors and their offices in the first half o f 2003.
However, in August 2003, the National Assembly adopted changes to the decentralization
laws, specifying that the regional councils would take the role o f local representation for
areas not covered by a commune and eliminatingthe role o fprovinces inthe decentralization
process. These changes required adaptations to the draft application texts to define the
relationship o f different institutions (region, regional council, province, rural commune,
village elder), their revenue bases, and their spending authority. Some draft texts are still
subject o f intense government debate given the potential financial implications. In this
environment, the political opportune moment for the nomination o f governors during 2003
was missed and their nomination is now expected to take place in 2004, before the
presidential elections in early 2005. The delay will not have immediate consequencesfor the
execution o f deconcentrated budgets in 2004, given the limited direct budget authority
granted to governors under the current decentralization architecture. However, the
nomination o f governors would increase pressures for improving regional service delivery
and therefore remains and important cornerstone in the decentralization agenda o f the
government.

80.     Environment.PRSC-4 continues the agendapresentedinthe environmental annexes
of prior PRSCs to ensure policies are environmentally sustainable. The environmental
safeguards for PRSC-4 under Bank policies are summarized in Annex 9, which includes a
detailed description how safeguards related to energy and telecommunication reform, cotton
reform, and rural development, education, and health have been implemented. The
environmental agenda supported by the PRSC encompassesthe reinforcement o f capacity for
applying environmental safeguards and increased controls o f their application. Although the
2004 budget saw important increases in the government budget for environment, allocations
to capacity building were insufficient and will be topped up by additional fhds during the
budget year. As regards safeguard policies, the ministry has prepared six sectoral guidelines
for the application o f safeguards. Moreover, three ministrieshave converted their focal points
for environmental safeguards into cells with several members to ensure continuity in case o f
personnel movements. Concerning the verification o f the application o f environmental
safeguards, the Ministry o f Environment has contacted all IDA projects and has begun in
early 2004 with a systematic supervision o f the implementation o f environmental
management plans (EMPs) o f IDA projects. To date, three projects have been visited and the
implementation of EMPs evaluated. They reveal a mixed record in EMP implementation
across projects. The Ministry o f Environment offered technical support for improving the
application o fsafeguardpolicies.

             V.      THE PRSC-SUPPORTEDPROGRAMFOR2004-05

81      Subject to satisfactory program implemen~tionand Executive 3oard approval,
PRSC-4 could be followed by further programmatic operations in 2005 and 2006, PRSC-5
and PRSC-6 would, together with the current operation, constitutea secondthree-year PRSC
program, designed within a coherent policy and results framework derived from the PRSP
and summarizedinTable 8.

                     A. ALIGNMENT WITHTHEPRSPANI] THE CAS

82.     During 2003, the government prepareda draft revised PRSP for 2004-06, This draft
revised FRSP was validated by a high-level seminar in October 2003. It builds on the same
four pillars as the original PRSP but enhances the number of priority sectors and more
comprehensively integrates the different sectoral programs. In order to reflect comments
from stakeholders and better operationalize the revised poverty reduction strategy, the
government drafted a detailed Priority Action Plan (PAP) for PRSP implementation in late
2003 and early 2004. The draft PAP summarizes government policies under the PRSP, and
provides a logfkame and a costed investment program. Its development constitutes a major
achievementfor bettermonitoring ofPRSPimplementationandresults. Itis expectedthat the
revisedPRSP and the PAP, which were subject ofa donor round table on March 4-5, 2004,
will be finalized and adopted by mid-2004 and be submitted for consideration by the
Executive b a r d of the IMF and the World Bank with the second review of the program
supportedunderthe IMF'sPRGF.

83.     Future PRSCs will be fully aligned with the revised PRSP and the new CAS. The
tentative framework for future programmatic lending operations summarized in Table 8
buildson the measures, objectives, and indicatorspresented inthe draft PAPand is expected
to be fully aligned with the final PRSP and PAP that will be presented to the Executive
Board. The new CAS, to be presented for Board consideration during Fiscal Year 2005,
would also build on the revised PRSP and its action plan. The CAS would determine the
instrumentsfor supportingthe implementationofthe revisedPRSPin2005-08, includingthe
use ofprogrammaticsupport underPRSCs.

84,     The policy framework of future PRSCs aligns itself with the draft budget support
framework ofthe donor community. Underthe new framework for budget support proposed
by the bilateral budget support group and the World Bank, disbursement criteria would be
derived from the actions and indicators of the PAP, as well as the summary assessments of
PRSPimplementationby the donor community and IMFreviews ofmacroeconomicpolicies.
It is expectedthat, except for some indicators linkedto institutional reforms, the final PAP
would include the PRSC policy framework presented in Table 8. Under the donor
harmonizationframework, it is also plannedthat policy discussions follow a fixed timetable.
The government would propose policy measures for the current and the future year in
January-February of each year to allow line ministries to reflect policy measures in their
proposed MTEF allocations. The identified policies would lay the foundation for the
discussion of PRSC matrices and indicators with the donor community. PRSCs would be
approved each year in April-May. The formal annual review of the PRSP would be
completed in June each year, once all indicators for the previous year are available. The
annual PRSP review would include a review of policy performance as well as result
indicators.

          B. KEYELEMENTS         OF THE PRSC-SUPPORTED       PROGRAM IN2004-05

85.     Future PRSCs would be organized along the same three thematic groups as PRSC-4:
(i)growth and employment creation, summarizing pillars 1and 3 of the PRSP; human
resource development derived from pillar 2 of the PRSP; and (iii)good governance,
reflectingpolicy objectives o fthe fourth PRSPpillar.

86.     Growth and employment creation. Future PRSCs would continue to support key
policies aiming at reducing constraints for growth and investment and promoting
employment creation, notably in rural areas. With a view to make progress toward income-
poverty MDGs, these measures would help to direct some o f the growing income to rural
areas and support new investment in urban and semi-urban areas. Particular reform areas in
2004-05 that could be supported under PRSC-5 and PRSC-6 are:


    0   Rural development. Future operations would accompany the finalization o f the
        transfer o f assets to new operators in the two cotton zones and the creation o f a new
        framework for the collaboration inthe cotton sector. Furthermore, to better define the
        government's role in the rural development process, the government and members o f
        the agricultural sector wouldjointly preparetexts to clarify the role ofdifferentactors
        in the rural sector, especially the relationship between the government, producer
        organizations, and the private sector. Continuing the diversification agenda, the
        government would also begin the implementation o f various action plans to support
        the diversification of agricultural production. The agenda could be enhanced in later
        operations with support to the livestock sector basedon a study on livestock, poverty,
        and growth that is currently being completed.
    0   Telecommunicationand energy sector reforms. To lower factor costs and entice
        investments in these two sectors, the government would pursue the privatization o f
        the telecommunications operator and would create the legal and regulatory
        environment for introducing private management and power production inthe energy
        sector. The works on the power line interconnecting Ouagadougou with Bobo-
        Dioulasso and CGte d'Ivoire would begin in 2005. Moreover, the petroleum
        distribution business would be partially opened for private participation. PRSCs
        would support these measures in complementing the competitiveness and enterprise
        development project and the energy reform project under preparation.
    0   Private sector development. The government would take a variety o f actions in
        2004-05 to lower factor costs and strengthen the business environment. The revision
        o f labor laws would be pursued to reduce labor costs. Moreover, the government
        would review a variety o f texts to facilitate commerce and reduce administrative
        hurdles. To strengthen the justice system, new administrative tribunals would be
        created.

87.     Human resource development.Under the human resource development thematic
group, the government would pursue sectoral policies in education, health, social protection
and water management to accelerate progress toward the education, maternal and child
mortality, and water supply MDGs.


    0   Education. Following the large increase in school enrollment rates in the past 2
        years, the PRSCs would support the government to improving the quality o f



                                               42

       schooling and the financial management o f the sector through the further
       development o f a sectoral MTEF. Measures supported under PRSCs would be
       complementary to the investments financed by separateprojects.
    0  Health. In the health sector, PRSCs would support policies to improve financial
       management and personnel management o f the sector, increase access to health
       services, and reinforce nutrition programs. Particular reforms include the
       development o f a sectoral MTEF, the design o f subsidies for obstetric emergencies,
       birth, and child diseases, redirection of resources to the fight against malaria,
       improvement o f hospital management, evaluation o f recent trends in malnutrition,
       and the development o fhealth worker incentives.
    0  Water sector. PRSCs would accompany the design o f a new water management
       framework, involving private-public partnerships. The agenda to review public sector
       water bills and usageto reducepublic water bills would be completed.

88.    Good governance. Under this thematic area, future PRSCs would continue to
support a variety o f public sector reform measures to reinforce programmatic budgeting,
increasepublic sector efficiency, fight corruption, and bringservices closer to beneficiaries.


    0  Budgetpreparation.Under future PRSCs, the government would continue its efforts
       to link budgets closely to PRSP objectives through global MTEFs. Moreover, the
       quality o fprogram budgets and their use would be strengthenedby implementingkey
       recommendations o fthe ongoing PER.
    0  Budget execution. Foreign-financed investment spending would be better monitored
       and recorded by clarifying the role o f different ministerial departments and designing
       a recording and information sharing system. Eventually a computerized application
       could be designedon this basis.
    0  Procurement. The procurement agenda o f previous years would be completed
       through the nomination o f a reform committee, the adoption o f a decree regulating
       concessions and leasing, and the development o f a computer application for the
       monitoring o f procurement processes. In addition, the government would continue
       the systematic ex-post controls on procurement contracting.
    0  Budget management and control. Inthe budget management and control area, the
       government would develop an accounting system for government property to verify
       the efficient use o f equipment and avoid fraud. It would continue the regular
       submission o f accounts to the Supreme Audit Court, and further reinforce staffing o f
       the ex-post control services.
    0  Public sector reform and decentralization. In this area, the government would
       expand the use of the electronic personnel management system to line ministries. It
       would finalize the accounting software for local communities, operationalize the
       regions, and begin with the transfer o f resources and competencies to local
       communities. The government would pursue efforts to strengthenthe management o f
       the agricultural ministriesand develop better professional training for the rural sector.
    0  Environment. The government intends to continue the capacity reinforcement
       program and the creation o f stronger bodies for environmental review in line
       ministries. The supervision o f IDA projects and other donor-financed projects will
       also be pursuedin 2004-05, and the management o f forestry resourcesstrengthened.

                                   A. CREDITADMINISTRATION


89.     Credit amount and financing. The proposed amount of IDA credit financing is US$60
million equivalent.

90.     Tranching.The credit will be disbursed in one tranche of SDR 40.9 million (US$60 million
equivalent), to be releasedat effectiveness,anticipatedto be inJuly 2004 after adoptionofthe credit
agreement by the Council of Ministers and the National Assembly, and the required review by the
ConstitutionalCourt.The creditclosingdate wouldbe June 30,2005.

91.     Disbursement and auditing. The credit will follow IDA'S simplified disbursement
procedures for adjustment operation^.'^ Credit proceeds will be made available for disbursement
upon effectiveness.The government will open an account in local currency with the regionalcentral
bank BCEAO. Upon notification o f release o f the tranche, IDA will deposit the proceeds in this
account in CFA francs when requested to do so by the government. If, once deposited with the
central bank, withdrawals are used for ineligiblepurposes (Le., to finance goods or services on the
standardnegativelist), IDA will requirethe governmentto rehndthe amountto the credit account or
directly to IDA. The Minister o f Financethroughthe General Directorateof the Treasury (DGTCP)
ensures that withdrawals from the account are only made for budgeted expenditure excludingthose
on the negative list. Status reportson the account are availablethrough treasury account statements,
The use of IDA resources for budgetary expenditure is subject to audit by the Supreme Audit Court
as part o f the annual budget execution report. In addition, donors in the budget support group
regularlyconduct auditsofthe flow of depositaccounts and under the credit agreement IDA reserves
the right to seek an independent audit o f the deposit account. The regionalcentral bank, BCEAO, is
subject to financial safeguards arrangements under the IMF's PRGF arrangement, including the
requirementfor regularexternalaudits.

92.     Environmentalsafeguards. The credit has beenreviewedat the concept stage by the Bank-
wide PRSC working group and been classifiedas a sectoraladjustmentcredit (SECACs), triggering
safeguards set forth in Operational Policy 4.01 (Environmental Assessment). PRSC-4 has been
classified as Category B and builds on PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 environmental analysis conducted for
health, education, and rural development.The safeguard measures will ensure that potential adverse
impacts will be screened and provisions are in place to mitigate those impacts o f concern. The
environmentalanalysis is detailedinAnnex 9.

93.     Implementation.The reform programfunded by this credit will be implementedby several
ministries.The PermanentSecretariatfor the SupervisionofFinancialPoliciesandPrograms(SP-
PPF) at the Ministry o f Financeand Budget is coordinatingthe contributions of different ministries.
Ministries involved in the implementationo f the program are the Ministries of Finance of Budget

o f Economy and Development (economic developments and statistics, PRSP, statistical monitoring
system), Ministry of Basic Educationand Literacy (implementationof PDDEB), Ministry of Health
(implementation of PNDS), Ministry of Commerce and Enterprise Development (privatization
program, cotton reform), Ministry of Agriculture, Water, and Fishing (cotton reform, institutional
reforms, agriculturaldiversification, sanitationprogram), Ministry of Territorial Administrationand
Decentralization (decentralization program), Ministry of Civil Service and Reform o f the State
(public administration reform), Ministry o f Energy and Mines (energy reform), and Ministry of
Environment and Living Conditions (environmentalreforms and analysis). The coordinationby the
SP-PPF has been generally successful in mobilizing collaboration of line ministries and has been
increasingly effective in ensuring ownership of the program in the administration. A closer
cooperationwith the technical secretariat for the coordination of economic and social development
programs (STC-PDES) and the general directorate for economy and planning(DGEP), which are in
charge o f the PRSP and the PRSP action plan, would at times be useful, however, to ensure close
alignmentofPRSP, sectoralprograms, and PRSCs.

94.     Credit supervision and monitoring of results. Supervision of the credit will take place
through the performance review of the PRSP conducted annually by the government; through bi-
annual reviews in the health and education sectors; and as part of the evaluation of program
performancefor the preparationof potential future operations.The results of PRSC-4, which cannot
be separated from those o f government spending through its budget, will be monitoredwithin the
three-yearresults framework of the revisedPRSP, which quantifies timebound targets for 2006 that
are subject to annualmonitoringand are reflectedinTable 8.

                              B. RISKSAND MITIGATING        MEASURES

95.     The main risks to achieving the targeted results are the country's vulnerability to external
shocks, vested interest, weak capacity, a weaker political support for reforms around the upcoming
elections, and, to a more limited extent, fiduciary risks. External shocks, including unpredictable
fluctuations o f aid, weather conditions, cotton price fluctuatuations, and regional instability, could
disrupt the implementation of the budget and thus disrupt PRSP implementation. Moreover, the
exogenous shocks also directly affecteconomic conditionsofthe populationandthus change poverty
rates and other indicators measuring the impact of government policies. Especially, unresolved
tensions in neighboringcountries continue to pose a threat for economic stability through possible
populationmovements and further disruptionof economic activity. Mitigating factors for these risks
are the sound policy record of the government with a proven ability to adjust non-priority spending
when faced by shocks, permitting to pursue program targets in adverse conditions. In addition, the
earlier approval of this credit would better align it with the budget cycle and thus increase the
predictabilityo fresources.

96.     Vested interests can represent reform obstacles for policies aiming at increasing private
sector involvement in the economy, notably in the energy and cotton sectors. The reform program
supported by the PRSC series reduces the influence of those with important stakes in sectors with
limited competition, in public enterprises, and in public administration by removing obstacles for
competition, diminishing public sector control over productive assets, and improving transparency
and ex-post controls. Therefore, PRSC-supported policies may be challenged by influential groups,
resulting in a slow-down o f the reform process, and policies may be subject to reversal after their
implementation.Underthe PRSC, these different risks arising from vested interestsare mitigatedby
the fact that all policy measures are implementedbefore credit approval and that each operation is
embedded in a medium-termpolicy framework. The commitment of the government to the principle


                                                 56

of programmatic support through PRSCs enhances the likelihood that particular interests can be
overcome.

97.      Achieving the credit objectives could become more difficult as a result of weak
administrativecapacity in BurkinaFaso and slow program implementation.To mitigatethis risk, the
Bank is giving technical support to the PRSP process with other donors. The PRSCs themselves
contain a set of measures, such as the preparation of sectoral MTEFs, aiming at increasing
governmentcapacityto conceive, monitorand evaluate programs. Inaddition, the Bank is supporting
the government under two separate capacity building operations for the administration and for
statistics(STATCAP).

98.      The upcoming presidential elections could weaken the resolve of the administration to
implement the reform program. In the run-up to the elections, the government may be reluctant to
take unpopularmeasuresthat couldweaken popularsupport andpoliticaluncertaintymay slow down
the speed of reforms.These risks are mitigatedthroughthe strongownershipby the government and
the administration of the medium-term reform program, and the stable political environment
following the larger representationof oppositionparties in the National Assembly and political life
since the 2002 elections.

99.      Fiduciary risks have diminished with successful implementation of the PRSC reform
program and the full implementation o f annual audit procedures recommended by the CFAA.
However, some risks remainowing to the limited size and capacity o f control services in verifying
the application o f laws and regulation. The credit is mitigatingthis risk by supporting the further
strengthening of ex-post audits, and by including further measures to enhance transparency of
budgetingand timelinesso faccounting.

Mr.James WOLFENSOHN
President o fthe World Bank
WASHINGTON DC, 20433 (USA)

                              LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY



Dear Mr.Wolfensohn,

1,      This Letter of Development Policy (LDP) reports on recent developments inBurkina Faso's
economic and social situation, and the outlook for the next two years. It is based in part on the
consolidated report that was prepared in September 2003, covering the third year o f activities under
the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), and in part on the priority action program for the
revised PRSP that was presented to the international community at the fourth roundtable with
Burkina Faso's development partners, which was held in Ouagadougou on March 4 and 5, 2004. It
highlightsthe government's implementation o fthe reform program (inthe various areas ofthe PRSP)
that is supported bypoverty reduction strategy credits (PRSC) from the World Bank.

2.       On the economic front, the year 2003 was initially clouded by uncertainties, reflecting in
particular the persistent crisis in CBte d'Ivoire, but in the end economic growth was more vigorous
than expected. In fact, thanks to a good crop year, sound budget management, and the promptness
with which economic operators adjusted to the shocks emerging from CBte d'Ivoire, economic
activity rose by 6.5 percent compared with 4.6 percent in 2002, while forecasts had predicted that
growth would slow to 2.6 percent.

3.       The evaluation of the third year o f PRSP implementation was conducted during July 2003.
The government's consolidated report covering the period 2000-2002 demonstrates progress in
carrying out reforms inpriority sectors, but also stresses the importance o f efforts that are still needed
to reach the millennium development goals for 2015. It calls upon all development players, and in
particular the country's technical and financial partners, to speed up the flow of resources needed for
actions that will improve the country's social indicators.


                                                   58

4.       Also during 2003 the Poverty ReductionStrategy Paper was revised with broad participation
by all stakeholders, including government, development partners, and civil society. The process
culminated in national consultations in early October 2003, where contributions were received from
the various thematic groups established for monitoring implementation of the PRSP. The revised
document includes a priority actionprogramfor implementationduring the period2004-2006.

I.IMPLEMENTATION STATUS OF THE POVERTY REDUCTIONSTRATEGY:THE
PRSCCONTRIBUTION

5.       Poverty reduction remainedthe central focus of governmentefforts throughout the year 2003.
The national budget was consistent with this priority concern, despite the uncertain environment in
which it was prepared. Thus, the government stressed efforts at budgetary reform and reforms to
ongoing sectoral programs supported by the World Bank's PRSCs. The following paragraphs
summarize recentprogress with these reforms.

6.      Although overall notable progress has been made recently, it must be noted that some
measures could not be implementedwithin the expected timeframe or have been implementedmore
slowly. Inparticular

     0   the nomination of governors for the regions was delayed by the time needed to revise the
         decentralizationlaws;
     0   the reform of the cotton sector has been delayed by two factors: first, one of the potential
         bidders called uponthe arbitration commission, second, the opening o fthe financial bids was
         delayed to allow bidders to take into consideration additional information provided on the
         format ofthe presentationof financial offers;
     0   the regulatory framework for the electricity sector could not be adopted because of the delay
         in adopting the option for the structuring of the sector; the government decided after
         examining a first versionofthe report inOctober 2003 that it requiredfurther deepening.

1.1.Acceleratingequity-based economicgrowth

7.       The Burkina Faso economy had a remarkable growth record in 2003, particularly when
viewed againstthe prevailing environment.Although growth was projectedat only 2.6 percent at the
beginning of the year, in the end it achieved 6.5 percent, compared with 4.6 percent in 2002.
Inflation, at 1.7 percent, was contained below the 3 percent ceiling set by the WAEMU convergence
criteria.

8.       The money supply rose by 9 percent in 2003, or slightly more than nominal GDP. For the
reasons noted earlier, having to do with non-project external assistance, net credit to government
from the banking system rose more than planned and the treasury respondedby issuing new notes.
Nevertheless, domestic financing to government at the end of December was within the limits
establishedby the program.

9.       On the external front, the current-account deficit in the balance o f payments (including
official transfers) stood at 8.1 percent of GDP in 2003, lower than initially forecast (9.4 percent),
compared with 9.8 percent in 2002. Much of this improvement in the external accounts was due to
the favorable performance of world cotton prices, thanks to which exports grew more strongly than
imports.



                                                  59

10.      The sound economic performance described above is attributable to the agriculture sector,
which yielded a cereals surplus in the order o f 1,000,000 tons, helpingthereby to ease pressure on
market prices. Cotton output also achieved a record level o f 500,000 tons, up by nearly 24 percent
from the previous year. This meant cash incomes o f more than CFAF 90 billion for producers, and
provided a boost for services (transportation) and industries. These results reflect in large part the
convergence o f favorable factors such as a good rainy season, a 10 CFA franc per kilo increase inthe
producer price for cotton, and stable prices for agricultural inputs, all o f which promoted an increase
inthe areaunder cultivation, and an improvement inagricultural yields.

11.      Nevertheless, the economy continues to suffer negative fallout from the Cbte d'Ivoire crisis,
particularly in the secondary and tertiary sectors in the western part o f the country, where reopening
of the border with Cbte d'Ivoire has not really sparked the expected recovery in trade between the
two countries, because o f persistent security problems on the main roads. Economic operators have
nevertheless diversified their channels for moving products and supplies, as part o f the process o f
adapting the economy to this real shock and to the rising transportation costs resulting from regional
tensions. Increasing traffic has caused heavy deterioration to the roads leading towards Mali and
Niger, and aprogram to upgradethose routeshashad to be undertaken

12.      The 2003 budget performance was on the whole satisfactory. Revenues exceeded forecasts
by 0.4 percent o f GDP (CFAF 9 billion), despite failure o f the WAEMU to remit more than 90
percent o f compensation payments for losses under the preferential community tariff (CFAF 6.5
billion), This good outcome reflects several factors, primarily the healthy business profits that were
earned in 2002 (and which produced substantial revenue for the government through investment
income and the industrial and commercial profits tax), and stricter tax enforcement, particularly for
the value addedtax (VAT).

13.      The trends innon-capital expenditure and net externally-financed loans were also as planned,
despite the shortfall o f nearly 36 billion CFA francs that was recorded in drawings o f budgetary
support (25 billion) and HIPC assistance (11 billion). These shortfalls were partially offset by the
government's own surplus and by accessing the domestic financial market, and the government had
to adjust its targets for domestically financed capital spending in order to respect program objectives.

14.      In this context, the primary budget deficit stood at CFAF 89 billion at the end of December
2003, compared with the target o f CFAF 106 billion. Nevertheless, the significant shortfall in flows
of budgetary assistance and funding under the HIPC initiative during the second half o f the year led
to the buildup o f expenditure commitments for which no payment orders were issued (DENM) in
2003, including some for social spending financed with HIPC resources.

15.      The budget law for 2004, which was voted in December 2003, is consistent with the fiscal
objectives of the three-year program covering the period 2003-2006, which call for containing the
government fiscal deficit on a commitments basis, including spending financed by HIPC resources,
to around 9.5 percent o f GDP, and improving the primary balance by 1.1 percentage points to        - 2.9
percent of GDP in2004. The budgetrespects the PRSP priorities: apart from externally-financed and
debt-financed projects, significant envelopes are earmarked for basic education (14.5 percent o f total
spending, including HIPC), health (10.5 percent), rural development (6 percent) and infrastructure
(4.1 percent). These allocations do not include appropriations for public utilities (water, electricity,
telephone) which are included under current interministerial spending (CFAF 16.5 billion, o f which
about 3 billion for health and 0.7 billion for basic education).




                                                    60

16.     The 2004 budget is based on a series of administrative measures designedto reinforce tax
collection and customs revenues, to expand the tax base, and to control expenditure growth, while
improving the capacity to absorb HIPC resources. The intent is to increase fiscal revenues and to
pursue efforts to rationalize spending, which are essential ifmore funds are to be devoted to priority
sectors.

17.     Recognizingthat the weakness infiscal revenues is a major concern, the government adopted
an action plan in December 2003 to strengthen the tax and customs administrations. That plan calls
for prompt implementation of the following measures: (i)closer control over major taxpayers, by
establishing a large-taxpayers unit with national authority (by the end o f September 2004); (ii)
computerizing the tax administration; (iii)introducing a new taxpayer identification system (by the
end of June 2004); and (iv) modernizing customs administration by strengtheningcustoms valuation
procedures and introducingthe new ASYCUDA data processing system inthe main customs offices
(by the end o f April 2004). This action plan, progress under which will be regularly evaluated with
IMFtechnical assistance, should produce an increase infiscal revenues from 11.1 percent of GDP in
2003 to 12.2percent in2004.

Promoting theprivate sector

18.     A number of steps were taken during 2003 to improve the business climate and the
competitiveness o f the national economy. The government is firmly committed to speeding up
reform in the cotton sector and in telecommunications and energy, as well as to privatization o f the
remaining public enterprises in its portfolio.

19.     Efforts to improve the business climate focused on a publicity and outreach campaign
relating to OHADA provisions, through the program for strengthening democracy, the rule o f law,
and governance (PADEG). The government has also continued to work actively with its private
sector partners to find ways and means of alleviating formalities for launching businesses, as a
hrtherimprovement to the businessclimate.

20.     With respect to the cotton sector, the process o f selling two zones in the east and central
cotton-growing districts is now in its final phase and invitations for technical prequalification were
issued on May 30, 2003. The firms selectedfollowing technical prequalificationhave been invitedto
submit their financial bids on February 13,2004, and these bids have been opened on April 6,2004.
The entry o f new operators should boost the cotton sector and improve its productivity, which is
already among the highest inthe world.

21.     With respect to telecommunications, after liberalization o f the mobile telephone segment,
which led to a substantial decline in communication costs and has expanded access to telephone
services, efforts are now focusing on finalizing the privatization o f the historic operator (ONATEL),
after spinning off its cellular business. The bids have been launched in December 2003, and the
financial bids must be deposited by the end o f April 2004: this is one month later than initially
scheduled, because o f bidders' requests for additional information relating to the concession
documents.

22.     In the energy sector, a new step with the planned reforms was taken with the government's
adoption o f an option for structuring the electricity subsector, thereby opening the way to firther
progress, in particular the startup o f work to expand SONABEL's thermal production capacity
(purchase o f a 14 MW power station)               and the ambitious project for the Bobo-



                                                  61

Dioulasso/Ouagadougouinterconnection,for which donor consultationswere held on March 26. As
regards the petroleum sector, the Council of Ministers examined the dossier on March 31, 2004 in
and instructedthe concernedministerialdepartmentsto finalize the dossier and submit it for decision
at itsnext session.

23.     With respect to other enterprises remaining in the government portfolio, procedures have
now begun for privatizingseven units:the BurkinaPrecious MetalsExchange(CBMP), the National
InformationProcessingCenter (CENATARIN), the SilmandC and IndCpendanceHotels, the National
Water Wells Office (ONPF), the nationaldrug company (MCdicaments du Faso, MEDIFA), and the
General EqualizationFund(Caisse GCnCralede PCrCquation, CGP).

1.2. Ensuring basic social services for the poor

24.     Humanresource development is indispensable for sustainableeconomic development.Aware
of Burkina Faso's weakness in this area, the government has assigned top priority to programs to
providebasic educationandhealthservices.

Basic education

25.     During 2003 the government continued to implement the 10-year basic education
developmentplan (PDDEB), with support from itstechnical and financial partners. Substantialhnds
continueto be earmarked for the sector, in line with the various commitmentsthat the government
has made to expand infrastructure and recruit more teachers for the new classrooms. These efforts
have led to a sharp improvement in basic education indicators. Thus, forecasts for the school year
2003-2004 by the Ministry of Basic Education and Literacy (MEBA) predict a jump of 13.7
percentage points, to 66.6 percent, in the first-year gross enrollment rate (60.5 percent for girls and
71.1 percent for boys). The gross enrollment rate in primary school has passed the symbolic
threshold of 50 percent, and now stands at 52.3 percent compared with 45.1 percent in 2002-2003,
while the gender parity indicator is trendingtowards equality inthis area by 2005 (45.17 percent for
girls and 54.83 percentfor boys).The inthe 20 provinceswith the lowestenrollment levels, there has
been a remarkable improvement in admission rates and literacy rates, thanks in large part to the
additionalcontributionofHIPC resources.

26.     These results reflect a determined commitment on the part of the highest government
authorities and o f all education partners, who have multiplied their efforts to give effect to the
PDDEB and to move towards the 2015 objective of universal enrollment, consistent with the
millenniumdevelopment goals. In pursuit of this commitment, a social awareness and mobilization
campaign has been launched, and a number of specific measures have been implemented: first-year
enrollment is now compulsory for all children who meet the entrance requirements, textbooks and
school supplies are providedfree in the 20 priority provinces, first-year enrollment fees are waived
for girls, subsidized or self-supporting canteens have been introduced, and the National Fund for
LiteracyandNon-FormalEducation(FONAENF) is beingactivated.

Health sewices

27.     Following the donors roundtable in June 2003, designed to put together hnding for the
PNDS, the HealthMinistry devoted itself to preparingan action plan and introducing a device for
managing its implementation.It has continued preventionefforts through vaccination programs for
poliomyelitis and the distribution of vitamin A to children under five years. At the same time, the



                                                  62

health services inspectionoffice has finalized in March2004 the verification on a samplingbasis of
observance of the new price structure for subsidized drugs and certain medical services, announced
in February 2003. This verification should confirm the results of the survey of public healthsystem
users conducted as part of the PRSP evaluation, showing that prices are moving in the desired
direction.

28.     In its human resource management policy, the government has sought to provide health
regions and districts with qualified operatingpersonnel, through the assignment of training school
graduates.

29.     The government has also providedfor a 10percent increase in budgetarysub-appropriations
to the decentralizedhealthservices, ina moveto improveoperationofthe healthdistricts.

30.     The government hadplannedto prepare a medium-termexpenditureframework (MTEF) for
managingthe PNDS, but this was delayed by capacity problemswithin the department. This work
has nowbeen rescheduledfor 2004, with support from the WorldBank.

1.3. Expandingopportunitiesfor the poor to find employment and earn incomes

31.     Resultsfrom the third prioritiessurvey show that the incidenceof poverty is highest in rural
areas. The government's continued attention to the agricultural sector reflects this finding. During
2003, it stepped up its support for initiatives to expand and diversify income sources for rural
dwellers, while keeping a close watch on developments in the cotton sector, now in the process of
reform.

32.     Cotton is Burkina Faso's most important export, and it is also the primary source of rural
incomes.Based on the 2003-2004 harvest of 500,000 tons of seed cotton, it is estimated that more
thanCFAF 90 billionwas paidto producers in2003.

33.     The government has also continued to promote small-scale village irrigation projects as a
way o f providingemploymentduringthe dry season. After two years of experimentation,the results
confirm that this activity can contribute to achievingthe objective of food security in BurkinaFaso,
which is subject to the vagaries o frainfall. The number ofproducers engaged inthese projectsinthe
country's 13 regions increased from 9,616 during the crop year 2001-2002to 14,159 in 2002-2003,
including 5,268 women. These figures reflect the enthusiasm generated by this program, which is
funded under the HIPC initiative. Two crops are involved, namely corn and cowpeas, for which
output in 2002-2003 was 24,636 tons and 285 tons respectively,compared with 1,330 tons and 172
tons in the precedingyear. Estimatessuggest that, depending on the zone, the use of pedal-powered
water pumps can mean a gross return to the producer of between CFAF 86,370 and CFAF 363,590
per hectare for corn, and between CFAF 780 and CFAF 10,890 for cowpeas.

34.     It should also be noted that most rural development projects and programs include a
component for promotingincome generatingactivities, through microcreditsor the establishmentof
a local development fund. This category includesthe Second National Land Management Program,
NBGT 11, which during 2000-2002 helped rural people to set up 600 village land management
committees (CVGT) and invested some CFAF 912 million in target zones, of which 395 million
through the village offices and 517 million through the provincialoffices. Finally, there have been a
number of important private initiatives, such as the Agricultural Industries Promotion Company
(SOPROFA) which, with governmentsupport, is promotingthe developmentof food crops. In2002-



                                                  63

2003 this company injected around CFAF 13 billion into the rural economy, resulting in the
productiono f25,000 tons ofpaddy rice, 8,000 tons ofsesame, and 12,000tons oftomatoes, mangoes
and green beans.

35.      The government has continued its efforts to support employment and vocational training by
improving the performance o f existing facilities, by expanding enrollment, coaching and teaching
capacities for the occupational assessment and training centers (CEFP) of Ouagadougou, Bobo-
Dioulasso, Ouahigouya, DCdougou, Tougan, Banfora, Kaya, and Fada N'Gourma. This will enable
them to train more than 600 young people every year in automotivemechanics, electricity, ironwork,
masonry, and leather work, thereby giving them the opportunity to integrate themselves into the
economythroughqualifiedemploymentor self-employment.

1.4. Promoting good governance

36.      Significant progress has been made in all aspects of governance. Strengtheningdemocracy
and the rule of law and improving fiscal management mechanisms remained at the center of
government concernsthroughout 2003.

37.      Interms of democratic governance, the intentionhas beento ensure that existingrepublican
institutions function properly, by refining the mechanisms that govern the democratic rules of the
game for the various players in Burkina Faso's political life. For example, in preparation for the
scheduled2005 presidentialandmunicipalelections, the Independent NationalElectoralCommission
(CENI) has undertakenaprojectto computerize the voters lists.

38.      The new senior judicial bodies resulting from the reform of the justice system are all
operationaltoday. The Constitutional Court is now examining the outcomes of the 2002 legislative
elections, and a number of draft laws ratifying various agreements and conventions. The Court of
Accounts has been very busy since its establishment in response to the government's efforts to
overcome the backloginthe renderingofpublic accounts. The programto consolidatethe democratic
process, the rule of law, and good governance, implemented with the help of several development
partners, is supporting government efforts to strengthen the capacities of players both within
government and incivil society.

39.      Consolidatingeconomic governance is a constant challenge for Burkina Faso in the context
of implementingthe PRSP, one with which many o f itspartners are assistingby providingbudgetary
support and leaving to the government the responsibility for allocating resources in light of its
declared priorities. This requires a much greater degree of accountability, which in turn demands
budgetary management tools and mechanisms that will ensure transparency in the use of public
funds.

40.      Since 1997, Burkina Faso has been engaged in a process to strengthenfiscal management,
with the institution of a computerized, integratedexpenditure system (CID), which was followed
subsequently by an integrated government accounting system (CIE) and a government personnel
administrativeand salary management system (SIGASPE). Since 1999 it has also beenworkingwith
new, complementary tools that have improved the budget programmingprocess (program budget,
medium-term expenditure framework, and the public spending review). These tools have been
refined each year, and are producing greater consistency between PRSP priorities and the
government budget, which is now framed interms ofthe MTEF envelopes.




                                                64

41.     Thus. as in 2003, the 2004 budget has been prepared on the basis of the 2004-2006 MTEF
envelopes that was adopted on April 30,2003. It was established in accordance with PRSP priorities
and attached to the budget circular for the fiscal year 2004. The budget law was approved by the
National Assembly on December 19,2003.

42.     Under the action plan for strengthening budgetary management (PRGB) adopted in 2002 to
improve permanently the transparency, reliability and effectiveness o f budget management, consistent
with PRSPobjectives, the following actionshavebeenundertaken:

    e   Parliamentary approval ofthe auditedbudget act for 2001; the draft audited budget act for 2002
        has been under examination by the Court o f Accounts since the beginning o f this year, and
        once that body has confirmed its conformity it will be submitted to the National Assembly.
        Provisions are now being made to preparethe audited budget act for the year 2003 and submit
        it to the National Assembly by the end of December 2004, pursuant to the budgetary
        framework act promulgated inOctober 2003.
    e   Consistent with studies o f the CFAA, the ROSC and the PRGB, the government has make up
        the backlog inthe production oftreasury account balancesto the year 2002, produced regularly
        monthly treasury account balancessince March 2003, and inDecember2003 it submitted to the
        Court o fAccounts an administrative audit o fthe individual accounts o f public accountants for
        the years 1984-2000.
    e   Preparation o fthe 2004 budget usingthe WAEMU nomenclature adopted inMay 2003.
    e   In light of the pilot experiment in Bobo-Dioulasso, deconcentration of payment order
        authorization (issuance of payment orders) for budgetary expenditures to four additional
        regional capitals (Ouahigouya, Kaya, Koudougou, and Tenkodogo).
    e   Preparation o f a draft decree for concessions and leasing to complete the decree on public
        purchases.
    e   Firstexamination by the governmentofa new statute for the Office ofthe Inspector General of
        Finance.
    a   Validation o f standardtexts for the application o f the new regulation for public purchases and
        verification o f application o f the new government purchasing rules by the General Finance
        InspectorateinFebruary 2004.

43.     When it comes to local governance, work continued in 2003 on revising the regulations
governing decentralization, following the creation in 2001 o f 13 regions. The technical work is now
completed, and it remains to finalize the political aspects to set in motion further progress. The
nomination o f governors, initially expected for 2003, had to be delayed for three reasons: 1/ The
revision in August 2003 o fthe decentralization laws by the National Assembly; 2/ the needto pursue
further the discussions between the ministry in charge o f decentralization and other ministries
concerned to find a sustainable financial framework; and 3/ the putting inplace o f favorable political
conditions.

2. THE OUTLOOKFOR2004-2005

44.     The government has recently adopted a revised PRSP that includes a program o f priority
actions for implementing it, drawing lessons from the three years o f experience with the first PRSP
and from the new poverty profile resultingfrom the third priorities survey conducted in 2003. In its
poverty reduction efforts it will be guided by this revised PRSP and it invites all its development
partners to do the same.



                                                   65

2.1. Economic growth andjob creation

45.      On the macroeconomic front, the government intends to consolidate achievements to date
with its new three-year program now underway, supported by the IMF's Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility.

Themacroeconomicframework andBnancing of thePRSP

46.      Projections for 2004-2005 based on the first program review point to continuing growth, at a
rate o f something over 5 percent, inflation at around 2 percent, and an external current-account
deficit below 12percent o f GDP.

47.      These projections nevertheless fall well short o f what is needed for comprehensive
implementation o f the PRSP priority actions plan, which is based on an ambitious hypothesis o f 7
percent average growth over the period 2004-2006, the rate considered necessary for making
significant inroads against poverty. The scope o f financing requirements i s such that all of Burkina
Faso's technical and financial partners will need to commit themselves firmly in support o f the
government's efforts. This commitment could consist o f steps to sensitize the international
community to provide additional resources, consistent with the spirit o f the Monterrey Consensus
and the various initiatives adopted to speed up achievement o f the millennium development goals.
The World Bank's poverty reduction strategy credits will help to meet these concerns, thanks to their
volume and their operational flexibility.

48.      For the government, the budget represents the principal instrument for financing the
antipoverty campaign, and it will take the required steps to increase domestic resource mobilization,
keeping to the schedule in the action plan o f measures to improve revenue collection, adopted in
2003. One o f the main objectives o f the new program negotiated with the IMF for 2003-2006 is to
raise tax ratios gradually towards the average o f the WAEMU zone. This objective will be a central
focus of government attention in2004 and 2005, as reflected inthe fiscal operations (TOFE).

Economic competitivenessandpromotion of theprivate sector

49.      Inagriculture, efforts will be focused over the next two years on two major tasks: completing
the restructuring ofthe cotton sector, and supporting initiatives to diversify agricultural output.

50.      An initial and concrete result of reform in the key cotton sector will be to strengthen the
competitiveness o f agriculture and o f the agri-food industry, once the transfer o f SOFITEX assets in
the center and east o f the country is completed within the next few months. Following signature o f
the transfer agreements, a new industry association and a new regulatory framework will have to be
set up. The government will also undertake by end 2005 to adopt a text to consolidate and harmonize
texts governing the relationship between the various players in the rural sector, notably functions
transferred or delegated to OPA, CRA the industry association, the private sector.

51.      Further steps towards diversification are another priority for coming years, with the
introduction o faction plans for cereal, oilseed and cowpea producers.

52.      Further reforms in telecommunications and energy will result in transferring the assets o f
ONATEL, as called for in the privatization plan, and the regulatory and legal framework will be
updated in accordance with the government's strategies for the future o f the electricity and



                                                   66

hydrocarbons subsectors. The scope for private sector participation in managing the energy sector
will thus be more clearly defined.

53.      The government has set up the Burkina Faso Enterprise Office (Maison de I'Entreprise du
BurkinaFaso, MEBF), as part o fthe project to support competitiveness and business development. It
will also take steps to improve the legal and judicial environment for establishing a business, by
strengthening the "one-stop shops" that streamline the formalities for persons seeking to set up a
business, and it will adopt a new labor code, while continuing its re-examination o f labor market
legislation and regulations. The revision of regulations governing commercial distribution and
external trade will facilitate trade by setting clear rules o f the game in order to combat fraud and
unfair competition. The Strengthening o f FASONORM and the Trade Point will help to make the
country's exports more competitive.

2.2. Human resourcedevelopment

Basic education

54.      The PDDEB's objectives are to achievean enrollment rate of 70 percent and a literacy rate of
40 percent. The multi-pronged activities under this program will be intensified in 2004 in order to
make up for the initial delay in its implementation. This will involve finalizing the education MTEF
(including secondary education, scientific instruction and scientific research) so as to assess available
resources more accurately and allocate them more effectively among components o f the education
system, with a view to the millennium goals. In order to make schooling more available in rural
areas, school subsidies inthe 20 provinces with the lowest enrollment rates will be continued and, to
meet concerns about the quality o f education, a study will be made o f the actual number o f hours
devoted to teaching. As well, expenditureperformance will be evaluated on the basis o f surveys and
administrative statistics.

55.      Inadditionto continued efforts to encouragethe enrollment ofchildren inrural areas through
school subsidies in the 20 priority provinces, the PDDEB will be updated in2005 to reflect the need
to expand the concept of basic education in line with the education policy letter and new education
initiatives ("Education for All", the MillenniumDevelopment Goals, the 25-2005 initiative, etc.)

56.      The government will pay close attention to the recommendations from the various reviews o f
the PDDEB that are held semiannually with all program donors and basic education partners. These
efforts should result in a significant improvement in basic education indicators by 2005, especially in
rural areas.

Health

57.      Actions in the health field will continue to be guided by the PNDS. The preparation o f a
health MTEF will serve to determine financial needs for achieving the health-related millennium
development goals. Approaches that have been proven successfbl, such as free vaccination and free
distribution o f vitamin A, will be pursued, and ways and means o f strengthening nutrition programs
will be sought.

58.      Further thought will be given to designing a system to subsidize emergency obstetrical care
in line with the objective o f increasing the rate o f assisted childbirths, by reducing the cost of these




                                                   67

services for women. The preventioncomponent ofthe anti-malariacampaign will be reinforcedwith
subsidiesfor impregnatedmosquitonets andtreatment costs.

59.      When it comes to drinking water and sanitation, the 2000 framework document will be
reviewed to take into account institutional developments. During 2004, an action plan will be
developed for public-private partnerships in urban areas. The government will also define the
investments and financing necessary to implement the action plan to attain the Millennium
DevelopmentGoals.

60.     The government has seized upon the review of the PRSP as an opportunity to extend the
secondtheme of the initial strategy to social protection.Consistent with this concern to provide better
protectionto at-risk groups, the government will develop two strategic frameworks are for providing
care to orphans and other vulnerable children, and for dealingwith social cases in the schools. These
will be followedby anationwidestudy ofthe elderly, inorder to target policy for this group.

2.2. Promoting goodgovernance

61.     On the political front, 2004 will be devoted to preparing for the upcoming presidentialand
municipal elections, scheduled for 2005.

62.     In terms of local governance, the government is determinedto make decentralization work,
but it recognizesthat it must proceedcarefully, preparingthe way by adopting a legal framework for
devolution in order to ensure that the process of establishingthe region as a decentralizedentity is
sound and irreversible. Finalizationof the software for computerizinglocal government accounting
(CICL) will help to ensure that the communes have the capacity to make proper use of resource
transfers. Continued deconcentration of payment orders will also contribute to this objective. The
entire framework will become fully operational with the putting in place of local personnel, namely
the nominationof governorsfor the regionsduring2004.

63.     Economic governance will be enhanced through the activities described in the PRGB,
including:

        Adoption of regulations for applying the budget framework law, consistent with WAEMU
        directiveson fiscal harmonization.
        Adoption of budget laws for 2005 and 2006 on the basis of the 2005-2007 and 2006-2008
        MTEFceilings, consistent with PRSPobjectives.
        Preparationof a timetable for the regular productionof accounts of public accountants in the
        futureand for the submissionofthese accounts for 2001and2002 to the Audit Court.
        Continued implementation in 2004 of the integrated revenue system, and starting in 2005,
        development ofthe system and implementationofthe first modules.
        Implementationof the actions for the integrationof foreign-financed capital spending in the
        budgetprocess, on the basis ofAFRITAC missionrecommendations.
        Finalization and adoption of the decree regulating concessions and leasing contracts and
        computerizingthe governmentprocurementmonitoring system.
        Adopting and implementingan action plan for introducinga goods accountingsystem, to be
        operationalin2005.

        Recognizing the importance of the program budget in the budgetary programming process,
the governmentwill take steps to have ministriesand institutionsmaster and makeuse of this tool. It


                                                  68

will implement the recommendations from the overall and sectoral public spending reviews as well
as from the audit of HIPC initiative spending, in order to improve the process for allocating
budgetaryappropriationswithin and between sectors. A particulareffort will be made, as of 2005, to
shortenthe time bywhich sub-appropriationsare madeavailableafter adoptionofthe budget.

65.    In terms of environmental impact reviews, the government will continue to strengthen the
relevant institutions' capacities to conduct environmental and development evaluations, by
establishing units within ministerial departments in accordance with the commitments made in the
environmentalanalysispaperpreparedin supportofthe fourthPRSC.

66.    The government of Burkina Faso remains convinced that the programs and measures
described above are appropriate in the context of implementingthe priority actions program of the
PRSP. They have beenadopted in support ofthe nextpovertyreductionstrategy credits (PRSC) from
the World Bank, and they should help to consolidate the macroeconomic framework and support
stronger, sounder and more sustainable economic growth, as is needed for a significant reductionin
poverty.

     Obiet : Lettre de Politiquede Dkveloppement

     Monsieur le President,

     1. L a prtsente lettre de politique de diveloppement (LPD) a pour objet de rendre compte
     de l'evolution rkcente de la situation iconomique et sociale du Burkina Faso et de ses
     perspectives au cours des deux prochaines annees, Elle s'appuiera B cet tgxd d'une part,
     s u r le rapport consolid6 de la troisitme annee de mise en oeuvre du Cadre stratigque de
     lutte contre la pauvrett (CSLP) produit en septembre 2003, et d'autre part, sur le
     programme d'actions prioritaires du CSLP revise prtsente A la communautk internationale
     lors de la quatrieme table ronde genirale des partenaires au dkveloppement du Burkina
     Faso tenue les 4 et 5 mars 2004 iOuagadougou, en mettant l'accent s u r l'exicuuon par le
     gouvernement du programme de riformes (dans les divers domaines du CSLP) soutenu
     notamment par des crtdits d'appui a la stratege de rtduction de la pauvrete (CASRP) de la
     Banque Mondiale.

     2. Au plan iconomique, l'annee 2003 qui avait debuti dans un contexte de grandes
     incertitudes du fait notamment de la persistance de la crise ivoirienne, s'est en difinitive
     bien achevke avec une croissance iconomique plus vigoureuse que prkvu. En effet, grlce 1
     une bonne saison agricole, une rapide adaptation des optrateurs iconomiques au choc Cree
     par la situation en C8te d'Ivoire et une gestion budgetaire pmdente, l'activite iconomique a
     progress6 de 6,5 O/o contre 4'4 Yo en 2002, alors que les previsions tablaient sur un
     ralentissement durythme de la croissance A 2,6 YO.

     3. L'exercice d'kaluation de la troisieme annie de mise en oeuvre du CSLP s'est diroulk
     courant j d e t 2003. Le rapport consolidt sur la periode 2000-2002 etabli par le
     gouvernement fait ressortir des progrks dans la mise en oeuvre des riformes dans les
     secteurs prioritakes, mais souligne l'importance des efforts restant 1 accomph pour
     atteindre les objectifs du millinaire pour le diveloppement 1l'horizon 2015. I1 interpelle
     l'ensemble des acteurs du developpement,         notamment les partenaires techniques et
     financiers,  B acctlirer la mise en place des ressources requises en vue de permettre
     d'engager les actions necessaires pour relever les indicateurs sociaux.                   F

     4. L'annee 2003 a etk igalement marquee par la conduite du processus de revision du
     document - cadre de stratkge nationale de lutte contre la pauvrete, avec une large
     participation de l'ensemble des acteurs, isavoir les administrations, les partenakes au
     developpement et ceux de la sociiti civile. L e processus a kte couronne par la tenue
     d'assises nationales debut octobre 2003 au cours desquelles des contributions ont kte
     recueillles au sein des diffkrents groupes thimatiques privus par le Qspositif institutionnel
      de suivi de la mise en Ceuvre du CSLP. L e document revise a ttk enrichi d'un programme

I- ETAT DE MISE EN CEWRE DU CADRE STRATEGIOUE DE LUTTE
      CONTRELA PATJVRETE:APPORT DES CASRP
      5. L'objectif de reduction de la pauvretk est demeurk la trame des actions du
     gouvernement burkinabi tout au long de l'annke 2003. L e budget de l'Etat a inscnt ce souci
      au premier plan des prioccupations, nonobstant l'environnement empreint d'incertimdes
      ayant prisid.6 ison elaboration. L e gouvemement a ainsi accentuC les efforts de reformes
      budgetaires et de celles des programmes sectoriels en cours soutenues par les CASRP de la
   ~



      Banque Mondiale.

      6. Si d'une manikre genkrale des avanckes notables ont Ctk enregistries au cows de la
      pCriode recente, ilconvient de relever que certaines mesures n'ont pas pu Otre m i s en
      muvre dans les dClais prkvus o u connaissent des lenteurs dans leur exicution. I1en est ainsi
      de :
      -  la nomination des gouvemeurs de regions, retardCe par les dilais nkcessaires pour la
         relecture des textes &orientation de la dkcentralisation
      -  la reforme de la fihkre coton, dont le processus a C t i freine par deux facteurs : d'une
         part, le recours de l'un des soumissionnaires ila commission d'arbitrage, et d'autre part,
         le report de la date d'ouverture           des offres financikres pour permettre aux
          soumissionnaires de tenir compte de prCcisions apporties aux modahis de
         presentation de l'offre ;
      -   l'adoption du cadte riglementaire du sous-secteur ClectricitC qui n'a pu se faire en
         raison du retard pris dans l'adoption de l'option de structuration du sous-secteur dont
         la premikre version a nicessiti un approfondissement souhaiti par le gouvemement
         aprks unpremier examen en octobre 2003.

 1.1-  ACCELERER L A CROISSANCE ECONOMIOUE ETL A FONDER SUR L'EOUITE

      7. L'economie burkinabi a enregistrC une croissance remarquable en 2003, au regard
      notamment de l'environnement dans lequel elle a CvoluC. En effet, le t a u de croissance,
      projeti i2,6 YOen debut d'annCe, a atteint 6,5 YOen 2003 contre 4,6% en 2002. L a hausse
      des prix, ktablie i1,7%, a i t 6 contenue en dessous du plafond de 3% furi par les critkres
      de convergence de YUEMOA.

      8. L a masse monktaire s'est accrue de 9 % en 2003, soit ligkrement plus que le PIB
     nominal. Pour les raisons Cvoquies plus haut concemant l'assistance extirieure hors
     projets, le credit net du systkme bancaire il'Etat a augment6 plus que prim et le trCsor a
     procidk ide nouvelles Omissions de bons. Toutefois, le niveau du tinancement intirieur de
     1'Etat a Ctk contenu il'intkrieur des h t e s h i e s par le programme ihndicembre.

     9. Dans le secteur extkrieur, le dificit du compte courant de la balance des paiements
     compris transferts officiels) s'est Ctablii8,l '/o duPIB en 2003, soit iunniveauplus faible
     que prem initialement (9,4%) contre 9,s Yo YOen 2002. L a bonne tenue du coton sur les
     marches mondiaux, i Yorigme d'une croissance plus forte des exportations que des
     importations, explique pour une large partie cette amilioration des comptes exterieurs. P

                                                           71

  10.Les performances iconomiques susvisies sont imputables au secteur apcole qui a
  digagk un excident ckrialier de l'ordre de 1.000.000 tonnes, qui a contribui iune ditente
  des pfix sur le marchi. L a production cotonniitre a igalement atteint un niveau record i
  500.000 tonnes, soit une hausse de prits de 24 YOpar rapport A l'annke pricidente. Cela
  reprisente pour les producteurs des revenus versis de plus de 90 mdhards FCFA et une
  stimulation pour les services (transports) et les industries. Ces rksultats tiennent pour une
  large part ila conjugiuson de facteurs favorables tels que la bonne saison des pluies, au
  rel2vement du prix effectif au producteur de coton de 10 francs CFA par lulo et le maintien
  des prix des intrants apcoles, qui ont favorisi une augmentation des superficies emblavies
  et l'amilioration des rendements agricoles.

   11.L'activiti Cconomique continue cependant de ressentir l'impact nigatif de la cnse
  ivoirienne, notamment dans les secteurs secondaire et teriiaire il'ouest du pays oh la
  riouverture de la fronditre avec la C6te d'Ivoire n'a pas viritablement entrain6 la reprise
  escomptie des ichanges entre les deux pays, du fait de la persistance des problitmes de
1

  sicuriti sur les routes. Les opirateurs iconomiques ont nianmoins diversifii les voies
  d'ivacuation et les sources d'approvisionnement, engageant ainsi l'adaptation de l'iconomie
  au choc r i e l et   l'accroissement des coiits de transport imposks par les tensions sous
  rigionales. L'intensification du trafic avec le passage du transit vers le Mali et l e Niger a
  fortement digradi les routes, obligeant h la mise en aeuvre d'un programme de
  renforcement des routes.

   12.L e budget 2003 a i t i exicuti dans l'ensemble de maniitre satisfaisante. Les
  recouvrements de recettes ont dipassi de 0,4    O/o duPIB (9 &ards      FCFA) les privisions,
  en dipit du non reversement par l'UEMOA de plus de 90 Yo des compensations de moins
  values au titre de la taxe prifirentielle communautaire (6,5 mihards). Ces bons risultats
  tiennent iplusieurs facteurs, mais principalement aux importants bknifices digagis par les
  entreprises en 2002 (qui ont ginkri pour l'Etat des revenus substantiels en matiitre de
  revenu du portefeuille et au titre de l'imp6t sur les binifices industriels et commerciaux) et
  aux efforts de renforcement des contr6les fiscaux, notamment en matiitre de taxe sur la
  valeur ajoutie P A ) .

   13. Les dipenses hors investissement et pr&s nets financis sur ressources extirieures ont
  i t i globalement exkcuties comme privu, malgri des moins values de prits de 36 d a r d s
  sur la mobilisation des appuis budgitaires (25 d a r d s ) et de l'assistance PPTE (11
  h r d s ) . Ces moins values ont i t i partiellement compensies par le surplus de recettes
  propres et un recours au marchi financier intirieur, et le gouvemement a dii opirer des
  ajustements h la baisse des dipenses d'investissement sur ressowces propres pour
  permettre de respecter les objectifs du programme.

   14. Dans ce contexte, le dificit de base du budget de l'Etat s'est itabli i89 d a r d s de
  francs CFA i fin dkcembre 2003 pour un repitre de 106 milliards de francs CFA.
  Nianmoins, les manques h gagner importants en matiitre de mobilisation &assistance
  budgktaire et au titre de l'initiative PPTE au cows du deuxiitme semestre a induit un
  accroissement de l'encours des dipenses engagkes et non mandaties (DENTvf)en 2003, y
  compris au titre des dipenses sociales financies sur ressources PPTE.

  15. L a loi de finances pour l'annie 2004votie en dCcembre 2003 s'inscrit dans le cadre des
  objectifs du programme triennal couvrant la piriode 2003-2006 qui vise, au plan des
  finances publiques, i conterk le dificit des opirations hnanciitres de l'Etat, base
  engagements, y compris les dipenses sur ressources PPTE, autour de 9,5 YOdu PIB et i
  amiliorer le solde de base de 1,l point h -2,9 Yo du PIB en 2004. Le budget adopti respecte
  les prioritis du CSLP en assurant, hors projets sur financements extirieurs et dette, des
  enveloppes consiquentes aux secteurs de l'enseignement de base (14,5% des dipenses
  totales y compris PPTE), i la santi (10,5Yo) au dkveloppement mal (6%) et aux                 P
                                                      72

  infrastructures (4,10/0). Ces allocations ne tiennent pas compte des crkbts pour les services
  d'utdite publique (eau, klectricitk, tilkphone) gkris en dipenses communes (16,5 milliards
  dont environ 3 milllards pourla santi et 0,7 milllardpourl'enseignement de base).

   16.L e budget 2004 se fonde sur une sine de mesures a h s t r a d v e s visant irenforcer le
  recouvrement des imp& et des taxes douanitres, iklargir les bases taxables et imdtriser
  l'ivolution des dkpenses, tout en amiliorant la capaciti d'absorption des ressources PPTE.
  I1 s'agt de mobhser davantage de recettes propres et de poursuivre l'effort                de
  rationalisation des dipenses, nicessaire pour accroltre les ressources alloukes aux secteurs
  prioritaires.

   17. Conscient que la faiblesse des recettes propres constitue le principal sujet de
  prkoccupation dans le domaine des finances publiques, le gouvemement a adopt6 en
  dkcembre 2003 un plan d'action pour le renforcement des administrations fiscale et
  douaniire comprenant la mise en Oeuvre rapide des actions suivantes : (i)    renforcement du
  contrble des plus gros contribuables par l'itablissement d'une h e c t i o n des grandes
  entreprises B     compitence nationale (d'ici fin septembre 2004); (ii)    informatisation de
~

  l'adrmnistration des imp&;         (iii)introduction d'un nouveau systtme d'identification des
  contribuables (d'ici hn juin 2004); et (iv) modemisation de l'administration des douanes
  travers le renforcement du contr6le de la valeur et la mise en place de la nouvelle version
  dusysttme informatique SYDONIA dans les principaux bureaux de douanes (d'ici hnavnl
  2004). L a mise en ceuvre de ce plan d'action, dont les progrts seront ivaluks ri&&rement
  avec l'assistance technique du FMI, devraient permettre de porter les recettes fiscales de
   11,1% duPIB en 2003 i12,2 Yo en 2004.
  Promotion du secteurpn'vd
   18. Au cours de l'annie 2003, &verses actions dans le sens d'amkliorer l'environnement des
  affaires et la compdtitiviti de l'iconomie burkmabi ont kt6 conduites. L e gouvemement
  s'est risolument engagi iaccklirer les riformes de la filiire coton et des secteurs des
  tilicommunications et de l'inergie ainsi que la privatisation des entreprises publiques de
  son portefeuille risiduel.

   19.Les actions visant l'amdlioration du cadre d'exercice des affaires ont porte sur la
  poursuite de l'effort de vulgarisation et de diffusion des textes de YOHADA itravers les
  interventions du Programme d'appui au renforcement de la dimocratie, de l'Etat de droit
  et de la gouvemance (PADEG). I1 a aussi continui irechercher activement, par une
  concertation permanente avec les partenakes du secteur privi, les voies et moyens d'alliger
  les formalitis de criation d'entreprises et d'amiliorer davantage l'environnement des
  affaires.

  20. S'agssant du coton, le processus de cession des deux zones de l'Est et du centre, dont
  l'appel d'offres pour la pri-qualification technique a C t i land le 30 mai 2003, est
  aujourd'hui dans sa demitre phase. Les entreprises retenues aprks la pri-qualification
  technique ont i t 6 invities le 13 fivrier 2004 ideposer leurs offres financitres, dont le
  dipouillement est intervenu le 6 a d 2004. L'entrCe de nouveaux opirateurs dans la filikre
  devrait permettre de dynamiser le secteur et amiliorer sa productiviti, diji l'un des
  medleurs au plan mondial.

  21. En ce qui conceme le secteur des tdkcommunications, aprts la libiralisation du
  segment de la tiliphonie mobile qui a induit une baisse sensible des cofits des
  communications et favorisi le dkveloppement de l'acci.s          au tiliphone, les efforts se
  concentrent sur la finalisation du processus de privatisation de l'opirateur hstorique, en
  l'occurrence YONATEL, aprts une W s a t i o n de son activiti portant sur la tiliphonie
  c e l l b e . L'appel d'offres a i t 6 lanci en dicembre 2003 et les offies hnanci2res doivent
  &re diposies fin avril 2004, soit un dicalage d'un mois par rapport au calendtier initial,
  suite A des demandes d'informations complimentaires des soumissionnaires portant sur les
  documents de cession.                                                                         f

                                                         73

    22. Quant au processus de la rkforme du secteur de l'knerge, une nouvelle ktape vient
    d'itre franchie avec l'adoption le 24 mars 2004 par le gouvemement d'une option de
    structuration du sous-secteur de l'klectricitk, ouvrant la voie pour de nouvelles avanckes, en
    particuher le dkmarrage des travaux de renforcement des capacitks de production
    thermique de la S O N A B E L (acquisition d'une centrale de 14 MGW) et de ceux de
    l'ambitieux     projet    d'interconnexion   Bobo-Dioulasso    /   Ouagadougou,     dont une
    concertation des badleurs de fonds vient de se tenir le 26 mars 2004. Ence qui conceme le
    volet hydrocarbures, le conseil des rninistres a examink le 31 mars 2004 en premiire lecture
    le dossier, et instruit les dkpartements concernis 1le Gnaliser et le lui soumettre isa plus
    prochaine skance pour dkcision.

    23. Concemant les autres entreprises du portefede rksiduel, ilconvient de signaler le
    dkclenchement des processus de privatisation de sept unitks, i savoir le Comptok
    burkinabk des mktaux prkcieux (CBMP), le Centre national de traitement informatique
     (CENATRIN), les h6tels SILMANDE et INDEPENDANCE, l'Office national des puits
     et forages (ONPF), les Mkdcaments du Faso (MEDIFA) et la Caisse gCnkrale de

  ' pkrkquation (CGP).
1.2-   GARANTIR L'ACCESDESPAUVRESAUX SERVICESSOCIAUXDEBASE

     24. L e dkveloppement des ressources humaines est indispensable pour soutenir un
     dkveloppement kconomique durable. C'est conscient de la faiblesse du Burkina Faso dans
     ce domaine que le gouvemement a krigk au rang des premiires pdoritks les secteurs de
     l'kducation de base et de la santk et klabori des programmes pour promouvoir leur
     dkveloppement cohkrent.

    Acces aux services d'kducation de base

     25. L e gouvemement a poursuivi au cours de l'annke 2003 la mise en aeuvre du Plan
     decennal de dkveloppement de l'kducation de base (PDDEB), avec le soutien de ses
     partenaires techniques et financiers. Des ressources substantielles continuent d'ttre
     assurkes au secteur conformkment aux dlvers engagements pris en la matihre par le
     gouvernement, pour accroitre l'offre d'infrastructures et recruter davantage d'enseignants
     pour rendre fonctionnelles les nouvelles salles de classes. Ces efforts ont permis d'obtenir
     une nette amklioration des indcateurs de l'kducation de base. Ainsi, sur la base de la
     situation provisoire de la rentrke 2003-2004 ktabli par les services du W s t h r e de
     l'enseignement de base et de l'alphabktisation, (MEBA), le taux brut d'admission en
     premiire annke a enregistrk unbond de 13,7 points h GG,Go/o    en 2003-2004 (60,s   O/Opout les
     filles et 71,l O/opourles garqons).L etaux brutde scolarisationauprimairea franchila barre
     symbolique de 50 Yo en s'inscrivant i52,3       O/ocontre 45,l Yo en 2002-2003 et la tendance
     affichke par la paritk gargons/fYles laisse entrevoir l'kgalitk dans ce domaine dhs 2005
     (45,17% pour les a e s et 54,83      O/o pour les garqons). Dans les 20 provinces les moins
     scolariskes, l'apport addltionnel des ressources PPTE a ktC essentiel dans l'kvolution
     remarquable des dlvers indlcateurs, en particder des taux d'admission et d'alphabktisation.

     26. Les rksultats ci-dessus tiennent h un engagement rksolu des plus hautes autoritks de
     l'Etat et de l'ensemble des partenaires de l'kducation qui ont multiplik les concertations
     autour des problimes du secteur afin de favoriser la mise en auvre adkquate du PDDEB et
     progresser vers scolarisation universefle v i s i pour l'horizon 2015, confomkment a m
     objectifs de dkveloppement du d k n a i r e . Cet engagement, qui s'est traduit par la conduite
     d'une campagne de sensibksation et de mobrlisation sociale et la prise de mesures
     incitatives telles que l'obltgation d'inscription en premihre annke de tout enfant remplissant
     les condtions d'accis, la gratuitk des manuels et fournitures dans les 20 provinces
     prioritaires, la dispense de fiais de scolaritk en premihre annke pour les fYles et la
    promotion des cantines assistkes ou endoghnes, l'opkrationnalisation du Fonds national
     d'appui    l'alphabktisation et L l'kducation non formefle (FONAENF).L e gouvemement a
     rkcemment engagk l'klaboration d'un CDMT expkrimental pour le secteur de l'kducation.
     Ce document, dont la premihre version est en cows de validation est centrke sur g
                                                                                                    Y
                                                          74

     l'enseignement de base, sera finalisi en          intigrant le ministkre des enseignements
     secondaire, supirieur et de la recherche sciendfique.

    Acc&sa m services de santk
     27. Aprks la tenue en juin 2003 de la table ronde des badleurs de fonds pour riunir les
     ressources nicessaires au financement du PNDS, le ministkre de la santd s'est attelk i
     l'ilaboration d'un plan d'action et ia mise en place du lspositif de pilotage du plan. I1a
     poursuivi les actions de privention itravers les programmes de vaccination contre la
     poliomyilite et la lstribution concomitante de vitamine A aux enfants de 0 i 5 ans.
     Paralldement, l'Inspection ginirale des services de santi a achevi en mars 2004 la
     virification par Cchanallonnage de l'application de la nouvelle structure des pfix des
     mkdtcaments subventionnis et de certains actes milcaux, annoncie en fivrier 2003. Cette
     virification devrait permettre de confirmer ou d'infirmer les risultats de l'enquite aupr2s
     des udsateurs de services publics de santi rialisee dans 1e.cadre de l'ivaluation du CSLP,
     qui traduisent une ivolution des coks dans le sens souhaiti.

  *  28. La gestion des ressources humaines a v i s i la dotation des rigons et dtstricts sanitaires
     en personnel qualifii pour assurer leur fonctionnement, dans le cadre de l'affectation des
     sortants des Ccoles de formation.

     29. Un effort d'accroissement des moyens allouis aux structures diconcentrkes du secteur
     a C t i igalement effectui, avec l'augmentation de 10 % des cridtts diliguis, pour un
     meilleur fonctionnement des districts sanitaires.

     30. Pour favoriser le pilotage du PNDS, ilavait k t i envisagi l'ilaboration d'un CDMT
     sectoriel, mais cette activiti a pris du retard du fait de problcimes de capacitis au sein du
     dipartement ;celle-ci est reprogrammke pour 2004 et sera rkalisk avec l'appui de la Banque
     Monlale.

1.3. ACCROITRE LES OPPORTUNITES D'EMPLOIS ET D'ACTMTES GENERATRICES DE
     REVENUSPOUR LESPAWRES
     31. Les risultats de la 3Bmeenquite prioritaire rivdent que le milieu rural reste le lieu de
     preddection de la pauvreti. L'attention soutenue portie sur ce secteur agncole procZde de
     ce constat. Au cows de l'annie 2003, le gouvernement a intensifii les actions de soutien
     des initiatives de nature iaccroitre et diversifier les sources de revenus du monde paysan,
     tout en restant attentif il'ivolution de la fi2re coton, engagie dans un processus de
     riforme.

     32. Le coton, premier produit &exportation du Burkina Faso, est igalement la principale
     source de revenus du monde m a l . En se fondant sur le niveau de production de la
     campagne 2003-2004, soit 500.000 tonnes de coton graine, c'est l'iquivalent de plus de 90
     d a r d s de francs CFA qui a i t 6 versi aux producteurs courant 2003.

     33. L e gouvernement a par d e u r s continui de promouvoir le diveloppement de la petite
    irrigation dageoise, qui permet d'occuper le monde rural en saison &he.              Les risultats
     enregstris apris deux annies d'expirimentation ont fini de convaincre de l'apport evident
    de cette activiti dans la rialisation de l'objectif de sicuriti alunentaire au B u r h a Faso, q i
     est confront6 aux alias pluviomitriques. D e 9.616 au cours de la campagne 2001-2002, le
    nombre de producteurs impliqds, rCpartis dans les treize rigions du pays, est pass6 en
    2002-2003 h 14.159 dont 5.268 femmes. Cette kvolutiontraduit l'engouement suscitk par le
    projet qui a &tiengagi sur les ressources de l'initiative PPTE. Deux spkcdadons sont
    concemies, isavoir le mais et le nikbi, dont les productions se sont Clevkes respectivement
    i24.636 tonnes et 285 tonnes en 2002-2003 contre 1.330 tOMeS et 172 tonnes la
    campagne      pricidente.   Les    estimations    sommaires     font ressordr    qu'un hectare
    d'exploitation avec l'usage de pompes i pddales pour l'exhaure de l'eau rapporte au
    producteur (risultat brut), selon les zones, entre 86.370 FCFA et 363.590 FCFA pour le
    mai's et entre 780 FCFA et 10.890 FCFA pour le niibi.


                                                          75

     34. I1 convient par d e u r s de relever que la plupart des projets et programmes de
     dkveloppement en d e u intitgrent un volet qxomotion des activitks gknkratrices de
     revenus)) dans leurs plans d'actions, 21 travers notamment des micro - crkchts ou la mise en
     place de fonds de dkveloppement local. S'inscrit dans cette catkgorie notamment le
     PNGTII, qui sur la pkriode 2000-2002 a appuyC les populations males dans la mise place
     600 comitks dlageois de gestion des terrairs (CVGT)             et investit dans ses zones
     d'intervention quelque 912 d o n s FCFA, dont 395 d o n s au niveau des p c h e t s
     vdageois et 517 d o n s au niveau des guichets provinciaux. Enfin, ilfaut signaler le rble
     important de certaines initiatives privkes comme la Societk de promotion des hltitres
     apcoles (SOPROFA) qui, avec l'appui de l'Etat, soutient le dkveloppement des cultures
     vivriitres. En 2002-2003, cette sociktk a inject6 environ 13 d a r d s de francs CFA en
     d e u paysan pour la collecte h e c t e de 25.000 tonnes de riz paddy, 8.000 tonnes de
     sesame et 12.000 tonnes de tomates, mangues et haricot vert.

     35. L e gouvemement a poursuivi les efforts engagks en vue de soutenir l'emploi et la
  ~
     formation professionnelle, itravers des actions visant iaccroltre les performances des
     structures existantes : augmentation des capacitks d'accueil, de suivi pkdagogique et
     chdactique de six      centres d'kvaluation     et de formation professionnelles     (CEFP)
     (Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, Didougou, Tougan, Banfora, Kaya et Fada N'Gourma).
     Cela permettta de former annuellement plus de 600 jeunes en micanique automobile,
     ilectricitk, forge, masonnerie et maroquinerie, crkant ainsi des opportunitks d'insertion
     dans la vie active en postulant iunemploi qualifik ou par auto emploi.
1.4. PROMOWOIRLA BONNEGOUVERNANCE
     36. Des progrksimportantsont ktk accomplis dans le domaine de la gouvemance sous tous
     ses aspects. L e renforcement de la dkmocratie et de l'Etat de droit, et l'amilioration des
     mkcanismes de gestion des hnances publiques sont demeurkes au centre des
     prkoccupations des pouvoirspublics tout au longde l'annke 2003.

     37. Au plan de la gouvemancepolitique, ils'est a g de vedler au bon fonctionnement des
     institutions rkpublicaines en place, tout en assurant l'afhnement des mkcanismes rkgssant
     le jeu dkmocratique entre les diffkrents acteurs de la vie politique au Burkina Faso. Ainsi,
     dans la perspective des prochaines kchkances klectorales prkvues en 2005 (klections
     prksidentielles et municipales), la Commissionklectorale nationale indkpendante (CENI) a
     entrepris l'informatisation des listes klectorales.

     38. Les nouvelles juridicdons supkrieures issues de la riforme de la justice sont aujourd'hui
     toutes opirationnelles. L a Cour constitutionnellea ison actif notamment l'examen des
     rksultats des klections lkgislatives de 2002 et de nombreux textes de loi portant ratification
     de dvers accords et conventions. L a Cour des comptes est trks active depuis son
     installation avec les efforts    engagks par le gouvemement pour rksorber les retards
     accumulks dans la reddtion des comptes publics. L e programme d'appui ila consolidation
     du processus dkmocratique, de l'Etat de droit et de la bonne gouvernance, mis en place
     avec    l'appui  de certains partenaires au dkveloppement,          soutient les initiatives
     gouvemementales de renforcement des capacitks des acteurs au niveau gouvememental et
     de la sociktk cide.

     39. L a consolidation de la gouvemance e'conomique est un dkfi permanent pour le
     Burkina Faso dans le contexte de mise en Deuvre du CSLP, que bon nombre de ses
     partenaires ont dicidk de soutenk A travers des appuis budgktaires, hssant ainsi au
     gouvemement la responsabhtk de l'affectation des ressources en fonction de ses prioritks
     affichkes. Cela a comme exigence une obligation de rendre compte beaucoup plus forte,
     qui impose la mise en place d'outils et de micanismes de gestion budgktaire garantissant la
     transparence dans l'utilisation des ressources.  d

                                                        76

40. L e Burluna Faso a engagi depuis 1997 un processus de renforcement de la gestion des
finances publics avec notamment le diveloppement d'un Circuit intigrk de la dCpense
(CID), suivi plus tard d'une Comptabiliti inthgrhe de 1'Etat (CIE) et d'un Systime htkgrk
de gestion administrative et salariale du personnel de l'Etat (SIGASPE). I1 a par d e u r s
adopti ipartir ipartir de l'annie 1999 de nouveaux ouds (complimentaires) qui ont
permis d'amiliorer notablement le processus de programmation budgktaire (budget
programme, Cadre des dipenses h moyen terme ou CDMT et revue des dipenses
publiques ou RDP), et dont l'utihsation, affin4e d'ann4e en annie, permet d'assurer plus de
coh4rence entre les priorit4s du CSLP et le budget de l'Etat dont l'4laboration est encadrke
par les enveloppes du CDMT.

41. Ainsi, c o m e en 2003, le budget 2004 a C t i ilaborh sur la base des enveloppes du
CDMT 2004-2006 adopt4 par le conseil des ministres le 30 avnl 2003, diterminies en
cohirence avec les prioritis du CSLP et annexies ila circulaire budgitaire pour l'exercice
2004. L a loi de finances 2004 a &tivotie le 19 dicembre 2003 par l'AssemblCe Nationale.

42. Dans le cadre du Plan d'action pour le renforcement de la gestion budghtaire (PRGB)
adopti en 2002 en vue d'amiliorer durablement la transparence, la fiabhti et l'efficacith de
la gestion budgitaire, conformiment aux objectifs du CSLP, les actions suivantes ont kt6
rCalis4es :
-   soumission au Parlement qui l'a adopti du projet de loi de riglement de l'annke 2001 ;
    le projet de loi de riglement de l'annie 2002 est en cours d'examen ila Cour des
    Comptes depuis le dibut de l'annie 2004 et, dis riception de l'avis de conformit4 de
    cette juridiction suphrieure de contrble, sera soumis i l'AssemblCe nationale. Les
    lspositions sont en train d'itre prises concemant le la priparation du projet de loi de
    riglement pour l'annie 2003 et sa transmission i l'Assemblie nationale d'ici hn
    dicembre 2004, en application des dispositions de loi relative aux lois de hnances
    promulguie en octobre 2003 ;
-   Risorption, confonniment aux itudes du CFAA, du RONC et du PRGB, du retard
    accumuli dans la production des balances ginirales des comptes du Trisor jusqu'en
    2002, production reguliere des balances mensuelles A compter de mars 2003 et

2-    PERSPECTIVESPOURLAPERIODE 2004-2005

    44. L e Gouvemement a rkcemment adoptk un CSLP rkvisk assorti d'un programme
     d'actions prioritaires pour son opkrationnalisation, en tirant les leqons du bilan de trois
    annkes de mise en Deuvre du premier CSLP et du nouveau profrl de la pauvretk retrack par
     les rksultats de la troisil-me enqukte prioritaires conduite en 2003. Les donnkes sur la
    pauvretk collectkes lors de cette enqu&e sont en cours d'examen en collaboration avec les
     experts de la Banque Mondlale pour une mise en cohkrence avec celles de 1998. L e
    gouvernement inscrira ses efforts de rkduction de la pauvretk dans le cadre de ce CSLP
    rkvisk et invite l'ensemble de ses partenaires au diveloppement icontinuer &en faire le
    guide de leurs interventions. Ce CSLP aura comme outil d'opkrationnalisation le
    programme d'actions        prioritaires qui retrace l'ensemble    des actions    et mesures
     programmkes s u r la pkriode 2004-2006.

2.1-   CROISSANCE ECONOMIOUE ET CREATION D'EMPLOIS

     45. Dans le domaine macro-kconomique, le Gouvemement entend, dans le cadre de son
     nouveau programme triennal en cours d'exkcution soutenu par la Facilitk pour la rkduction
     de la pauvretk et la croissance duFMI, consolider les acquis.

      Cadremacro-dconomipe et financementdu CSLP

     46.Les projections pour 2004-2005 ktablies lors de la premiere revue du programme
     tablent sur la poursuite de la croissance, h un rythme supkrieur h 5 %, un t a u d'inflation
     contenu autour de 2% et un dkfidt du compte courant extkrieur en dessous de 12% du
     PIB.

     47. Ces perspectives sont loin de permettre l'exkcution intkgrale du programme d'actions
     prioritaires du CSLP, blti autour de l'hypothese volontariste de 7 YOde croissance en
     moyenne sur la pkriode 2004-2006 jugke nkcessaire pour impulser une riduction
     significative de la pauvretk. Au regard de l'ampleur des besoins de financement requis, elles
     interpellent l'ensemble des partenaires techniques et financiers du Burkina Faso pour qu'ils
     s'engagent rksolument isoutenir les efforts du gouvemement. Cet engagement pourrait
     consister en des actions de sensibllisation de la communautk intemationale pour une
     mobllisation accrue de ressources conformkment il'esprit du consensus de Monterrey et
     dans le cadre des diverses initiatives dkveloppkes pour accklkrer l'atteinte des objectifs de
     dkveloppement du millknaire. L e s CASRP de la Banque Mondule, par leur importance en
     terme de montant et la flexibhtk dans leur mise en aeuvre, rkpondent ices prkoccupations.

     48. L e gouvemement, pour quile budget reprksente le principalinstrument de financement
     de la lutte contre la pauvretk, prendra les mesures requises pour accroitre la mobhsation
     des ressources intkrieures, h travers notamment la mise en aeuvre selon le chronogramme
     prkvu de son plan d'actions pour l'amklioration du recouvrement des recettes adoptk en
     2003. L e rell-vement du taux de prklevement fiscal, pour progresser dans le sens de la
     moyenne de la zone UEMOA, est l'un des principaux objectifs du nouveau programme
     conclu avec le FMIpour la pkriode 2003-2006. L a rkahsation de cet objectif sera au centre
     des prkoccupations du gouvemement en 2004 et 2005, est reflktke dans les projections du
     tableau des opkrations financiiires de l'Etat.

    49. Dans le secteur agncole, les actions seront orientkes vers deux axes majeurs au cows
    des deux prochaines annkes: la poursuite de la restructuration de la f i i i r e coton et le
     soutien des initiatives s'inscrivant dans la recherche d'une diversification des
    agricoles.




                                                        78

    50. La riforme de la &&re - clk du coton connaitra un premier rksdtat concret dans le
    domaine du renforcement de la compititiviti des &;res          agricoles et agroalunentaires avec
    la finalisation de la cession des actifs de la SOFITEXdans les zones Centre et Est au       C O ~ S
    des prochains mois. Apr& la signature des conventions de cession, ily aura isoutenir la
    mise en place de la nouvelle association interprofessiomelle et d'un nouveau cadre
    riglementaire. Le gouvemement entreprendra igalement, en vue d'une adoption d'ici fin
    2005, un texte consolidant et harmonisant des textes pour dgir les relations entre k s
    dffirents acteurs dans le secteur apcole, notamment l'exercice des fonctions transfkries
     ou dilkguies aux CRA, OPA, aux interprofessions et au secteur privi.

     51. L a poursuite de la mise en place des bases de la &versification constitue un autre axe
    pnoritaire pour les prochaines annies, avec le dkbut de la mise en aeuvre des plans
     d'actions des hlil.res ciriales, oliagineux et nikbi.

     52.La poursuite des riformes dans le secteur des tklkcommunications et de l'inergie
     conduira au transfert des actifs de YONATEL tel que p r hdans le schkma de privatisation
  .  et le cadre rkglementaire et ligal sera actualisi conformkment aux stratigies d'ivolution
    retenues par le Gouvemement pour l'ivolution des sous secteurs de l'ilectriciti et des
     hydrocarbures. L a participation du secteur privi dans la gestion du secteur de l'knergie sera
     ainsi mieux prkcisie.

     53. L e Gouvemement a install6 la Maison de YEntreprise du Burkina dans le cadre du
     Projet d'appui ila compititivitk et au diveloppement de l'entreprise. Dans ce cadre, il
     s'emploiera iam6liorer l'environnement juridique et judiciaire de l'entreprise en mati2re de
     cdation d'entreprise par le renforcement du Centre des guichets uniques (CGU) pour
     allkger les formalitis de criation d'entreprise, et adoptera le nouveau code dutravail tout e n
    po"ivant       la riflexion sur la ligislation et la rkglementation du marchi du travail. La
    relecture en cours des textes en mati&-e de commerce de distribution et du commerce
     extkrieur facilitera les kchanges en fixant mieux les r&gles du jeu pour lutter contre la fraude
     et la concurrence diloyale. L e renforcement de FASONORMet du Trade point induira
    une medleure compktitiviti il'exportation des produits burkinabk.

2.2-   DEVELOPPEMENTDESRESSOURCESHUMAINES
     Educationdebase

     54. Les actions multiformes diployies dans le cadre du PDDEB qui poursuit l'objectif de
     70% de taux de scolarisation et de 40% de taux d'alphabitisation seront intensifiies en
     2004 afin de rattraper le retard accusk dans la mise en aeuvre du programme. 11 s'agira
     notammentde finaliser le CDMT sectoriel de l'kducation (y compris les enseignements
     secondake, scientifique et de la recherche sdentifique) pour pennettre de mieux apprtcier
     le niveau des ressources et le prof3 de leur allocation intra sectorielle le plus apte iassurer
     l'atteinte des objectifs du d i n a i r e . Dans l'optique d'amkliorer l'accts il'kcole en zone
     rurale, la politique des subventions s c o k e s dans les vingt (20) provinces les moins
     scolarisies sera poursuivie et, pour rkpondre aux prkoccupations sur la qualitk de
     l'enseignement, une ktude sur le nombre effectif d'heures d'enseignement sera conduite.
    Par aiUeurs, il sera prockdk par voie d'enquttes et des statistiques administratives, i
    l'kaluation de l'exkcution des dkpenses.

    55. En2005, outre lapoursuite des incitations il'inscription des enfants en zone rurale par
    des subventions scolaires dans les 20 provinces prioritaires du secteur, l'actualisation du
    PDDEB sera effectuie pour tenir compte de la nkcessiti de l'ilargssement du concept
    d'iducation de base conformiment aux orientations de la lettxe de politiques Cducative et
    des nouvelles initiatives (iducation pour tous des ODM, initiative 2512005, etc.).
    56. L e gouvemement accordera l'attention requise aux recommandations issues des
    &verses revues du PDDEB, orgaruskes semestriellement avec l'ensemble des bailleurs de
    fonds du programme et des partenaires de l'kducation de base. Cette mobilisation devrait         P
                                                            79

    ditermination des besoins en ressources financiires nicessaires il'atteinte des ODM dans
    le secteur pourra &.re assurie dam le cadre de l'klaboration d'un CDMT sectoriel. Les
    actions ayant produit des risultats probants, c o m e la vaccination gratuite et la dtstribution
    gratuite de vitamine A, seront poursuivies et les voies et moyens de renforcer les
    programmes de nutritionseront recherchis.

    58.La rkflexion va itre menie pour concevoir un systime de subvention des soins

    privention connaitra un approfondtssement avec la subvention des moustiquaires
    imprignies et des frais de traitement.

    59. En matiire d'eau potable et d'assainissement, le document cadre adopti en 2000 sera
    relu pour prendre en compte les ivolutions institutionnelles. Un plan d'action du
    partenariat public/privC au secteur urbain sera ri&gi au cours de l'annie 2004. le
    gouvemement d C h a igalement les investissements et le financement nicessaire pour la
    mise en aeuvre du plan d'action pour l'attente des objectifs de d i n a i r e .

    60. L e Gouvemement a saisi l'opportuniti de la rivision du CSLP pour itendre l'axe 2 de
    la stratigie initiale ila protection sociale. En droite ligne avec ce souci de mieux protiger
    les groupes vulnirables confront6 i la pricariti, deux cadres stratigques de prise en
    charge, l'un, des orphelins et autres enfants vulnirables, l'autre, des cas sociaux scolkes,
    seront m i s en chantier. 11s seront suivis par l'itude nationale s u r les personnes igies, qui
    permettra de mieux cibler la politique du troisiime ige au Burluna Faso.

    61. Au plan politique, l'annke 2004 sera consacrie i la priparation des prochaines
    ichiances Clectorales, isavoir les Clections prisidentielle et municipales de 2005.
    62. En matiire de gouvemance locale, le Gouvemement est attachi ila mise en aeuvre
    effective de la dicentralisation, mais ilentend conduire le processus avec toute la skrkniti
    requise et en prenant les mesures d'accompagnement prkalables, notamment l'adoption du
    cadre juridtque de la dkconcentration, pour favoriser des avanckes viritables et irriversibles
    duprocessus de mise en oeuvre de la rkgon comme entiti diconcentrie. L a finalisation du
    logciel de Comptabhtiintigrke des collectivitis locales (CICL) pennettra de mieux assurer
    le riceptacle du transfert des ressources et des compitences aux communes. L a poursuite
    de la diconcentration de l'ordonnancement participe aussi de la rialisation de cet objectif.
    L'ensemble de ce dispositif sera rendu pleinement opirationnel avec la mise en place
    effective de l'exkcudf local, c'est-i-due la nomination des gouvemeurs de rigons courant
    2004.

    63. L a gouvemance kconomique sera amiliorie par la poursuite des actions inscrites

                  Annex 2: Burkina Faso: Relationswith the World Bank Group

                                          (As o fApril 7,2004)

Partnershipin BurkinaFaso's developmentstrategy

1.       The government of Burkina Faso outlined its development strategy in a poverty reduction
strategy paper (PRSP) in May 2000. The Bank and Fund Board endorsedthis strategy in June 2000,
as well as the first (December 2001) and second (November 2002) annual progress report. The
government is currently undertaking the full update o f the PRSP. The PRSP sets out the following
four pillars o f the government's strategy: (i)accelerating equitable growth; (ii) promoting access to
social services; (iii)increasing employment and income-generating activities for the poor; and (iv)
promoting good governance.

2.       The Fundhas supportedBurkina Faso under three arrangementsunder the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility between 1993 and 2002, and the authorities are currently receiving support
under a fourth arrangement covering 2003-06. The Fund takes the lead in the policy dialogue on
macroeconomic       policies and monitors macroeconomic          performance through quantitative
performance criteria. Inaddition, it establishedrecently structural performance criteria inthe areas o f
tax policy, financial transparency and good governance, and trade policy. The Bank is supporting the
implementation o f the PRSP in the areas o f public finance management, good governance,
decentralization, health, education, and cotton reform through a series o f poverty reduction support
credits (PRSC), complemented with a portfolio o f specific projects to address issues relating to
HIV/AIDS, basic education, infrastructure investments in transport, water and urban areas, rural
development, and private sector development, as outlined below.

The CountryAssistance Strategy(FY 00-03) and the Bank portfolio


3.       The general objective of the November 2000 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the
World Bank i s to support the government's efforts, as described in the June 2000 PRSP, to achieve
sustained high growth rates, to reduce the high incidence o f poverty, and to improve the nutrition,
health, and education o f the rural population, which constitutes the largest group among the poor.
The CAS has three specific objectives: (i)supporting policies and programs aimed at improving the
supply side o fthe economy in order to allow for sustained, broad-based, and export-oriented growth;
(ii)improving public finance management to increase efficiency o f public spending; and (iii)
ensuring that the allocation process and public spending effectiveness goals result in a special
emphasis on social services.

4.       The Bank's assistance to the PRSP is intended to be selective and complementary to
activities supported by other donors. Specifically, the Bank envisages a program and related country
budget allocation that will (i) priority to supervision o f ongoing projects; (ii)
                                give                                                  acknowledge the
important role o f donors; (iii)consolidate lendingoperations into fewer but broader resource transfer
mechanisms that are more closely integrated with the government's own budgetary allocation and
execution processes; and (iv) include a share o f nonlending services to foster a robust analytical base
for consensus and partnership building.

5.       To refocus its assistanceprogram and put a consistent emphasis on rapid growth with poverty
reduction, the Bank Group strategy in Burkina Faso focuses attention on (i)key social sectors, where


                                                  82

there are viable long-term strategies or where they can be developed; (ii)longer-term economic
reforms to improve competitiveness and reduce business costs; (iii)the improvement of public
resource management; and (iv) the adapting of Bank-supported programs to the subregional
framework and potentials. Bank lending to Burkina Faso takes the form of results-driven
programmatic credits (Poverty Reduction Support Credits-PRSCs)           and self-standing projects for
capacity building, support for community driven development activities (concentrating on rural,
social, and HIV/AIDS interventions) and infrastructure investments directly targeted to poverty
alleviation and private sector development. There is a continued commitment to analytical and
advisory activities, as knowledge is the critical input for progress in the substantive areas presented
inthe PRSP.

6.      The March 2003 CAS Progress Report (i)       assesses the progress made in implementingthe
PRSP and the FYO1-03 CAS; (ii)providesan update on the economic and social developments; (iii)
elaborates the new challenges that BurkinaFaso is facing; and (iv) identifiesthe risks for continued
implementationof the PRSP and CAS. The progress report confirms that the strategy set out in the
2000 CAS remainsappropriateand proposes an extension of this strategy for 12-18months to cover
the perioduntil the new CAS is prepared. The new CAS is expected to follow closely the full update
o fthe PRSP.

7.      Assessment of country policies. In close collaborationwith the Burkinabk authorities, IDA
has undertakensubstantial analytical work over the past three years to assess key social, structural,
and sectoral development policies and identify policy and institutionalreform priorities for poverty
reduction. IDA has relied on a combination of the PRSP and its annual progress reports, a second
priority poverty survey and two poverty profiles, sectoral policy notes, and informal papers on
specific issues, such as constraints in growth and competitiveness, or the dynamics of poverty and
income inequality.IDA has also helpedthe Burkinabb authorities carry out analytical work in key
sectors (education, health, rural development, energy, transport, and privatesector development) and
assistedwith the preparationofa comprehensiveeconomic study on long-termsources ofgrowth and
competitiveness in 2001. On poverty reduction, two further studies are underway - a participatory
povertyassessmentandthe thirdnationalhouseholdsurvey.

8.      Since the beginning of the structural reforms in the early 1990s, the World Bank has
approved, in addition to support for investment projects, two structural adjustment credits, an
economic recovery credit, an agricultural sector adjustment credit, a transport adjustment credit, an
economic management reform credit, and three povertyreductionsupport credits (PRSC-1,PRSC-2,
and PRSC-3). The Bank's cumulative commitmentsto Burkina Faso as of April 7, 2004, amount to
US$1,413.6 millionequivalentfor 69 operations, comprising66 IDA creditsand 3 IDA grants.

9.      The current portfolio amounts to IDA commitments of US$529.3 million, of which
US$310.9 million is undisbursed. There is also a GEF Project for US$7.5 million, of which $1.7
millionhasbeendisbursed. IDA'Sactiveportfolio inBurkinaFaso is as follows:


    0   The PRSC-3 grant was approved in July2003 for US$50 million. The PRSC program
        focuses on key sectoral actionplans and reformsto improvepublic finance management, the
        competitivenessof the economy, and to facilitate the country's integrationinto the regional
        andworld economy.

0Three operations support IDA'Sstrategy in the agriculture sector. A second agricultural
 services project (US$41.3 million, FY98) aims at increasing agricultural productivity and
 farmers' incomes, improving natural resource management, and promoting institutional
 development.A private irrigation project (US$5.2 million, FY99) supports provision of the
  demand-driven services necessary for the development of an efficient, sustainable small
  irrigation subsector in Burkina Faso. A community-based rural development program
  (US$66.7million, FYO1) aims at reducingpoverty and promotingsustainabledevelopment in
  rural areas. Its first phase provides for building local capacity to plan and implement rural

            IMFCompletesFirstReviewUnderBurkinaFaso'sPRGFArrangement
                            and Approves US$5.1Million Disbursement

1.      The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first
review o fBurkina Faso's economic performance under a SDR 24.08 million (about US$35.5 million)
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (see Press Release No. 03/82).
The completion o f the review enables the release of a further SDR 3.44 million (about
US$5.1 million), which will bring the total amount drawn under the arrangement to SDR
6.88 million (about US$10.2 million).

2.      In completing the review, the Board waived the nonobservance ofthe performance criterion
pertaining to the effective computerization o f the large and medium-sized taxpayers' units in two
main cities, Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso. The Board also concluded that the third progress
report submitted by Burkina Faso on its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) provided a sound
basis for IMF concessional assistance.

3.      The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted ina participatory process
involving civil society and development partners and articulated in a PRSP. This i s intended to
ensure that PRGF-supported programs are consistent with a comprehensive framework to foster
growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate o f 0.5 percent and are repayable
over 10years with a 5 %year grace period on principal payments.

5.      Following the Executive Board's discussion on Burkina Faso's economic performance,
Agustin Carstens, DeputyManagingDirector and Acting Chair, stated:

      "The performance o f the Burkinabe economy under the PRGF-supported program has been
      satisfactory to date. The Burkinabk authorities implemented prudent macroeconomic policies
      and strengthened fiscal transparency and accountability in 2003. This, along with abundant
      rainfall and a higher producer price for cotton that boosted agricultural production, resulted in
      robust economic growth, subdued inflation, and continued narrowing o f the current account
      deficit in 2003. Nevertheless, the Burkinabk economy remains fragile and vulnerable, owing to




                                                  93

the country's heavy reliance on cotton exports and external assistance, the highpublic external
debt burden, and the continued difficulties inCote d'Ivoire.

"The authorities' economic program for 2004 remains guided by the objectives set'out in the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). Successful implementation o f the program will
depend critically on further fiscal consolidation. The main fiscal challenges will be to increase
tax revenue, contain domestically-financed expenditure while re-orienting resources to priority
areas, and fully utilize HIPC Initiative-related resources to finance priority social spending.
Inthis regard, the authorities are implementinga comprehensive action planto improve tax and
customs revenue collection, and are taking steps to control the wage bill and non-priority
spending and to increase absorptive capacity inthe social sectors.

"In the context of the 2004 program, the authorities aim to continue to make progress in
enhancing transparency,     accountability, and governance; liberalizing prices and trade;
privatizing and restructuring public enterprises; and opening up the cotton sector to private
firms. These reforms will be important to enhance Burkina Faso's external competitiveness and
spur private sector growth.

"The broad participatory approach to preparing the PRSP progress report has been helpful in
building national consensus on the poverty reduction strategy. The PRSP is being updated for
the period 2004-06, and for this purpose it would be useful to carry out a poverty assessment
and develop adequate social and poverty indicators," Mr.Carstens said.

                      Annex 8: The Cotton Sector: Past and Future Challenges


1.        Inthe past 20 years, the production of cotton in Burkina has increased from 50,000 metric
tons in 1980 to almost 500,000 tons in 2003. Owing to the recent production increase, Burkina Faso
has become the second most important cotton producer in West Africa after Mali, despite the
difficulties to transport fertilizers and cotton fiber since the onset o f the Ivorian crisis. The cotton
sector encompasses about 200,000 producers, organized in 8,000 producer organization and 2,700
village organizations, with 248 departmental unions and 36 provincial unions.16 The sector has
contributed 56 percent o f export revenues duringthe past 5 years and 10 percent o f the value added
in the agricultural sector. 17 percent of the population depend directly of indirectly on the cotton
sector. In2003-04, the sector represented 5.4 percent of GDP.

2.        The performance of the cotton sector has benefitedfrom a good management ofthe negative
impact resulting from the sharp decline in cotton prices since mid-2001. SOFITEX made
considerable efforts to improve the quality o f inputs and intensify agricultural extension services,
which allowed to stabilize the yields at about 1040kg/ha in 2000-03.'7 In addition, SOFITEX has
maintained a prudent management and a rational commercial policy using term contracts and a
policy to keep production costs down. As a result, costs have been about CFAF 700kg during 2000-
03,

3.        The progressive liberalization o f the sector since 1998 has also been a factor explaining the
good performance o fthe cotton sector. The most important elements o fthis policy are:


     0    the transfer, in early 1999, o f 30 percent o f the shares o f SOFITEX to the producer
          organization UNPCB, reducing by 36 percent the number o f shares o f the government and
          leading to a larger implication o f UNPCB inthe managemento fthe sector.
     0    the capacity buildingmeasuresfor producer associationsbytechnical and financial partners.
     0    the transfer of transport activities to the private sector, including foreigners since the Ivorian
          crisis.
     0    the extension ofcredit to producer organizations.
     a    the liberalization offertilizer and insecticides markets.
     0    the sale of cotton to SOFITEX at a fixed price to which SOFITEX adds a bonus reflecting
          half o fthe profits o fthe previous campaign.
     0    the opening of the Eastern and Central zones, representing about 15 percent of cotton
          production, for private investors who will take over SOFITEX's assets inthese zones.

4.        As regardsthe entry of new operators into the sector, the process o f selling the assets inthe
two zones i s in its last phase. In fact, the technical bids were launched on May 30, 2003, the pre-
qualified companies have been invited to submit offers on February 13, 2004 and the offers have

been received and opened on April 6, 2004. Following the conclusion o f this process, cotton
production will be subject to a competition between different operators, which should entice each
operator in his zone to follow a policy o f rational management and support the country's objective to
generate incomes inrural areas.
5.        Another advantage o f the sector is the high quality o f the raw cotton, as confirmed by the
International Cotton Committee, which has classified Burkina Faso in 2001 on the 4th place
worldwide as regards quality o f cotton fiber. In fact, more than 80 percent o f the production
corresponds to the highest world standards. The highquality results from:

      0   the efforts made by SOFITEX to produce cotton varieties with qualities that correspond to
          demand.
      0   the manual growing and harvesting, inwhich producers have been successfully trained.
      0   the quick evacuation o f cotton by SOFITEX, avoiding degradation o f cotton inthe field.
      0   the honoring by SOFITEX o f its contractual obligations.

6.        The activities o f the cotton sector have been confirmed to have an impact on poverty. The
poverty headcount in the principal cotton growing regions was 41 percent in the Western region,
where most cotton is produced, against 51 percent for the rural sector countrywide. However, the
income distribution seems less equal incotton growing areas compared to the national average.I8
7.        Despite the good performance o f the sector and to maximize its impact on growth and
poverty reduction, Burkina Faso must lift a certain number o f constraints :

      0   the decline in the remaining land usable for cotton production as a result o f a use o f
          techniques with high labor input, for which average yields have not exceeded 1040 kg/ha.
          Certain efficient producers have already reached 2000 to 2500 kg/ha, which shows that yields
          could be improved by new technology, mechanization, fertilizers, and pesticides or new
          experiments with new varieties o f cotton that have already been proposed for developing
          co~ntries.'~
      0   the subsidies paid to producers in large producer countries increase the offer o f cotton fiber
          artificially and depress the cotton price for African countries. The elimination o f these
          subsidies would allow producers in West and Central Africa to better use their comparative
          advantage, promote growth, and reduce poverty. The discussions continue in this area on the
          level o fthe WTO and with the EU.

                                 Annex 9: EnvironmentalAssessment


Introduction

1.      This document analyzes the potential environmental and social impacts of the reforms
supported by the fourth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-4) for Burkina Faso. Since PRSCs
take the form o f a series o f successive operations, the analyses contained in this report are based
extensively on the contents of the previous environmental assessment (EA) report for PRSC-3 and
prepare the ground for the PRSC-5 EA. This document will be annexed to the Credit Memorandum
sent by the President to the Boardo f Governors o f the International Development Association (IDA).

General context and descriptionof projectobjectives

2.      PRSC-4 i s the fourth operation in a series o f credits and grants to support implementation o f
the poverty reduction strategy adopted by the Government of Burkina Faso in 2000. It supports the
government objectives o fmaintaining a sound macroeconomic environment and accelerating growth,
through budget support. In particular, the operation is designed to strengthen short-term
macroeconomic management and promote the creation o f the necessary economic and institutional
environment in order to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency o f public expenditure and achieve
sustainable improvement o fkey social indicators.

3.      Like its predecessors, PRSC-4 will continue to support the reform program adopted and
implemented by the Government. For example, in addition to sound budgetary management, the
operation will also support improvements in delivery o f basic services, particularly in the areas o f
education and health, and stimulate growth sources through structural reforms and increased
investment in rural development. In brief, PRSC-4 emphasizes reforms designed to accelerate
growth, develop human resources and promote good governance. Its principal activities and
objectives are described below.

4.      Accelerating growth and employment creation. PRSC-4 will support the implementation
of several measuresto increase productivity and reduce factor costs. Inparticular, under PRSC-4, the
Government will continue its efforts to increase agricultural productivity and create employment in
the rural sector. The agriculture sector is the main source o f employment and income for about 80
percent o f the population o f Burkina Faso. It also generates considerable growth and employment
links with the potentially dynamic sector represented by the non-agricultural rural economy. The
agriculture sector is also the main source o f growth for the economy, contributing 90 percent of
export earnings in 2003. Despite the relatively good performance o f Burkina Faso at the
macroeconomic level, the incidence o fpoverty remains high, particularly in the rural areas where 5 1
percent o fthe population lives below the poverty income threshold. There is an urgentneed to reduce
the pressure exerted by rapid demographic growth onthe limitedand fragile resources ofthe land. In
particular, intensification o f farming and rapid technological change are perceived as a means of
increasing the productive potential o f the land and o f improving living conditions in rural areas. The
Government has prepared strategic guidelines for the agriculture sector covering four topics:




                                                  97

    0    Modernization o f agriculture (improved seeds, water management, fertilizers, agricultural
         equipment).

    0    Soil fertility management.
    0    Support for producer organizations.

    0    Capacity building.

Inthis context, the Government adopteda global ruraldevelopment strategyat the endof2003.

5.       The proposed PRSC-4 will continue to support the objectives defined in the three previous
PRSCs: strengthening o f the policies needed to create the conditions conducive to enhanced
performance by key subsectors. These objectives will be pursued mainly through action plans for
diversification o fagricultural production and reform o fthe cotton sector.

6.       For example, in 2001 the Government initiated a process o f opening the cotton sector to
private investors able to compete with the semistatal structure SOFITEX. The reform process started
with the abolition at the end o f 2001 o f the SOFITEX monopoly o f the cotton trade. In 2002,
consultations started for the sale o f two production zones to private investors. The SOFITEX assets
inthe two zones were evaluated, a list ofpersonnel to betransferred to the new operators was drawn
up, and documents on the two zones and their production potential were prepared and validated.
Calls for bids for the two zones were launched on 30 May 2003 and a reform monitoring committee
was set up to supervise the process. PRSC-4 will help the Government in the bidding process and
reorganization o fthe sector.

7.       Under PRSC-4, the Government will also maintain its policies o f reducing factor costs,
particularly telecommunication, energy and labor costs. Inthis connection, it embarked on a process
of privatization o fthe State firm ONATEL in2003. The pre-qualification procedure was launched in
May 2003 and calls for bids were launched in December 2003. PRSC-4 will help the Government to
conduct this process, which should be completed inMay 2004.

8.       In the energy sector, the Government will continue its restructuring policy. In this
connection, under PRSC-4 the Government will adopt a sectoral reform strategy geared to private
participation in the electricity and hydrocarbon subsectors. Restructuring o f the energy sector will
make it possible to improve performance inthe context o f the major investments for connecting the
Ouagadougou grid with Cdte d'Ivoire. In the long term, these reforms will reduce the high cost o f
electricity. Inthe hydrocarbon subsector, privateparticipation will improve the efficiency o fthe State
firm SONABHYand reducethe costs of importedhydrocarbons.

9.       Concerning labor costs, the Government has embarked on the revision o f the labor code. In
this connection, tripartite discussions (Government -employers -trade unions) have been held, and
a study on labor market regulation will be prepared during2004.

10.      Developing human resources. Under this component o f PRSC-4, the Government will
pursue its policies designedto improvethe quantity and quality o fbasic services.

11.      Basic education: The key issues include: (i) and unequal access to basic education; (ii)
                                                      poor
high cost of enrollment; (iii)misuse of resources and poor quality o f education; (iv) inadequate
financing of basic education; and (v) limited management and monitoring capacity. The government
program for the improvement o f basic education indicators was submitted in the Ten-year Basic



                                                   98

Education Development Plan (PDDEB). This plan is currently supported by an investment project
financed by IDA and other donors and by the PRSCs. Like PRSC 1,2 and 3, PRSC-4 will continue
efforts to improve accessto basic education andreduce costs, by helpingto:


    0    Implementthe Government'sBasic EducationDevelopmentPlan.
    0    Subsidizeschool supplies inthe poorestprovinces.
    0    Improveaccess to education inruralareas by expandingschool infrastructure.
    0    Continueto providebooks without charge to the poorest families.
    0    Strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Basic Education (MEBA) for programmingand
        programimplementation.

12.     Basic health: The combination of relatively high fertility and poor health and nutrition is
both a cause and a consequence of poverty in Burkina Faso. This situationexacerbates poverty by
reducingproductivity and household income, while increasingexpenses. The other factors associated
with poverty and contributingto poor healthand its relatedconsequences includewomen's illiteracy
andtheir limitedaccess to basic social services suchas cleanwater and sanitation.

13.      In order to improve the health and welfare of citizens, the Government has formulated a
National Health Care DevelopmentPlan (PNDS). This Plan, which is supported by a medium-term
reform program, follows three pro-poorpolicy directions: (i)   improvinghealth indicators among the
poor; (ii)limiting the financial burden of usage costs for poor families; and (iii)increasing the
involvementof the poorestcommunities in decision-makingon healthmatters.The specific goals of
the Planmay be summarized as follows:


    0    Improveaccess and upgradequality and use ofhealthandnutritionservices.
    0    Improve monitoring o f infectious diseases, with special emphasis on reduction of HIV
         infectionrates.

    0    Upgrade humanresources.
    0    Increase total financing for the health sector and make health and nutrition services
         financially more accessible, byreducingbarriersto healthandnutritionfacedbythe poor.
    0    Strengthen institutionalcapacityinthe Ministryo fHealth.

14.      In additionto adopting a new set of policies targeting reduction of the financial burdenof
usage fees for households, the Government has undertaken to implement the measures described
below. UnderPRSC-3, the Government issued a unified listing of the cost of basic medical services
in hospitals and health centers, including a reduction of the cost of pediatric care and obstetrical
assistance. The listing also mentions that pre-natalcare and vaccinations are free of charge and, to
this end, the Government has taken a number of measures. Under PRSC-4, the Government has
pursued these policies by continuing free distribution of vitamin A, monitoring application of the
new tariffs, assigning staff to the regions and districts, expandingdelegated funding and creating a
framework for PNDSmonitoringandevaluation.

15.      Promoting good governance. Overall, PRSC-4 will continue to support the Government's
efforts to maintaina stable macroeconomic framework and to align its Medium-TermExpenditure
Framework(MTEF) with the prioritiesofthe PovertyReductionStrategyPaper (PRSP) as definedin
the program of priority activities. These objectives will be pursued through a number of activities
designed to improve the rules and monitoring of budget management and to improve the
management of the civil service and promote decentralization. In this context, the Government has


                                                  99

taken steps to integrate MTEF into budget preparation, to extend the automated expenditure circuit to
the regions, to improve procurement procedures and to strengthen monitoring of the budget. In the
context o f civil service reform and decentralization, PRSC-4 will continue to support the process o f
decentralization and deconcentradon o f public services, as the best way o f improving the efficiency
o f delivery o f social services and the quality o f such services. It also provides for delegation o f
budget hnding to the regions and provinces and issuance of payment orders at the regional and
provincial levels.

Environmentalclassificationand safeguards policy

 16.     On the basis of the project objectives, PRSC-4 was classified as a Sectoral Adjustment Credit
(SECAC) at the meeting organized by the PRSC Working Group covering the Bank as a whole, in
accordance with the PRSC Interim Directives of May 2001. Under Bank policy, Operational
Directive (OD) 8.60 (Adjustment Lending) and Operational Policy (OP) 4.01 (Environmental
Assessment) apply to this Credit. In accordance with OP 4.0, the Credit was classified in category B,
without a separate environmental assessment. To the extent that the Credit will support reforms inthe
rural development sector through the preparation of action plans in key areas such as cotton and
horticulture, OP 4.09 (Pest Management) may also apply. However, an environmental analysis in
accordance with OD 8.60 is annexed to the Program Document. According to the Bank's revised
disclosure policy, the environmental analysis annex is being made available via the World Bank
InfoShop and in Burkina Faso before evaluation o f the Credit. The annex may be revised after the
evaluation mission to take into account any changes made in the arrangements, in order to ensure
compliance with environmental and social safeguards.

Key issuesof safeguardsand mitigatingmeasures

17.      The potential environmental and social impacts of PRSC-4 stem from its sectoral coverage.
These impacts, which are mainly linked to the measures for rural development, privatization o f
ONATEL and reform ofthe energy sector, as well as to investmentsin education and health, should
not be extensive; nor will they be irreversible. At this stage, the potential environmental and social
impacts can be described only in general terms.

18.      PRSC-4 will deal with the environmental issues mentioned below and will be based on the
national regulation requiring an environmental impact study for qualified investments, on the
ongoing sectoral investment projects supported by the Bank and on the EA capacity-building
activities supported by PRSC-4.

19.      Rural development: The reform measures envisaged under PRSC-4 relating to rural
development fall into two categories. The first category concerns activities likely to encourage
agricultural diversification. The second category relates to activities connected with opening o f the
cotton subsector.

20.      DiversiJcation. The potential environmental impacts related to the activities mentioned
above are diverse in nature but not irreversible. Agricultural diversification could improve soil
fertility management and reduce the need for pesticides, but it could also result in more intensive
cultivation methods. Efforts to intensify agricultural production may result in better soil fertility
management (for example, by addition o f nutrients) but may also lead to increased and inappropriate
use o f pesticides, with possible adverse (and sometimes catastrophic) environmental and social
impacts.


                                                  100

21.     The potential environmental impacts related to the intensification of agricultural production
are being tackled by two main types o f government intervention. The first is the promotion o f
conservation practices that help to maintain the production capacity o f the resource base. Soil and
water conservation activities have long beenthe core of national efforts to encourage the adoption o f
sustainable agricultural practices. During the three years o f PRSP implementation, significant
progress has been made in this area under the auspices o f the national soil fertility initiative
(supported by HIPC resources). Labor-intensive soil and water conservation arrangementshave been
introduced. The creation of village resource conservation groups helped to accelerate these efforts
duringthe secondyear ofPRSP implementation, although no quantitative evaluation is yet available.

22.     The second type o f intervention was designedto mitigate the adverse environmental impacts
o f agricultural intensification, such as pesticide-related pollution and dangers. The most significant
efforts in this area concern pesticide registration. In addition to the national policy initiatives, these
efforts are helping a regional pesticide registration initiative supported by a number o f donors
through the ComitC Permanent Inter Etats de Lutte Contre la SCcheresse au Sahel (CILSS). Pesticide
management and pest management efforts have expanded in recent years inBurkina Faso. However,
integrated pest control initiatives inthe country have so far achieved only very limited success.

23.     Through the decentralized rural development operation financed by IDA, the Government
will support the promotion o f alternative and complementary pest management methods, in
accordance with the provisions o fthe Bank OP on pest management (OP 4.09) and with the Burkina
Faso regulations issued in articles 42 to 46 (dealing with problems o f pesticide and fertilizer
management) o f the Environment Code (see also document E377). The application o f these policies
and rules will require the adoption o f specific measures for the handling, use and conservation o f
products, sensitization and training o f stakeholders. The rural community development operation
financed by IDA is supporting the diagnostic tool that will help to identify and mitigate any adverse
social and environmental impact related to community investments.

24.     Opening of the cotton sector. The transfer of two cotton-growing zones, including ginning
plants, may raise environmental impact issues, particularly concerning environmental responsibility
in connection with this privatization. Inorder to reduce the impact o fthe privatization and establish
investors' responsibility inthe context o fthe transfer o fpart o fthe assets o f SOFITEX (the semistatal
cotton firm), an environmental audit o f the ginning plants was conducted in order to ascertain the
scope o f the problems and potential environmental responsibilities and decide how to take them into
consideration in the privatization transactions. The results o f this environmental audit were made
available before the financial bids were submittedso that the costs related to mitigation o f potential
environmental and social problems could be taken into account. The final audit report recommends
for each region an environmental and social managementplan gearedto the following items:


    0   a plan for mitigationand optimization o f impacts.
    0   a list o f environmental and social parametersto be monitored.
    0   a list o f methods for tracking and periodic monitoring o f such parameters.
    e   a definition o f stakeholders' responsibilities.
    0   an estimate o f the cost o f the plan for mitigation and alleviation o f the impacts identified
        duringthe audits.

Inaddition, the auditors made recommendations to ensure better implementation ofthe measures set
out inthe recommendedenvironmental and social managementplan.



                                                     101

25.      Privatization of ONATEL. The privatization o f ONATEL may raise questions concerning
the responsibility of the new owner for environmental questions, either as regards existing
installations or as regards investments to be made in the fbture. The privatization o f ONATEL was
accompanied by an IDA technical assistance credit for competitiveness and enterprise development
(PCDE). This project financed an environmental audit o f the firm before the start o fthe privatization
process, in accordance with environmental annex E530 o f the project. The audit recommendations
concerning the management o f environmental responsibilities were included in the bidding
documents and implementation ofthe recommendations is supervised by the IDA project.

26.      Energy sector reform. The reform of the energy sector raises the issues o f the
environmental responsibility o fpotential investors. Inaddition, the investments inthe construction o f
the interconnecting line betweenBobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougouand the construction o fa new 14
M W power station raise environmental impact questions. The reform o f the energy sector is
accompanied by two IDA projects : the above-mentioned PCDE and a project for energy sector
reform under preparation. The various environmental audits have already been conducted. The audit
o f SONABHY was prepared inthe context o f the PCDE. Underthe energy sector reform project, the
investment component envisages the purchase of a 14 MW power station and construction of a line
interconnecting Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou. For this purpose, the following environmental
studies have beenmade:

        Evaluation o fenvironmental and social protection under the reform.
    0   Environmentalimpact study o fthe 14MW diesel station at Kossodo.

    0   Environmental impact study o f the project interconnecting Bobo-Dioulasso                  and
         Ouagadougou.

27.      In accordance with existing arrangements and with the schedule drawn up with the World
Bank for the presentation o f the Burkina Faso energy file to the Board o f Governors, these studies
were officially presentedat a ceremony heldon February 9, 2004. On Tuesday, February 10, 2004, a
press announcement was made inthe principal newspapers in Burkina Faso. Init, the public was told
where the various environmental assessment reports couldbe consulted for the purpose ofexpressing
opinions and submitting amendments, observations, comments and counter-proposals.

28.      The different audits address the environmental responsibilities o f potential investors, which
will be included in the specifications, and propose mitigating measures for the investmentsfor the
interconnection. Implementation o fthe recommendations is supervised bythe two IDA projects.

29.     Health sector development:In general, the reforms supported under PRSC-4 in the health
sector concern capacity building and decentralization o f services delivery, and upgrading o f human
resources. More specifically, PRSC-4 continues to give priority to improving access by the poor to
basic services (by abolition o f fees for preventive care and reduction o f prices for essential
medicines), maintaining adequate budget allocations for primary health services and developing a
better policy o f staff motivation. Essentially, these PNDS-based activities will have only a small
number o f adverse and irreversible environmental impacts. The main environmental concern is the
management o f dangerous medical waste (including needles) and the disposal o f dangerous
substances, human body parts, etc.
30.     Dangerous medical waste is a source o f concern to the authorities. Specific measures
consisting mainly o f packaging and disposing o f such waste (by incineration) were taken as part o f
the management and administration of all health care centershervices. These arrangements are part



                                                  102

o f the present ten-year national plan. Here too, the IDA support operation for efforts to combat
HIV/AIDS has formulated and adopted a nationalplan for medicalwaste management, which will
serve as a guide for the executingunit inprocessing suchwaste (see document E715).

31.     Developmentof basic education:The main activities plannedunder the proposed PRSC-4
are continued support for the poorest families in the form of subsidized school supplies, increase in
the number of schools and capacity building in the Ministry of Basic Education. The only potential
environmental impacts linked to these activities could result from the construction of school
buildingsand o frelatedsanitary infrastructures.

32.     Through the Ten-year Basic Education Development Plan (PDDEB), PRSC-4 will ensure
compliancewith Bank requirements and policies inthe context of school infrastructureconstruction.
The PDDEBhasprepareda frameworkthat conformsto Bankrequirements.

Linkage between PRSC-4 and supplementary sectoral investment projects as regards
compliancewith safeguards

33.     As will be apparent from the above analysis, there is a close and direct link betweenPRSC-4
and the sectoral investmentprojectsas regardscompliancewith environmentaland social safeguards.
Since these accompanyingsectoral investmentoperations havetheir own environmentalmanagement
plans (EMPs) formulated to offset the main environmentaland social impactsidentifiedduringtheir
evaluation, it is more rational to use these plans as a basis in order to guarantee compliance with
Bankrequirementsandpolicies.

34.     Since the Task Team Leaders of these investment operations are members o f the PRSC-4
team, they are responsible individually (at any rate, more than the PRSC-4 team) for ensuring full
implementationof the EMPs of the operations, which they lead. The details o fthese Environmental
Management Plans can be found inthe EnvironmentalAssessments (EAs) ofthe respectiveprojects.
For information, the sectoralinvestmentoperationscoveredbythe PRSC-4 environmentaland social
safeguards are:


     0  The Community-basedRuralDevelopmentproject.
     0  The BasicEducationSector project.
     0  The Responseto HIV/AIDSproject.

Readinessof the borrowerto dealwith safeguards issues

36.     Like many other IDA countries, Burkina Fasoprepared a National Environment Action Plan
(NEAP) at the beginningofthe 1990s. Unlikeinthe other countries, however, the NEAPof Burkina
Faso was not reflected in a coherent investment program, which could have included capacity-
building components. The result was delays in creating the regulatory framework, a lack o f
experience and limited capacity in certain areas o f environmental management, particularly
environmental assessment. The current regulatory framework for the country's environmental
management is the result o fa slow but steady development o f environmental law, including land law,
forest law and mining law.

37.     In accordance with the Interim Directives (of the PRSCs) and OD 8.60, preparation of the
PRSCs provided an opportunity to verify the country's readiness to apply the environmental
assessmentto development projects. This work, done under PRSC-1, focused on the institutional and
technical capacity o f the government agencies involved in supervising environmental assessment
(EA), Most environmental policies and practices inBurkinaFaso are basedon the Environment Law
enacted in 1997. Articles 17 to 24 o f this law describe the situations in which an environmental
assessment o f development activities i s required, as well as the procedures to be followed for its
preparation, Typically, the law requires that any development activity likely to produce major
adverse environmental impacts should be the subject o f an environmental assessment, which must be
endorsedby the Ministryo f the Environment. The law also requires that a public consultation should
be organized with the affected partieskommunities to discuss potential impacts and ways to mitigate
them.

38.     The assessment found that Burkina Faso has the necessary regulations pertaining to
environmental assessment but that compliance with such regulations was weak. There were three
main reasons for this situation. The first one was the very recent enactment o f these regulations
(1997) and the late adoption o f the implementation decree (June 2001). The second reason was the
lack of clarity in the responsibilities o f the institutions responsible for ensuring compliance with
these regulations. Finally, the lack o f technical capacity and awareness both within the Government
and in the non-government sector for applying EA to development operations constituted a major
obstacle to obtaining a higher level o f compliance with the regulations enacted. On the basis o f this
assessment, it was agreed that EA capacity building would be the focus o f the measuresproposed to
deal with environmental issues in the PRSCs. In addition, it has been found that overlapping
responsibilities within these institutions and unclear mandatesare an obstacle to effective application.

Arrangementsto enable the Borrower to dealwith safeguards issues

39.     A long-term capacity-building commitment will be required in order to remove the
constraints preventing effective compliance with Bank safeguard policies and EA requirements in
Burkina Faso. On the basis o f the revisions o f the country's environmental policies and practices
(PRSC-I), it was agreed between the Bank and the Borrower that long-term EA capacity buildingat
the national level (national agencies, consulting firms, NGOs, civil society, etc.) is the best way of
ensuring effective compliance with Bank safeguards in PRSCs. This approach o f filling the gap in
the Borrower's capacities is in conformity with the Operational Memorandum on the Interim
Directives for PRSCs (attachments 1 and 2). The arrangements to enable the Borrower to deal with
safeguards issues are based on PRSC-3. In particular, these arrangements consist o f two types o f
activity and are designed to enhance due diligence while permitting the development o f local
capacity to the level at which national agencies can ensure effective monitoring and suitable


                                                   104

application o f EA requirements.The first type o f activity consists o f measures to supplement those
adopted and implemented under PRSC-3 and inthe preparation o f PRSC-4; the second type involves
enhanced supervision of Bank operations under way in the country. The goal is to ensure full
compliance with plans for management o f the environmental and social safeguards adopted at the
time when these operations were assessed.

Implementationof measuresadopted under PRSC-4

40.      As mentioned above, the Government needs to expand its efforts to create conditions
conducive to compliance with EA requirements. PRSC-4 will continue to expand previously initiated
capacity-building activities. More specifically, the arrangements to ensure adequate treatment o f
environmental issues that are included inthe proposed PRSC-4 are a continuation o f the measures in
PRSC-3, and will focus on three main areas.

41.      EA capacity building. The activities in the three-year plan for EA capacity building
prepared by the Borrower include training (government personnel, consulting firms, and NGOs),
sensitization (education and information campaigns), and application (environmental audit and
technical assistance for implementation o f the environmental management plans o f investment
operations). The plan was prepared with the idea o f mobilizing donor co-financing to support
implementation. Apart from some limited funding provided by the bilateral donor (now exhausted),
resources have been sparse. An interim solution proposed under PRSC-3 is to identify key priority
capacity-building activities, which could be financed from the 2004 government budgetunder PRSC-
4. A program has been formulated for the provision o f training during 2004. This program was
integrated in the PRSP priority action program prepared for the period 2004-2006, in accordance
with the recommendations made along these lines by the PRSC-3 macroeconomic review mission
conducted duringNovember 2003. Inaddition, inthe context o fpreparation o fthe 2005-2007 MTEF,
the Ministry o f Environment and Living Conditions (MECV) included environmental protection
activities in its priority program for financing. Inaddition, through the project o f institutional support
for the permanent secretariat o f the National Council for the Environment and Sustainable
Development (CONEDD), which is in its final phase and was implemented with the support o f
Belgian technical cooperation, MECV was able in 2003 to organize two EA workshops for central,
regional and provincial directors o fenvironment and living conditions

42.      Secondly, emphasis is placed on integration o f the environment inthe sectoral ministries, by
sensitization and capacity building. UnderPRSC-3, this goal was pursuedby the creation o fEA focal
points in the ministriesconcerned. These focal points consist o f one person per ministry. Since there
i s a considerable risk that the focal point may move to another place or another assignment, it was
considered that the risk o fthe focal point disappearing should be reducedby involving more than one
person. Duringthe workshop on Bank safeguardsheld inNovember 2002, the participants asked that
the concept o fan EA sectoral focal point should be replaced by that o fan EA sectoral cell consisting
o ftwo or three persons. These cells will helpto ensure compliance with EA requirementsin sectoral
investments, if necessary. In particular, they will serve as starting-points for environmental pre-
selection for public investmentsintheir respective ministries, before the Ministry o fthe Environment
makes more detailed recommendations and institutes follow-up.

43.     To sum up, 12 technical ministries with activities related to environmental management are
concerned by the creation o f environment cells within their research and planningdirectorates (DEP)
for the following reasons. Technical project documentation is initiated by the ministries within the
DEPs, which must ensure that environmental aspects are taken into account. At the ministry level,


                                                   105

the DEPs chair the procurement committees and, inthis capacity, can introduce a clause concerning
EMPimplementation inthe biddingdocumentstransmittedto bidders.So far, all 12ministrieshave a
focal point and three o f them have created environment cells (Ministry o f Finance and Budget,
Ministry o f Commerce, Promotion of Enterprise and Handicrafts, Ministry of Infrastructure,
Transport and Housing). These cells will be created on a case-by-case basis.

44.     The third element ofEA capacity building inthe proposed credit concems the formulation of
sectoral directives to assist the Ministry o f the Environment, the sectoral focal cells and non-
governmental stakeholders (NGOs and consulting firms helping in EA preparation) in pre-selection,
consideration and application o f EA requirements.

45.     Inthis connection, the Directorate General for the Environment (DGE) has embarked on the
preparation o f four guides to Environmental Impact Studies (EIS) for mining, road, industry and
urban development projects. In addition, there is a general guide on EIS and a guide on public
surveys. All these guides, drafts o f which are available, will be disseminated after validation at
workshops during 2004.

46.     Improved monitoring of environmental management plans (EMPs). In order to ensure
due diligence and compliance with Bank safeguardsunder PRSC-4, when capacity-building activities
are under way, greater attention must be paid to implementation o f the sectoral operations o f EMPs
under way and supported by IDA. The main responsibility for ensuring compliance with
environmental and social safeguards during PRSC-4 will fall to the operations under way in sectors
covered by the credit: rural development, education and health. Because environmental and social
mitigation measures are a key element o f any EMP, when their respective EMPs are implemented,
these operations will automatically conform to Bank safeguardpolicies.

47.     Under PRSC-4, supervision o f Environmental Management Plans concemed three IDA
projects to which the DGE has given priority: the Ten-year Basic Education Development Plan
(PDDEB), the National Program for the Management o f Territory (PGNT 2) and the ZIGA project.
The process leading to the preparation o fa report is dividedinto the following phases:

        1) Preparationofsupervision

        0   Two meetings with project managers convened by the Ministry o f Finance and Budget
            (the latestwas heldon 26 January2004).
        0   Preparation o f a document transmitting a Technical Note on the Environmental
           Management Plan for the attention o f Task Team Leaders.
        0  Preparation o fTOR for the supervision mission.

        2) ContactingTaskTeam Leadersin order to schedule the mission

        0  Exchangeso f correspondence inorder to obtain documents (documents received between
            13 and 17 February 2004).
        0  Physical contact with Leaders in order to settle the practical arrangements for the field
           mission scheduledto take place from 23 February to 19 March 2004.

4) Findingsafter oneweek of fieldtrips

PNGTteam

   Recognitionofthe needfor the supervisionmission.
   The missionis perceivedas anadvisory supportmission.
   The activities of PNGT2 cover the same area as the study and EnvironmentalImpact
   Notice (EIN), but the team concentratedon projectsand activities subject to the national
   regulationsrelatingto environmentalassessment:the healthand social promotioncenters
   (CSPSs), dam construction and downstream development, forest development and
   managementplan,pastureland developmentplans.
   Distribution of the Environmental Assessment report was apparently limited to the
   former provincialauthoritiesand does not extendto the new ones.
   Certain provincial authorities that have the EA report plan to introduce mitigating
   measures, while others are payingno attention.
   Provincialauthoritiesare quite unfamiliarwith the regulationsconcerningenvironmental
   assessment: only one has Decree No. 2001-342 of 17 July 2001 on the sphere of
   application, contents and procedures of the study and of the environmental impact note
   (EIN).
   The PNGT-I1EA report recommends that an EA or EINshould be prepared for specific
   projects (shallows management, infrastructure construction). However, projects are
   sometimes split up into several tranches for financial reasons (former CSPS and school
   complex), makingit difficult to requireanEINor anEA.

PDDEBteam

0  As a program, PDDEBwas the subject ofa strategicEA, a copy ofwhich was sent to the
   coordinationunit.
0  The programs and activity reports do not mention implementation of the assessment
   recommendations. The EMP segment of PDDEB is merged with the ""One school, one
   grove" component, which predatesPDDEB.
0  The coordinationunit has no knowledge of the above-mentioneddecree regulatingEAs
   andEINs inBurkinaFaso.
0  A PDDEBmanager participatedinthe EA workshop organizedinNovember2002 bythe
   World Bankand the MinistryofEnvironmentand LivingConditions.

           the ZIGA project.
        0  Financingis beingacquired for implementationofthe downstream EMP.

After one week of field trips, and pending analysis of the findings, the following partial
recommendationsmay be made:


    0   The decree on EAs and EINs should be widely disseminated among managers o f IDA
        projects.
    0   Sessions shouldbeheldto sensitize managersofthese projectsto EMPimplementation.
    0   An environmentalclause should be drafted for inclusion in the PDDEB bidding documents
        and a component entitled "EMP implementation" should be created in the programmingof
        PDDEB activities, with inclusionofa relatedbudget line.

Program of reforms for preparation of PRSC-5

48. Inorder to strengthenenvironmentalsafeguards, the Government is aimingto continueits reform
programsduring2004. These reformsshouldenhancethe ability ofthe administrationto analyze the
environmental impact of activities financed from the State budget. In addition, motivated by the
encouraging results o f supervision of project EMPs, the Government will boost this aspect o f its
activities.

49. The activitiesto be undertaken in2004 for the preparationofPRSC-5will be:


     0   Implementationofthe key measures in the capacity-buildingplan developedunder PRSC-2
         inthe budget for 2004 and2005 and inclusionofthe measures inthe 2005-2007MTEF.
