REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT (PRSC", "versiontyp": "Gray cover", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Rating for the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC) for Burkina Faso\n            are as follows: overall outcome of the all three PRSC's\n            series was satisfactory, risk to development outcome for all\n            three series was moderate, and the performance of the Bank\n            and the Borrower was also rated satisfactory for all three\n            series. Key lessons drawn from the implementation of PRSC-4\n            to 6 are follows: (i) country ownership. The use of the PRSC\n            instrument to support implementation of the poverty\n            reduction strategy has contributed to strengthen country\n            ownership. Specifically, this PRSC series greatly reinforced\n            the importance of the budget and the country's own\n            capacity for the success of government policies; (ii)\n            harmonization of budget support among donors. The creation\n            of the Cadre General d'Organisation des Appuis\n            Budgetaires (General Framework for Budget Support) (CGAB)\n            and its unified framework for budget support and joint\n            performance matrix provided an effective framework to\n            harmonize the dialogue and efforts of Burkina Faso's\n            development partners, including this PRSC series, with the\n            government's own strategy. In particular, it allowed\n            for early entry points in the policy dialogue with the\n            government and the identification of corrective measures or\n            solution to implementation bottlenecks. It also allowed for\n            all actors to make good use of analytical work. Furthermore,\n            close and continuous dialogue with the government allowed\n            CGAB members to better understand the constraints on the\n            reform process and build government ownership. This was\n            particularly relevant for some complex reform areas, like\n            cotton, decentralization, privatization and the reduction of\n            factor costs; and (iii) primacy of the cotton sector. Recent\n            developments in the cotton sector have highlighted the\n            importance of the sector for the country's\n            macroeconomic stability and growth, the need to adjust the\n            government strategy in the cotton sector to reflect recent\n            exogenous shocks and the importance of continued Bank\n            involvement in this sector. The increased focus of the third\n            PRSC series on reforms in the cotton sector reflects the\n            need to flexibly adjust the strategic orientation and\n            emphasis of the PRSCs. The lessons drawn from the experience\n            with cotton sector reform also show the need to broaden the\n            analysis of the risks inherent in the development of this sector."}, "docdt": "2008-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
