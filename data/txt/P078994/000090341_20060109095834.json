Lessons learned from the\n            project: In assessing overall progress in the implementation\n            of reforms sought under Poverty Reduction Support Credits\n            (PRSCs), one should take into account the track-record\n            established by a country. One continuous lesson from\n            PRSCs' implementation in Burkina is the need for\n            strengthening the PRSC-related sectoral dialogue by\n            involving more actively line ministries as well as Bank\n            sector teams. An important issue is how Bank's teams\n            could get better involved in budget preparation whether\n            formally or informally. An emerging lesson is the need to\n            pay more attention to the effectiveness of parallel support projects."}, "docdt": "2005-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
