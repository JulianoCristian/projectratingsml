   strategy presented in the 2000 Country Assistance Strategy\n            (CAS) and the 2003 CAS progress report. Consistent with the\n            four strategic pillars of the PRSP-accelerating broad-based\n            growth, promoting access to social services, increasing\n            employment and income- generating activities for the poor,\n            and promoting good governance- PRSC-4 supports the\n            implementation of key reforms to accelerate growth and\n            income creation, improve social service delivery, and\n            strengthen budget management and governance. There are three\n            project components. Under the growth and income creation\n            component, the operation supports reforms in the cotton,\n            telecommunication, and energy sectors as well as the labor\n            market to lower factor costs, increase productivity, and\n            favor new investments. The second component of the credit\n            includes policies in the education, health, and water\n            sectors to build infrastructure, lower the cost of services,\n            improve service quality, and reinforce monitoring and\n            evaluation. The third component encompasses policy measures\n            to strengthen budget execution, procurement, budget control,\n            public sector performance, decentralization, and\n            environmental management."}, "docdt": "2004-04-14T00:00:00Z"}
