Rural development\n            entails actions focused on agricultural diversification, and\n            the liberalization of the cotton sub-sector. Although\n            diversification efforts will likely improve agricultural\n            extension and production, due to improved soil fertility\n            through the adoption of nutritional substances, the use of\n            pesticides may threaten the environment. Thus, it is\n            recommended that appropriate use of pesticides be\n            implemented, in accordance with standard international best\n            practices, following training and capacity building as\n            necessary. Soil and water conservation is being pursued at a\n            national level, through community participation and village\n            groups, who contribute their resources and efforts.\n            Concerning the cotton sub-sector, the parastatal enterprise\n            SOFITEX, conducted an environmental audit of its\n            establishment and cotton gins, to determine cost estimates\n            for an environmental management, and identify best\n            practices. Similarly, Onatel conducted an environmental\n            audit prior to privatization, whose recommendations are\n            being incorporated in procurement and contract documents, to\n            be enforced during implementation. Construction for, and\n            installation of power lines and interconnections, as well as\n            new central power stations, should comply with standard\n            international regulations. As for improvements in the\n            education and health sectors, specific environmental\n            management measures will apply for schools construction,\n            with adequate infrastructure (water supply and sanitation\n            measures), while particular attention will be given to\n            medical wastes disposal."}, "docdt": "2004-01-07T00:00:00Z"}
