REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO MALAYSIA FOR THE
WESTERN JOHORE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation on a pro-
posed loan to Malaysia for the equivalent of US$45.0 million to help
finance the Western Johore Agricultural Development Project. The loan
would have a term of 25 years, including 6 years of grace, with interest
at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE EOONOMY
2.          The latest economic report (No. 217-MA) was circulated to
the Executive Directors in August, 1973. An annual economic mission
visited Mal ysia in January/February 1974, and its report will be circ-
ulated in due course.  Country data for Malaysia are included as Annex I.
3.          With a per capita GNP of about US$400 (1971), Malaysia is one
of the most prosperous developing countries in Southeast Asia.  The
econoiy has maintained fairly high rates of real growth, the GNP growing
at an average of about 6 percent a year during the last decade, with an
increase to 6.5 percent forecast for the first half of the 1970's.
Exports, which account for over 40 percent of GNP, have been growing at
4 to 5 percent a year. The country's balance of payments position is
sound. There are few foreign exchange controls and external reserves are
equal to eight months' imports.
4.          Malaysia has significantly diversified its exports in the last
few years. Wahereas in 1961 nearly 50 percent of merchandise export earnings
was derived from rubber, in the last few years only about one-third
originated from this source. Timber and palm oil exports have risen sub-
stantially, in 1973 representing an estimated 14 percent of merchandise
exports. This trend is expected to continue.
5.          It is too early to forecast with any precision how the world-
wide energy problems will affect the Malaysian economy, but it is unlikely
that Malaysia will suffer a shortage. In 1973 Malaysia's pmduction of
crude petroleum was about 100,000 barrels per day, or 4s.5 million long
tons during the year, and in about four years is expected to increase five-
fold. In 1973 Malaysia was still a net importer of petroleum products,
at a net cost of about US$40 million; however, based on present production
and consumption trends, Malaysia is expected to become a net exporter of
petroleum by 1977. Sibstantial reserves of natural gas have been found
which in the next few years will become an important foreign exchange
earner. Malaysia's hydroelectric potential is fairly large and detailed
investigations of known possible sites are being accelerated.



6.          Agriculture has accounted for about 30 percent of the
country's GDP and about 50 percent of employment but the manufacturing
sector is making an increasingly important contribution. During the
Second Malaysia Plan (SMP) period (1971-75), agricultural growth Is
ex)ected to average about 8.5 percent, while the projected growth rate
for the manufacturing sector is 14 percent. The manufacturing sector now
accounts for 15 percent of GDP, about 22 percent of merchandise exports,
and employs 10 percent of the working population.
7.          Although Malaysia achieved satisfactory rates of growth of
production during the 1960's, a decline of 20 percent in the terms of
trade reduced real income growth from 6 to about 4.5 percent per annum,
resulting in a less than 2 percent increase in per cepita income. This
trend continued into the early years of the present decade. However,
during 1973 a boom in export prices improved the terms of trade, boosting
real GNP by about 10 percent, and leading to a real per capita income
growth of 7 to 8 percent.
8.          Population growth rates will remain high for some time, around
2.7 percent per annum, accompanied by a growth in the labor force of about
3.3 percent per annum, but Malaysia's physical resources and employment
potential are great. The Second Malaysia Plan (SMP) projects an average
annual increase in employment of 3.4 percent accompanied by a reduction
in underemployment.   In the longer term, over the next two decades, Malaysia
expects to reduce the unemployment rate from 7.5 to 4 percent. Daring
this period, the agricultural share of the labor force in Peninsular
Malaysia is expected to drop by almost 20 percent to 33 percent, and the
employment share in manufacturing is expected to more then double, rising
to 24 percent.
9.          During the last several years the Government's long-term
planning has concentrated on the problem of reducing the economic disparity
between the Malays, who account for a little over half the population,
and non-Malays, who are predominantly Chiinese. Over the next 20 years
the New Economic Policy, as it is called, aims to eradicate poverty and
to restructure society so that the present identification of race with
economic activity will eventually be eliminated.   The basic outlines of
the pollcy are sound and allow for continued growth for each of the
principal ethnic groups while at the same time enlarging economic opp-
ortunities for Malays. The SMP seeks to support these two objectives
by encouraging economic growth.



10.         The SAp also refl.ctS the overnmnent'a choice of a more
vigorous role for the public sector in the couittry'3 development
effort    "he reviand plan proposes an ailocatlon or US$4 billion for
publLc develospmernt expenditures, twice the level under the first plan.
The. public sector' s planing end implementation capacity has been
expanded, although severae planning and operating agencies still suffer
from substantial manpower shortages. The improvement in the Gorernment's
capacity to prepare and execute proiects resulted in expendituires during
the first three years of the plan period that wore already t;wo-thirds of
the original. plan 0llocation. The revised plan levels anticipate a
fu-ther strengthenlng of project identification and implementation in the
public sector.  fst of the :I.ncreased a1l1ocatIon is earnarkred to support
the New Economic Policy, including among other items (i) the expansion of
the land settlement programs to provide employment opportunities, (ii)
incre. a.sed support to the manufacturing sector to diversify the economy
and to provide increazed emiployment in higher income jobs', and (iii) the
prcvision of training aid education to upgrade the job opportunities of
the low-income groups.
11.         During the first three years of the Second Malaysia PTlan,
1971-73, total public sector development expenditures amounted to about
US2. 2 billon, of vhich 50 percent was financed by net domestic borrow-
Ing and 16 percent by net foreign borrowing. The balance was financed
largely by current surpluses. The Bankl has provided slightly less than
40 percent of the foreign loan commitmentts  and bilateral aid, mainly
from the United Kingdom, other Commonrwealth countriee, Germany, Japan,
and loans from the Asian Development Bank, provided the rest. Domestic
financing resources for the remaining two years of the AP is considered
adequate. Government reveniues are satisfactory, accounting i.n 1972 for
22 percent of GNP. In addition, the Government can readily borrow
substantial amounts from domestic resources, notably from the Government
Enployees' Provident Fund. The estimated external net inflow require-
ments of public medium- and long-term loanis will amount to about US$190
million. New foreign loan commitments are expected to come from the same
sources with a significant increase in Japanese lenvding. New commitments
from the Bank are expected to remain at about 4O percent of the total.
This level of foreign borrowing is well within Malaysia's debt-servicing
capacity. Debt service obligations at present are about 3.5 percent of
exports of goods and non-factor services and are estimated not to exceed
8 percent during ttE late 1970's. The current Bank share of Malaysia's
debt service payments is 22 percent and is expected to increase to about
25 percent by the end of 1978.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPEMATIONS IN MALAYSIA
12.         The Bank has made 24 loans to Malaysia for projects in
eduacation, population, agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power,
wate.r- supply, telecommunications, ports, railways, roads anid urban trans-
port. Although in a few cases disbursements were slow, the execution of
these projects has generally been satisfactory. As of January 31, 1974,



the loans to Malaysia held by the Bank amounted to US.$350.9 million. In
Addition, the Bank rnrde a loan in 1965 to the Public Utilities Board,
Singapore (Loan 405-MA), guaranteed by Malaysia, to finance the Johoro
River Water Project. The amount held by the Bank under that loan is
US$5.2 iziillion. Seven loans have been fully disbursed. Annex II contains
a summa.y statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of January 31,
1974, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.         Bank assistance to Malaysia is intended to support. the Goveni-
ment's efforts within the framework of the New Foconomic FPtoicy to redress
imbalances in rural and urban incomes, to create employment for the urban
unemployed and to reduce ruLral underemployment.  Since Malaysia's land
development and rural development programs provide the most effective
Government instnv rment for tackling the issues o£ unemployment and income
imbalance, the Bank will continue to give financial support to these pro-
grwr:..  9b far, the Bank has made three loans for land settlement projects
in the Jengka Triangle area, where about 100,000 acres of land are being
developed and about 10,000 smallholders are being settled, and one loan
for land settlement in the State of Johore, Where about 4,500 families will
be settled.  The Bank has also made two loans for irrigation, ane for the
Muda Irrigation ProJect (Loan 434-IA) and anotner- for the Kemubu Irrigation
ProJect (Loan 500-4MA), both projects assisting low-income rice growers.
In addition, the Bank will contlnue to assist Malaysia in the critical
fields of education to increase educationel opportunities for the rural poor
with one loan in this ,Iscal year. Also, the Bank will ontinue to assist
in the financing of infrastructure development that will irtmprove conditions
in the urban areas .and help support manufacturing.  The Bank has helped the
Governmerit to prepare projects either in the course of its lending operations
or by acting as &-ecuting Agerncy for UNDP-fiianced stuaies.  '.he Bank has
also helped strengthen pub:Lic agencies responsible for carrying out important
parts of Malaysia's investment program.   We wrill continue this policy which
will be reflected in the loans to be presented to the Executive Directors
in the next year or so. These loans would be for projects involving agri-
cultural developmeLnt, agricul2tur.l credit , agricO.turaL reseasrch, education,
public utilities and infrastructure development.   In agriculture, where
the foreign exchange content of projects is often small, the Bank will oon-
tinue to cover a portion of local costs.
14.         IFC has been active in Malaysia since 1963 and lhas made five
investments totalling US$8.7 million (kAnex II).   The tot-al commitments
under these investaents held by IFC as of January 31, 1974 amounted to
US$b.5 million. The Corporation has under preliminary consideration a wood
processing and a pulp and paper project.



PART III - AGRICULTURE IN MALAYSIA
General
15.         The agricultural sector holds a pre-eminent position in
the Malaysian economy. In 1972 it generated around 30 percent of gross
domestic product, provided employment for over 50 percent of the econ-
omically active population, and accounted for about 60 percent of
Malaysia's foreign exchange earnings. Expansion of rubber exports in
the 1960's, in the face of declining prices, was achieved by large gains
in productivity. At the same time, crop diversification, mainly to oil
palm, was vigorously encouraged and has resulted in Malaysia becoming the
world's largest producer of palm oil. Rice production has been increased
by half through the provision of irrigation, and Malaysia is now nearing
self-sufficiency. Malaysia is second only to Taiwan as an exporter of
pineapple but is finding it increasingly difficult to maintain her share
of the market. Other major crops, such as coconut, coffee, fruits and
vegetables, are grown mainly for internal consumption.
16.         The agricultural population includes some of the most
economically depressed sections of the Malaysian community. Those engaged
in fishing and padi production are at or near the bottom of the income
ladder. khereas the average GNP per head for Malaysia in 1971 was about
M$950, the GNP per head for agriculture was only about half of that. Few
data are available on the size distribution of rural incomes between types
of activity, but it would appear that the smaller padi and rubber producers
in particular have incomes of only about M$200 to M$250 per capita.
17.         The main thrust of agricultural policy is, on the one hand,
to resettle landless rural unemployed and marginal smallholders on viable
holdings planted with oilpalm, rubber and other crops and, on the other
hand, to raise the incomes of existing potentially viable smallholdings
by providing infrastructure and agricultural services. As mentioned in
paragraph 13, the Bank is helping to finance four land settlement projects
which are proceeding very satisfactorily. In support of the Government's
second objective, the Bank has also helped to finance two irrigation
projects to increase padi production. Disbursements have been completed
and agricultural production increases exceed estimates made at appraisal.
A major study, undertaken by the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program, is presently
analyzing the impact of the projects on the local economy and income levels.
A problem is still the prevalence of absentee landlords. The results of
the study, expected by mid-1974, should assist the Government in tackling
the land tenure problem in the areas.
18.         Over the last ten years Government has substantially streng-
thened and restructured the institutions dealing with agriculture. The
major institution responsible for land settlement is the Federal Land
Development Authority (FELDA) which is currently engaged in a program of
developing about 100,000 acres of land and settling some 8,000 to 10,000
families annually. Other land settlement programs are being undertaken
by the individual states and by the Rubber Smallholders Development
Authority (RISDA) which, in addition, is responsible for replanting assist-
ance to rubber smallholders. Agricultural research has recently been



consolidated in the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development
Institute (MARDI) and the Bank is considering helping to finance a
comprehensive research program covering most of the existing small-
holders' crops. Farmers Organizations (Fi's) are presently being est-
ablished in all smallholder areas throughout Malaysia and the Govern-
ment's aim is that all extension services previously undertaken by the
Department of Agricuiture will be channelled through these organizations.
A Farmers Organization Authority (FOA) was recently created to super-
vise the management of the FO's. All the FO's are Government-financed
and the finance is channelled through the FOA. The main source of rural
credit is the Bank Pertanian Malaysia (BPM) with loan processing and
disbursements being handled by the FO's for a small fee. This system has
worked well in the two Bank-assisted irrigation projects. The proposed
project would be the first project to assist existing tree crop small-
holders on a large scale and would use the above discussed agricultural
institutions in order to maximize the benefits from the infrastructural
investments.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Western Johore Agricultural Development Pogram
19.         The Government of Malaysia has prepared an agricultural devel-
opment program for the western part of the State of Johore in Peninsular
Malaysia. The program is aimed mainly at raising the income levels of the
eisting smallholders, who belong to the lowest 25 percent income group in
Malaysia. The program covers a gross area of 930,000 acres and consists
of the improvement of drainage facilities and the development of agri-
cultural resources through changes in cropping patterns to suit soils, the
introduction of better agronomic techniques and the provision of agri-
cultural supporting services. The proposed project forms the first phase
of the Western Johore Agricultural Development Program. It covers about
330,000 acres (see Map) of land in the southern part of the region with a
population of 200,000. Of the total area, about 137,000 acres is undeveloped;
the rest has rudimentary drainage facilities and some parts are subject
to salt water intrusion.
20.         The project was appraised in July/August 1973 and negotiations
were held in February 1974. The Malaysian delegation was led by
Mr. Abdullah bin Salleh, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Agriculture
and Fisheries. A loan and project summary is included as Annex III. The
Appraisal Report, No. 314a-MA dated February 28, 1974, is being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors.
Project Description
21.         The proposed project consists of:   (a) the construction of 29
miles of coastal embankments; (b) construction and improvement of about
250 miles of main and lateral drains; (c) construction and improvement of
on-farm feeder drains and roads; (d) improvement of 36 miles of river
channels;  (e) construction of   project headquarters and eight new Agri-



cultural Development Centers to house agricultural supporting services;
(f) development of processing facilities;  and (g) a feasibility studby
for the second phase of the Western Johore Agrlcultural Development Fro-
gram. The project works would take about five years to construct.
Agricultural De1ve1oment Program
22.         To fully realize the benefits of the proposed investments,
an extensive agricultural development program has been prepared and forms
part of the project. The program will continue throughout the 30-year
development period foreseen for the project area. Agricultural develop-
ment would not only increase yields by more sustained extension work and
the introduction of new agronomic techniques, but would change the cropping
pattern by growing crops best suited to specific soils in the area.
Rubber, now the major crop, would be gradually replaced by oil palm, 60,000
acres of cash crops would be grown on existing undeveloped peat soils and
coconut areas would be interplanted with bananas, coffee mnd cocoa. The
existing pineapple industry would also be modernized through research and
development.
23.         There are 30,000 farm families (average size of six persons)
in the area, who mostly own their holdings. The average farm size is about
10 acres. Over 60 percent of the population are Malays. The project would
introduce modern farming techniques and raise the saallholders' incomes.
The local chiefs and village heads command considerable respect among the
people in the area and the modern agricultural institutions would work
through them to disseminate new technologies and encourage changes in
cropping patterns.  The sociological aspects of these innovations were con-
sidered during project appraisal and the proposed project organization
was designed to harmonize with the social structure of the area.
Doect Costs and Financing
2h.         Total cost of the project is estimated to be about US$100 million
(net of taxes) with a foreign exchange component of US$45 million or 45
percent of the total cost. The proposed Bank loan of US$45 million would
finance the estimated foreign exchange cost of the project. The balance of
the project costs (US$55 million) would be financed by the Government.
25.         Project beneficiaries would be expected to pay for the cost
of operation and maintenance of drainage works. In line with Government's
policy, they would not be required to pay directly for the capital costs
of the project. This is justifiable because: (a) the project works con-
sist mainly of drains aad an embankment to reduce sea water intrusion
and flooding and unlike irrigation projects it would be difficult to relate
farm charges directly to services renderedj (b) incomes in the area, even
after full development, would remain below the projected average rural
incomes; and (c) additional revenue accruing to the Government as a result
of the project, especially through increases in export taxes and land
taxes, as well as reduction in pineapple subsidies, would be sufficient to
cover the Government's investment costs and incremental expenditures



incurred for agricultural extension services throughout the life of the
project (excluding interest). It is estimated that incremental revenues
to the Government would exceed cumulative expenditures by about US$6.4
miillior. (M$15 million) at the end of the project's development period.
Ladirect growth effects of the project on the economy would yield addition-
al revenues.
Procurement and Disbursement
26.         Contracts amounting to US$35.4 mil-lion (net of contingencies)
for civil works and US$4.6 million for equipment would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding and in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines.  About 60 percent of these contracts are expected to be won
by foreign bidders. In evaluating bids, loc a. equipment maiufacturers
would be allowed a margin of preference of 15 percent or the actual customs
duties, whichever is lower.   Cbntracts amounting to US$3.1 million for
agricultural processing plants and buildings, which are individually small
and scattered, would be awarded after locally advertised bidding.
27.         Feeder drains (total cost US$6.2 million), which also are
individually small and scattered in space and time, would be carried out
by the Dreinage and Irrigation Department (DID) of the Ministry of Agri-
culture through rural works contracts with village chiefs at fixed unit
rates determined annually by the Government as is now done for the main-
tenance of existing schemes.   Apart from the fact that these minor works
would not interest international contractors, the use of local institutions
would save the cost of land acquisition for such drains, as farmers would
donate the land required along their lot boundary. This saving would be
of the order of US$2 million. Furthermore, these contract3 wsould provide
work for and benefit the local rural population whilst -the project is still
in the development stage.
28.         Disbursements would be made against:   (a) 50 percent of civil
works expenditures;   (b) 100 percent of the c.i.f. cost of imported vehicles
and equipment; (c) 100 percent of the ex-factory cost of locally produced
vehicles and equipment procured after international competitive bidding;
and (d) 70 percent of imported but locally procured vehicles and equipment.
Disbursements are expected to be caopleted by JLune 30, 1980.
Organization and Management
29.         The Government would establish, within the Ministry of Agri-
culture and Fisheries, a Western Johore Agricultural Development Division
to be responsible for the overall implementation of the project, including
construction and agricultural development, and to coordinate the activities
of the various organizations and agencies involved. The Division would be
headed by a Project Director who would have full responsibility and
authority for making day-to-day decisions.   In general policy matters, the
Project Director and the Division would be guided by a Steering Committee



- 9 -
of senior Federal and State officials. The establishment of the
Division and the appointment of the Project Director would be conditions
of loan effectiveness.
30.         Several existing organizations would act as executing agents
of the Division in various aspects of project implementation. These
agents would be administratively responsible to the Project Director but
would receive technical direction from their own headquarters. The
Drainage and Irrigation Department of the Ministry of Agriculture would
be responsible for the construction of embankments, the improvement of
drainage facilities and feeder roads and would also be responsible for
maintaining and operating the drainage works.
31.         To spearhead the Agricultural Development Program, eight
Farmers Organizations (para 18) would be established in the project area
in addition to two now existing, and these would be located in Agricult-
ural Development Centers strategically located throughout the area. The
professional staff of the Farmers' Organizations would be responsible for
providing the necessary agricultural supporting services and promoting
changes in cropping patterns and introducing new agronomic techniques, and
for assistance in processing, marketing and transportation of rops where
required.   In all these activiti*s, the Farmers' Organizations would be
supported by various specialized agencies such as the Department of
Agriculture of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Rubber Industry Smallholders'
Development Authority, the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development
Institute and the Malaysian Pineapple Industry Board, all of which would
work from the Agricultural Development Centers. The Bank Pertanian Malaysia
would provide the agricultural credit required by the farmers at local
credit centers in the Agricultural Development Centers.
Benefits and Justification
32.         The proposed project would contribute significantly towards
achieving the Government's income distribution and employment objectives.
It will mainly benefit a group of smallholders belonging to the lowest 25
percent of the income groups in Malaysia. While the current average income
per farm family in the project area is about M$2,100 (US$900), it is
anticipated that the implementation of the project would achieve an increase
in income level to about M$3,700 (US$1,600) by 1983 and M$4,800 (US$2,100)
by the year 1993.
33.         It is estimated that the project would result in the creation
of about 12,000 new jobs by 1983 and about 24,000 by the year 2003.
Under-employment, which is substantial in the area, is expected to be con-
siderably reduced.
34.         The project will have a positive environmental impact.   By
draining the peat swamps, the project will contribute to the eradication
of malaria, currently the most serious health problem in the area.

35.         Since the project was appraised in July/August of last
year there have been considerable cost increases in Malaysia, particul-
arly as a result of the recent oil price increases. To allow for these
and expected further increases during the implementation period of the
project, the project costs were revised to take into account all the
immediately foreseeable effects of the energy crisis. Also, the projected
prices of the crops to be produced in the project area were revised upward
in the light of our latest estimate of long-term trends. The economic
rate of return of the project is now estimated at 15 percent.   While it
was not possible to analyze in detail the effects of the energy shortages
on international demand and the consequent possible indirect effects on
Malaysia's economy., we are confident that the proposed loan remains fully
justified.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
36.         The draft Loan Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the pro-
posed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft Loan Agreement conforms to the pattern normally used by the Bank
for agricultural development projects.
37.         I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
38.         I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Loan No. 533   Jengka Triangle Project; US$14.0 Million Loan of
April 17, 1968; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Loan No. 672   Second Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project; US$13.0
Million Loan of May 20, 1970; Closing Date: May 31, 1977
Loan No. 885   Third Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project; US$25.0
Million Loan of March 30, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The projecta consist of the clearing of forest, the planting of 62,000
acres of oil palms and 35,000 acres of rubber and the settlement of 10,000
families in the Jengka Triangle (State of Pahang). The Federal Land Develop-
ment Authority (FELDA), responsible for the execution of the project, operates
efficiently and its standard of planting and maintenance is high. The first
project (533-MA) has been completed. Cost overruns are estimated to have
been about US$5 million or 20 percent of appraisal cost estimates, of which
about US$3 million is due to the US$ devaluation. The Second Jengka Project
(672-MA) is also mostly completed. But, due to timber shortages, the
housing program is somewhat behind schedule. Cost overruns are estimated
at about US$3.5 million or 10 percent of appraisal cost estimates. of which
about US$3 million is due to the US dollar devaluation.   In terms of
economic viability, improved prospects for palm oil and rubber prices
have fully compensated for cost overruns on both projects. The Third
Jengka project is proceeding satisfactorily and is somewhat ahead of schedule.
Loan No. 673   Jengka Forestry Project; US$8.5 Million Loan of May 20,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
Implementation of the project, consisting of a highly complex
integrated forestry products industry established in the Jengka Triangle,
suffered because of management and technical problems, which were both
traced to the lack of previous experience of this kind in Malaysia. How-
ever, corrective steps were taken and performance, both managerial and
financial, has since been satisfactory.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 700   Fifth Power Project; US$20.0 Million Loan of
July 16, 1970; Closing Date: January 31, 1975
Implementation of the projects consisting of extensions to
existing thermal plants of the National Electricity Board system were
delayed because of manufacturers' delays, particularly in supplying
structural steels and turbo-alternators. Loan No. 579 will be disbursed
by the present Closing Date which was extended from March 31, 1973. The
Closing Date for Loan No. 700 will have to be extended1
Loan No. 753   Second Telecomnmunications Project; 5S$13.? Hillion loan
of June 21, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project includes facilities and equipment to improve the
domestic and international telecommunications systems. Implementation has
been delayed but better progress is now being made and there are reasonable
prospects that the project will be completed on schedule. Orders placed
exceed US$10 million and applicLtion for reimbursement amour;ting to about
US$4 million are expected to be received shortly.
Loan No. 561   Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$3.6 Million Loan
of September 27, 1968; Closing Date: September 1, 1974
Loan No. 908   Second Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$13.5 Million
Loan of June 14, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The projects consist of the improvement and expansion of water
supply facilities in the Kuala Ltupur area.   Implementation of the first
project had been delayed because the main civil works contract had to
be retendered following the death of the main contractor and the liquidation
of his firm. Costs were within the original estimates and work has been
completed. However, the Closing Date had to be postponed for a second time
to September 1, 1974 to allow for the payment of retention monies. The
original Closing Date was September 1, 1972. Tenders for certain parts
of the second project have been awarded and site investigations for the
proposed dam are in progress.
Loan No. 599   Education Project; US$8.8 Million Loan of
May 23, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The project will provide in 21 new schools about 11,000 student
places, of which about 2,500 will be in Sabah and Sarawak for secondary
education and teachers training and about 8,500, mainly in Peninsular
Malaysia, for vocational, technical and agricultural education. Project
implementation generally is about six months behind schedule, due to soime
siting problems and to staff shortages in the Pablic Works Department which
delayed preparatory design processes, but is now progressing well. All
but one of the 21 project institutions should be completed by end 1974.



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 6 pages
A start on the construction of the remaining project item, one of the
three agricultural schools in Peninsular Malaysia, was considerably delayed
by difficulties in obtaining a suitable site. Although the site is
now acquired and construction has already begun, the Closing Date will
require postponement.
Loan No. 810   Second Education Project; US$15.5 Million Loan of
April 5, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Under this project the expansion of technical and vocational
education in Malaysia, started under the first project, will be continued
by the construction of 8 schools, providing 4,700 student places, and by
the establishment at the University of Penang of science schools providing
about 2,600 student places. The project includes also the establishment
of an educational center which will provide a curricula improvement course
for teachers and the provision of educational television which is expected
to serve some 500,000 primary and secondary students. Progress is
generally satisfactory.
Loan No. 774   Sabah Ports Project; US$16.1 Million Loan of
June 30, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
The project consists of the construction of new ports at Kota
Kinabalu and Sandakan in the State of Sabah. All civil works contracts
have been awarded but construction is behind schedule, initially due to
mobilization delays caused by the seamen's strike in Japan and the staffing
difficulties arising as a result of the project manager's death and more
recently due to difficulties in the supply of raw materials.
Loan No. 799   Railway Project; US$16.0 Million Loan of
February 11, 1972; Closing Date:   December 31, 1975
The project includes mainly equipment and works for a dieselization
program of the Malayan Railways (MR). Implementation is behind schedule
by about one year because of the Railways' management problems and its
initial unfamiliarity with the Bank's procurement procedures. The Bank
has proposed that MR hire consultants to help MR in improving its manage-
ment.
Loan No. 851   Kuala Lu   ur Urban Transport Project; US$16.0 Million
Loan of July 20, 1972; Closing Date:   April 30, 1977
The project is designed to improve access to Kuala Lumpur
from the adjacent town of Petaling Jaya. Project implementation is
satisfactory.

Loan No. 880   Population Project; US$5.0 Million Loan of February 9,
1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1978
The project is designed to assist Malaysia in achieving low
birth and population growth rates and thus to contribute to an increase
in per capita income growth and in the long run to ease the unemployment
problem. The United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) is
providing US$4.3 million in the form of a grant to finance certain components
of the project. Progress is satisfactory after initial difficulties in
coordinating activities of the Government agencies involved, which has delayed
loan disbursement.
Loan No. 931   Second Highway Project; US$19.5 Million
Loan of August 22, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The project consists of construction and improvement of Peninsular
Malaysia's main north-south highway and also includes various studies.
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily.

Procurement Arrangements:      Contracts estimated, net of contingencies, at
US$35.4 for civil works, and US$4.6 million
for equipment would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding; in
evaluating bids, local equipment manufacturers
would be allowed a margin of-preference of
15 percent or the actual customs duty, which-
ever is lower. Contracts, for processing
plants, buildings and feeder drains, estimated
at US$9.3 million, each individual contract
being small and scattered in time and space,
would be awarded after locally advertised
bidding or, in the case of feeder drains,
through rural works contracts with local
villagers on the basis of a unit price fixed
annually by the Government.
Rate of Return:                The economic rate of return has been calculated
at about 15 percent.
Appraisal Report:              Report No. 314a-MA, dated February 28, 1974.
