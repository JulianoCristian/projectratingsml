SUMMARY
i.        The Cyprus Development Bank Limited (CDB) was established in 1963
by the Government of Cyprus with a wide participation of private share-
holders. Its share capital is currently CI6 1 million, 60% being owned by
the Government.
ii.       In spite of intercommunal disputes, Cyprus' economic growth averaged
7.5% during the years 1967-1970. Investment rose rapidly during this period
and now represents over 23% of GNP. Due to a high inflow of capital, foreign
exchange reserves are high, averaging over one year of imports. The manufac-
turing sector, which accounts for about 12% of GDP, has grown at about 15%
annually since the mid 1960's. Enterprises are still small and directed pri-
marily towards import substitution, but, given the size of the market, further
investments would have to aim increasingly at exports. Initial gains have
already been made.
iii.      Tourism has become a prime growth activity in the past years.  Pro-
spects for increasing this activity are good and an average annual growth of
14% in the number of visitors is forecast over the next four years. Construc-
tion of about 9,400 additional beds during the 1971-1975 period is needed to
accomodate the projected number of tourists.
iv.       Since its inception, CDB has played a useful part in Cyprus' eco-
nomy as the principal institutional long term financier of industry and
tourism. Its operations have been conducted on sound business principles.
But in view of the volume of work already reached and ahead, CDB's profes-
sional staff, although well qualified, has become hard pressed. CDB will
therefore have to add soon to its professional staff. CDB is currently
considering such additions.
v.        As of December 31, 1971, a total of 156 loans and equity opera-
tions had been approved by CDB, amounting to Ch 4.6 million, nearly all of it
loans. Approvals during 1971, totalling CG 1.04 million, represent 23% of
total approvals since CDB's inception. CDB's total assets, at December 31,
1971, stood at CE 3.3 million. The quality of CDB's loan portfolio is satis-
factory, and provisions for possible losses are adequate.
vi.       CDB has good business prospects which call for total commitments
of CE 3.7 million for the period beginning January 1, 1972 and ending June 30,
1974. The proposed Bank loan, together with a projected loan from
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau of DM 4 million, and a b 500,000 line of
credit from a British Bank, would provide the resource needed to finance
the import component of CDB's commitments during this period.  CDB's needs
of domestic currency resources will in an important measure be met with
the Government's help. CDB is a suitable and creditworthy borrower from
the Bank and an appropriate amount for the proposed Bank loan would be
US$3 million.



- iv -
vii.       The terms of the proposed loan would be those normally applied to
Bank loans to development finance companies, including standard commitment
fee. The proceeds of the loan would be used to finance direct imports plus
percentages (80%) of off-the-shelf procurement and 45% of civil works, repre-
senting the import element of these costs. CDB's long-term debt would be
limited to five times its share capital and free reserves. A free limit on
the use of Bank loan would be established at $100,000 per project, and
there would be an aggregate free limit equivalent to 25% of the loan.
viii.     As the Government of Cyprus will cover the exchange risk for CDB
on its indebtedness to the Bank, it was agreed in negotiations that CDB would
repay the proposed loan according to a fixed schedule. Given the fairly
standard terms on which CDB extends its loans, a fixed amortization schedule
has been established that would mirror quite realistically the actual com-
posite repayment of funds by sub-borrowers involved.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Cyprus Development Bank Limited (CDB) was established in 1963
by the Government of Cyprus with the participation of about 900 private share-
holders. For the most part, CDB has been operating with resources provided
from within the country, although it obtained a loan from the Kreditanstalt
fur Wiederaufbau in 1969. More recently, CDB requested, with the endorse-
ment of the Government of Cyprus, a loan from the World Bank.
II. CDB'S ENVIRONMENT
2.01      A detailed review of the economy of Cyprus may be found in a re-
port titled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Cyprus" (R71-279)
distributed to the Executive Directors on December 17, 1971.
2.02      In spite of the problems between the Greek and Turkish communities,
the economy has done quite well. GNP per capita was $847 in 1970. Economic
growth averaged about 8% in real terms during the years 1967 to 1971 (10.3%
at current prices) compared with an average annual rate of just under 6%
in the preceding five years. But the pace of economic expansion shows con-
siderable fluctuation, under the influence of variable agricultural results.
There was little structural change in the sectoral composition of GDP over
the last five years. Agriculture accounted in 1971 for about 20%, industry
for 12% and commerce for 21%. Tourism is expanding rapidly and gross receipts
in 1971 were over C* 11 million.
2.03      Cyprus' balance of payment is characterized by substantial current
account deficits due to weighty import surpluses; these are offset by impor-
tant capital movements; as a result, foreign exchange reserves stood at the
end of 1971 at $286 million, equivalent to roughly 12 months imports. Im-
portant to Cyprus foreign exchange receipts are expenditures by foreign mili-
tary forces running recently at close to $67 million a year. The leading ex-
port commodities are traditionally, vegetables, wines and fruits. Mineral
products (asbestos, copper) have declined in significance over the past ten
years. The share of manufacturing goods in exports has grown since recently;
they now constitute 20% of total exports.
2.04      Investment was high and rose rapidly during the period 1967-1970,
the period during which there has been relative stability in the country.
Investment in 1971 amounted to over 23% of GNP which is high. Gross nation-
al saving averaged 21% of GNP during the last three years and financed more
than 90% of the gross investment during the Second Plan (1967-1971).
2.05      The lab,jr force :elative to total population is high - 42% in 1971.
This has been due to a low population growth rate (1.5% during 1967-1971), a
traditionally large participarion of women in the labor force and the fact



2. -
thiat a subsLantial number of farmers have a full-time occupation outside agri-
culture. In fact, the labor market has been tight for the past six years, and
there is little reserve capacity in the employable population. Unemployment
dropped steadily from 3% in 1961 to 1% in 1971.
Manufacturing Sector
2.06      Manufacturing is a relatively recent activity in Cyprus.  Entre-
preneurs originate from merchants hailing especially from the Greek community.
Not surprisingly, most manufacturing enterprises principally serve the domes-
tic market, mainly with textiles (shirts and shoes, etc.), food processing
and building materials. Except for one recently built refinery, manufacturing
is privately controlled in Cyprus. Companies are generally family owned and
reluctant to have ownership broadened tb include outsiders. Manufacturing
enterprises (about 1,300 enterprises employing more than 5 workers) are usually
small; only about 30 of them employ more than 100 workers. Industrial develop-
ment spurted in recent years under the influence of growing per capita income
and Government incentives. Recent official estimates put industrial gross
investment at close to CE 7 million in 1970, which the Bank's last economic
report considered a very conservative estimate. To reach this level, manu-
facturing investment had to grow roughly 15-20% annually since the mid 1960's.
2.07      Cyprus' industry has about terminated the first round of obvious
import substitution activity. Further investments intending to serve exclu-
sively the domestic market would have difficulties in succeeding. Already at
this stage, Cypriot enterprises, when making investments, have to think about
the need to export. This aspect is not resolved simply because Cypriot indus-
tries' experience in foreign trade is only being built up since recently and
decisions as to the right type of product and the appropriate scale of plants
are not easy to make, considering the novelty of exporting. However, as export
statistics indicate, some enterprises already have had success in making sus-
tained sales to nearby Middle Eastern countries. Initial inroads into Europ-
ean markets have been made by high quality garments made in Cyprus. Given the
acumen of the Cypriot entrepreneurs -- and their sensitivity to market changes --
Cypriot industry, barring major political controversies, is likely to be able
to broaden further its export volume. In addition, Cyprus has some limited
evidence that it may participate in the iMediterranean phenomenon of having
European enterprises sub-contract some of their manufacturing phases to Cypriot
manufacturers. Cyprus is about to enter into association negotiations with the
Common Market, following the entry of the United Kingdom into the ECC, and this
could have a favorable result for Cyprus' export potential.
2.08      The Government provides some i.acentives to encourage private indus-
trial investment. Prominent among these is an investment allowance which is
granted in addition to normal depreciation. Another concession offered to new
industries is tariff protection which averages 25% on an ad valorem basis.
This protection is given on a case-by-case basis, when the Government is con-
vinced that such a protection is vital for a new enterprise. In 1969, to
reduce the pressure of costs, imoort duties on a range of raw materials were
reduced or abolished.



-3-
Tourism Sector
2.09      Hotel development started from a low base (68,000 visitors and
6,400 beds in 127 hotels in 1967). Motivated by the interest of European
tour operators and the recent increase of European vacationers each year,
hotel building has become a prime growth activity in the past few years.
Cyprus seems to handle about one-half percent of total Mediterranean tourism:
160,000 tourists visited Cyprus in 1971, spending about CI3 11 million. Hotel
developments involved, at the beginning, only Cypriot entrepreneurs. They
have been concentrated so far in the coastal resorts of Famagusta and Kyrenia,
and in Nicosia. Some foreign tour operators are now beginning to build and
run hotels in association with Cypriot entrepreneurs. Cyprus now has about
9,400 beds in good quality hotels. Most of them were erected in the past few
years at an average cost of nearly $4,000 per bed, which is good by Mediter-
ranean standards. This development was helped by a few Government incentives:
a generous depreciation regime and concessionary loans given by the Governnment
through its Loan Commissioners. (See para. 2.11.)
Financial Environment
2.10      Cyprus, for its small size, is well served by banks.  There are
eight commercial banks, five of them foreign. Furthermore, there are a Greek
and a Turkish cooperative bank, the Mortgage Bank of Cyprus, Lombard Banking
(Cyprus), specialized in hire purchase financing, and finally the Cyprus
Development Bank. The Bank of Cyprus is the leading commercial bank and con-
trols, together with its subsidiaries (Mortgage Bank of Cyprus, Bank of Cyprus
Finance Corporation) about 50% of the banking assets in Cyprus.
2.11      In addition, the Government is important as a financier.  It pro-
vides long term finance through its Loan Commissioners, who are financed by
Government interest free long term loans, and retained earnings. The Loan
Commissioners extend long term loans at low interest rates (5 to 7%) mainly
for water development and agricultural projects (30%), infrastructure proj-
ects (25%) and the remainder for school building and hotel projects. For
hotel projects in the private sector, the loans extended by the Loan Commis-
sioners have averaged CE 250,000 per year over the last 5 years.
2.12      Commercial banks, principally the Bank of Cyprus, remain the trad-
itional private sector financiers of manufacturing in Cyprus. They are
formally not very active in making medium and long term loans to industry,
but provide renewable annual overdrafts, at rates currently varying from
7.5% to 9%. The banks have succeeded in securing their short term lending
with-mortgages on fixed assets. Resources available for bank lending by
commercial banks have increased markedly in the last two years as deposits
increased, mainly on account of capital in-flows from abroad, from CE 76 mil-
lion in 1967 to CE 120 million in 1971: 60% are term deposits, 20% savings
and 20% sight deposits. The liquidity ratio of the deposit money banks never
fell below 27% between 1965 and 1971, although the reserve requirement is only
15%. At the end of 1971 total advances and loans of the banking sector stood
at about Ct 115 million; if the pattern of 1970 continued, 35% were for for-
eign and domestic trade, 16% for manufacturing, and only 2% for tourism.



2.13      The Cyprus capital market is almost nonexistent, with less than
350 securities listed and very few transactions taking place. The Govern-
ment issued four long term debentures between 1969 and 1970; the three
first at rates between 5 and 6% had to be supported by the Central Bank,
while the last, bearing interest at 7-1/2% was over subscribed indicating
market sensitivity to the interest level. CDB issued, with the Government's
guarantee, debentures in 1969 and 1971, at 6-1/8% and 7-1/2% respectively.
2.14      No substantial change in the interest rate structure in Cyprus
occurred in the past four years. The ceiling for advances and loans re-
mains fixed at 9% by the Central Bank, although commercial banks are at
times able to increase their actual return to 11% through various charges.
CDB has not been able to charge more than 8-3/4% for tourism loans and 8-1/2%
for industrial loans, the same rates charged by commercial banks. Given
the high sensitivity of borrowers to the cost of money, and the competition
from commercial banks, CDB's present rates are practically at a ceiling for
the time being.
2.15      There is considerable competition between the commercial banks
and CDB, as among the commercial banks themselves. Co-financing involving
banks and CDB is rare. (In contrast CDB finances many hotel projects to-
gether with the Loan Commissioners.) Indeed there have been projects ap-
praised and approved by CDB which, however, obtained finance from a commerical
bank at a slightly lower interest rate than CDB's, merely on the basis of
CDB's approval. A major difference between CDB and the commercial banks is
that the latter restrict their lending to well-known firms and individuals
who can put up mortgages, while CDB also attempts to look at the inherent fi-
nancial and economic prospects for the projects it finances.
III. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Ownership
3.01      CDB's authorized share capital is CE 3 million.  Its paid-in
share capital is CE 1,000,000 divided in 400,000 "A" shares and 600,000 "B"
shares, the latter owned by the Government, as shown in Annex 1. (Both shares
have equal voting rights.) The "A" shares are owned by about 900 shareholders,
none of them holding more than 3.75% of the "A" share capital. All the com-
mercial banks operating in Cyprus have a small participation (each has 1.4%
of "A" shares), although they are prevented by MB's Articles of Association
from being represented on the Board. No group of shareholders owning together
a significant proportion of shares has ever emerged, and the private share-
holders do not take a very active interest in the company. Absenteeism is
the rule in the General Assemblies.
3.02      For CDB's initial 10 years, running out at the end of 1972, the
Government conferred, by law, important advantages on CDB. The principal
ones are:



a.   The Government guarantees a dividend of 6% in respect
of each of the Class "A" shares of CDB.
b.   Dividends paid to class "A" shares are tax-free.
c.   "B" shares get only insignificant dividends. 1/
Board
3.03      A fairly elaborate system (embodied in the Articles) provides for
a Board of 11 or 14 directors, comprising 3 or 6 Government Directors, 5
private Directors, and 3 public Directors, elected by the private and Govern-
ment Directors. Annex 2 gives the present composition of CDB's Board, which
operates under the 11-member option. The Chairman of the Board is Mr. Chris-
takis Papadopoulos, a private Director, and the Vice-Chairman is Mr. George
Eliades, Director-General of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. One pub-
lic Director's seat is currently vacant. Out of the present 10 members, 7 in-
cluding 4 private ones, have been in office since 1963. Although some conti-
nuity in membership is desirable, CDB's Board seems virtually permanent, ex-
cept for the Government representatives.
3.04      CDB's Board appears to be active and is guided by business princi-
ples. It is worth emphasizing that, despite its majority ownership, the Gov-
ermuent's opinion does not always prevail in the Board. The Board meets at
least monthly, discusses project issues at length, and unanimity is rare,
even among the Government representatives. But the Board is conservative,
not keen on risks, seems to like strong security, and focuses on policy issues
ad hoc when provoked by project situations.
Policies
3.05      CDB does not have a single statement elaborating its policies.  CDB's
Memorandum and Articles of Association allow it to lend long and medium-term
money in productive enterprises in any economic sector, and to take equity par-
ticipations. The following limits are, with the Bank's agreement, being in-
troduced in CDB's Memorandum and Articles of Association: Advances to a single
enterprise are limited to 30% of CDB's net worth; equity participations in a
single enterprise are limited to 10% of CDB's net worth, except when necessary
to secure or recover any advance; total equity portfolio is limited to 60% of
CDB's net worth, which is conservative. By practice, CDB observes sound fi-
nancial and operational policies.
1/   "B" shares are eligible to receive dividends only after:
a.   10% of net profit are set aside for reserves;
b.   a 6% dividend is distributed to "A" shareholders;
c.   20% of net profit has been set aside as further reserves.



6-
Management and Staff
3.06      From CDB's inception in 1963 to 1967, the management team consisted
muainly of foreigners. Mr. Angelos Pikis, the present General Manager and
Chief executive, took up his duties in 1967. Mr. Pikis, an economist and
chartered accountant, was formerly chief accountant of the Bank of Cyprus,
the island's leading commercial bank. When Mr. Pikis is away from CDB, the
Chairman or another Board member acts as the chief executive.
3.07      On project work, Mr. Pikis is supported by two experienced senior
officers: Mr. J. Joannides, economist, in charge of the Economic Department
(new customers, economic and technical studies), and Mr. L. Sparsis, an eco-
nomist and EDI fellow, in charge of the Operations Department (repeat cus-
tomers and supervision). Their staff are small but have good training. A
lawyer/secretary acts as CDB's company secretary and takes care of all internal
legal affairs. CDB's professional staff totals 7 as listed in Annex 3.
3.08      The small size of CDB's staff has become a constraint on the growth
of the company. During negotiations, CDB's management advised that it is seek-
ing approval from its Board to strengthen staff for the engineering and fi-
nancial work of CDB. It will recruit an experienced industrial engineer and
a new financial analyst. The Bank indicated to CDB that it attaches great
importance to the proposed staff additions, given the expected growth in
lending by CDB, and the need for CDB to improve LtS project supervision work.
Appraisal
3.09      The quality of CDB's appraisals has been reasonably good but uneven.
In both assessment and presentation, there is need to get better judgments on
marketing possibilities of clients, on more realistic starting dates of ope-
rations and on client companies' expected financial results. Actually, CDB
has much more detailed information on its projects than is evident from its
formal appraisal papers. The explanations for short-cuts in presentation
appear to be that (i) there is little need to present to the Board data which
each member is aware of, given the small size of the economy and the close
relationship among members oL the financial and industrial community in the
island, (ii) the pressure of business does not allow CDB's staff to prepare
more detailed appraisal papers and much of the appraisal work is presented
orally . Altogether, depth and care in appraisal need improving and sustained
attention. These improvements are 0ossible, given che skill and training of
the principal officers engaged in pro4ect work. Understandings on steps to
improve CDB's appraisals, including the strengthening of economic analysis,
were reached during negotiations.
3.10      Procurement.  CDB requests its customers to submit their applica-
tion with more than one tender for machinery and equipment, and with an esti-
mate made by an architect for buildings.  One of the problems CDB clients
encounter at this juncture comes from the fact that there is a great lag
of time between the tenders and the delivery of goods, and that European
suppliers have often increased significantly their prices during that time.
It seems that, given the small amount of equipment involved in each project,
European manufacturers display very little interest to follow up small orders:



it is therefore almost impossible to get firm tenders. One reason for devel-
oping further engineering capability within CDB would be to enable the company
to make better checks on equipment prices and suitability.
Project Supervision
3.11      Project supervision has been handled in an inconsistent manner.
Except for the real problem cases which have every professional's attention
in CDB, there are very good examples of follow-up mixed with situations where
there is no follow-up at all. CDB's portfolio, though still small in absolute
terms, has grown to such a number of operations and has enough weak spots,
to require more systematic and effective follow-up work. CDB is aware of this
necessity and has advised the Bank during negotiations that it will lay stress
on improving project supervision.
3.12      Disbursement.  CDB disbursements are carefully handled, in line with
the progress of its projects and together with the disbursement of the sponsors'
contribution. Disbursements for machinery and equipment are generally made to
the suppliers on submission of invoices. CDB has worked out satisfactory con-
trol procedures to insure that disbursements are made for the intended purposes.
Audit
3.13      CDB's accounts are audited by Messrs. Metaxas, Christofides, Loiziaes
and Co., the leading auditors in Cyprus. The firm has been associated since
1962 with Touche Ross & Co. International of New York, and has done work for
the U.S. firm in Greece on American companies such as Chrysler, Kaiser Engineer-
ing and American Motors. An audit presentation of the type required by the
Bank will be carried out.
IV. RESOURCES, OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION
Resource Position
4.01      Annex 4 shows a detailed statement of CDB's resources (before repay-
ment). They total CE 3,276,000 ($8,537,000 equivalent) as of December 31, 1971;
CDB has obtained CE 700,000 loan from the Government, CE 1,000,000 in two de-
benture stocks and DM 4,000,000 (CL 480,000) from Kreditanstalt f'ur Wiederaufbau.
4.02      During its initial four years, CDB's business was low and CDB relied
entirely on its equity. CDB's first borrowing took place in 1968. Since then,
CDB has borrowed four times in Cyprus, altogether CL 1.7 million, at interest
rates that were successively higher and on terms that were each time longer.
The first debenture issue was taken up mainly by the banks, but the second,
made in 1971, found a fairly wide market among individuals, private companies
and insurance companies. A factor in this wide distribution was, apart from
the Government guarantee, the 7-1/2% interest rate. Tne KfW loan is CDB's only
facility from abroad.



- 8 -
4.03      As at December 31, 1971, CDB's resources invested and available for
investment were as follows: (in CE '000)
Total outstanding borrowings          1,900
Net worth                             1,096
Total outstanding resources   2,996
Uncommitted KfW loan                    150
Total resources                 3,146
Against this total, CDB's commitments at that date amounted to CE 3,536,000
leaving a gap of CE 390,000. CDB has, since the end of 1971, mobilized resources
to cover this gap, namely two Government loans totalling CE 1,000,000. 1/
Foreign Exchange Risk
4.04      At present, CDB is not protected against the risk of any changes
in the exchange rate applying to its borrowings from the KfW. (In fact, CDB
already had to write off CE 15,000 against an exchange loss sustained in
1971.) CDB is unable to pass this risk on to its borrowers and the Government
will not cover it. On December 31, 1971, CE 403,000 was outstanding on the
loan from KfW and the final maturity is in 1984. Starting in 1972, CDB is
setting aside yearly provisions to cover potential exchange losses on its KfW
loan, to begin with equal to 2% of the outstanding amount. CDB will review
with the Bank each year the adequacy of that percentage. CDB has undertaken
in loan negotiations to protect itself against the foreign exchange risk from
future borrowings and it has obtained the Government's agreement that the
Government would cover that risk on the proposed Bank loan.
Characteristics of Operations
4.05      A summary of CDB's operations is given in Annexes 5, 6, and 7.
From CDB's inception, in October 1963, to December 31, 1971, a total of 156
loans and equity operations (involving 93 borrowers) were approved, amounting
to CE 4,556,400 (US$11.9 million equivalent). CDB's operations, nearly all of
them loans, hovered on a low annual level of approvals of about CE 160,000
through 1966. This was due to political un-rest since 1963, and perhaps also
to several management changes. With che return of a good measure of stability
in 1967, annual approvals rose from slightly over CE 300,000 in 1967 to nearly
CE 1.1 million in 1971.
4.06      An analysis of CDB's operations since 1963 is given in Annex 5.
Noteworthy features are the following.
4.07      Size.  Reflecting the small size of the country and the economy,
CDB's operations are also small as shown in the table below:
1/   One loan, for CE 250,000 has alrea6v been signed, and the other for
CE 750,000 has been approvec by the Parliament and will be signed soon.

4.08      All CDB's projects involve Greek Cypriot entrepreneurs.  None of
them is sponsored by an entrepreneur of the Turkish community.
4.09      Sector and Involvement.  CDB's operations reflect the recent de-
velopment of the manufacturing sector in Cyprus. 36% of CDB's approvals
are for tourism projects, 58% for manufacturing, and 6% for agriculture and
others. The groups of food, beverages and tobacco industries, and of tex-
tiles and footwear, account each for roughly 20% of total approvals, toge:Aer
for about 55% of CDB's operations in industry.  CDB's financing as a perc.-..t-
age of the total cost of projects it finances, has averaged at 35% for manu-
facturing and agriculture, and at 18% for tourism, the overall percentage
being 26%.
4.10      Purpose.  67% of CDB's operations have been for new projects and
33% for expansion and modernization. Loans granted for tourism projects
always concern new projects; therefore, 49% of loans for the manufacturing
sector are for new projects and 51% for expansion and modernization.  For_ign
investments in CDB's projects, except for a few hotel projects, are insignif-
icant.
4.11      Import Component.  The import component of the total cost of indus-
trial projects (excluding land) is about 75%: 14% for construction and 61%
for machinery and equipment. For hotel projects, 65% of the overall cost
(excluding land) represents imports of which 20% for construction and 45% for
equipment. Of the funds lent by CDB, 70% has on average been used to procure
imports.
4.12      Terms.  98% of CDB's approvals were for loans, 70% of them for dura-
tions ranging between 7 and 12 years, including 2 years of grace. Loans to
hotels are made for 12-14 years including 2-1/2 - 3 years of grace. Up to
1969, CDB charged 7-1/2% on its loans. During 1970, the range of interest
rate was established at 7-3/4% to 8-1/4% and increased in 1971 to 8-1/4% to
8-3/4%. As at December 31, 1971, somewhat over one-half of CDBts outstanding
loans were still earning only 7-1/2%.
4.13      Equity Investments.  CDB's equity investments are still insignifi-
cant: three equity participations in two companies account for 1% of its
total approvals and 3.1% of its outstanding portfolio as at December 31,
1971. The first participation was in a successful cement factory (Vassilikos
Cement) for CE 35,000. In addition, CDB has shares for CE 22,000 in a shoe
company (Alfa Shoe), a problem company which recently went through a recon-
struction. CDB is now planning to take an equity participation of 10%
(CE 27,500) in a new company processing cartons. Furthermore, CDB has



- 10 -
options to buy shares in tl.ree companies, and in four companies righlts to
convert part of its loans into equity, all for a total of CL 184,000. The
low volume of equity investments is in po;rt explained by the disinclination
of closely controlled family companies to accept outside shareholders. Also,
CDB's Board has not been keen on approving equity investments.
Economic Impact of CDB's Operation
4.14      During the roughly 5 years in which CDB has been effectively operat-
ing, it has been able to achieve an increasingly prominent role in the economy.
The projects which CDB has been supporting in recent years account for substan-
tial proportions of output and value added in their respective sectors. For
instance, in 1970 gross output of CDB's operating industrial projects was over
CE 7 million, about 11% of the value of total industrial output of Cyprus.
Value added in the same year was about CE 2.6 million, or about 8% of total
value added by Cyprus industry. CDB's impact is even more marked in the hotel
sector. There, in 1969-1971, its loans financed about 20% of total hotel in-
vestment of CE 4.8 million underway in those years. Another measure of CDB's
importance is that the 17 operating hotel projects financed by CDB had a
revenue of CE 3.5 million in 1970 as compared to total tourist expenditures
of CE 8.5 million. CDB's industrial and hotel projects in operation contrib-
uted about 3,700 jobs -- as to industry, about 9% of total manufacturing em-
ployment. Investments to create a new job amounted to about $17,000 in
hotels 1/ and somewhat below $8,000 in industry. These figures are fairly
low; indeed, given the high rate of employment, Cyprus is having to shift pro-
duction to more capital intensive processes.
4.15      Reflecting the recent trend, and CDB's involvement with a typical
segment of Cyprus industry, CDB borrowers have shared in the growth of Cyprus'
manufacturing exports. They contributed about CE 2.4 million to the total
of Cyprus' industrial exports of CE 7.5 million in 1970. These exports
were achieved without special drawbacks or financial incentives provided by
the authorities. In addition, it is noteworthy that products sold by Cyprus
industry in the domestic market enjoy very little tariff protection and that
they face nearly complete freedom to import competing goods from abroad. CDB
has been successful in converting a growing number of Cyprus entrepreneurs to
the advantage of obtaining contractual long-term financing, even in the face
of strong competition from commercial banks. This success is evidenced by the
fact that out of 93 Borrowers, 29 are repeat clients.
Evaluation of Loan and Equity Portfolio
4.16      Loan Portfolio.  CDB's arrears in principal and interest on December 31,
1971 amounted to 2.7Z and 0.6% of portfolio respectively. 24.3% of outstanding
1/   On the basis of permanent workers only.  Taking into account total number
of workers during the peak season would reduce the investment cost per
job to about $10,000.



loan portfolio totalling CE 3 million are affected by arrears of any type,
and 15.2% by arrears over three months. These percentages, if taken by them-
selves, are quite high. They have to be viewed against the following facts:
a.   Production in several projects has been delayed beyond CDB's
optimistic assumptions for starting dates.
b.   CDB is reluctant to reschedule its loans:  first, to keep pres-
sure on its borrowers and, secondly, to get some additional
return on its portfolio because a rate of 9% is being charged
on the principal and interest in arrears. Even when an under-
standing on rescheduling occurred (there are three such cases),
there was no change in the loan agreements, and the customer
still appeared formally in arrears.
c.   Cypriot payment habits are at times lax.  The explanation is
that, even while paying penalty interest of 1 to 2% on arrears,
some borrowers consider CDB in effect a source of short-term
funds on terms competitive with commercial banks; some CDB
borrowers are financing their working capital needs this way.
This tendency is exacerbated by the fact that commercial banks
nearly always obtain mortgages for their short-term advances,
and CDB's customers, which have already given these mortgages
to CDB, have therefore only limited capacity to offer security
for short-term funds from the commercial banks.
4.17      From a detailed review of each loan in arrears, it appears that out-
standing amounts in the really troublesome cases account for about 4% of CDB's
loan portfolio: 3 loans with CZ 126,000 outstanding. The rest of the arrears
could be eliminated with a strengthening of CDB's follow-up and judicious re-
scheduling of loans which are otherwise good. CDB has, over its life, aad to
write off only CE 10,000 in bad loans. Provisions for possible losses
(CE 55,000 or 1,8Z of portfolio) at the end of 1971 were thus adequate to
cover CDB's real risk of losses. Nevertheless, CDB should tighten its collec-
tion procedures and perhaps increase the penalty interest rate to push bor-
rowers to make payments on time.
4.18      Equity portfolio.  CDB's equity portfolio is insignificant and re-
presented only 3% of CDB's loan portfolio as at December 31, 1971. About one
third of this equity investment is in the aforementioned company which went
through reconstruction.
Profitability
4.19      Income statements for the years 1967 to 1971 are given in Annex 8.
Reflecting the sharp increase of business since 1967, CDB's net operational
income has doubled since 1967, from CE 39,000 to CY 81,000. Earnings before
interest, provisions and tax rose from 4% of average total assets in 1967 to
6.2% in 1971. This increase has been helped by the relative decrease of staff
and administrative expenses, which were 3.2% of average total assets in 1967
and stood at 1.5% in 1971.



- 12 -
4.20      Refiecting the limited leverage of CDB (long-term debt: equity
ratio of 0.1:1 in 1968 and 1.7:1 in 1971), CDB's profitability has been
co,asistently low. Net profit as a perceni-age of average net worth, amount-
ing to 3.2% in 1967 was only 4.4% in 1971. CDB's net profits were CE 48,000
in 1971, and this represents only 4.8% of CDB's share capital (4.2% in 1970).
Due to the combined effect of low profitability resulting from CDB's low
leverage, and the legal requirement to pay a 6% dividend on its "A" share
capital (40% of share capital) the dividend payout ratio has been high:
69% in 1970 and 60% in 1971.
Financial Position
4.21      Audited balance sheets for the years 1967 to 1971 are given in
Annex 9.  CDB's portfolio grew from CE 684,000 in 1967 to CE 3,108,000 in
1971, an average rate of growth of 47% a year.  The long term debt/equity
ratio is still quite low: 1.7:1 as at December 31, 1971. The current ratio
of CDB deteriorated from 2.1:1 in 1969 to 1:1 in 1971, because CDB borrowed
in 1971 short term funds to cover longer term commitments.
4.22      Prior to 1968, CDB's provisions against possible losses were put
into an "inner reserve" considered as part of net worth, without any specific
link to loss possibilities. In 1968, CDB began to assess its provisions on
a case-by-case basis by reviewing its portfolio for real loss possibilities.
In the Annexes, the provisions constituted before 1968 are included in re-
serves, and those constituted after 1968 are not, and are deducted from
portfolio.  On December 31, 1971, free reserves were 3.1% of portfolio.
V. CDB'S FUTURE OPERATIONS
5.01      Prospects for the further development of the island will depend
on the maintenance of stability between the two communities resident in
Cyprus. This assumption is being made. Investments in industry continue
to be spurred mainly by the remaining prospects for broadening import sub-
stitution. Larger projects have either been started, or are being actively
considered, for wood products, by-products of asbestos, building materials
and concrete pipes. (For the latter there is a great demand because of im-
portant Government works for water development.) There are also chances,
though of more limited scope, to produce at competitive costs certain phar-
maceuticals, bottles, and agricultural pesticides for the domestic market.
5.02      As noted in paragraph 2.07, a number of enterprises already count
strongly on export sales for their viability. This aspect will no doubt loom
even larger in the years to come. Cyprus counts, as to exports, on its abil-
ity to process further some of its food products, for instance, by making
frozen juice concentrates and vegetables, and by continued upgrading of the



- 13 -
quality of its textiles 1/.  If an arrangement with the Common Market works
out, Cyprus may also be able to participate in subcontracting activities,
such as making spare parts for motor vehicles and bicycles.
5.03      Though quite a few of the possibilities currently being considered
in Cyprus will never see the light of day, there is enough entrepreneurship
and specific investment proposals to expect that the next 5-6 years will see
gross investment in manufacturing in the island rise from a present annual
level of about CE 7-8 million, to roughly CE 12 million in the mid-seventies.
5.04      There is a firmer basis for predicting hotel investments.  The
9,400 beds now available to accommodate foreign tourists were barely suf-
ficient to take care of the roughly 160,000 tourists that visited Cyprus
(for stays of about 10-14 days) in 1971. Plans of the Cyprus Government
aim at accommodating in 1975 about 260,000 visitors - a figure which ap-
pears well attainable given the likelihood of further tourism growth in
the Eastern Mediterrean and the fact that Cyprus had to refuse, in recent
years, offers of tour operators to bring tourists to the island. Assuming
a 55% occupancy ratio, which is reasonable, another 9,400 beds are needed
on top of the roughly 4,500 currentlv under construction to enable 260,000
visitors to visit Cyprus. Indeed, there is already sufficient tangible
evidence of interest of foreign and Cypriot investors supporting the ex-
pectation that these beds will be built. With an average investment cost
per bed at CE 2,300 (US$5,500), slightly higher than the one recently
achieved, fresh investment (excluding projects now under construction)
should be of the order of about CE 22 million, through 1976.
Forecast of Business
5.05      Projected approvals, commitments and disbursements are shown in
Annex 10. They are based on the following assumptions:
5.06      As to manufacturing, recent developments and the current pipeline
of projects before CDB suggest that approvals will, over the period 1972-1976,
rise at an average annual rate of about 17%. (This compares with a 45;% growth
per year in the past five years.) CDB should be able to maintain, as in the
past, its share of 10% of industrial investment and this assumption underlies
the forecast approvals.
5.07      As to hotel investment, the reasonable assumption is being made
that CDB will continue to be associated with about 80% of the new investment
in Cyprus through 1976 and that it would contribute about 20% of total in-
vestment cost. On this basis, CDB's contribution over the five-year period
should total about CE 3.5 million. This is a reasonable, and probably a
conservative, figure.
1/   Cyprus' industrial exports have been helped by the fact that there are
important Cypriot trading communities in the U.K. and the Middle East.

5.09      CDB hopes to increase its equity investments in the future.  More
CDB equity operations will probably be needed to support the borrowing base
of projects sponsored by new entrepreneurs. The import component of CDB's
commitments is likely to continue about as in the past and total about
CE 5.9 million (over $15 million) or 70% of total commitmlents during the
five year period.
Projected Financing
5.10      At the beginning of 1972, CDB was overcommitted by CE 390,000.  This
was an aspect of concern to the Bank. CDB has now assured the Bank that it
would be its policy to avoid making overcommitments, and that it endeavors to
match the maturities of its assets and liabilities. Commitments for the pe-
riod ending on June 30, 1974 will total CE 3.3 million, of which CE 1.9 mil-
lion (US$4.0 million) will finance imnports. CDB secured early in 1972-
CE 1,000,000, through two, 5-1/2%, 12-year loans from the Government (para. 4.03).
The will cover CDB's needs beyond the middle of 1972. CDB will float a third de-
benture issue in 1973 for CE 500,000, and has good prospects to raise a
CE 300,000 five year line of credit from a British Bank. In addition, it is
expected that KfW in a year or so will extend to CDB a second loan of DM 4
million (CE 500,000) of which about CE 300,000 will be available for commit-
ments through June 30, 1974. CDB's internal cash generation would raise
about CE 100,000 in 1972 and 197-  nd CE 300,000 will come from term de-
posits.  These resources total CL ,.- ' lillion, leaving a gap of CE 1.2 mil-
lion (US$3 million) which the proposed Bank loan would cover.
Financial Projections
5.11       CDB's forecast operations through 1976 are reflected in the finan-
cial projections shown in Annexes 8-9 and 11-12 and their underlying assump-
tions. CDB's portfolion (net of provir_on8) will grow from CE 3.1 million in
1971 to CE 4.8 million in 1973 aid CE 6.2 million in 1976. CDB's loan port-
folio will remain reasonably balanced between hotel projects (40 to 44%) and
industrial projects.



- 15 -
5.12      Profitability.  Projections show that CDB's gross income as a
percentage of average total assets will remain constant, around 8.3% through-
out the five year period. Financial expenses as a percentage of average to-
tal assets increase markedly, from 3.6% in 1971 to 4.8% in 1973 and 5.6% in
1976. This trend reflects the rising cost of CDB's growing borrowings. As
a result, the spread (before administrative expenses) on which CDB is working,
considering its equity at no cost, decreases from 4.1% in 1971 to 3.5% in
1973 and 2.9% in 1976. Although the amount of staff and administrative ex-
penses almost double from 1970 to 1976, as a percentage of average total as-
sets they drop from 1.5% in 1972 to 0.9% in 1976. CDB pays tax at a rate of
42.5% of net income. 1/ CDB's financial results are expected to evolve as
follows:
1971   1972   1973   1974   1975   1976

Earnings before provision
and tax as % of average
net worth                               7.5    9.5    9.8   10.8   11.6   14.1
Net earnings after provisions
and tax as:
- % of year-end share capital          4.8    6.0    4.7    5.5    5.3    7.4
- % of average net worth                4.4    5.4    4.2    4.8    4.5    6.2
Taxes CDB has to pay have great weight for CDB's net profits.  Interest cover-
age oscillates around 1.4:1 during the five-year period, and is satisfactory.
Also, the coverage of CDB's principal payments oscillates around 2.5:1 during
the five-year period, and never falls below 1.8:1.
5.13       Financial Structure.  Annex 9 gives the projected balance sheets
of CDB for the period 1972-1976. Total assets will increase from CE 2.9 mil-
lion in 1970 to 5.6 million in 1973 and 8.9 million in 1976. Except for 1971,
the current ratio of CDB remains constantly considerably above 1, because CDB
plans to rely principally on long term funds 2/ for its resource needs.
5.14      CDB will make its annual allocations to provisions on a case-by-
case analysis. The forecasts assume that an annual provision for possible
losses of 3% of the yearly increase in CDB's portfolio will be charged
1/   Further explanations on CDB's tax position are given in Annex 13.
2/   13-month deposits are considered to be available to CDB througliout thie
5-year period. CGB has good prospects of obtaining and holding them.

against income. This results in provisions of 2 - 3% of portfolio through-
out the forecast period, which appears to be reasonable. In addition to
provisions, free reserves as percentage of year-end net portfolio will be
in the neighborhood of 3%.
5.1       Given CDB's low level of profitability, the build-up of retained
earnings is slow, although the dividend policy projected is quite conserv-
ative. CDB hopes to maintain a 6% dividend on both "tA" and "B" shares;
this results in a payout ratio of about 40% during the forecast period, ex-
cept in 1973, when it will be higher due to the initial impact of CDB's new
tax regime.
5.16      CDB is an established bank that, in general, has followed sound
project selection principles; losses to date have been insignificant; its
existing portfolio is sound. From the point of view of risks in CDB's
portfolio, and taking account of CDB's past performances and future pro-
spects, a limit on CDB's total long term debt equivalent to five times its
share capital and free reserves is within prudent bounds. On this basis,
CDB would have to raise fresh share capital sometime in 1975.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.01      Since its inception, CDB has played a useful role in Cyprus'
economy as the principal institutional long-term financier of the corporate
productive sector, especially industry and tourism.  CDB has been able to
finance a sizeable share of productive investments in Cyprus. Its opera-
tions have been conducted on business principles. Though Government owns
the majority of CDB's capital, CDB has been able to maintain its operational
autonomy. Though further improvements are needed, CDB has built up an or-
ganization of good quality and a creditable experience in term financing of
industry and hotels.
6.02      CDB's portfolio is sound.  Although low, CDB's profitability has
enabled CDB to build up acceptable levels of reserves and provisions. CDB
should be able to reduce arrears through better follow-up and judicious re-
scheduling.
6.03      Prospects of development for Cyprus are good for industry, and
bright for tourism. As CDB is Cyprus' principal long-term finance insti-
tution, it has a definite role to play in future investment and should be
able to maintain its present share of total investments in these two sec-
tors.
6.04      CDB has realistically forecast its business.  CDB has taken steps
to secure resources for the expected growth in its operation, and has assured
the Bank that it will maintain good financial management. CDB is furthermore
taking steps to strengthen its organization in order to cope with the tasks
ahead. CDB is a suitable and creditworthy borrower from the Bank. Therefore
a loan of up to $3 million is recommended to cover part of CDB's resource
needs over the two years period ending on June 30, 1974.



- 17 -
6.05      The terms of the proposed loan should be those normally applied to
Bank loans to development finance companies, including the standard commit-
ment charge. The proceeds of the loan should be used to finance direct im-
ports plus 80 percent of off-the-shelf procurement and 45 percent of civil
works, representing the import element of these costs. CDB's long-term debt
should be limited to five times its share capital and free reserves. A free
limit on the use of Bank loan should be established at $100,000 per project,
and there should be an aggregate free limit equivalent to 25% of the loan.
6.06      As the Government of Cyprus will cover the exchange risk for CDB
on its indebtedness to the Bank, it was agreed in negotiations that CDB would
repay the proposed loan according to a fixed schedule. Given the fairly
standard terms on which CDB extends its loans, a fixed amortization schedule
has been established that would mirror quite realistically the actual com-
posite repayment of funds by CDB's sub-borrowers.

ANNEX 13
THE CYPRUS DEVELOPMENT BANK LTD.
Tax Position
1.        The tax law applicable in Cyprus to Corporate Companies is
the former British tax law, still in application in a number of countries
with British legal traditions. This law does not differentiate between
the companies and their shareholders, and the only tax which is levied
is the income tax, at a rate of 42.5% of income.
2.        Taxable income is net profit after provisions, which is con-
sidered as the property of shareholders. Dividends are declared gross
(at a rate of 6% for CDB) and paid net out of the net profit after tax
into the hands of shareholders. Companies issue to their shareholders
a note showing the gross dividend and the net amount paid.
3.        However, in application of law 21 of April 11, 1963, cDB's
dividends are tax free for a ten year period ending December 31, 1972.
During this period, dividends are declared and paid, at the rate of 6(,
for "A" shareholders, out of net profits before tax; the income tax
applies to the remaining portion of net profits.
