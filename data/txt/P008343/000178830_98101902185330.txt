REPOR AND RECOM1NDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE CYPRUS DEVELOPMENT BANK LTD,
FOR A DEVELOPYMT BANK PROJECT
1.    I submit the following report and recommendation an a proposed loan
to the Cyprus Development Bank Ltd. with the guarantee of the Republic of
Cyprus for the equivalent of US$3 million to help finance industrial and
tourism development in Cyprus. The loan would have a tenn of 16 years, in-
cluding three years of grace, with interest at 7½ percent per annum.
PART I - Tl-IE ECONOMY
2.    A report entitled "Current Economic Situation and Prospects of Cyprus"
(Report No. EMA-41a, dated December 9, 1971) was circulated to the Executive
Directors on December 17, 1971. Basic data on the economy of Cyprus are
given in Annex II.
3.    The population of Cyprus is predominantly of Greek extraction (81 per-
cent) with the remainder largely of Turkish origin. The relations between
the two communities deteriorated in the late 1950's and early 1960's and
serious interconmunal disturbances occurred in 1963. Many Turkish Cypriots
resettled in locations with predominantly Turkish population. These areas
have their own administration and public services and are to a large extent
self-governing. Since June 1968, there seems, however, to be general agree-
ment that the political differences should be solved through negotiations,
and representatives of both communities have met intermittently to discuss
outstanding differences. The continued presence of United Nations troops
helps to provide a safeguard against any accidental outbreak of violence,
which neither community desires. Recently, differences between the Cypriot
and the Greek Governments have introduced an additional element of uncertain-
ty in the political situation.
The Second Five Year Plan 1967-71
4.    The major objectives of Government economic policy are to achieve rapid
economic growth and improvements in social services, while maintaining internal
price stability and a viable balance of payments. These objectives were the
basis of the Second Five Year Plan (1967-71), which has just been completed,
and of the Third Plan (1972-76) which is in the final stages of preparation.
During the past five years considerable progress towards these objectives
has been made.
5.    The rate of economic growth averaged about 8 percent per year in real
terms during 1967-71, compared to just under 6 percent per year in the pre-
ceeding five years. Sectoral output     growth rates attained er exceeded
the targets of the Second Plan., except in manufacturing which, because of
delays in some important projects, increased at about 9 percent per year as
against the plan target of 10 percent. Economic growth has been accompanied



- 2 -
by structural change, vith employment in agriculture declining in absolute
as well as relative terms, and employment in industry anld services increas-
ing. The rapid growth reflected a high and rising rate of investment, a
rapid increase in agricultural and industrial exports and a flexible fiscal
and monetary policy which stimulated growth but also maintained a fair degree
of domestic price stability.
6.    To attain a viable balance of payments the Govermment strategy has been
to reduce the dependence on exchange earmnings from foreign military expendi-
tures, by developing commodity exports and tourism. Exports of goods and
services increased at an average annual rate of 12.5 percent during 1967-71
and foreign exchange receipts from tourism increased by 26 percent per year
during the same period. Consequently, foreign military expenditures contri-
buted only 27 percent of the total exchange receipts from goods and services
in 1971 as compared to over 37 percent in 1966. However, because imports
have increased more rapidly than exports, the trade gap has doubled during
the Second Plan and there has been a deficit on the current account since
1968.    However, foreign exchlange reserves have been rising because capital
inflows, mainly private capital, have been increasing.
7.    The labor force has increased at an annual rate of about 1.5 percent
during 1967-71, and unemp'loyment has averaged only about one percent of the
labor force. Shortages of labor have been felt largely in higher and middle
grade technical personnel and particularly in the construction and hotel
industries, With the tight labor market there have recently appeared strong-
er demands for significantly higher wages which could have inflationary con-
sequences. A policy of keeping wage increases in line with productivity
growth, while accepted in principle by all parties, has proved difficult to
carry out.
8.    There has been a significant improvement in social services.  Health
services have been strengthened and the number of schools and teachers has
increased. Elementary education up to age 12 years is compulsory and free,
and,as of this year, the first three years of secondary schooling will also
be free. An increasing proportion of those completing elementary education
go on to secondary education (70 percent in 1966-67 and 84 percent in 1970-
71) and participation in technical or scientific courses is rising.
Development Strategy in the Third Five Year Plan 1972-76
9.    The draft Third Plan (1972-76) proposes to continue the strategy of
the Second Plan. Rapid growth of agricultural and manufacturing production,
with increased orientation to exports, and the expansion of tourism are to
be the means of maintaining a sound balance of payments. The Plan envisages
a GDP growth of about 7 percent per year with manufacturing output increas-
ing at an average annual rate of about 11 percent and agriculture at about
7 percent. To reach these targets Cyprus' needs for external capital are
expected to increase from about $18 million in 1972 to about $55 million in
1976. However, as during the Second Plan, gross domestic savings are expect-
ed to finance about three-fourths of total fixed investment.
10.   Although future progress could be influenced by the political uncertain-
ties, a continuation of the present political situation would not preclude



further rapid economic growth, as demonstrated by the record of the last
few years. Shortages of capital, labor and water are major constraints on
growth, and success in increasing the supplies of these factors and their
efficient utilization will be an important determinant of economic growth
in the long run. In the next five years, during the period of transition
under the arrangemernts for the United Kingdom's joining the EEC, exports of
Cyprus to the United Kingdom are unlikely to be seriously affected, but in
the long run, the terms of association which Cyprus is able to negotiate
with the EEC will have a profound influence on future growth.
Major Sectors
11. Agriculture is still the largest sector, accounting for about a fifth
of GDP, over a third of employment, and more tlhn half of commodity exports.
Agricultural production, despite year-to-year fluctuations, has increased
at about 8.5 percent per annum during 1966-71, reflecting gains in both
crop and livestock production. The main factors underlying the rapid growth
of production were increased exploitation of the water resources and the
diversion of production to citrus fruit, potatoes, meat, milk and eggs.
Government policy has been to maintain balance between farm incomes and
incomes in other occupations through investment, financial incentives and
subsidies for the diversification of production. Government development
expenditure on agriculture amounted to 35 percent of total Government
development expenditure during 1967-71.
12. The two major constraints for future agricultural expansion are the
scarcity of water and the fragmentation of holdings. The latter hinders
the adoption of modern systems of farming and livestock production, and a
law was passed in 1969 to encourage the consolidation of holdings. Land
consolidation has begun in a number of villages but progress has been slow.
Scarcity of water has become an increasing problem. Only about 11 percent
of the cultivated area is irrigated but it produces about 60 percent of
total agricultural production. Most of the irrigated area is supplied from
ground water and the expansion of irrigation in the 1950's and 1960's has
resulted in serious over-exploitation of the main aquifers through illegal
drilling and extraction. Government policy is to develop surface water,
conserve underground water, and replenish overpumped aquifers. The formula-
tion of a master plan for the control, rational utilization and development
of water resources has been undertaken and feasibility studies for specific
projects are nearing completion.
13. Industrial output has increased rapidly and in 1971 accounted for
about 12 percent of GDP and employment, and about 20 percent of exports.
Industry in Cyprus is largely private. Government policy has limited itself
to creating a favorable climate by providing incentives and direction through
protection, tax allowances, and low rent in government-owned industrial
estates. Food processing industries provide the major part of manufactured
exports, Other light industries manufacturing consumer goods have been
producing import substitutes (e.g. clothing and footwear) but are gradually
looking to export markets as the small domestic market offers limited scope.
The industrial sector is characterized by a large number of small, family-
owned, and at times inefficient units.  Productivity per worker has, however,
increased by about 3-4 percent per year.



- 4 -
14.   Manufacturing industry is regarded as as-a coxnerstone of the policy
of restructuring the economy and reducing its dependence on foreign military
bases and similar expenditure: Industrial development is expected to improve
the balance of payments, to create employment, and to make possible the utili-
zation of local raw materials and agricultural products. Fixed investment
in manufacturing is expected to total about $160 million during the Third
Plan. The growth of industrial output is expected to average about U1 per-
cent per year during the next five years as compared to about 9 percent
during 1967-71.
15.   Government policy aims to modernize and rationalize small enterprises
by encouraging the establishment of larger and more efficient units, capable
of facing foreign competition at home and abroad. Greater export orientation
of industry is stressed to overcome the limitation of the small domestic
market. A system of export credits is being considered by the Government.
Cooperation with foreign firms is also being encouraged, Two major constraints
on the continued expansion of manufacturing are labor, particularly skilled
labor, and finance. The domestic capital market is little developed, as des-
cribed in more detail in paragraphs 28-30, below, and few enterprises are in
a position to raise capital abroad.
16.   During 1967-71 the number of tourists increased rapidly and tourism
receipts increased from C.3,6 million in 1966 to over C.ll million in 1971.
The growth of the sector is sensitive to political developments in Cyprus
and in neighboring areas. The number of tourists was much reduced in 1963-
64 and in 1967, and the growth rate declined sharply in 1970 when there were
local disturbances. In 1971 the growth of tourism was again very high. The
Government regards the country's tourism potential as a major resource and
is promoting its development by publicity abroad and by encouraging the
construction of hotels and the training of personnel. There is scope for
regional diversification of tourist traffic, about half of which now comes
from the United Kingdom.
External Assistance
17.   In the past few years private long-term capital, mainly direct invest-
ment, has accounted for nearly three-fourths of the capital inflow into
Cyprus, with short-term commercial and suppliers credits constituting the
bulk of the rest. Most of the private capital inflow has come from the
United Kingdom. In addition to the Bank., which has provided the largest
part of the public capital inflow, Cyprus has received loans from Germany,
the United Kingdom and the United States. Private long-term capital inflows
are expected to continue to be the main source of external capital, with
loans from international organizations and bilateral donors playing an import-
ant, though subsidiary, role.
18*   The structure of the capital inflow is reflected in the relatively small
external public debt which, at the end of December 1971, amounted to about
$39 million (excluding undisbursed). Just over half of the debt was owed
to the IBFD, about 24 percent to the United Kingdom and 14 percent to Gexmarny.
The debt service burden is low, the debt service ratio being about 2 percent;
including private debt, this ratio would be in the order of 5 to 6 percent.
In the light of its economic performance and low external debt burden, Cyprus
is creditworthy for continued Bank lending.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CYPRUS
19.   The present total of Bank lending to Cyprus is $39.5 million equivalent
(net of cancellations), of which $35e4 million was outstanding on April 30,
1972. Three loans totalling $22.6 million (net of cancellations) for power
development were made to the Electricity Authority of Cyprus, one in each of
the years, 1963, 1967, and 1969. A loan of $11.5 nillion for a ports project
was made in 1969, Two loans totalling $5.4 million were made in 1971 for
sewerage projects in Nicosia and Famagusta. Performance under all these loans
has been satisfactory, and there are no outstanding problems. Annex I con-
tains a summary statement of Bank loans as of April 30, 1972, and notes on
the execution of ongoing projects.
20.   In concentrating its lending on the provision of infrastructure, the
Bank has sought structural and institut oinal reform to relieve the constraints
on further economic development. Through the power loans the Bank has assist-
ed in the consolidation and expansion of the Electricity Authority. Ijprove-
ment of port adinistration and operation through the creation of a National
Ports Authority, now underway, is the objective of Bank lending in this sector,
and the recent creation of sewage boards was an important element of the-two
sewerage projects.
21.   the Bank's major objective in Cyprus continues to be to supportstructur-
al reform. Given the sectors covered by previous Bank operations and the
size of the economy, the following are likely to be the remaining areas in
which the Bank can expect to encourage reforms:
(a) to provide assistance to improve agriculture, in particular
through more effective development and utilization of the limited water
resources. This assistance might include projects such as the Paphos Irriga-
tion Project, which is under preliminary consideration, and would be-one of the
largest irrigation projects in Cyprus;
(b) to help improve the availability of long-tenm finance hor-tnurism
and industry, through the expansion and strengthening of financial institutions;
and
(c) to provide infrastructure upon which future econmic development
will depend, including the development of a balanced highway investnant program
in ccnection with a proposed loan for roads in FY73.
22. The Bank has one other loan under consideration for Cyprus in FY72.
This is a proposed fourth power loan to the Electricity Autherity of Cypras,_
which has already been negotiated and is expected to be sutmitted to the
Excecutive Directors simltaneously with the loan proposed in this report.
These two loans would bring the total of Bank lending to Cyprus this year to
the relatively high level of US$12 miUlion. However, only one loan of US$4j
million is envisaged for FY73 and the average annual lending over the next
few years is not expected to exceed Us$5 milion. This is not an inaignificant
amount considering the maall size of the economy, and takes into account the
difficulty Cyprus has in raising long-term  inance for development from other
sources,



-6 -
23.   As yet IFC has made no investments in Cyprus, althougi it has had
project identification missions in December 1971 and March 1972. IFC is
currently reviewing an expansion project by the Cyprus Cement Company (Limassol).
Several hotel projects have been brought to IFC's attention, and these are
being studied with the assistance of the Cyprus Development Bank.
PART III - THE PROJECT
24.   In order to reduce the dependence of the economy upon foreign military
expenditures, there is need to find alternate sources of foreign exchange.
The two sectors most likely to offer scope are industrial exports and tourism,
sectors in which the Cyprus Development Bank has been most active. This is
consistent with the IBRD objective of furthering economic development by
encouraging reform and strengthening financial institutions.
25.   A report entitled "Appraisal of the Cyprus Development Bank Limited"
(DB-86a, dated M4ay 22, 1972) is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
26.   In September 1970 the Cyprus Development Bank Limited (CDB), supported
by the Government of Cyprus, requested the Bank to provide some financial
assistance. Following clarification of a number of preliminary issues, an
appraisal mission visited Cyprus in November 1971 and negotiations were held
in Washington in April 1972. The Borrower's delegation was led by Mr. A.M.
Pikis, General Manager, and the Guarantor was represented by Mr. T. Theophilou
of the Ministry of Finance.
Establishment and Resources of CDB
27.   CDB was established in 1963 with a share capital of C£1 million. It
was created at the initiative of the Govermment, in cooperation with the
private sector, to provide long-term finance to manufacturing and service
enterprises. The Government is the majority owner, holding 60 percent of
the shares; about 900 private shareholders, none of them large subscribers,
hold the balance.  The company's board is drawn largely from the private
sector and until the end of 1972, the Government's shares are subordinated
to others in respect of dividend rights. In most respects CDB operates as
a private institution. For its initial four years, when business was low,
CDB did not raise additional resources. This situation changed in 1968,
and to carry out a rising volume of operation since then, CDB has borrowed
long_term funds. It has raised several loans from the Government (C£1.7
million), made two domestic debenture issues (CZ 1 million), and borrowed
C480,000 from the Kreditanstalt far Wiederaufbau. At the end of 1971, CDB
had a net worth of about Cd .1 million and long-term loans of about Cf2.0
million.



-7-
Objectives and Role of CDB
28.   At the time CDB was established, the Cypriot Government considered
that there was a need for an institution specializing in term finance and
capable of providing advice to small- and medium-sized Cypriot firms. CDB
was set up to meet this need and was established in such a way as to give
it a private character, as well as independence from the commercial banks
in Cyprus.
29.   The commercial banks have been the traditional source of finance for
Cypriot entexprises and although the banks normally restrict their financ-
ing to short-term, but renewable, overdrafts, CDB in effect competes with
them for business. CDB's competitive strength has varied depending on the
liquidity of the banking system and 0DB's own resource position.  The coomer-
cial banks currently have about C£20 million in outstanding loans to the
manufacturing sector, a multiple of CDB's portfolio. CDB's role has not,
however, been unimportant because it has evaluated investments on the basis
of their long-term viability rather than on short-term security consideratiors
and it has thus been able to finance some of the smaller, less-established
firms in the country. CDB has also been more effective in financing tourism
projects in that it has been able to provide loans of much longer-term than
the commercial banks were willing to give. Currently, CDB's tight resource
position and a fairly high degree of liquidity in the commercial banks has
affected its competitive position.
30.   Apart from CDB and the banks, there is no significant domestic source
of funds for manufacturing firms although the Government has lent some funds
for tourism projects through its Loan Commissioners. Effective interest
rates for bank funds range from 8 percent to 11 percent. Government has made
some tourism loans at a concessional rate of A, percent. MDB charges what
the market will bear;  currently this is in the 8 1/4 percent - 8 3/4 percent
range. There is almost no market in private shares or debentures.
Management and Organization
31.   CDB's Board of Directors has eleven members.  In accordance with CDBts
Articles, three are appointed by the Government, five are elected by private
shareholders and three are selected by the private and the Govermnent Directors
jointly. The Chairman comes from the private sector and the Vice-Chairman
is a Government Director. There has been little turmover on CDB's Board
It is an active board and it takes decisions on the basis of conservative
business principles. The Board discusses individual investments at length
and neither Government nor private directors vote as a bloc.
32.   CDB's day-to-day operations are competently managed by the General
Manager, Mr. Angelos Pikis, formerly chief accountant of the Bank of Cyprus,
who joined CDB in 1967. CDB has seven professional staff including two ex-
perienced senior officers dealing with project appraisals. However, the
small staff can no longer cope effectively with the growing volume of work.
During negotiations, CDB advised the Bank of its plans to strengthen its
staff and to improve project appraisal and supervision work.



-8-
Policies and Operations
33.   Policies. CDB's Memorandum and Articles of Association give it wide
scope for providing medium- and long-term loans to companies in any economic
sector. It may also take equity positions. In practice the bulk of its
financing has been for manufacturing and tourism. It has generally followed
conservative financial policies. It is now, with the agreement of the Bank,
raising the limits to the amount of finance it can provide to a single firm
(30 percent of its net worth in loans; 10 percent of its net worth in any
single equity position; 60 percent of its net worth in total equity partici-
pation). CDB carries the foreign exchange risk on its KfW loan. Provision
will be made to offset this risk and CDB has agreed not to incur further
foreign exchange risks, The Government will assume the exchange risk on
the proposed Bank loan.
34.   ODerations. Reflecting economic trends in the country, CDB's business
has devl'oped significantly only over the past four years. Since its creation,
and through the end of 1971, CDB approved 156 loans and equity investments
amounting to cu4.6 million. Approvals in both 1970 and 1971 were about
CL.1l million, of which roughly 30 percent was in tourism projects. Most of
its loans are under C£L00,00O and for terms between three and eleven years.
CDB charged an interest rate of 712 until 1970, but since then it has charged
between 8 1/4 and 8 3/4 percent.
35.   CDB's portfolio amounted to CL3.l million ($8.1 million equivalent)
at the end of 1971. About 60 percent represented industrial loans and 30 per-
cent was related to hotel companies. Investment in manufacturing in Cyprus
has grown 15-20 percent annually since the mid-sixties to reach about C£7
million per year in 1970, and CDB is associated with about 10 percent of the
total manufacturing investment in this period. In 1970, CDB's manufacturing
clients contributed l1 percent of output and 8 percent of value added by
Cyprus' industry. They are in the principal branches of Cyprus' industry;
food products and apparel account for over one-third of MDB's operations.
Though the majority still focus on supplying the domestic market, some have
shared in the growth of Cyprus manufacturing exports, contributing in 1970
about C£2.4 million to the total exports of manufactures of C£7.5 million.
These exports were achieved without special incentives provided by the
Government.
36.   Hotel construction has become a prime growth activity in Cyprus.  CDB
is closely involved in it through its association with about 80 percent of
the island's new hotel projects. Hotels financed by CDB accounted for about
40 percent of total expenditures by tourists in 1970.
37.   CDB's industrial and hotel projects have created about 3,700 jobs.
Investment per job amounted to about $10,000 in hotels and $8,000 in industry,
which is low in comparison with other countries in the Mediterranean area.
Indeed, given its high rate of employment, Cyprus might find it advantageous
to shift production to more capital-intensive and labor-saving processes.



- 9 -
38.   The quality of CDB's appraisals has been reasonably good, although
somewhat uneven. Although CDB has much more detailed information on its
projects than is evident from its formal appraisal papers, there is a need
to improve the analysis of marketing possibilities, construction periods
and expected financial results. While CDB has given close attention to
serious problem projects, there are others where follow-up has been deficient.
CDB's portfolio now has a sufficient number of operations, and enough poten-
tially weak spots, to require more systematic and effective follow-up work.
During loan negotiations, understandings were reachled on ways to improve
CDB's appraisals and project supervision. The planned staff addition will
help. CDB in this respect.
39. CDB requests its borrowers to submit their applications with more than
one tender for equipment. It is developing its capability to improve its
advice to borrowers on prices and suitability of equipment. CDB's disburse-
ments are carefully handled.
40. Financial Results and Portffolio. CDB's earmings before provisions
and taxes dx &vTii .frcm '7to 1971. Administrative expenses have been
modest. However, reflecting its liimited financial leverage, CDB's profit-
ability, aethough improving has remained low. Return on avrerage net worth
(after Drcoi.cioiis and taxes3 increased from 3,2 percent in 1967 to only 4.4
percent in 1971. CDB is obliged under its Memorandum and Articles of Asso-
ciation to pay a 6 percent dividend to its private shareholders (i.e. on 40
percent of its total share capital) and has done so since its creation. As
a resvlt, CDB's pay-out ratio has been high, e.g. 60 percent in 1971. Until
1972, CDB's dividends are tax free and it has to pay insignificant dividends
on Gove.3nm(nt s7nares. From 1972 on, these two privileges will cease. These
factors have been incorporated in the financial projections and will not
adversely affect CDB's profitability.
41.   CDB's portfolio grew from nearly CZ700,000 in 1967 to about C£3.1
mill:ion in 1971, an average growth of 47 percent a year. It is of good
qualiby, de3pite the fact that about 15 percent of its loan portfolio is
affI:tcad by arrears ovor three months, Better project supervision, as
notes -'70ve, a more forceful ccL.ection effort which 0DB is now planning,
and. JUi."US res;oheduling of loans that are otlherwise good, could eliminate
muc1 of theae axrears. A px-Jision of C£55,000 is adequate to cover CDB's
risk of losses on the CZ126,000 of outstanding loans which are experiencing
difficulties, The ratio of long-term debt to equity is still low: 1.7:1
as at the end of 1971. Altogether, CDB's financial position is sound.
42.   MDB's accounts are audited by the leading auditors in Cyprus, who are
also active in Greece in association with Touche Ross & Co. CDB has agreed
to present the Bank with an annual audit in a satisfactory form.

Projected Operations and Resource Requirements
43.   An important field for industrial investment in Cyprus lies in further
import substitution. Large projects are being considered for a variety of
building materials. Furthermore, investments for industrial exports will no
doubt increase in the years to come. Cyprus counts on further processing
some of its food products, and on continued upgrading of the quality of its
textiles. If an arrangement with the European Economic Community is worked
out, Cyprus may also be able to participate in sub-contracting activities
such as making spare parts for vehicles. It is reasonable to expect that
annual gross manufacturing investment will rise from about C£8 million to
C0l2 million in the mid-seventies.
44e   Given the pressing demand for tourist accommodation, and projects
already being prepared, there is a reasonably firm basis for predicting hotel
investments in Cyprus. By 1975, another 9,1400 beds will be needed, in addi-
tion to the 14,000 available or under construction0  To have them in place,
fresh investments of about C£22 million need to be made.
45.   CDB has based its five-year forecast of industrial financing (1972-76)
on the expectation that industrial investment in Cyprus will grow by about
14 percent per year. CDB expects to continue to be associated with about
80 percent of the new hotel investments in Cyprus through 1976, and to contri-
bute about 20 percent of total investment cost to projects it will finance.
CDB could most probably increase its financing of hotel projects but wants
to keep its portfolio balanced between industry and tourism. Total commit-
ments in the 1972-76 period are forecast of C£8.4 million.
46.   On the basis of its projected operations, CDB would require C£3.7
million to cover its commitments through June 30, 1974. It has already
secured a Government loan for C0O.25 million and will shortly receive a
second loan for C0f075 million. The satisfactory conclusion of this loan
agreement is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan.
Together these loans will cover its needs well beyond the middle of 1972.
Resources already in sight for the two-year period ending June 30, 1974 are
a domestic bond issue for C£0.5 million, a possible second loan from Kredit-
anstalt fur Wiederaufbau of DM4 million (C£0.5 million) of which about
C£300,000 will be available for commitments through June 30, 197X4, and a
C£4.3 million line-of-credit from a British bank. In addition, intemnal
cash generation would bring about C£0.1 million, and C£0.3 million will come
from term deposits. These resources, totalling C£2.5 million would narrow
CDB's resource gap to about C£1D2 million, equivalent to US$3 million, which
forms the basis of the proposed Bank loan.
47.   Total assets are expected to more than double in the 1972-76 period,
reaching a level of about C£10 million (US$26 million equivalent) in 1976.
During this period CDB's long-term debt equity ratio is likely to increase
from 1.7:1 in 1971 to 4.6:1 in 1974. Net profits are expected to increase
from 5.4 percent of average net worth in 1972 to 8.3 percent in 1976, a
moderate growth reflecting the increasing cost of resources on which CDB
will likely have to depend.  CDB should be able to continue prudent appro-
priations to provisions and reserves, and to pay a 6 percent dividend
throughout the period.

48.   Over the long term the Government and CDB's private shareholders will
need to give thought to CDB's status as a joint venture between the public
and private sectors, because the likely return to private shareholders as
it is now constituted is not satisfactory.
Terms of the Proposed Bank Loan
49.   The proposed Bank Loan to CDB follows the terms and conditions of
recent Bank loans to other development finance comnpanies, including the
standard commitment charge. The free limit above which Bank approval of a
project is required would be US$100,000. The aggregate free limit would be
US$750,000.  The limit on the ratio of debt to equity would be five to one.
The loan would be repaid over 16 years, including three years of grace,
according to a fixed amortization schedule which would mirror the estimated
composite repayments expected from sub-borrowers. The proposed loan would
be limited to financing the foreign exchange cost of imports needed for
investments supported by CDB.
50.   CDB is an institution which plays an important role in Cyprus' economy.
While experiencing the normal problems of a growing institution, it is well
equipped to handle them. CDB has taken measures which should enable it to
cope with the growing tasks ahead and is creditworthy for the financing
proposed.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ANID AUTHORITY
51., The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and The Cyprus Development
Bank Limited, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Cyprus
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Sec-
tion 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a
Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. The draft Agreements conform to the nozmal pattern
for loans to development finance companies.
52.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOIMIENDATION
53.   I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

B.    PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Performance under aIl Bank loans to Cyprus has been satisfactory.
Disbursements have been delayed in only one instance (the Ports Project),
and this was due to a dispute between the contractor and the Government involv-
ing the contractor's claim to foreign currency payments in accord with his bid
estimates without submission of evidence of actual foreign currency payments.
We have been assured by the Government that this matter will be settled within
the first half of 1972.  Construction, however, has remained largely on schedule.
