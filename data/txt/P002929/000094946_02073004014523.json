likely,\n            institutional development impact as modest, Bank performance\n            as satisfactory, and borrower performance as satisfactory.\n            The outcome of expanding and improving the reliability of\n            power supply was successful, although delays were\n            experienced in the commissioning of the Owen Falls Extension\n            hydropower plant (OFE). However, institution-strengthening\n            efforts and attempts to improve Uganda Electricity\n            Board's operational and financial performance fell\n            short of expectations. The lessons learned include: It is\n            more efficient to initiate and implement measures to improve\n            institutional and financial performance in advance of major\n            new investments. Government ownership of its power sector\n            reform program is a critical underpinning to ensure its\n            successful and timely implementation. The inclusion of the\n            Dispute Review Board (DRB) should be reviewed as it could be\n            counterproductive to the dispute resolution process. The\n            removal of amicable settlement with the introduction of the\n            DRB could also delay the resolution of disputes because if\n            DRB's recommendation were to be rejected, the next step\n            would be arbitration. Procurement capacity should be built\n            prior to commencement of implementation in order to avoid\n            delays caused by poor procurement decisions, as was the case\n            concerning the first civil works contract for OFE."}, "docdt": "2002-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
