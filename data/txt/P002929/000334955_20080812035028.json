"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Third Power Project and\n            Supplemental Credit for Uganda are as follows: outcome was\n            unsatisfactory, risk to the development outcome was\n            significant, the Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was rated as moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some of the lessons learned from this\n            project are: 1) power sector reforms need to be very\n            country-specific in order to produce improved sector\n            performance and increased access to electricity by the poor.\n            The Bank's power sector policy and lending strategies\n            of the 1990s, with their strong emphasis on unbundling and\n            privatization, did not lead to better performance of the\n            sector and increased access, because they were not applied\n            with due consideration to the country's\n            characteristics; 2) private sector participation in major\n            power projects can create significant contingent liabilities\n            for the governments. Therefore, the Bank needs to encourage\n            and help governments to develop an appropriate framework for\n            risk sharing with the private sector; 3) the Bank needs to\n            carefully scrutinize contractor prequalification. In some\n            cases, the Bank might be better off using the services of\n            outside consulting firms instead of relying on its own\n            expertise; and 4) timely midterm reviews (and project\n            restructuring if warranted) are particularly important in\n            infrastructure projects with long implementation periods\n            during which the original objectives and project design are\n            more likely to require changes."}, "docdt": "2008-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
