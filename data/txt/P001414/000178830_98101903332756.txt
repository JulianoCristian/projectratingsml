KEPUIJL,iC CL' LIBERIA
FUBLIC UTILITMS AUTHOMI;L
APPiAILSAL (2w THE SEGCIjD POWER PROJECT
SUTMARY _AkID CONcLJSICNS
i.        The Bank's firsi, power loani to Liberia was signed in June 1970.
One of the items financed by that loan -eras a consultants' study of the
Public Utilities Authority's (PFUA Y) power transmission and distribution
requirements for 1971-198il. The study tmes completed in January 1971.
Based on its recommendatior s, thoe Gover:uneant of Liberia, on behalf of
PUA (the borrower), has requested a Bank loan of US$4.7 million to cover
the off-shore costs of a Project bhi.ch includes transmission, distribution
and generation, estimated to cost US$6.4 vdhlion.
ii.       PUA 's transmission and  Lstr:tbition network is at present
unsatisfactory. It is over3oaded, requires too much maintenance, and gives
rise to high losses and frequent f£e.lts. T'iee Project would remedy these
shortcomings, increase reliability of the supply, improve system planning,
and establish a sound base for i`uture grovth.  The Project includes only
the most essential improvements needed in 1972-197h, because of PUA's
present inability to finance a larger program.
iii.      The Project also includdes the i.nstallation of an additional
generating unit (No. h) of 1.7 MW at the Mt. Coffee hydro-electric plant.
Demand has grown more rtpidly than Pas estimaeted during appraisal for the
first Bank loan.  Installation of the n.iLit is J.ustified one year earlier
than was originally planned because the -Xnergy which it would generate
would replace more expensive thermal energy.
iv.       Construc-tion of the tranzxiLission and distribution part of the
Project would start in the fall of 1972. In the interim period, detail
design would be carried out, specifica-tions and tender documents would be
prepared and issued, bids would be evaluated and contracts awarded.  Pro-
curement of Unit No. 4 would be almost iimmediate since the tender docu-
ments issued and bids recently received for Unit No. 3 under the first
loan (684-LBR) included an option for nMit N o. 4. PUA would also utilize
the time available to recruit anid tralin additional distribution construc-
tion crews.
V.        The internal financial, rate of return of PUA's 1971-1974 develop-
ment program, of which the Project formus an integrel part, is about 21%.



- ii -
vi.       PUA is responsible not only for power, but also for water supply
and sewerage. These other two services, however, constitute only a small
part of its activities; power accounts for 70% of total assets and 85% of
total revenues. Separate accounts are kept for the three services.
vii.      PUA's  financial position has been weak, with heavy debt, and
earnings give a low return on net assets in operation. An increase in
power tariffs to produce 16% more revenue was necessary to complete the
financing plan for the power division and this increase has already been
implemented.
viii.     The total capital requirement of PUA's power division for 1971-1974
is about US$30.0 million. About one-third of this amount would be provided
by net internal cash generation. The first Bank loan plus the loan now
proposed would cover 41% of the total requirement. Loans to be arranged for
subsequent construction would amount to 24%, and 3% is covered by a loan from
the African Development Bank, made in 1970 for a gas-turbine unit.
ix.       With the tariff increase., the rate of return on average net fixed
assets in operation is expected to improve from 5.6% in 1970 to 9.9% in 1976
for PUA as a whole, and from 6.6% to 12.4%, respectively, for power opera-
tions alone.
x.        Several covenants seeking improved performance by PUA as a whole
were agreed when the previous loan was signed. These have been reconfirmed
for the loan now proposed.
xi.       The Project constitutes a suitable basis for a loan of US$4.7
million, for a period of 19 years, including 4 years of grace.



REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
PUBLIC UTILITIES AUTHORITY (PUA)
APPRAISAL OF THE S1IOND POWER PROJECT
1. INlTROJDUCTION
1.01      The lovernment of Liberia on behalf of the Public Utilities
Authority (PUA) has requested a Bank loan of US$4.7 million to finance the
off-shore cost of a Project consisting of new installations for the genera-
tion, transmission and distribution of power. PUA's program for transmission
and distribution during 1972-1974 is the primary element of the Project, which
also includes the installation of a hydroelectric generating unit (No. 4) of
17 MW at the existing Mt. Coffee power station.
1.02      The borrower would be PUA.  The total cost of the Project would be
US$6.4 million. 1/ The proposed loan would be the second to PUA within about a
year.  The first loan (684-LBR) was signed on June 4, 1970.
1.03      Loan 684-LBR financed the installation of two 15 MW gas turbine
units at Bushrod; the civil works and installation of a 17 MW hydro unit
(No. 3) at Mt. Coffee; civil works only for unit No. 4; and some 12 miles
of 69/138 kV transmission line. It also included a study by PUA's con-
sultants (Chas. T. Main International Inc. of Boston, U.S.A.) of the trans-
mission and distribution network serving Monrovia and the surrounding area,
which has been completed. The study included the preparation of a program
of development for ten years (1971-81), and the Project would be part of the
first phase of this program covering 1972-74, as stated above. It would
rehabilitate, strengthen, and extend PUA's Monrovia system. The scope of
the consultant's proposal for 1972-1974 had to be reduced because of PUA's
tight financial situation during 1971-1973 in spite of a 16% tariff increase
(see paragraphs 8.05 and 8.09). However, because of PUA's forecast favorable
financial situation after 1973 a further increase in tariffs is not justified.
Accordingly the reductions made were included in subsequent phases of the
1971-1981 program. The Project as presented however, would be adequate to
carry the loads expected without undue overloading and voltage drop. It
takes into account the particular importance to PUA of demonstrating the
reliability of its service, in order to persuade large industrial consumers
to buy power from PUA rather than install their own generating plant. Such
consumers at present account for 70% of all generating capacity installed
in Liberia (see paragraph 2.03).
l.o4      At the time Loan 684-LBR was signed, the No. [4 generating unit at
Mt. Coffee was not scheduled to be commissioned until mid-1975; accordingly,
the civil engineering works for it were included for financing under that
loan, but the unit itself was not. Ehergy sales are now expected to develop
more rapidly than was estimated in '969 because the Bong Mining Company has
recently contracted to purchase additional energy from PUA. The installation

of unit No. 4 is therefore justified one year earlier; it will not add firm
capacity but will replace thermal energy thus saving fuel costs. The tender
documents for the No. 3 unit which is financed by Loan 684-LBR included, as
an option, the No. 4 unit. Bidding was on an international basis and the
off-shore cost of the No. 4 unit, namely US$2.2 million, is included in the
loan now proposed, so that PUA may take up the option.
1.05      The status of the project for which Loan 684-LBR was made is as
follows. All tender documents have been issued and the bidding for most
items has been completed; no construction has been carried out to date.
The Mt. Coffee units are about 4 months behind schedule and the gas-turbine
units about one year (see paragraph 3.02). As a result load shedding had
to be introduced in early 1971 (the dry season) and will again be necessary
in early 1972.
1.06      PUA's financial performance since the appraisal of Loan 684-LBR
has been as forecast. The principal aspects of the proposed loan would be
identical with Loan 684-LBR. The date of final repayment of both loans
would be the same. The commitments entered into by PUA and the Government
for Loan 684-LBR would be equally applicable to the proposed loan and have
been repeated without change in the new agreement. They deal with: appointment
of consultants; no increase in the scope of non-power activities; continued
employment of management consultants; reorganization of management; audit
arrangements; insurance; rate of return; no payment of dividends during
loan disbursement period; no utilization of power resources for non-power
activities; debt limitation; continuation of the Government's policy to
finance secondary centers; and an undertaking by the Government to make
good deficits for water and sewer operations.
1.07      This report is based on PUA's consultants' feasibility report,
and on the findings of a field appraisal in February/March 1971, by
A.N. Memon (Financial Analyst) and E.A. Minnig (Power Ehgineer).

2. THE POWER SECTOR
The Country and the Economy
2.01      Liberia is situated on the West Coast of Africa, north of the
equator. The country is a substantial exporter of rubber and the world's
third largest exporter of iron ore. Iron ore mining accounts for about
one quarter of GDP and three quarters of exports. However, the population
which is estimated to be about 1,500,000 and to be growing by about 2.5% p.a.
has a per capita income of less than US$200 p.a. The distribution of income
is very uneven and 70% of the population has a per capita income of about
US$50 or less. Almost two-thirds of GDP (US$395 million in 1969 at current
prices) is produced by industries which employ less than one-quarter of the
working population. The role of mining and its impact on commerce, especially
in Monrovia, is reflected by power generation per capita of 496 kWh in 1970
which is unusually high for a country with such a low level of income.
2.02      GIP is currently increasing by about 4.5% p.a. in real terms, and
unless there are unexpected changes in the prices of rubber and iron ore
this rate of increase is expected to continue for the next three or four
years.  Economic activity, apart from mining and agriculture, is concentrated
in Monrovia, Harbel and Buchanan - the area served by PUA's Monrovia power
system. (See Annex 1 for economic data.) The past growth of power consump-
tion in Monrovia, exclusive of the mining load served by PUA, is expected to
be sustained.
The Power Sector
2.03      PUA's Monrovia system, i.e. the system serving a narrow coastal
area from Robertaport to Buchanan, is the main source of public power, al-
though PUA also operates six secondary centers, as an agent of, and with
funds provided by, the Government. However, private sources of power, no-
tably the mining companies, dominate the sector; two of the four mining
companies are now interconnected with PUA' 9 Monrovia system. Annex 2 gives
a breakdown of private generating capacity and generation for the years 1969
and 1970 and a summary of the sector for those years. Principal data for the
sector in 1970 are given in the following table.

1/ The Monrovia syster. viaza 7 MW in 1961. Since February 1971, capacity has
been 77 MW.
2/ 15.4 MW within Monrovia system; 4.1 M* elsewhere.



2.04      The only indigenous source of energy, hydro electricity, is limited;
there are no favorable sites for storage, and stream flows vary widely. About
1,200 GWh, is the estimated national hydroelectric potential without storage,
but its early development is unlikely.  The installation of about 275 MW at
an average capacity factor of 50% would be possible, but only about 60 MW of
this capacity would be firm. Substantial parallel investment in thermal plant
would still be required.
PUA's Installations
Monrovia Power System
2.05      PUA's Monrovia system consists of two 17 MW hydroelectric units
at the Mt. Coffee power station, and two 15 NW gas-turbine units plus six
diesel generators with a total capacity of 13 NW at the Bushrod power station.
The second 15 NW gas-turbine unit (financed by the African Development Bank)
was commissioned at Bushrod in February 1971. Both power stations operate
satisfactorily; planned additions (paragraphs 5.03 - 5.06) are adequate.
2.06      PUA's transmission and distribution network is in urgent need of
improvement. Many transformers have been damaged by overloading.   Trans-
mission is at 69 kV and distribution voltages are 7.2 kV and 12.5 kV.  That
part of Monrovia still using the old 2.4 kV system will be converted to
12.5 kV as part of the Project. A fuller account of PUA's power installations
is given in Annex 3.
Secondary Power Systems
2.07      The six small centers served by PUA are not connected to Monrovia's
grid. They generate about 5% of PUA's total output; separate accounts are
kept for them. Accordingly, they have been excluded from further discussion
in this report.
Water and Sewer Facilities
2.08      PUA took over the Division of Water and Sewers of the Department
of Public Works in 1963.  New works financed by US AID have since been
undertaken. These two services, which are operated and accounted for
separately from power, are described in detail in Annex 4.

3. THE BORROWER
Management
3.01      PUA is a specialized agency of the Government and was established
in 1962 as the successor of the Monrovia Power Authority. It is controlled
by a Board of ten Directors who are appointed by the President of the Republic.
The Department of Public Utilities is responsible for PUA, and its Secretary
is also Chairman of PUA's Board and PUAls acting Manager.  PUA has the poten-
tial of becoming an efficient organization; areas of inefficiency exist,
but improvements have been in progress since Loan 684-IBR was made.
3.02      Since 1963, PUA has had a contract with Sanderson & Porter Inc.
(S&P) of New York to provide management advice and, through the provision
of a seven-man management team to assist in management. However, this
arrangement has not operated entirely satisfactorily because the management
team has been involved in day-to-day operations. Responsibilities have not
been clearly defined; control of labor has been lax; and forward planning
has been deficient. The commissioning of gas-turbine units Nos. 3 and h
has been delayed by a year because specifications were prepared and issued
later than required. In part this was due to PUA's reluctance to initiate
procurement procedures before approval of Loan 684-LBR, causing an initial
delay of about 7 months.
3.03      Previously there was a Liberian counterpart to each member of the
S&P management team. The Liberians have excellent qualifications and PUA
now proposes to give them full responsibility and to retain the S&P team in
an advisory capacity, as shown by the chart of organizational structure in
Annex 5. The long-term objective is to eliminate expatriate assistance. A
Liberian Assistant Manager has already been appointed and the appointment
of a Liberian Manager should be possible by the target date of November 1972
agreed under Loan 684-LBR. It should then be possible to begin to phase
out expatriate assistance. Progress with this policy ia satisfactory.
Staff
3.04      In January 1971, staff in service exclusive of the management
team, totalled 640 of whom 14 were expatriates. For day-to-day operations
and maintenance, staff is adequate. At the end of 1970, PUA was serving
15,269 power customers and 9,625 water and sewerage oustomers. For design
and implementation of the Project, however, PUA will have to rely on consult-
ants (paragraph 6.07) and is arranging to recruit and train by September 1972,
4 additional distribution construction crews, each of about 7-10 men, which
should be possible and should present no difficulties.
Training
3.05      PUA's policy is to promote employees from within its organization,
and to give on-the-job training when an employee is promoted. Training has
become more effective. An adequate number of qualified Liberians are now



- 6 -
in service, freeing expatriates from day-to-day operations, thereby allowing
them to arrange and provide training courses. Several employees are sent
overseas each year for technical or managerial training. Trouble-free
operation at Mt. Coffee power station since its commissioning in 1966 has
been due, in part, to the success of the training policy.
Insurance
3.06      PUA has obtained commercial insurance as required under Loan 684-LBR
and has agreed to increase its insurance coverage commensurate with the
increase of assets in service.

4.01      The market served by the Monrovia system is small. Forecasts of
growth are, therefore, sensitive to individual new loads since one unexpected
new load, from the mining industry for example, could affect the forecast
appreciably and, therefore, the program. The current forecast is based on
a study by PUA's consultants and is reasonable. It includes only those new
industrial and commercial loads which will arise from known plans for develop-
ment.
4.02      Capacities and demand for the Monrovia system are as follows:
1970 (Actual)          1973  /(Forecast)
Dry Season Wet Season Dry Season Wet Season

because above-average flows occurred in the dry season.
3/ No. 3 unit not expected to be commissioned until the end of the wet
season because of delay in construction (paragraph 1.05).
4.03      During 1964-1970 PUA's total sales increased at an average annual
rate of about 22%. Much less rapid growth of about 13.5% per annum is forecast
for the period 1970-1978. The reasons in detail are as follows:
(i)  Residential and commercial sales increased during 1964-1970 at
an average annual rate of about 14%; for the period 1970-1978
a similar rate is forecast, which is consistent with projected
economic development.
(ii)  Government and street lighting sales increased during 1964-1970
at an average annual rate of about 17%; an annual growth of 14%
is forecast during 1970-1978 because of a slow-down in major
construction by the Government.
(iii)  Sales to the mines which started in 1967 (after Mt. Coffee power
station had been commissioned) grew during 1967-1970 at about 33%
per annum0  Annual growth of about 24% is forecast for 1970-74.
However, the annual rate of growth is only about 11% if the forecast
is made over the period 1970-78 because no firm new developments
are known after 197h4



- 8-
4.04      Distribution losses have in the past been as high as 18%, mainly
due to illegal connections.  PUA has made great efforts to reduce this source
of losses and in 1969 and 1970 total losses were reduced to about 13% and 14%,
respectively. Because conductors are too small and transformers overloaded,
losses are forecast to increase to about 16% in 1972; but with the commission-
ing of the Project, they would decrease again to about 13% by 1978. This is
reasonable.
4.05      Past and forecast generation, maxbimm demand, sales and revenue are
given in detail in Annex 6. Annex 7 provides details on which the forecast
of the load is based. Installed and firm capacities and actual and forecast
generation are shown graphically in Annex 8. The table below summarizes the
main features.

5. DEVELOPMNT STRATEGY
Generation
5.01      Expansion plans for the Monrovia system were described in detail
in report PU-38a*which was the appraisal forming the basis of Loan 684-LBR.
The principal details are ssummarized in the following paragraphs.
5.02      PUA's consultants (Chas. T. Main International Inc. of Boston, U.S.A.)
in a study financed by US AID in 1969 concluded that the most economic method
of meeting PUA's short-term needs consisted of the expansion of the existing
Mt. Coffee run-of-the-river hydroelectric plant (installed capacity presently
2 x 17 MW; ultimately 6 x 17 Ki) and instell&tion of gas-turbine units, to firm
up hydro power during the dry season of each year.
5.03      Loan 684-LBR provided for the initial expansion of Mt. Coffee by
the addition of a third 17 NW unit including civil works; civil works only
for the fourth 17 MW unit; and two 15 lMW gas-turbines at the Bushrod station.
At the time the loan was made, it was expected that these additions would
meet requirements through 1974 and that the fourth Mt. Coffee unit would not
be required before 1975. Since each additional hydro unit provides energy
rather than firm capacity, its installation is justified only when, in the
first year of operation, it can produce 39 GWh of useful energy. The cost
of the fuel saved is then about equal to the annual charges of such a unit.
The increase in fuel prices now expected and the contract recently negotiated
with the Bong Mining Company justify the installation of No. h unit one year
earlier, since the breakeven point has been reduced to 30 GWh and the system
can readily absorb the energy generated. Thus PUA's generating capacity at
the end of 1974 would consist of:
h units each of 17 NW at Mt. Coffee            68 NW
4 gas-turbines each of 15 kW at Bushrod        60 NW
Diesel units at Bushrod totalling              13 NW
Total                  141
This capacity would permit PUA to meet its forecast demand of 84 MW at the
end of 1974 as follows:
Dry Season             Wet Season
Hydro Capacity (MW)            13                      51  "
Diesel Capacity (MW)           13                      13
Gas-turbines                   60                     60
86                    124
2/ Total dependable peak availability.
g/ Short-term reserve capacity could be provided by one Mt. Coffee unit.
J   One unit in reserve.
/ All units available but only one unit in continuous operation and one
unit for peaking.
*   Public Utilities Authority Power Expansion Project, May 13, 1970.



- 10 -
5.04      To meet its forecast demand after 1974, the following additions
would be required:
1975:  Gas-turbine unit No. 5                 15 MW
1976:  Gas-turbine unit No. 6                 15 M
1977:  Mt. Coffee unit No. 5                  17 MW
1978:  Oil-fired steam unit No. 1             35 MW
1979:  Mt. Coffee unit No. 6                  17 MW
1980:  Oil-fired steam unit No. 2             35 MW
With the introduction of steam units from 1978 onwards the gas-turbine units
would successively be utilized for peaking only.
5.05      Under Loan 684-LBR, PUA agreed to up-date the generation study by
uhe end of 1973 in order to finalize its plans after 1977, since only the
addition of gas-turbines Nos. 5 and 6 and the Mt. Coffee unit No. 5 cal today
be considered firm. The costs of this study have, therefore, been included
in the proposed loan.
Transmission and Distribution
5.o6      During 1971 and most of 1972, urgent works in the most heavily-
loaded parts of the network will be carried out by PUA with its own funds
until the Project gets underway, because time is required for final planning
of the distribution system, preparation of specifications and tender docu-
ments, issuance of tenders, analysis of bids and award of contracts. The
Project includes those works needed to extend the network and to increase
its reliability during 1973 and 1974.
5.07      Although the Project includes conversion of the primary distribu-
tion system in the central area of Monrovia from 2.4 kV to 12.5 kV (involving
principally the installation of new transformers) this is only a temporary
solution, and PUA's consultants have been instructed to design an underground
system for the downtown area. Overhead transmission lines are difficult to
position in the high-load-density area to be traversed and are aesthetically
objectionable. Underground cables are justified in such areas (Annex 12), and
also eliminate most of the hazards associated with overhead lines. Work on
this underground system would be- otarted in 1974, as part of the second phase
of the proposed ten-year program. Ring systems would be introduced successively,
to increase reliability, and additional transmission lines would be needed to
bring power to the centers of consumption.  By the late 1970s, the 69 kV trans-
mission system will become overloaded and will need to be converted to 138 kV;
transmission lines built in the interim period will, therefore, be constructed
for 138 kV but operated at 69 kV. The 69 kV system in Monrovia proper will,
however, be retained for primary distribution. The installation of a new sub-
station in the downtown area would reduce transmission length and the conver-
sion of primary distribution voltage from 2.4 kV to 12.5 kV would increase
carrying capacity. The combination of these two factors would permit the pre-
sent overloaded system to serve a substantially higher load (3-4 times) at mini-
mum costs thus meeting increased demand until commissioning of the underground
system on which work would start in 1974.



- 11 -
5.o8      The need for an underground system in the second phase of the
program was not clear when the first appraisal was made, because information
on load density was still being collected at that time. As a result, invest-
ment requirements were under-estimated. Rehabilitation requirements are also
greater than originally expected because a complete, up-to-date inventory of
distribution facilities had not then been compiled,
5.09      A single-line diagram of the existing system is shown in Annex 9.
The existing system is also shown on the map in Annex 10. Annex 11 shows
the existing and future transmission at 69 and 138 kV and design criteria
for transmission and distribution are discussed in Annex 12.
Development Costs
5.10      The estimated costs of new works required by PUA's power division
for the period 1971-1976 would total US$50 million as follows:

The Project would account for 12.7% of PUA's program of investment for
1971-1976, and the two Bank projects would together account for 32%.

Annex 12.

6. THE PROJECT
6.01      The Project, together with the project financed by Loan 6814-LBR,
would enable PUA to meet demand until the end of 1974.
Description
6.02      The Project consists of:
(i)  Procurement and installation of the fourth hydro-e.lectric unit
at Mt. Coffee (17 lW);
(ii) procurement and erection of 3 miles of 69 kV wood-pole line; and
2.5 miles of 69 kV underground cable to connect a new 69/12.5 kV
substation in the downtown area to the system;
(iii) establishment of a new 69/12.5 kV substation; expansion of an
existing substation; and rehabilitation of the main substation
at Bushrod to increase reliability of supply; and
(iv) procurement and erection of 142 miles of 12.5 kV overhead lines
in Monrovia outside the downtown area; 54L miles of 12.5 kV
overhead lines in the outlying areas; conversion of the 2.4 kV
system to 12.5 kV; procurement and installation of about
1,000 pole-mounted 12.5 kV/120-240 V transformers with a total
rated capacity of about 30 MVA and about 4,500, 120-2140 V service
connections; and
(v) financing of consulting services.
The location of the transmission lines and substations are shown on the
maps in Annexes 10 and 11.
6.03      The Project would rehabilitate the distribution system, thus
increasing its reliability and improving voltage, and serve new areas.
Installation of the new hydro unit would replace some of the more costly
thermal energy supplied.  In addition to work directly related to the
transmission and distribution aspects of the Project, the consulting
services provided would cover a study of generation requirements after
1977 and a study of the proposed underground system, thus providing a
sound base on which to plan future expansion. The consultants would carry
out most of the design and investigation in Monrovia in collaboration with
PUA's staff, so reducing costs and providing valuable staff training.
Costs
6.o4      The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$6.14 million.  A
detailed estimate (given in Annex 13), is summarized below. Prices at the
end of 1970 were taken as a base. The total contingency allowance is about
20% of the estimated direct costs. Increases in the costs of equipment and
labor have been allowed at an annual rate of 6% and an allowance of 8% has
been made for physical contingencies which, given the nature of the Project,
is considered adequate.

The proposed Bank loan would cover the off-shore costs of the Project
amounting to US$4.7 million. The off-shore cost appears to be relatively
high because the Project does not include the civil engineering works for
No. b unit at Mt. Coffee which are to be constructed as part of the earlier
project.
Procurement and Disbursement
6.05      Procurement, except for consulting services, would be on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines.
The No. 4 unit at Mt. Coffee would be procured from an option, as explained
in paragraph 1.04. For the remainder of the Project, specifications and
tender documents would be issued in September 1971 and the first contracts
awarded in January 1972. Disbursements would be made only for the off-shore
c.i.f. costs of equipment and materials and the off-shore costs of installa-
tion as specified in the contracts. If the contingency allowances are not
used, or there are other savings, such savings would be cancelled. A disburse-
ment schedule for the proposed loarn is given in Annex 14.



- 14 -
Schedule of Construction
6.06      Construction is scheduled to start in September 1972, and should
be completed by mid-1974.  In the interim period, design will be finalized,
specifications and tender documents prepared and issued, bids analyzed and
contracts awarded.
Consultants
6.07      PUA will engage engineering consultants to assist with tender docu-
ments, specifications, analysis of bids and supervision of construction.  The
consultants will also prepare a program for construction based on their
January 1971 feasibility report, which will indicate the sequence in which
works are to be carried out and ensure that PUA's capability is not exceeded.
Sanderson & Porter of New York will continue to provide management services.
The arrangements for management services (see paragraphs 3.02 and 3.03) are
acceptable.
The Environment
6.08      The Project will have no adverse impact on the environment.  In the
case of Mt. Coffee, only the installation of another machine in an ecisting
power station is involved. For transmission lines, existing rights of way
are being used. In the case of the gas-turbine units financed under Loan
6814-LBR, silencers are provided to eliminate noise and air pollution is al-
most negligible because of the high combustion temperatures.



- 15 -
7. JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The Project is needed to help meet the demands forecast for power,
and thus to sustain economic development in the area which it will serve.
The value of Liberia's manufacturing output (principally in the area served
by the Project) has grown at an average annual rate of about 19% from 1965
to 1969. The increase in 1969 over 1968 was about 33%. It is expected that
past growth will be maintained in the immediate future.
7.02      The present unsatisfactory conditiorn of PUA's transmission and
distribution system establishes an important need for the Project. The
reliability of service would be increased, so helping to ensure that new
demands would be directed to PUA rather than supplied by more costly captive
plant. PUA can sell industrial power at between 1.2-1.4 US cents/kWh which
is 30-50% below the cost of self-generated power.
7.03      The Project will provide a sound basic system of transmission and
distribution capable of supporting future growth at minimum costs. PUA's
staff will also receive valuable training through involvement in planning
and investigation.
Least Cost Solutions
Generation
7.04      Construction of Mt. Coffee power station was started before investi-
gation had been carried out to determine the feasibility of storage. As a
consequence, the Mt. Coffee installation as it now exists has a limited firm
capacity. As explained in report PU 38a,l/subsequent investigations showed
that provision of upstream storage within Liberia to firm up the capacity
installed at Mt. Coffee was uneconomic, and that accordingly, new capacity
was needed. A number of alternatives were analysed. The combination of
expansion of Mt. Coffee and gas-turbine units was found to be the solution
best adapted to meet forecast demand. The cost of the hydro/gas-turbine
combination amounts to about US$320/kW installed, which is within the range
usually considered economic for hydroelectric developments. In the wet
season when run-off is adequate, fuel can be saved; in the dry season, be-
cause of the storage available in the head-pond, hydro capacity can be
utilized to best effect for peaking. Up to a discount rate of 15% the
hydro/gas-turbine combination was found to be cheaper than the lowest-
capital-cost alternative of gas-turbines only.

- we -
Transmission and Distribution
7.05      The proposals for transmission and distribution are also the least-
cost method of developing the system. The 12.5 kV system is to be retained
as a permanent secondary distribution voltage, and the 69 kV transmission
system retained for a limited period. In the late 1970s it will be necessary
to change the transmission voltage to 138 kV, because by that time the 69kV
system will be overloaded. Any transmission lines built in the interim
should be designed for 138 kV ultimately but operated at 69 kV initially.
The 69 kV transmission system in Monrovia however, would be retained and
utilized for primary distribution. Thus the transmission line included under
Loan 684-LBR is a 69/138 kV line but the transmission lines included in the
proposed loan are at 69 kV only.
Internal Financial Rate of Return
7.06      The internal financial rate of return of a project is defined as the
equalizing discount rate of incremental costs and incremental benefits attri-
butable to the project. In the present case, the Project covers a part of
PUA's overall development program 1971-1974. It is difficult to separate it
from the program. The internal financial rate of return was, therefore,
calculated on the 1971 through 1974 time slice of the program, assuming a
discount period of 25 years on the following basis:
(i) Price levels from 1975 onward were kept at the 1974 level;
(ii) incremental capital expenditures were taken as the 1971-
1974 cash expenditures;
(iii) incremental fuel costs, excluding taxes, were taken as those
presently forecast for the 1971-1974 period;
(iv) operating and maintenance expenses were escalated at 6% annually
to reflect the aging of facilities and increased maintenance; and
(v) incremental sales attributable to the program time slice
were calculated on the basis of the energy generated by
two additional gas-turbines and two additional Mt. Coffee
units applying forecast losses. Incremental revenue was then
obtained by multiplying sales in kWh by the forecast average
revenue per kWh.
7.07      On the basis of the above assumptions, the internal financial rate
of return on the time slice of the program is about 21%.

8. FINANCES
8.01      The financial characteristics and problems of PUA remain broadly
the same as those discussed in the appraisal report for the previous loant
(a) the Power Division accounts for 70% of assets and 85% of revenue, the
balance being accounted by the Water & Sewer Divisions; (b) the capital
structure is heavily loaded with debt (the debt to equity ratio is 77/23);
(c) debt service coverage is low (1.1 times); and (d) earnings are unsatis-
factory, giving a rate of return of 5.6%.
8.02      The Water and Sewer Divisions keep separate accounts, and the
financial aspects of their operations are discussed in Annex 4. The dis-
cussion below refers primarily to the Power Division. The financial outlook
of PUA as a whole is summed up in paragraph 8.11.
Past Operating Results and Present Position
8.03      Actual operating results of the Power Division for 1970 were
almost identical with those predicted at the time of the last appraisal
(operating revenue US$6.7 million compared with US$6.4 million estimated;
operating cost US$4.1 million compared with US$3.9 million estimated; rate
of return 6.6% as estimated). Gross fixed assets on December 31, 1970
amounted to US$47 million and are reasonably valued. Long-term debt
comprises 77% of capitalization, details of which are in the Balance Sheet
shown in Annex 18. The Income Statement and the Sources and Application
of Funds Statement for the Power Division are in Annexes 16 and 17,
respectively.
Collections
8.04      The Government continues to pay its electricity bills to PA.
regularly. Accounts receivable (net) shown in the Balance Sheet are
principally for private accounts only. Yearly collections as a percentage
of the amount billed in the year have improved from 67% in 1963 to a new
record of 90% in 1970, which was nevertheless short of expectations. PUA
has recently begun to pursue the collection policies agreed with the Bank
last year, namely (i) disconnect anyone who is delinquent for more than
90 days; (ii) remove the meter and service connection 30 days later to avoid
illegal reconnection if the consumer has made no arrangements for settling
his bill; (iii) maintain the reconnection fee at $25; and (iv) require higher
deposits from consumers with bad records of payment. one of the main problems
is that there is no postal service in Liberia. Two methods of delivering
bills are being tried at the moment. Collections are expected to improve,
but progress is expected to be gradual. Provision is made for uncollectible
bills each year in the Income Statement. The collection problem is under
constant review by both PUA and the Bank and is the subject of special
provisions in the Bank's reporting requirements under the existing and the
proposed loans.

Tariffs
8.05      The tariff structure is reasonable but rates are low.  Without a
tariff increase, the Power Division would not be able to finance the local
cost of the construction program. An increase in tariffs not later than
July 1, 1971 to produce 16% higher revenueswas Proposed s0 as to ensure com-
pletion of the financing plan. Since then PUA has increased its tariffs
retroactively to January 1, 1971 for industrial mines and effective April 1,
1971 as regards other customers. Adjustments made to individual tariffs were
discussed during negotiations and confirmation obtained that they yield not
less than 16% higher groso operating revenues.
8.o6      The previous report predicted a tight cash position in 1971 and
1972 but did not call for a tariff increase. The following developments
have affected the cash position adversely since then:
(a) The estimated cost of the program of construction for
1971-74 has increased from approximately US$18 million
to US$23 million (see paragraphs 5.03 and 5.08) which
requires additional internally-generated cash for addi-
tional local expenditure and debt service;
(b) The price of fuel is expected to increase by 30% this
year, primarily because of the recent agreements be-
tween the oil-producing countries and the oil companies;
(c) The commissioning of gas-turbine sets Nos. 3 and 4 has
been delayed until mid-1972 (paragraph 1.05) causing
load shedding (and thus loss of gross operating revenue
of approximately US$90,000 in 1971 and TJS$235,000 in
1972) and postponing connection of approximately 10 MW
of mining load by one year (and thus a loss of gross
operating revenue of about US$1.0 million); and
(d) The effort to collect accounts receivable has been less
successful than expected.
Proposed Financing Plan for the Power Division
8.07      The financing plan for 1971-74 is summarized below.  The Project
accounts for less than one-fourth of expenditure on construction during the
period. The balance of the construction program consists of (a) the project
financed by Loan 68h-LBR; (b) unfinished work under the African Development
Bank's loan (paragraph 2.05); (c) PUA's own construction program; and (d) ex-
penditure during 1973-74 for the next stage of PUMAs development. Details
of the construction program are shown in Annex 12, Page 12. Of the total
capital requirement, 32% would be met from internal cash generation after
debt service and 68% from borrowings. Details of the sources and applications
of funds are shown in Annex 17.

8.0B      In addition to withdrawals from existing Bank and African Development
Bank loans, the new borrowings in the financing plan consist of:
(a) The proposed Bank loan of US$4.7 million equivalent,
assumed to be at 7.25% interest, with 0.75% commitments
charge on the undisbursed amount and repayment over
15 years after four years' grace; and



- 20 -
(b) A drawdown of US$7.0 million equivalent during 1973
and 1974 of future loans for the next stage of the
development program. Arrangements for these loans
have not been made but for the purpose of this
analysis, current Bank lending terms have been assumed.
8.09      The cash position is expected to be tight during 1971-73, even
with the tariff increase mentioned above; but normal planning of daily
cash flow, to which PUA is accustomed, should be adequate to control it.
If not, the following extra sources, which are not included in the financing
plan, would be available:  (i) a loan of US$.4 million from the Government
for 5 years including 3 years of grace, agreed as part of the last Bank
loan to PUA, (ii) a loan from the Water Division Which is expected to have
a cash surplus during the period in question, and (iii) an overdraft from
local commercial banks. Anr extra cash needed is unlikely to be more than
any one of these three sources could provide on reasonable terms. The
Government's assurance that in case of shortage of funds, it will provide
sufficient funds to complete the project, has been repeated for this loan.
Financial Outlook for the Power Division
8.10      Revenues from electricity sales are expected to increase from
Us$6.7 million in 1970 to US$16.2 million in 1976, or 16% a year (see
Annex 16). Average revenue per kWh reflects the nearly constant sales of
low-priced energy to large consumers after 1974 (see paragraph 4.03).
Operating costs are estimated to increase from US$4.1 million in 1970 to
US$9.0 million in 1976, or 14% a year, the 30% increase in price of fuel
mentioned above (paragraph 8.06(b)) being a major factor. The rate of
return on average net fixed assets in operation for power is estimated to
increase from 6.6% in 1970 to 11% and higher in 1973 and later years,
compared with the 10% required by 1974 under the existing loan agreement.
The increase in the rate of return is due to tariff increase, higher gales and
lower unit cost of operation, coupled with the relatively small increase in the
av rage net fixed assets in operation. The requirement of 10% return starting in
1974 has been repeated for the proposed loan. Debt service coverage for
the Power Division is expected to be 1.3 in 1971 and 1.5 or better in sub-
sequent years. The debt to equity ratio is expected to become steadily
stronger, being satisfactory by the end of 1973. The bases for the
financial projections by the Power Division are explained in Annex 19.
Financial Outlook for PEn as a Whole
8.11      It is estimated that with the increase in power tariffs, the
gross operating revenue of PUA, including power, water and sewerage services,
will increase from US$7.9 million in 1970 to US$18.7 million in 1976 (15%
a year). PUA's operating costs are estimated to increase from US$5.1 million
to US$11.1 million (14% a year) during the same period. The return on
average net fixed assets is expected to increase from 5.6% in 1970 to 9.9%
in 1976, which is satisfactory. The overall return is lower than for the
Power Division due to the low return on water and sewerage services (see



- 21 -
Annex 4). Overall debt service coverage is expected to be 1.3 in 1971;
however, it is estimated to be 1.5 or better in each of the succeeding
years. Debt to equity ratio is expected to improve to 67/33 by 1976.
Consolidated income statements, balance sheets and sources and applications
statements for PUA as a whole are given in Annexes 20, 21 and 22. Like
that of Power Division, the overall financial position of PU is expected
to improve steadily being satisfactory by 1973.
9. AGREEMNTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
9.01      The covenants for Loan 684-LBR relating to the following points
have been repeated for the proposed Loan:
(a) PUA will engage consultants for design, review and
preparation of tender documents and specifications;
(b) PU will not extend the scope of its non-power
activities without the Bank's prior approval;
(c) PUA will continue, to the extent necessary, to employ
management consultants;
(d) PUA will -
(i) fill the position of Manager by not later
than November 1972; and
(ii) consult the Bank with regard to the suita-
bUlity of the candidate selected for
appointment to the position of Manager, and
for any subsequent changes in this post;
(e) PUA will continue the present audit arrangements and
will submit the auditors' report to the Bank within
four months of the end of each year;
(f) PUA will carry adequate insurance against normal
operational risks;
(g) no cash dividend will be paid to the Government
during the loan disbursement period;
(h) power tariffs will not be reduced during the loan
disbursement period, and will be maintained at a
level which ensures a return of at least 10% on
the Power Division's realistically-valued average
net fixed assets in operation, starting in 1974;



- 22 -
(i) revenues of the Power Division will not be utilized
to meet current or capital expenses, or debt service,
of any other service of PUA;
(j)    (i) PUA will carry out and complete a study by
not later than December 31, 1972 of water
and sever tariffs; and
(ii) starting January 1, 1974, revenues from water
and sewerage operations will be maintained at
a level sufficient to cover cash operating
costs, debt service and an appropriato contri-
bution to future development of these operations;
(k) PUA will not incur any further long-term debt without first
obtaining the Bank's approval, unless the maxdmum future
debt in any succeeding year is covered at least 1.5 times
by internal cash generation;
(1)    (i) Government will continue to follow its present policy
of financing the secondary centers; and
(ii) Government wil1 not cause PUA to operate or
eatablish any additional centers unless such
additions will not adversely affect PUA's power
operations;
(m) Government will grant PUA priority in use of the flow of the
St. Paul River up to a natural flow of 18,300 subic feet per second;
(n) in the event of any shortfall of funds, Goverzuent will
make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank to provide PUA
with sufficient funds to complete the Project; and
(o) Government will undertake to make up any deficits for
water and sewer operations.
9.02      It was confirmed during negotiations that PUA's electricity tariffs
have been revised to yield an increase of approximately 16% in revenue and
these have been put into full effect.
9.03      The Project would form a suitable basis for a loan of US$4.7
million equivalent for a term of 19 years, including a period of grace of
4 years.

MONROVIA POIfER SYSTEM
EKisting Facilities
1.        PUAts Monrovia system serves an area 70 miles x 125 miles in
extent, from Totota in the north-east to Buchanan in the south-east and
Bomi Hills in the north-west. The main centers of population and of
electrical load are Monrovia (the capital); Buchanan (an important port);
Robertsfield (near the international airport); and Bong Mines and Bomi
Hills (industrial centers).
Generating Plant
2.        There are two generating stations; at Mt. Coffee and on
Blushrod Island.
Mt. Coffee. This hydroelectric plant was completed in 1966
with an installed capacity of 34 IP1PT in two units with provision
for 4 additional similar units. It is located on the St. Paul
River 15 miles north-east of Monrovia. The generators, manu-
factured by the General ELectric Company (US) have a rated
capacity of 17,647 kVA and the turbines, inanufactured by Allis
Chalmers, a maximum output under a head of 72 ft. of 24,000 hp.
The initial installation was financed by US AID. Bank Loan
684-LBR of June 4, 1970, provided funds to install the third
17 Mi unit which should be in operation in 1973. Two 15/20 MVA
3-phase transformers step up generation voltage (12.5 kV) to
69 kV for transmission to Monrovia.
Bushrod Island. The plant installed consists of six diesel
units with a total capacity of 13 MAW and a 15 MM gas-turbine
unit. A second 15 MW gas-turbine unit is being installed for
commissioning in March 1971; it has been financed by the
African Development Bank. Bank Loan 68h-IBR of June 4, 1970
provides for the financing of two further 15 MW gas-turbine
units to be commissioned in 1972. Six single-phase transformers
with a total capacity of 25 MVA step up diesel generation
voltage from 12.5 kV to 69 kV. Transformer capacity for the
gas-turbine units is 23 MVA and voltages 13.8 kV/69 kV.



ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 3 pages
Transmission System
3.        Monrovia is served by a 69 kV transmission system (see Annex 10).
The 69 kV overhead lines are of single-wood-pole standard-cross-arm
construction. The system is essentially radial; 69 kV lines radiate from
Bushrod, Mt. Coffee and Paynesville and supply the outlying areas. Bong
Mine is supplied over a 35 mile line from Mt. Coffee. The Bomi Hills
area including Kle, is fed from Bushrod over a line 39 miles long. A
line from Paynesville extends 36 miles to the north-east via Mt. Barclay
and Careysburg, to supply the Kakata-Totota area, and another line extends
eastward for 75 miles to Robertsfield and Buchanan.
Substations
h.       The following 69/12.5 kV substations supply the Monrovia system:
(i) Monrovia and vicinity
Krutown        2 x  5,000 kVA   3-phase
Congotown      1 x  5,000 kVA   3-phase
Paynesville    1 x  5,000 kVA   3-phase
Capitol        1 x  7,500 kVA   3-phase
(ii) Cutlying areas
Kle            3 x    833 kVA   1-phase
Kakata         3 x    833 kVA   1-phase
Bomi Hills     2 x  5,000 kVA   69/34.5/7.2 kV
3-phase
Bong Mine      2 x 10,000 kVA   3-phase
Robertsfield   6 x    333 kVA   1-phase
Buchanan       1 x  7,500 kVA   3-phase
Mt. Coffee     1 x  2,500 kVA   3-phase
In addition, loads are supplied directly at 12.5 kV from the low-voltage
busbars at Bushrod.
5.        A section of downtown Monrovia is supplied at 2.4 kV by the
following 12.5/2.4 kV substations:
Krutown        1 x  5,000 kVA   3-phase
Ashmun         1 x  1,000 kVA   3-phase
Tubman Hill    2 x  1,000 kVA   3-phase
Nevport        2 x  1,000 kVA   3-phase
McDonald       1 x  1,000 kVA   3-phase



ANNEX 3
Page J of 3 pages
Distribution System
6.        The system is a radial primary feeder system emanating from the
substations described above. Distribution voltage is either 12.5 or 7.2 kV
with a pocket of 2.4 kV in downtown Monrovia. A substantial percentage
of 12.5 kV overhead lines are underbuilt on 69 kV transmission lines. The
2.4 kV system is in need of rehabilitation and is gradually being converted
to 12.5 kV.
7.        A 12.5 kV ring main, completed in 1960, interconnects the 12.5/
2.4 kV substations in downtown Monrovia. A section of this main is under-
ground (Krutown to Tubman Hills and connecting Ashmun and McDonald sub-
stations). The ring is completed by a 12.5 kV overhead line extending
from Tubman Hill to Krutown via Newport. The ring is normally open, and
supplies Ashmun and Newport from Krutown and McDonald and Tubman Hill from
Capitol.
8.        Distribution lines are all of wooden construction with standard
cross-arms. Distribution transformers are pole mounted. An inventory of
existing distribution facilities gives the following:
Length (miles)
Voltage                       Three-Phase    Single & Two-Phase
2.4 kV                             8                  4
12.5/ 7.2 kV  Overhead                 200                 70
12.5 kV  Underground                3                  _
9.        Distribution transformers installed at the end of 1969 had a
total capacity of 52.5 MVA and had cost about US$16/kVA. Secondary
voltages (nominal) are:
Single-phase        120/240 V  3-wire
Three-phase         120/208 V  4-wire
240/416 V  4-wire
240 V  3-wire

AWater and Sewer Division
1.        In 1963, the Division of W4ater and Sewers of the Department of
Public Works was transferred to PUA.  Up to that time PUA had only had
responsibility for power. By the end of 1969, PUA's investments in water
supply and sewerage totalled US$14.8 million.  Two loans by US AID of
US$7.0 million and US$7.2 million respectively, plus two contributions from
the Government of Liberia of US$0.8 million each, provided finance for a
new water treatment plant, a water main and distribution network and for
sewers and a sewage treatment plant in 'Monrovia. The new water system
came into operation in January 1969 and the sewerage system is just about
completed, (commissioning April 1971).
WBater Supply
2.        Since 1957 the St. Paul River has been used as a source of water
for Monrovia, from an intake at White Plains (downstream from Mt. Coffee
power station) from which water was pumped through a 16 inch main 17.5
miles in length to a booster station at Bushrod Island. Wells augmented
this supply and two service reservoirs, of 0.6 and 1.0 Mg capacity
respectively, were in use. However, the water had to be boiled and fil-
tered before it was potable. By 1967, 3.3 Mgd was available from White
Plains, provided all the equipment was operational.
3.        Construction of the new works mentioned above started late in
1966. They consisted of a new intake and treatment plant beside the
existing intake, with high-lift pumps feeding a new 36 inch main, nearly
16 miles long, to Congotown; the capacity of this system is 8 Mgd. In
addition, the distribution system has been improved. The new main was
put in service in October 1968, and the treatment plant in January 1969.
4.       T,vhen the new plant had been placed in service, the pumping
rate rose from 5.0 to 10.0 Mgd, indicating serious leaks from broken or
cracked pipes which had not been able to cope with the higher pressure.
After repairs had been made, consumption dropped to 6.5 Mgd. The total
quantity pumped in the year was 2,h00 Mg.
5.        Demand was stimulated by the improvement in pressure and
quality. A total of 920 new connections were made in 1969 compared with
306 in 1967. Since the new works were started, about 4,000 new connections
have been made.

6.        PUA has retained the services of its consultants - Alvord,
Burdeck and HIowson of Chicago - to make a survey of the system to locate
all leaks and illegal connections.
7.        White Plains pumping station is manned predominantly by
Liberians. Under the US AID Loan Agreement, funds were provided to send
a number of Liberlans to the US for specialized training. This program
was successful in that, on their return, they were able to assume
responsible supervisory positions.
8.        In 1970 the volume of water pumped averaged about 210 Mg/month,
an increase of about 5V% over 1969. The data gathered by PUA's Consultants
(paragraph 6) should help to increase monthly billings and to reduce the
amount of water unac_ounted for. The new 36 inch main, which was over-
designed, can carry 25 Mgd. The capacity of the treatment plant can be
doubled to 16 Mgd with a minimum of new construction. Extensions re-
quiring an investi,e-nt of US$2.0 million will need to be carried out for
commissioning in 1973. A further US$2.0 million is estimated for a
reservoir and a second main to increase reliability.
9.        By the end of 1970 a water system for Greenville which has been
under construction since 1969 was completed, and a system for Harper was
essentially completed. Both systems have been provided under an agree-
ment between the Governments of Liberia and the Federal Republic of Germany.
These two systems will be operated in a similar manner to the secondary
power centers, in that PUA will act as an agent of, and with funds provided
by, the Government.
10.       WJith the assistance of UN, the Government of Liberia has under-
taken a national community *Ater supply program, the purpose of which is
to study ways and means of providing water systems for other communities
throughout the country.
New Sewerage System
11.       Construction started in October 1968 and will be completed in
April 1971. By the end of 1970 the treatment plant was complete and the
sewers about 80% comiplete. The treatment plant is located at Sinkor; it
will discharge treated waste into the Mesurado River.
12.       At the present time sewage is discharged untreated into the
river.  The new plant will, therefore, be a significant factof in reducing
the health hazard and pollution of the beaches.
13.       PUA's I/Ianagement Consultants - Sanderson & Porter of New York -
will provide a qualified consultant to assist in the operation and main-
tenance of the new facilities.

Tariffs
14.       A restructuring and reduction in water rates was made effective
on August 1, 1969 and the rates are as follows:
Minimum monthly charge for
first 2,000 gallons               US$2.50
next 18,000 gallons               US$0.85/1,000 gallons
next 80,000 gallons               US$0.75/1,000 gallons
exaess                            US$0.60/1,000 gallons
Before August 1969, US$4.00 was charged to flat rate consumers and
US$1.00/1,000 gallons to metered consumers.
15.       Sewerage rates to be charged when the new system comes into
service will be based on water consumption as follows:
Minimum monthly charges for
first 2,000 gallons               US$1.50
next 18,000 gallons               US$0.51/1,000 gallons
next 80,000 gallons               US$0.45/1,000 gallons
excess                            US$0.36/1,000 gallons
The connection charge is US$10.00 for the stub from the main to the
property or curb line.
Finances
16.       The rate of return on average net fixed assets in operation for
the Wdater and Sewer Division declined from .0Q% in 1968 to 1.7% in 1969
as a result of the reduction in tariff. It amounted to 2% in 1970.
Separate Water and Sewer Divisions will be established this year. The
4ater Division is expected to earn an annual return between 1.8% and 4.2%
during 1971-1976. The Sewer Division is expected to have a negative
return in each year of the forecast period. Financial statements for
W4ater and Sewer Divisions are shown on pages 4 - 9 of this Annex.
17.       A relatively low rate of return for water supply and a negative
rate of return for sewerage are consistent with the Government's desire
to run these services together on a no-profit no-loss basis. In order
to ensure that they will not be a burden on the Power Division, assurances
were obtained under Loan 68h4IBR that (a) PUA will not utilize revenues
of the Power Division for non-power activities, (b) the Government will
make good any deficit for water and sewerage services, (c) PUA will carry
out and complete a study by not later than December 31, 1972 of water and
sewerage tariffs and (d) starting on January 1, 1974 revenues from water
and sewerage services will be maintained to cover cash operating costs,
debt service and an appropriate contribution to future development.

REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
PUBLIC UTILITIES AUTHORITY (PUA)
MONROVIA SYSTIMl
Load Forecast
1.        The load forecast prepared by PUA's consultants and utilized
as a basis for estimating distribution system requirements is discussed
in this Annex. For this purpose the Monrovia system was divided into
areas along the following criteria:
Type of Area:  Commercial urban
Residential urban
Marginal rural
Average rural
Aining
Large plantations
2.        The growth rates adopted are based on:
Economic and population growth
General industrial developnent
New housing development
3.        The consultants conducted field investigations; analyzed
past available data on energy sales; studied long-range economic plans
of the Government; tool: into account expansion plans of major indus-
tries and general business indicators and reviewed their findings with
PUA's management. The conclusions of this study are satisfactory.
Monrovia Proper
4.        Bushrod Island (5.9 sq mi).  This service area has a large
industrial load and a considerable residential load. Industries are
principally located in the Freeport area with small industries dis-
tributed throughout the remainder of the island. Company compounds
associated with industrial loads and residences at Claratoum, .tew Krutotin,
Vaitown and Jamaica Road contribute to the residential load.
5.        Freeway (46 sq mi).  This includes the area between the St. Paul
and MIesurado Rivers, east of Stockton Creek up to and including Caldwell
Junction. At present a large residential population exists along the
St. Paul River in the Caldwell and New Georgia regions. Industrial load
is beginning to grow along the freewfay, shoe factories and the oil re-
finery being examples. A large section of this area referred to as the
Industrial Park has been zoned for industrial and commercial use.

6.        Downtown (1.4 sq mi).  This is a rocky peninsula extending NlW
into the Atlantic Ocean and bounded to the N and NE by the Mesurado
River. The eastern sector includes the Bassa community and the Lorma
quarter. This area is almost entirely residential and commercial with
very little industrial load.  Small industr-ies -n this area are: Printing,
laundries, garages, dry cleaning, communication equipment. Residential
and commercial loads consist of embassies, hotels, residences, shops and
markets.  MIamba Point is a sector that has the majority of the embassies,
luxury hotels and residences. Old Krutown has a public market, a few
shops and stores. Homes that utilize electricity for lighting and minor
electrical appliances only are in the Tlest Point, Bishop Brooks, Bassa
co.mmunity, and Lorma quarter. Businesses and government offices, stores,
clinics, cinemas, banks, hospitals, schools, restaurants, supermarkets,
bars, nightclubs, hotels, churches, and homes line the section from the
water-front to the center of downtown.
7.        Goverrnent Buildings (0. sq mi).  These are located between
the Downtown and S nIror districts. The major loads in this area are
concentrated on Capitol Hill consisting of the executive mansion, tele-
cormunication, broadcasting services buildings, the Treasury, the
Capitol, the Temple of Justice, the Government Hospital and the University.
8.        Sinkor (!.3 sq rii).  This area has the Yiesurado River to the
north, the Atlantic Ocean to the scuth, Payrne Airfield to the west and
extends eastuard to the MLJA Road. This area is high-grade residential
with few small industries such as brick plants, rock quarries, cement
plant. However, the area is zoned to be residential only. It has
large embassy grounds, beaches, motels, housing establishments, homes,
schools, airport, and the medical college of the university.
9.        Paynesville-Schiefflin (120 sq mi).  This area has the ELWA
Road, Freeway Area, the Miangrove area Of the Hesurado River to its west,
the Atlantic Ocean to the south, the VMA (Voice of America Transmitter) -
Mt. Coffee areas to its north, and to its cast the Firestone Rubber
Plantation and Robertsfield.  This area has the military camp at
Schiefflin, the transritters for both FL,JMA and the Liberian Broadcasting
Corporation, the National Police AcadeKr, a soft drink company, paint
manufacture, a French wireless station, a beach resort and some residences.
Outlying Areas
10.       Robertsfield (100 sq m-').  Bcunded to the north by the Firer
stone Rubber P-lantation, to the south by the Atlantic Ocean, on the
west by the Paynesville-Schiefflin service area and on the east by the
Bassa Hills, this area contains the international airport and an
explosives manufacturing company located nearby.  MIarshall and Owens-
grove are residential centers.
11.       IC e (300 sq mi).  To the north of this area is the LMC-Bomi
area, to the wesb is the Lofa River, tc the south the Atlantic Ocean and
to the east the Suehn  hi-huay.  'he major customers in this &rea are:



ANNEX 7
PageTof 8 pages
The B. F. Goodrich Plantation, the VOA Balac Radio Station near Braves-
ville, Picko Institute, Lott Carey Mission, Bravesville, Royesville and
a number of small Liberian owned rubber plantations.
12.       Buchanan (50 sq mi).  The Buchanan area is centered around
the mouth of the St. John River. Major customers are: LAilICO, Buchanan
and residential loads at Buchanan, Edina, Hartford and Fortsville.
LAMCO has a pelletizing plant and harbor in Buchanan served by captive
plant. Buchanan has schools, hotels and a government receiver and
repeater station.
13.       Kakata-Totota (370 sq mi).  This area comprises the Kakata
and Totota regions and areas along the Kakata-Totota hightway. Nearly
all the Liberian owned rubber plantaticns are in this area. A German
rubber plantation exists in Salala. In addition to a large residential
load, Kakata has a technical high school, a teachers training college,
a junior high school, several elementary schools, a hospital and govern-
ment dispensary. Along the Kakata-Totota highway there are several
elementary schools and a high school at Konala. Salala and Totota are
residential, each having a mission school. Between Salala and Totota
the President of the Republic has a large farm and a motel and zoo.
There are government repeater stations at Kakata, Salala and Totota.
Residential loads exist along the Kakata-Dobli Island highway up to
Laketa.
14.       Mt. Coffee (30 sq mi).  This service area east of the Freeway
area and north of the VOA area has residential loads at Harrisburg,

area. It has the Atlantic Ocean to its west and Lake Piso to its east.
Some residential load exists at Robertsport. If the Whologisi iron ore
project is established, additional residential and industrial loads are
anticipated. The area around Lake Piso is an ideal resort area. Roberts-
port has two high schools and several elementary schools. There is a
mission at Bendu and the possibility of additional residential load at
Tala. Presently all electricity is generated locally. A 69 kV trans-
mission line is partially built from nle towards Robertsport. A highway
between Kle and Robertsport is under construction and when completed
would facilitate the extension of 69 kV transmission to Robertsport.
17.       LMC-Bomi (102 sq mi).  This is the Lofa-Gola service area to
the north of Kle. Vaitown at Bomi Hills is residential while LMC-Bomi

18.       BIUIC-Bong.  Primarily indlus-rial, this area is located north of
the Kakata-Totota highway. There are small residential loads at Dobli
Island, ITaimu, and Suak-aisu and numerous small Liberian owned plantations
along the Kakata-Dobli Island highway. There are also some small
diarond mines located on the Dong-Takata highway.
forecast of Area Loads
19.       For estimating the annual growth rates for the areas described
above past energy sales figures were used for guidance only. In the
areas outside Monrovia proper, energy sales for lighting are minirmal
both on a number of consumers and average use basis, In PIonrovia proper,
while the ratio of lighting and small conmercial consumers to possible
consumers is high, a sharp increase by exist-ng consumers is anticipated.
20.       The  ollowTing factors for estimating load growth in each area
were considered:
(i)  New consumers based on an increase of population of 3.2%
per annum for M.onrovia and 1.3' in other areas;
(ii)  new industrial power consumers and increased conslunption
of existing industrial and large power consumers;
(iii)  increase in the standard of living and its effect on power
conSumpt Uon;
(iv)  increased agriculturall production; and
(v)  Covernment policy and economic program.
21. *The estinated growth varies by area from about ',j per annunm to
about 28g.  The highest growTth rate is predicted for the Freeway area
and reflects its potential industrial development.  The average annual
growth rate for the  Ionrovia Service Irea 1969-1951 is forecast at about
13.5%; and for MIonrovia Proper about 13.6<.  Excluding the major in-
dustrial loads (BIJC-3ong and LHC-Bomi Hills) the grow.Tth rate averages
about 1 5' whvich is about the growth rate assumed in the ID-ED Report
for Loan 684-LBR.
22.       Listed below are the forecast major load increases 1970-1972:

Industrial Loads
23.       Transmission requirements are significantly affected by the
magnitude and characteristics of industrial loads. In the past, the
larger mining companies and rubber concessions and otlher large industries
decided not to rely upon the small PUA system for relatively large
blocks of firm power and installed their own generating equipment. IMore
recently this policy has been continued by L.AMICO in connection with their

new pelletizing plant at Buchanan and by the oil refinery. Efforts by
PTA to firm up its system and to increase service reliability have
started to pay off. After a two-year trial period on a secondary basis
LMC has now contracted for primary supply of its total requirements, and
BMC has contracted to meet part of the load increase resulting from the
installation of a pelletizing plant. Firestone is also now purchasing
its requirements from PUA on a firm basis.
24.       In a few years, LMC may transfer operations to a new mine
close to the present location where a pelletizing and benefication plant
if installed may add up to 20 MIW of primary load to the PUA system.
Serious steps towards establishing a new iron ore and bauxite develop-
ment are now being taken. A concession has been granted and explorations
conducted since early 1968. The project known as the Wiologisi develop-
ment is located about 110 miles north of Bomi Hills and will include
(a) harbor and port development at Robertsport; (b) a 200 mile railroad;
and (c) a large iron mine and probably a pelletizing and benefication
plant at Robertsport. The development of Robertsport i1ll then follow
the lines of Buchanan and the residential and commercial load will in-
crease substantially.
25.       Recent legislation makes it mandatory that PUA be given the
option of supplying the power requirements of all new mining and other
industrial concessions. PUA therefore has an incentive to continue to
maintain a high degree of service continuity and reliability. Such
new loads are not included in the load forecast as summarized in the
attached Table, however in planning future transmission requirements
consideration was given to the possible size and location of these
potential loads.

REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA

Design Criteria
A. TRANSMISSION
Objectives
1.        To ensure an abundant supply of power in the most economical
manner, sufficiently in advance of demand to permit sustained and accelerated
growth.
2.        To provide power in the system where it is needed from central
generating stations. Growth of load for the Monrovia system can be forecast
much more accurately than local growth in a particular part of it. With
local generation, the cost incurred by misplacing capacity due to a change
in local plans could be considerable. With a central plant, the power can
be delivered where and when it is required, provided the transmission system
is properly designed.
3.        To supply loads reliably and economically under normal and emer-
gency conditions without overload and with adequate voltage regulation.
In the case of PUA, special attention must be given to the quality of
service, which is of major importance in attracting large industrial con-
sumers,
4s.       To give consideration to potential mining and other large indus-
trial developments. Such loads are: Bomi Hill area; Wologisi Mountain
Range about 110 miles north of Bomi Hills; and the National Iron Ore Company
(NIOC) on the Mano River some 49 miles west of Bomi. NIOC may require
power to replace the output of old diesel units.
EIcisting System
5.        The existing 69 kV transmission system is briefly described in
Annex 3 and shown in Annexes 9 and 10. For the long 69 kV radial lines,
due to the high incidence of thunderstorms, continuity of service is
maintained after temporary faults by automatic reclosure of all 69 kV
breakers. With the growth of PUA's load, increased reliability from
permanent faults can be obtained by establishing wherever possible, a two-
line supply to a main center of load.



ANNEX 12
Page 2 of 12 pages
Future Development
6.        The plan recommended utilizes a dual voltage transmission system,
namely at 69 kV and 138 kV. The 138 kV bulk transmission system will
overlie the existing 69 kV network and interconnects future generating
stations. The supply to Monrovia proper will remain at 69 kV. A looped
69 kV supply is recommended by PUA's consultants.  The 138 kV system will
be established at Paynesville, Bushrod, and on the Freeway. The outlying
areas of Kakata, Bong, Robertsfield, Careysburg and LMC-Bomi will be supplied
at 138 kV, and a 138 kV substation will be established at Mt. Coffee. This
system is shown in Annex 11. These proposals will need to be assessed
periodically as patterns of generation and demand develop.
7.        Specifically, the plan recommended cal'ls for the establishNent
of 138 kV transmissi-in between the following centers of load and generation:
Mt. Coffee-Freeway
Mt. Coffee-Gareysburg (VOA)
Mt. Coffee-Bong
Bong-Kakata
Kakata-Careysburg (VQA)
Freeway-Paynesville
Freeway-Bushrod
Bushrod-LMC (Bomi)
Paynesville-Robertsfield
Robertsfield-Kakata
-Mt. Coffee-Freeway and Freeway-Bushrod would be double-circuit steel
tower line. All other lines would be of single-circuit HI-frame construc-
tion. The system is sufficiently flexible to accomodate possible changes
in the location of future thermal plants. It is difficult to determine
when 138 kV transmission should be introduced. About 1977 has been assumed,
when the system load will be about 130 MA and Mt. Coffee will have an
installed capacity of about 85 MW,
8.        Extension of supply to the llologisi Mines and to the secondary
centers of Gbarnga, Zorzor and Voinjama (total load 60 MI) is envisaged.
It was found that a voltage of 138 kV would adequately supply these
remote loads, and would also adequately serve the requirements of the
Monrovia system. Development of the system should permit a higher trans-
mission voltage within the next 10-15 years.
9.        In the initial stage of development of the 69 kV transmission in
Monrovia proper, the Krutown, Newport and Capitol substations will be looped,
but the supply to them will be radial from Bushrod. The Capitol-Congotown
tie will be operated open to avoid paralleling the Bushrod-Paynesville
transmission. In subsequent stages, with the establishment of new 69 kV
substations, a second "radial loop" could be established from Paynesville
and/or from the Freeway 138 kV substation when 138/69 kV autotransforming
is established there.



ANNEX 12
Page - of 12 pages
Development in 1971-1976
10.       This stage extends to immediately prior to the installation of
the fifth unit at Mt. Coffee. Generating capacity would comprise-
Four 17 MW hydro units at Mt. Coffee; and
Five 15 MW gas-turbine units
in accordance with the plan discussed in Report No. PU-38a, Annex 3.  The
following transmission facilities have been recommended for construction
by PUA's consultants:
(i) Caldwell Jct-Mt. Coffee (10.3 miles, 69 kV);
(ii)  Freeway Jot-Bushrod (3.o miles, 69 kV);
(iii)  IMt. Coffee-VOA (11.0 miles, 138 kV single-circuit initially
operated at 69 kV forming part of the Mt. Coffee-VOA-Kakata-
Bong loop);
(iv)  Kakata-Bong (22 miles, 138 kV single-circuit initially
operated at 69 kV completing the Mt. Coffee-Voa-Kakata-
Bong loop);
(v)  Krutown-Newport-Capitol (2.6 miles, 69 kV underground
cable to supply the new Newport substation and establish-
ing a 69 kV loop Bushrod-Capitol-Newport-Krutown);
(vi)  Capitol_Congotown (4.o miles, 69 kV);
(vii)  Kakata-Totota (38 miles, 138 kV single-circuit initially
operated at 69 kV forming part of a possible extension to
Gbarnga);
(viii) Bushrod-Kle-LMC-Bomi (39 miles, 138 kV single-circuit); and
(ix)  Mt. Coffee-Bong (35 miles, 138 kV single-circuit initially
operated at 69 kV).
11.       The development of a looped system from the existing radial
system will achieve greater security and continuity of service. Generating
stations have been assumed to be at Bushrod (existing), Mt. Coffee (existing),
and Paynesville (new). Generation at Paynesville is favorably located with
respect to load and will provide voltage support at the eastern end of
Monrovia.  Fuel can be easily and inexpensively obtained from the refinery
nearby.

B. DISTRIBUTION
13.       To determine distribution requirements, consideration was given
to the existing system, the load growth and the nature of the projected
load in each area.
14.       Conversion to an underground distribution system in the down-
towm and Capitol areas of Monrovia is recommended by the consultants
because load densities warrant this type of system. The 1971-1981 mileage
requirements were found by plotting on a map the necessary feeders and
laterals over the existing system.
15.       The total length of distribution lines required in 1971-1981
is estimated at about 625 miles; 200 miles are three-phase and 425 miles
single-phase lines. About 20 miles of three-phase 12.5 kV and 43 miles
of single-phase 7.2 kV distribution line per year will be needed through-
out the period, their estimated total cost being about US$5.7 million.
16.       Corrosion problems in the coastal areas dictate the use of
aluminum conductors. The size recommended for 12.5 kV conductor is AAAC,
336.4 MCM capable of carrying 515 amps (11 MVA) and may carry up to about
13 MVA. The size recommended for 7.2 kV conductor is 3/0, 195.7 MCM.
Distribution Transformers
17.       A ratio of connected distribution transformer kVA to system
demand has been assumed at 1.88 for Monrovia and vicinity and 2.0 for the
outlying areas. Transformers are in three categories:
(i)  Pole type without taps              5 -   100 kVA
(ii)  Conventional pole type            167 -   500 kVA
(iii)  Pad mounted                     1,000 - 1,500 kVA
18.       Investment requirements 1971-1981 are estimated at US$3.6 million
(excluding requirements of the downtown and Capitol areas 1974-1981, which
would be converted to underground distribution commencing in 1974).



ANNEX 12
Page b of 12 pages
Proposed Underground Distribution System
19.       The consultants recommend an underground distribution system
for the downtown area of Mlonrovia by 1981. Design should be started
immediately and construction started in 1974. The consultants' reasons
for this recommendation are as follows:
(i)  Load densities for the downtown area by 1981 will be
23 MVA/sq mi and for the Capitol area 1h.6 MVA/sq mi.
Some sections already have load densities of 20-30 MVA/
sq mi.  To serve such densities many poles will have
to carry more than two primary feeders. Consequently it
will become physically difficult to meet increased loads
as lines with more than two feeders present an unsafe
and unreliable operating condition;
(ii)  interconnecting the distribution system into a network
provides for greater reliability and better voltage
regulation. This can be accomplished by an underground
network by initially building spot networks which will
agree and fit into a complete network plan; and
(iii)  for safety reasons the open wire lines must be put under-
ground or on higher poles. In a high-rise area the pole
solution is expensive and unsightly. In Monrovia,
buildings are usually completed one story at a time with
overhanging balconies. These balconies often protrude
well beyond the building line thus reducing wire clearance.
In high-rise areas overhead lines will present a serious
hazard for fire fighters.
20.       Total installed costs of establishing an underground system for the
period 1974-1981 is about US$8.5 million.
Service Connection Requirements
21.       The cost of service connections are estimated at about US$88/
connection. In establishing these costs, construction of new dwellings to
meet population growth has been assumed at the rate of 5 occupants/dwelling.
The table below shows the requirements:
Year        Population         New Services
1970         395,928
1971         404,828              1,780

ANNEX 12
Page 7 of 12 pages
Conversion of the 2.4 kIV System
22.       Some sections in downtown Monrovia are still served by a 2.4 kV
delta system. 1969 total coincident peak load served was about 5,320 KVA.
This represented about 25% of the Monrovia "propert' load extending from
Bushrod to Congotown.
23.       PUA has been gradually and systematically converting the fringe
areas to 12.5 kV operation. This conversion shortens the 2.4 kV feeders,
thus improving voltage regulation and reducing losses and further reducing
the loading in the 12.5/2.4 kV substations.
24.       Ecisting pole structure and cross-arms lend themselves to the
use of 12.5 kV provided conductor cross-sections remain unchanged. The
same feeder operated at 12.5 kV would have 5.2 more load capability than
when operating at 2.4. This additional feeder capacity should be more
than adequate to supply primary capacity to the district until the pro-
posed underground system can be brought into service.
25.       There is no economical solution to supplying the normal growth
in this district other than by voltage conversion.
Standardization of Service Voltages
26.       The service voltages utilized by PUA are discussed in Annex 3.
The consumer can install wiring and use equipment for only one voltage
rating; it is therefore difficult for him to obtain any new equipment
or repair parts without special orders. By using so many voltages, PUA
has multiple secondaries and in many instances two transformer banks on
the same pole connected for different secondary voltages,thus increasing
capital investment.
27.       The consultants recommend the following voltages:
(i)  Single-phase service areas: 120/2h0 V, 3-wire with
secondary neutral being the common neutral of the
high-tension system; and
(ii)  three-phase and single-phase service: 120/208 Y,
4-wire with neutral of the wye being the common
neutral of the high-tension system.
28.       Consumers requiring over 100 kVA of capacity should not be
served at secondary voltages. Such customers should be served from the
12.5 kV system. In this case the customer should furnish his own trans-
formation and distributing equipment according to PUA rate schedules and
choose any suitable voltage for utilization provided his transformer
connections are compatible with PUA's system.

60/12 5 kV Substation Deve1o2ment
29.       All substation equipment now in service, which has proper rating
and interrupting capacity, will be fully utilized to its useful life in
the expansion of the system. Transformers and switchgear will be trans-
ferred from stations where larger capacities are needed to other stations.
Flexibility and lower costs dictate the use of outdoor type substation
equipment.  This method permits advanced procurement and local stocking
to speed up "in-service" dates for increasing capacity and facilities.
30.       A standard substation'has been developed for the Monrovia area,
but outlying areas wi,ll have modified versions.
Standard Substation Design
31.       This design consists of:
(i)  A single high-tension bus;
(ii)  a minimum of two transformers;
(iii)  a single low-tension bus for each transformer with bus-tie
and isolating switches for disconnecting the transformer
from the bus;
(iv)  tie switches between adjacent feeders to permit isolation
of individual 12.5 kV feeder breakers for inspection or
maintenance;
(v) 6 - 12.5 kV feeders with a normal capability of 6 - 7 MVA/
feeder and a short-time overload capability of about 10 IVA;
(vi)  use of high-tension fuse protection rather than high and
low-tension breakers to reduce costs; arcing or large type
fault pressure relays are provided on each transformer
which, when operative, trip both line breakers to isolate
the station from the 69 kV system;
(vii) line breakers are provided to isolate any faulted line
section of the loop;



ANNEX 12
Page   of 12 pages
(viii)  12.5 kV feeders are radial.  Non directional overcurrent
phase and ground relays are provided on each feeder breaker;
(ix) each low-tension bus is provided with a single-phase
station service transformer to supply transformer cooling
equipment, battery chargers, breaker pneumatic closing
system, breaker spring changing systems, station lighting,
etc.;
(x) integrating kWh and KVARh meters with 30 minute demand
registers for each feeder in the low-tension side of each
transformer; and
(xi) a switched capacitor bank for each low-tension bus for
voltage regulation and bus power factor improvement.
32.       Transformers
(i) Monrovia and vicinity
4 three-phase transformers         7.5/9.4 MVA; or
2 three-phase transformers        12/16/20 MVA
It was found that the most economic solution for Monrovia
consists of the installation of 2, three-phase transformers
with a rating of 12/20 ]4WA. This calls for the addition of
transformer capacity at all existing 69/12r5 kV substations
and the establishment in 1972 of a new substation at Newport.
Towards the end of the period under consideration, it is
proposed to establish new 69/12.5 kV substations at Sinkor
and in the Freewiay area. The requirement for a new sub-
station at Newport is dictated by the relatively high
density in the downtown area and the substantial capacity
shortage in this area. This new substation will become
the nucleus for the underground 12.5 kV system.
(ii) Outlying Areas. Whenever possible, transformers removed
from substations in the downtowin area would be transferred
to substations in outlying areas. The substations would be
similar in design with the exception that no 69 kV line
breakers are provided.  A new 69/12.5 kV substation would
be established at Totota. The VOA substation will be re-
established in 1971 using 5 IVA transformers presently
located at the Bong Mines. This substation will serve the
VOA load and Careysburg.

Period September 1, 1969 - August 31, 1970
1.        This Annex summarizes a typical year of operation.  Four
Liberian Ehgineers work directly under thie Distribution Manager
(Sanderson & Porter, Management Team) and have the following respon-
sibilities:
(i) Make sketches for new service connections;
(ii) make reports on street lights and substation loads;
(iii)  assume technical responsibility during the absence of the
distribution manager; and
(iv)  plan and inspect work carried out.
2.        For the period under review, service application statistics
are summarized below:

overloaded.
9.        Street Lights.  160 new street lights were installed and 100
repaired during the period.  Of the 1,056 street light units installed,
473 are unmetered and 82 street light units were out of service. Ehergy
consumption for this purpose totalled 2,432,052 kWh for the period.

Conclusions
11.       In the period under review 1,241 new service connections were
made raising the number of consumers from 13,759 to 15,000. Maintenance
work was unduly high, indicating the overleaded state of the distribution
system.  Rehabilitation and improvements to the system should free
maintenance crews for expansion work, thus increasing the efficiency of
PUA's operations.

ANNEX 19
Page 1 of 3 pages
REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
PUBLIC UTILITIES AUTHORITY (PUA)
Explanation of Bases for
Financial Projections   71-76
Sales
1.        Sales forecast has been prepared for each of five consumer
categories and for each of 16 conveniently divided areas served by PUA.
The details are shown in Annexes 6 and 7.
Revenue per kwh
2.        Revenue per kWh by consumer category was first estimated at
existing tariff rates. For residential consumers it is assumed to decline
gradually from 4.140/klh in 1970 to 3.93¢/kwh in 1976.  The decline is due
to larger increase in consumption by existing consumers at progressively
lower price per kW.h which is offset only in part by new consumers using
little electricity at higher prices per kIIh. For the Government, the
rate is assumed to remain constant at its 1970 level of 3.750/kWh. Street
lighting is assumed to remain constant at the 1970 level of 4.50/kWh.
Revenue per kWh from commercial consumers is expected to decline gradually
as a result of an improvement in load factor. Revenue per kTWTh from indus-
trial mines is expected to increase from the present rate of 1.20/kWh
to 1.250/kWh in 1972 due to fuel price adjustment provided for in the con-
tract, rising further to 1.31/klNh in 1973 due to a higher rate to be
negotiated with one of the mines for an additional 10 FE%T of load to be
connected at that time.
Gross Operating Revenues
3.        Gross operating revenues at the existing tariffs have been
obtained by multiplying sales to each consumer category and corresponding
revenue per kwilh as estimated above. The revenues were subsequently in-
creased by 16% as of July 1, 1971 to take account of the expected tariff
increase.
Cost of Operations
4.        Cost of operations was estimated by keeping in view (a) sales,
(b) commissioning schedule for new equipment and (c) the fact that hydro
generating plant will be available seasonally. The forecast is based on
the combined best judgement of the mission and expert staff of PUA. The
forecast has been made in detail, e.g. operating expenses as shown in the
income statement are the sum of 19 individually forecasted items, main-
tenance expenses include 23 items and administrative and general includes
14 items. Two items, namely Fuel and Uncollectable Accounts have been



ANNEX 19
Page 2 of 3 pages
shown separately to emphasize their unusual importance in this case.  The
forecast for sensitive items, e.g. labor, use of consultants, maintenance
of overhead lines and transformers, operating expenses for generating
plant, etc. is based on latest information available to the mission while
the rest of the items are in some cases no more than extension of past
experience of PUA. Labor wages are assumed to increase at 6% a year.
Operating and Maintenance FEcpenses
5.        Operating expenses include cost of labor and expenses incurred
in the general supervision and direction of operation of generation,
transmission and distribution facilities. Fuel is not included and is
discussed separately. Total operating eypenses for 1970 amounted to
$199,000 of which generation accounted for $87,000 or 44%, transmission
for $10,000 or 5  and distribution for $102,000 or 51%.  An important
assumption relates to the commissioning of new generating units (Annex 8)
which in turn determines staff needed to operate them. The expenses for
the three types of activities are expected to remain in roughly the same
proportion throughout the forecast period. The total is proJected to
increase to $l43,00o  in 1976 or ih% a year.
6.        Maintenance expenses include the cost of labor and expenses in-
curred in the supervision and carrying out of maintenance of generation,
transmission and distribution facilities.  In 1970,out of total maintenance
expenses of $525,000, generation accounted for $200,000 or 38%, trans-
mission for $51,000 or 10%, and distribution for $273,000 or 52%.  The
maintenance expenses for generation in 1979 were relatively large because
they included the purchase and expensing of a large qu-ntity of spare parts;
these are consequently estimated to increase to only $282,000 by 1976.
Maintenance of distribution facilities, in particular that of overhead
lines, underground lines and transformers is expected to remain the
important expenditure item especially until 1974 when rehabilitation will
be completed. Maintenance of distribution is expected to amount to
$456,ooo or 54% of the total maintenance expenditure in 1976. The yearly
increase is estimated to be 8.4%.
Fuel
7.        PUA currently obtains fuel at 9.17¢/gallon.  There are two
types of pressures to increase the price - (i) capital and current costs
of the refinery have turned out to be much higher than anticipated and
(ii) recently negotiated oil contracts between oil-producing countries
and oil companies. The refinery would like to obtain about a 20% price
increase immediately for the first reason. The increase due to the new
oil contracts is expected to be 7% to 10% a year between late 1971 and
1975. PUA is expected to successfully resist any major price change
associated with the first reason but is not expected to resist an
increase associated with the second reason. Keeping the uncertainties



ANNEX 19
Page 3 of 3 pages
in mind and in order to be particularly conservative as far as 1972-73
(years of low cash) are concerned, an average price increase of 30% effec-
tive July 1, 1971 is assumed. It may be noted that if the increase at
any time turned out to be even higher, at least a part of the increased
cost will be passed on to industrial consumers under the fuel adjustment
clause.
Administration and General Expenses
8.        Administration and General Eapenses include the cost of overall
management, customer accounting, collection activities, sales activities
and maintenance of offices. Uncollectable accounts have been separated
and treated below. Out of the total administration and general expenses
of $761,000 in 1970, customer records (IBM computer), meter reading and
other collection expenses accounted for $153,000 or 20%0; management con-
sultants accounted for $186,000 or 2h%; and property insurance (self and
commercial) accounted for $90,000 or 12%. Several smaller items accounted
for the rest. Customer accounts expenses are gradually expected to increase
to $262,000 by 1976. Expenses for management consultants are expected to
increase to $210,000 by 1972 but then to decline to $170,000 by 1976 as
the dependency on expatriate management is reduced. Property insurance
is estimated to cost tl4O1,000 by 1976 in order to keep the coverage
cormmernsurate with the expansion of assets. Total administration and
general expenses are expected to increase to $1,060,0C0 by 1976, which
amounts to a 5.7% increase per year.
Uncollectable Accounts
9.        Yearly collections as a percentage of the amount billed for the
past several years have improved from 67% in 1963 to 88.9% in 1968 and to
90%0 in 1970. The collections are assumed to be aDproximately 91% in 1971,
91.6% in 1972, 92.2% in 1973, 92.3% in 1974 and 93.2% in 1975 and 1976.
The remaining amounts are assumed to be u-ncollectable in each year.
Accounts Receivable (net)
10.       Accounts receivable shown in the Balance Sheet are net of reserve
for bad debts. These amounted to $2,166 million in 1970 or 32% of total
billing in that year. Even after accounting for those who are not expected
to pay, there are others who will pay late which is the cause of the increase
in accounts receivable.  These are estimated to improve to 30% of sales
in 1971, 28% in 1972 and 1973, 26% in 1971 and 1975 and 23% in 1976.
