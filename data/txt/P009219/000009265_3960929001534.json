Structural Adjustment Loan\n            Project aims at achieving sustained and efficient economic\n            growth while reducing inflation and improving external\n            creditworthiness. The loan supports reforms that will\n            correct relative price distortions, increase competition,\n            improve mobility of resources and promote efficiency in an\n            environment based on a competitive market. Measures\n            implemented include: (a) setting real interest rates at\n            positive levels; (b) establishing a market for foreign\n            exchange; and (c) liberalizing the foreign trade and\n            domestic pricing regimes. Other reforms, embarked upon, but\n            requiring a longer implementation period include: (a)\n            tightening financial discipline in the enterprise and\n            banking sectors; (b) improving the process of selection of\n            investment projects; (c) supporting the expansion of private\n            sector and small- and medium-scale enterprises and\n            rehabilitation of viable enterprises facing financial\n            difficulties while weeding out chronic loss makers; (d)\n            strengthening the central banking function of the National\n            Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY) while establishing banks as\n            independent, shareholding entities; and (e) mitigating the\n            social and productive disruptions which can accompany\n            structural adjustment of the economy."}, "docdt": "1990-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
