of the Second\n            Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) Project for Yugoslavia was\n            not released and the loan closed on September 30, 1991, six\n            months after the original closing date. At that time the\n            remaining balance was canceled. The government was unable to\n            ensure that the National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY) would act\n            as an autonomous institution in full control of monetary\n            policy. The lessons learned from this project contained a\n            comprehensive list of structural measures and was intended\n            to be implemented along with a strong IMF stabilization\n            program. Though the complete dissolution of the country\n            could not have been predicted, perhaps the riskiness of the\n            loan was underestimated."}, "docdt": "1997-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
