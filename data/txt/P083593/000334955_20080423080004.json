in\n            the Montreal protocol, the World Bank agreed to help the\n            country develop a MB Phase - out plan. Some of the negative\n            impacts of the project are as follows: (i) soil treatment\n            with chemicals nematicides/fungicides effect directly and\n            indirectly to human health and causing chemical\n            contamination in soil, air and under ground water; (ii) soil\n            treatment with copper sulphate leaving residue of heavy\n            metal in the soil, causing contamination of products and\n            causing chemical pollution of soil, air and under ground\n            water; (iii) regular spray with fungicides effect directly\n            and indirectly to human health and causing chemical\n            pollution of soil, air and under ground water; and (iv) soil\n            fumigation with MB causing depletion of Ozone. The\n            mitigation measures are as follows: (i) development of pest\n            control standards and hygiene requirements for storage\n            facilities; (ii) training for MB users; (iii) training of\n            local technicians and farmers; and (iv) termiticide products\n            used by certified pest control operators."}, "docdt": "2008-04-17T00:00:00Z"}
