                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is in the late stage of implementation. Progress made towards reducing CFC, Halon and Methyl Bromide (MB) consumption have been measured and reported annually.
                         All agreed phase-out targets for the past years have been met according to the Agreement between the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund Executive Committee and the
                         Government of Vietnam. As of March 2014, the project has already achieved 90% of the CFC/Halon/MB phase-out targeted, equivalent to approximately 2,725,000 tons CO2 of
                         avoided annual emissions.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The updated Plant Protection Law was approved by the National Assembly in November 2013 as expected in which requirements for MB phase-outwere added. The PPD is leading
                         revision of the existing Circular 03/2013/TT-BNNPTNT to include a ban on MB use in non-QPS applications as of January 1, 2015. It is expected that the revised circular will be
                         issued by Dec. 31, 2014 when the project ends. An ICR mission will be carried out along with the next supervision mission for the HCFC Phaseout Project Stage I scheduled in Sept.
