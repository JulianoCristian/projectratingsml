                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to make good progress towards its Global Environmental Objectives. The Project has two main sub-projects: CFC/Halon Phaseout sub-project and Methyl
                         Bromide (MB) Phaseout sub-project. The CFC/Halon sub-project (US$ 1,260,000) was completed in 2010 and all phase-out targets have been met. By January 1, 2010, a total of
                         319.4 ODP tons of ODSs (CFCs, Halon and CTC) has been phased out under the project. The Methyl Bromide sub-project (US$ 1,098,284), which was added in 2008, is under
                         implementation and progressing well. A total of 15.2 ODP tons of Methyl Bromide has been phased out by January 1, 2012. Methyl Bromide is expected to be completely phased out
                         by January 1, 2015.
