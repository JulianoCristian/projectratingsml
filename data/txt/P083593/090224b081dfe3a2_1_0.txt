                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has two main components: CFC/Halon Phaseout component and Methyl Bromide component. The CFC/Halon component was completed in 2010 and all phase-out
                         targets have been met. The Methyl Bromide component is under implementation and progressing well with most project activities completed. Remaining activities consisting of
                         training workshops for fumigation companies, storage facility owners/operators, farmers and local technicians on the proper use of methyl bromide alternatives are scheduled in 2013
                         and 2014.

                         As methyl bromide has been a very effective, wide spectrum fumigant and no one fumigant with similar properties is available, it will be a continued challenge to identify and promote
                         alternative methods. The project therefore emphasizes several policy adjustments, development and implementation of a resistance management strategy and capacity building for
                         key stakeholders to create conditions more amenable to sustained methyl bromide phase-out.
