                         The project objective is to assist Vietnam in phasing out its consumption of ODSs (CFC 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115, halon 1211, 1301 and 2402, 1,1,1-
                         trichloroethane, and CTC) in accordance with Vietnam's agreement with the MP in a timely and cost-effective manner.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) and Halon Phase-out Sub-Project has completed satisfactorily with full disbursement and successful achievement of Vietnam#s commitments to the
                         Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. As of 1 January 2010, Vietnam has achieved the target of consuming zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) tons/year
                         of CFCs, halon, methyl chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride. Vietnam has also banned the import of these substances. The Inter-Ministerial Circular No. 14/2005/TTLT-BTM-BTNMT
                         issued on 11 July 2005 by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and Ministry of Trade stipulates that import quota for those substances is zero from 1 January 2010.
                         The Methyl Bromide Phase-out Sub-project was added to the project GA in 2008 and is nearly at the half waypoint of implementation. In 2010 Vietnam consumed less methyl
                         bromide than even the agreed target (metric tons (or 76 ODP tonnes) versus the target of 133 metric tons or 80 ODP tonnes).
