Implementation Status and Key Decisions

All project activities are completed and all agreed Montreal Protocol ODS targets have been met, although final validation of data for one ODS
(methyl bromide) is still pending. At closing, the project will have helped Vietnam to completely phase out consumption of CFCs, halons, CTCs, and
methyl bromide at a total of 344 metric tons per year. In addition, the ODS eliminated is equivalent to about 2.5 million tons of avoided carbon
dioxide emissions per year.
