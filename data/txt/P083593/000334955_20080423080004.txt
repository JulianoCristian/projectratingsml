Pest management plan (PMP) for Methyl Bromide 
 
Executive Summary 
 
Methyl Bromide (MB) is a broad spectrum chemical used to control pests in the soil, 
commodities and structures. MB has been identified as an ozone depleting substance (ODS) 
controlled under Annex E of the Montreal Protocol. The protocol established a multilateral 
fund to provide technical and economic support for developing countries to phase-out these 
substances.  To assist the Government of Vietnam to phase out methyl bromide consumption 
for non-Quarantine and Pre-Shipment applications in accordance with the schedule stipulated 
in the Montreal Protocol, the World Bank agreed to help the country develop a MB Phase 
–
out plan at a total cost of US$1,098,284. However, since MB has been highly effective in 
controlling a wide spectrum of pests, alternatives will have to be identified for the various 
uses of methyl bromide in Vietnam. Fortunately, there are a number of very effective 
alternatives that enable the government to achieve the stated objectives. The selected 
alternative pest control measures need to be effective, practically feasible, economically 
affordable and environmentally sound.   
 
The project is preparing a Pest Management Plan (PMP) to deal with pest management issues 
for the various uses of methyl bromide (soil, commodities and structures). This will help the 
project meet the World Bank Operational Policy ) objectives on Environmental Assessment 
(OP 4.01) and on Pest Management (OP 4.09 and BP 4.01 Annex C). This comprehensive 
PMP outlines the various elements and actions needed to be taken to adequately address pest 
management concerns during project implementation.  
 
Methyl bromide use in Vietnam is classified in four major applications: (i) pre-harvest 
applications; (ii) post-harvest applications; (iii) structural fumigation; and (iii) Quarantine and 
Pre-Shipment applications.  This PMP will not address methyl bromide use or its potential 
alternatives for QPS applications as this is still allowed under Montreal Protocol. 
 
Methyl bromide has recently been introduced for soil fumigation in Vietnam. Such 
applications are still limited to few highland provinces producing crops dedicated to the 
export market (i.e. Lam Dong, Dong Nai, Ho Chi Minh City). The major crops relying on soil 
fumigation include strawberries, peppers, flowers, tobacco, vegetables and other high value 
crops, mainly for export to Australia, Japan and Taiwan.   
 
Demonstrations and training on IPM approaches for pre- and post-harvest applications will be 
conducted, focusing on farmers and licensed fumigators. Farmers will be trained in pest and 
storage management using the Farmer Field School (FFS) and Training of Trainers TOT) 
methods. A more targeted approach will be used for training the licensed fumigators as their 
interest will be on chemical control and more specifically the use of alternative fumigants.  
Field and storage demonstrations will focus mainly on Integrated Pest/Crop Management in 
pre-harvest applications and on storage pest management for farmers and export ccompany 
staff. 
The use of MB and all other fumigants in Vietnam are strictly controlled and regulated by the 
government. Their use is restricted to licensed fumigation companies.  Relevant legal 
documents are regularly updated (see annex 3)

I. Introduction
:
Despite the fact that Methyl Bromide (MB) is an Ozone Depleting substance 
(ODS), controlled under Annex E of the Montreal Protocol, it has been contributing to the 
protection against many pests including insects, weeds, bacteria, nematodes, etc. To assist the 
Government of Vietnam to completely phase out its consumption for non-QPS application in 
accordance with the phase 
–
out schedule stipulated in the Montreal Protocol, the World Bank  
agreed to support the country US$1,098,284 from Multilateral Fund to set up a MB Phase – 
out plan and to look for safer alternatives. However, since MB is highly effective to control 
pests, proposed alternatives need to be very effective to enable the achievement of phase-out 
objectives. To address those concerns the Government of Vietnam will need to find 
alternative pest control measures that are effective, practically feasible, economically 
affordable and environmentally sound.  These alternative pest control measures will need to 
be in compliance with the World Bank Operational Policies on Environmental Assessment 
(OP 4.01) and on Pest Management (OP 4.09 and BP 4.01 Annex C).  
 
To meet the safeguard policy objectives, the project is preparing a Pest Management Plan 
(PMP) as required under BP 4.01 annex C and OP 4.09.. This comprehensive PMP outlines 
the various elements and actions needed to be taken to adequately address those above 
concerns during the project implementation.  
 
II. Content of PMP: 
In order to successfully develop a plan for an effective and 
environmentally sound application of alternative pest management practices during project 
implementation, the PMP will include 5 major sections: (1). pest management approaches; 
(2). pesticide use and management; (3). policy, regulatory framework and institutional 
capacity; and (4). monitoring and evaluation and (5) cost estimates  
 
II.1. Pest management approaches 
II.1.1. Current and anticipated problems, relevant to the use of MB 
 
Methyl bromide use in Vietnam could be classified in four major applications: (i) pre-harvest 
applications; (ii) post-harvest applications; (iii) structural fumigation; and (iii) QPS 
applications.  In this PMP, we do not intend to provide detailed description of methyl bromide 
use and its alternative for QPS applications as this is still allowed by the Montreal Protocol. 
 
i. Problems related to Pre-Harvest applications of MB. 
 
Methyl bromide has recently been introduced in Vietnam for soil fumigation.  Applications of 
methyl bromide for soil fumigation are still concentrating in a few provinces in the highland 
areas such as Lam Dong, Dong Nai, Ho Chi Minh City as these provinces are the production 
centers of agricultural products for the export market. Major crops cultivated in these areas 
include strawberries, peppers, flowers, tobacco, vegetables and other high value crops for the 
export market, mainly Australia and Japan.   
 
Foreseeing the potential of the international markets, the growers approach is to invest in new 
and high technologies to improve production and quality of the products in order to meet the 
international quality standards. The intensive horticulture and agriculture in Dalat and other 
areas are facing many obstacles from soil borne insects, diseases, nematodes and weeds due to 
a
reliance on monoculture with inadequate crop rotations. Conventionally, crop rotation 
between dry crops and paddy rice is considered as the most effective practice in reducing soil 
borne pests and diseases. However this method seems less practical in the intensive 
monoculture and recent socioeconomic development.  
 
Page  5
4
In addition, the intensive monoculture of few crops over large areas has favored the 
propagation of certain soil borne pest species. The rapid turnover of of arable land has no free 
time for proper field sanitation. Hence, soil borne pests can accumulate in the soil for many 
seasons. This practice has provided favorable conditions for the spread of soil borne 
pathogens, insect pests and most of all nematodes. In addition, the same crops lead to the use 
of the same pesticides over an extended period of time, resulting in the development of 
resistance to major classes of chemical pesticides. Consequently, crop losses due to 
agricultural pest and diseases have increased proportionally to the number of field seasons 
using the same practice.  
 
Soil borne pests are very varied and range from weeds, insect pests, fungi, bacteria to 
nematodes. Soil fumigation is perceived as a very attractive practice as it can target this wide 
spectrum of pests.Soil borne diseases and insect pests can be found in any arable area, from 
the wet fields to dry fields. However the more diversity in their composition and more severe 
damage can be expected in the dry fields. Host plants may range widely from short season 
vegetable such as leaf vegetables, potatoes, legumes to flowers, from annual industrial crops 
such as soybean, peanut and tobacco to perennial industrial crops such as tea, coffee and 
pepper, from fruit trees such as strawberry, citrus, rambutan and durian to forestry plants.    
 
Soil borne insects
:
Many insect pests spend part or their full life cycle in the soil and feed on 
plant roots and stems, for instance larvae of black cutworm 
Agrotis
 sp., flea beetle 
Phyllotreta
 
sp., some cricket species in Gryllidae family and others. Other insects such as termite and ant 
may cause soil degradation and loss of the large cultivated areas.  
 
Soil borne diseases:
Soil serves as medium as well as storage for many plant pathogens 
including fungi and bacteria. Soil borne fungi can cause serious crop losses. According to 
uncompleted record from scientists, the most important groups of soil borne fungi include 
Fusarium
 sp., 
Pythium
 sp., 
Phytophthora
 sp., 
Rhizoctonia
 sp., 
Cylindrocladium
 sp., 
Sclerotium
 sp., 
Rhizoctonia
,
sp., 
Sclerotinia
 sp. and 
Aspergillus
 sp. Some of them stay in the 
soil and cause root and stem rot and subsequently wilting or rotting of the crops. Early 
infestation in the seedling stage or beginning of transplanting may cause entire loss of the 
crops. Some fungi may also affect the upper part of the crops e.g. 
Phytophthora
 sp. causing 
up to 30-40% crop yield loss. 
 
Nowadays, the most common diseases found in the vegetable cultivated areas in Da Lat were 
bacterial soft rot of cabbage caused by 
Erwinia
 sp., root rot of crucifer vegetable, tomatoes, 
cucumbers and others caused by 
Pythium
 sp., 
Rhizotonia
 sp. The club-root diseases of 
cabbage caused by fungus 
Plasmodiophora
 
brassicae
 has become a severe problem in all 
cabbage areas in Da Lat.  About 60% of cabbage in infected field has been destroyed.  
 
Soil is also the storage for many plant bacteria, of which the most important is 
Ralstonia 
solanacearum
.
This bacterium can infect plants at any stage and cause heavy loss. Once 
infected, plants can not be rescued since at present no effective bactericide is available. 
Bacterium can spread very fast all over the field from the first infestation site with water flow. 
 
Soil born nematodes
:
Nematode is the most important pest group among soil borne pests. The 
most common nematode family that attack varied crops in Vietnam is root-knot nematode 
Meloidogyne
 sp. They feed, parasite and multiply inside plant roots affecting nutrition uptake. 
Infected plants tend to appear stunted with discolored leaves, giving very low yields. Heavy 
infestation may destroy all the root system and cause the death of the plant. The tiny size and 
hidden feeding behavior of nematode in general and root knot nematode in particular make 
them among the most difficult agricultural pests to diagnose and control. Root knot nematode 
Page  6
5
attacks a wide range of host plants from coffee, pepper, tobacco, legumes and vegetables to 
flowers and others. For instance, after 2-3 years intensive monoculture of carrot, all the fields 
have been severely infested by nematode with more than 80% crop yield loss. Thousands 
hectares of coffee plantations have been destroyed from 2003 to 2005 caused by 
Meloidogyne
 
sp. and 
Pratylenchus
 sp. in Gia Lai, Dak Lak and Lam Dong provinces. The injury caused by 
nematode on the root system opens the path for infestation of other micro-organisms (i.e. 
viruses, bacteria or fungi).  
 
Similar to the intensive monoculture in Da Lat and other districts in Lam Dong province, 
intensive vegetable production in Southern and Northern provinces surrounding Ho Chi Minh 
and Hanoi city have also been facing serious soilborne pathogen, insect and nematode 
infestations. After a few years of specialized vegetable production, the effects of nematodes 
and soil borne diseases caused by 
Rhizoctonia
 sp., 
Pythium 
sp. and 
Sclerotium 
sp. have 
increased significantly. Other insects and animal pests such as stripped flea beetles 
Phyllotreta
 sp., snails and ants have been found causing substantially damage to plants.  
 
ii. Problems related to Post-Harvest applications of MB  
 
Based on historical data, the biggest MB users in Vietnam are the fumigation companies 
providing services for rice, maize, cassava and coffee industries for human and animal food. 
These commodities may be stored in bulk, in silos of various sizes, or in bags. The storage 
time is generally short, ranging from 2-5 months. Up to date, there has been 110 insect species 
detected in stores. Among them, 25 species are beneficial, 43 species are insect pests. But

Although the damage caused by storage insects is considerable, there has been a little 
systematic surveillance or monitoring of losses in each commodity. It is estimated that about 
20% loss is due to insect damage during storage.

iii. Problems related to structural fumigation
 
with MB. 
Beside storage insects, termite is the major target requiring treatment in construction. It was 
reported that there are several termite species causing damage to structures, but 
Coptotermes 
formosanus
 Shairakai and 
Odontotermes
 sp. are considered as the most important. Their 
damage is more likely related to infestation and termite source in the soil and organic matters 
under the structure. However, it is certain that termite treatment is necessary for any new 
construction as well as for dam and dyke protection.  
 
iv. Potential change in pest problems that can be anticipated as a result 
of the project’s 
activities
:
MB is only one method of pest control and experience has proved that no single 
method could achieve high and complete control of pests.   In some cases, MB and other 
fumigants must be integrated with management techniques (i.e. physical, cultural, biological, 
etc..). For example, after soil fumigation with MB, farmers in Dalat still need to have further 
foliage spraying with fungicides to control leaf diseases during crop growth. The project is 
opting for an IPM approach to avoid relying on a single control method that might lead to 
outbreaks of certain pests 
as result of the project’s activities. Development of resistance as a 
result of selective pressure using narrow spectrum chemical insecticides may lead to an 
outbreak of primary pests.  Or a control method might give excellent control of a target pest 
but lead to an outbreak in secondary pests.   
 
II.1.2. Current and proposed pest management practices: 
i. For soil born pest control at pre-harvest: 
 
a. Current practices
:
Although soilborne pests can cause big problems to agricultural 
production, there has been very few effective control methods being developed in Vietnam. 
The widespread of IPM training programmes in food crops and vegetables in 1990s have 
successfully introduced to farmers the concept of integrated crop, pest and disease 
management and production of safe and healthy products. However, soil borne diseases and 
insect pests and nematodes have been well addressed. The success of IPM program in crop 
production of this period has focused more on the control of aerial pathogens and pests but 
not the soil borne pest agents. 
 
The recent increasing awareness of soil borne pests and the requirement of sustainable 
agricultural production have called for the use of IPM for the control of these pest groups. 
Growers have recognized that no single method can bring high effectiveness to control soil 
borne pests. The IPM approach includes proper prevention (cultural practices, resistant 
varieties..etc.) and intervention practices (chemical and biological treatments). Currently, 
growers in Lamdong and other provinces can apply a series of non-chemical control measures 
to prevent infestation and reduce damage of soil borne pests. That may include: (1). Soil 
tillage and disinfection before planting by deep plowing of the soil and disinfection by 
broadcasting powdered lime before cropping; (2). Plowing the soil after harvesting and 
maintaining as fallow for 1 to 2 crop seasons to break the cycle of pests and  soil pathogens; 
(3). Soil mulch with plastic sheet by covering soil beds with plastic sheets combined with 
Page  8
7
control of irrigation has some effect (solarization treatment) in control of weeds and soil 
borne diseases and nematodes; (4). Rotating upland crops, with paddy rice, to suppress the 
incidence of soil borne diseases, insect pests and nematodes; (5). Substitution of infested soil 
surface by a new soil layer  (6). Biological control with emphasis on biopesticides use.  
 
Though physical and IPM methods have been recommended for successful control of soil 
borne pests, chemical pesticides still remain indispensable for their ease of application, 
convenience and effectiveness. At the areas that are historically infected with nematodes or 
are at a higher risk of infestation, all growers have to treat soil with some nematicide products 
such as Ethoprophos  (Mocap 10G), Cytokinin (Sincosin), Carbofuran (Furadan), Carbosulfan 
(Marshal  3G; 5G); and Dazomet (Basamid) after utilization of different above preventive 
methods like soil plowing and disinfection, mulching with plastic sheet, plowing soil loose, 
top soil change/substitution or crop rotation. 
 
As opposed to the effects of nematicides, the disinfection of land with chemical fungicides 
before planting has low efficacy due to the number and complex combination of pathogens. 
More over, fungal spores persist in the soil for long time. Their time for incubation and 
germination are different. Thus the treatment of soil surface with fungicides has to be timely 
by broad spectrum action fungicides. Some fungicides have been recommended for soil 
treatment including Metalaxyl (Viroxyl 58 BTN ), Iprodion (Cantox D 50WP) , Pencycuron 
(Moren 25WP) and Copper sulfate. Most of chemical fungicides are being used for leaf 
spraying from the nursery to fully grown crops. The advantage of chemical control method is 
the low cost, high efficacy, convenience and ease of application in large scale. However, 
some chemicals can be costly, and potentially harmful to human health and the environment.  
 
Cost of current practices for control of soil borne pests
:
The cost of current practices is 
summarized in table 2. In general, the cost varied from 16 to 1,500USD/ ha depending on the 
technique and level of pest infection. The cheapest control is chemical nematicides and 
fungicides and the most expensive is change/substitution of top soil surface. In all cases, the 
cost for pest control is far cheaper compared to MB use.  
 
Environmental  impacts
:
Except the negative impacts of chemicals directly to user’s health 
and indirectly to consumers through pesticides residue from products, there has been no 
reports or evidence of environmental impacts of current practices to control soil borne pests in 
Vietnam. The potential advantages and environmental impacts of each technique are also 
summarized in table 2. 
b. Proposed practices
:
While there were a few individual alternatives that have already been 
introduced in Vietnam, none was, however, found providing as effective against a wide range 
of soilborne pests as MB.   It is evident that to eliminate MB in soil fumigation applications a 
method using a combination of various techniques (i.e., IPM) is preferable.  Alternatives have 
to be developed and selected to ensure their high efficacies but reasonable price, easy to apply 
and safe to the implementers and environment. Based on recent research findings in Vietnam 
and successful alternatives selected from other countries, 5 major techniques including: (1). 
Steaming; (2). Soil solarization; (3). Bio-fumigation ; (4). Chemical fungicide (5 Botanical 
nematicide (Saponil) will be selected for single use or integration application. These 
techniques may be integrated into 3 alternative options: (1).soil solarization with plastic much 
+
fungicides + Nematicides; (2). Bio-fumigation + fungicides + Nematicides; and (3). soiless 
culture for nursery production.  
 
Cost of proposed practices for control of soil borne pests
:
The cost of alternative techniques 
range from 80 to 3,670USD/ ha depending on the scope of application, level of pest infection 
Page  9
8
and requirement of control level (see more detail in table 3). Those costs are far cheaper 
compared to MB use (5,000-7,000USD/ ha). 
 
Environmental impacts
:
Except the negative impacts of chemicals as mentioned above, the 
proposed practices will bring no negative impact to the environment. The new approach of 
using biofumigation with organic matter proposed in the project is a good practice for 
sustainable environment protection and soil fertility. Possible advantages and environmental 
impacts of each technique are also summarized in table 3. 
 
In conclusion, though MB can bring high efficacy to control soil borne pests, the replacement 
with current and new techniques would ensure the protection of agricultural production from 
pest damage with economic and environmental sustainability due to lower cost than MB and 
environmental impacts.     
 
ii. Pest control in storage: 
 
a. Current practices
:
In order to minimize losses caused by storage insects, it is necessary to 
have integrated management. However, unlike with field conditions, it is not easy to develop 
efficient IPM practices for storage pests. Up to date, there are only a few conventional non-
chemical control methods being applied to minimize the density and damage of storage 
insects including: (1). storage hygiene before being filled with commodities by physical 
cleaning and chemical treatment; (2). regular surveillance for in - time treatment when 
required; (3). physical control: cold treatment, heat disinfection treatment, adjusting CO2 
concentration; (4). manual control such as screening; and (5) use of botanical insecticides 
liked Guchuang Jing (GCJ). 
 
Due to the improper design of most storage facilities, the efficacy of non-chemical control 
methods is rather low. Chemical control is considered the most effective and hence more 
popular with farmers and storage managers. Up to date, there are three groups of chemicals 
used for insect control in stores in Vietnam. They are: (1). chemicals for spraying such as: 
DDVP 50%, Sumithion 50EC, Actellic 50EC; (2). Fumigants including MB and Phosphine.   
 
Cost of proposed practices for store treatment: 
The cost for current store treatment practices 
depends on technologies. It may range from 0.2-0.82 USD/ m
3
as summarized in table 2. 
 
Environmental impacts
:
The most important impacts of current practices are ozone depletion 
caused by MB. For other methods, no evident of impact except the trouble when collecting 
waste after fumigated with Phosphine since it is easy to make flame and explosion. More 
over, Phosphine may corrode copper and electronic equipments and causing pest resistance 
(table 2). 
 
DDVP (Dichlorvos) is toxic to fish and aquatic arthropods. It is highly toxic to birds and to 
honeybees. DDVP is included in the list substances whose discharge is dangerous to water. It 
is also in WHO Class Ib (highly toxic, not allowed under Bank’s Procurement and Safeguards 
Policies) 
 
b. Proposed practices
:
For alternative of MB use, a series of techniques including current and 
new ones have been determined. They include:  Aluminum phosphide fumigation with 
recirculation system; Magnesium phosphide fumigation with recirculation system, Inbound - 
Aluminum phosphide with automatic pellet dispensers; Carbon dioxide fumigation; and 
integrated pest management.  
 
Page  10
9
The cost of those alternative techniques varied from 0.2- 10USD/ m
3
.
Although Magnesium 
phosphide fumigation with recirculation system, Inbound - Aluminum phosphide with 
automatic pellet dispensers are more advanced than Aluminum phosphide, their cost is much 
more higher for large scale application. The most costly sound methods are Aluminum 
phosphide and Carbon dioxide fumigation.  
 
Environment impacts
:
The impacts of proposed practices are referred in table 3. Except 
impacts of Phosphine as mentioned above, there are no impacts caused by other proposed 
practices to environment. 
 
iii. Pest control for structure
:
a. Current practices: 
 
Chemical control and fumigation are more popular and effective methods with the use of MB 
as fumigant and some of systematic insecticide such as Fipronil and Chlopyrifos Ethyl for 
construction treatment and DDVP, Sumithion and Athelic for store hygiene.  
 
Cost of current practices:
 
The cost of current practices is highly dependent on the treatment 
materials and sites as summarized in table 2.  
 
Environmental impacts
:
Both MB and chemicals used for construction treatment may cause 
negative impact to environment. The impact of MB has been referred to before. For other 
treatment with pesticides, beside the consequence of pest resistance, pesticides may all cause 
pollution and contamination of air, surface and underground water in case of leaching to air 
and soil. 
 
b. Proposed practices: 
There will have no change of proposed practices to control store pests.  
The best control methods presently used for termites rely on 2 types of chemicals: (i) Insect 
Growth Regulators usually dispensed in Bait Systems and (ii) Liquid Termiticides, either 
repellents or Toxicants  (See comparative table in Annex)

foliage spraying cost to control diseases). 
2.  *: including the cost of foliage  spraying to control disease after applying soil 
treatment 
Among those pest control measures, some are under testing and hopefully can be used as 
alternatives for MB: 
 
(1). Inbound - Aluminum phosphide with automatic pellet dispenser
:
through an FAO 
funded project (1979 
–
1984, 1985 – 1990), two enterprises in Vietnam has already tested and 
have been equipped with dispenser equipment.  The recommended alternative to MB for 
fumigation of concrete silos is also aluminum phosphide.  However, the suggested method for 
distributing phosphine in this type of fumigations are automatic aluminum phosphide 
dispensers.  These devices dispense aluminum phosphide directly into the grain stream, 
allowing for even distribution of the aluminum phosphide formulation throughout the 
concrete silos.  Presently, dispensers are used only in a few facilities in Vietnam for 
fumigation of inbound grains like wheat, maize and rice. Concrete silos are roughly 30 meters 
tall, hold approximately 2,000 tones of grain and can be completely filled in 6-10 hours.  
Automatic pellet dispensers are especially designed for this type fumigation.  The phosphine 
pellets or tablets that are dropped in the grain flow turn in to hydrogen phosphide within 2 to 
6
hours under the climate conditions in Vietnam.  If the grain temperatures are higher than 
30° C, the pellets will dissipate even faster.  By using this efficient method of fumigating 
inbound ingredients, the need for MB fumigations will be eliminated later in the storage 
process.  Pellet dispensers are portable and can be moved from one bin to another.  Machines 
typically weigh approximately 30 kg, with a hopper capacity hopper of 2 kg of aluminum 
phosphide pellets or tablets.  This capacity is sufficient to fumigate (at least) one concrete silo. 
Experience is available. 
 
(2). 
 
Carbon dioxide fumigation: 
Carbon dioxide (CO
2
)
is also under testing for using to 
disinfest stacks of processed grain in Vietnam.  This process takes 7 to 21 days on average, 
but it is difficult to achieve high mortality under the best conditions.  CO
2
is potentially more 
dangerous to use and requires specialized equipment for detection and monitoring.  Special 
nylon sheeting is required to hold the inert gas during the long fumigation periods.   
Carbon dioxide a level of 380 ppm is listed as an approved organic technique for fumigating 
bagged commodities.  Carbon dioxide has a specific gravity of 44, which means it is light and 
can penetrate readily into a mass of commodity like bagged grain.  It is highly toxic at 
Page  15
14
concentrations of 40-60% (400,000 - 600,000 ppm).  CO
2
dehydrates insects and causes death 
by desiccation 
 
iv. National service aimed at providing fumigation management advices/ service
:
Fumigation takes an important role especially in store and structure treatment. To undertake 
this action, fumigation companies must register with PPD for their service. At present, there 
are 42 companies granted fumigation practice certificates in which 14 companies considered 
fumigation companies for import and export commodities.  All of these companies can supply 
any fumigation service except importation of MB. Up to date, there are 6 companies are 
regular importers including Vietnam Termite Control and Fumigation Joint-Stock Company, 
Vina Control, Fumigation and Inspection Company, Cafe Control, Vietnam Inspection and 
Fumigation Joint-Stock Company, Hanoi Commodity Inspection Joint-Stock Company.  
 
In framework of Government management, PPD is assigned by Gov. to manage the 
fumigation service. To facilitate and manage the activity, various regulations and legal 
document have been promulgated such as the Ordinance No. 36/2001/PL-UBTVQH10 on 
Plant Protection and Quarantine, the Decree No. 58/2002/ND-CP on plant protection, 
regulation on plant quarantine, and regulation on pesticides control; the Plant Quarantine 
Regulation stipulates duties and authorities of plant quarantine offices/ bodies and article 
owners in monitoring, prevention and elimination of quarantine pests, of articles that may be 
infested with quarantine pests, of articles for import, export or for transportation out of the 
areas infested with quarantine pests, the regulation on Pesticide Management determines all 
legal requirements as per export and import of pesticides in and out of Vietnam, the decision 
No. 84/2002/QD-BNN published on 24
th
 September 2002 empowers PPD with authorities to 
establish procedures for granting fumigation practice certificates. There are some updates on 
legal document: The Decree No 02/2007/ND-CP on Plant Quarantine issued by Government 
dated 5 Jan, 2007 will replace the Regulation on Plant Quarantine issued following the Decree 
No. 58/2002/ND-CP; (see Annex 2) 
 
II.1. 3. Relevant IPM experience within project area, country, region
:
Under the assistance 
of FAO, the IPM program started developing in Vietnam in 1992 to address the problem of 
pest control and over use of chemical pesticides. Up to date, there have been 6 IPM programs 
being implemented under the funding of various international and national organizations 
including: (1). community IPM program from 1992 
–
2002
with total budget of 4.6 mill USD 
funded by Norway through FAO as a counterpart; (2). DANIDA support to maintain the 
national IPM program from 2000-2007 with total budget of 8.5 mill. USD; (3). International 
program for development of IPM on vegetables in Vietnam and Southeast Asia from 1996-
2000 with total budget of 644 thousand USD; (4). Community conservation and development 
of plant genome from 2002-2004 with the total budget of 360,000 USD from BUCAP; (5). 
introduction of GAP guideline on citrus through IPM program funded by AusAid through 
Western Sydney University with total budget of 290,000USD from 2007 to 2009; and (6). 
research on development of IPM techniques on vegetable for Mekong area funded by Norway 
from 2005-2007 with total funding of 76,000USD. The major achievements of IPM programs 
in Vietnam is raising awareness and enhancing capacity of both technicians and farmers of 
IPM and ICM, thus they can apply integrated methods for sustainable pest control and 
reducing up to 60 – 80% of insecticides for rice pest control compared to before IPM program 
deployment. Through different training methods such as  training of trainers (TOT), farmer 
field school (FFS), community IPM, IPM club, farmer researches, etc., the national IPM  
program has trained 1,054,150 farmer house holds of rice, vegetable, legume, cotton and tea 
Page  16
15
production areas including some hot spots of project such as Lamdong, Dongnai and 
Tiengiang Province.  
 
Although there has been no specific IPM techniques developed for soil borne pest control and  
post harvests treatment up to date, farmers all have trained in IPM concepts and principles 
through joining IPM program or mass media, so that they can easily adopt new IPM 
techniques. Whereas there has been no IPM program currently deploying in the country, 
lessons learned from previous programs can be utilized to conduct project activities. 
Therefore, even in the cases of no available funding for IPM program, some of technical 
support have been supplied to research institutions to focus on development of IPM package 
with emphasis in physical (trapping, using of pheromone, protein bait etc.) and biological 
control approaches (releasing of bio-agents, development and application of new bio/ 
botanical pesticides etc.). The subject of soil borne pest control is also attracting the research 
of scientists from various Institutions/ Universities; for example the research programs for 
botanical nematicides development, development of bio-fungicides with mixture of different 
micro organisms and organic agents, development of multifunctional biological fertilizer 
against nematodes, application of antagonistic fungi to control soil borne diseases etc. 
conducted by National Institute of Plant Protection, Southern Institute for Agriculture 
Science, Can Tho University.  
 
II.1.4. Recommendation for adjustment of proposed pest management approaches where 
necessary 
 
It is believed that techniques selected as alternatives, have been successfully applied in 
Vietnam or other countries, the predictable risks of pest control is only in cases pests 
resistance to chemical fumigants/ Nematicides. To avoid this problem, the project has selected 
various methods or combination of methods such as rotation of chemical pesticides, 
combination of  CO
2
for store fumigation and IPM package for storage pest control or the use 
of steam (heat treatment), biofungicides and botanical nematicides for nematode and fungal 
pathogen control.  
 
The development of pest resistance to pesticide or an outbreak of secondary pests may require 
the project to adjust few activities to address these specific issues.  
 
II.2. Pesticide use and management  
 
II.2.1. Present, proposed and/ or envisage pesticide use: 
Although there have been various 
methods of pests control at pre and post harvest as well as structural treatment, pesticides are 
still considered as most effective methods and widely applied for pre-harvest control, store 
hygiene and termites control. The pesticides may include chemical, botanical and biological 
to control all target pests such as insect, disease, weeds, nematodes, termite, rat, bird etc.  
·
For pre-harvest application
:
Up to date, the use of pesticides to control soil borne 
nematodes and diseases is the easiest, most feasible, cheapest and effective method. 
The cost of chemical for soil treatment may be ranged from 55 
–
95USD for whole 
crop season only depended on the crops and pesticide quality. Furthermore, there are  
numerous chemical pesticides currently commercialized in Vietnam and in other 
countries for selection, as shown in table 4. However, due to the narrow spectrum, and 
improper application methods, pesticides often lose efficacy causing the resistance of 
pests. In those cases, growers often increase the dosage and frequency of application. 
Consequently, higher cost is required but no efficacy improved. In order to overcome 
Page  17
16
those constraints, farmers now often apply pesticides in integrated system by using 
prevention /cultivation techniques such as: field sanitation; soil plowing and soil  
solarization with plastic much; crops rotation. Farmers also use lime or copper sulfate 
to disinfect the soil, rotate chemical pesticides or use biological pesticides. These 
integration methods help not only improving efficacy of pesticides leading to 
reduction of application but also overcoming resistance development of pests to 
pesticides. 
·
For store treatment:
 Chemical pesticide like Deltamethrin may be used to mix with 
botanical pesticides to reduce the dosage of application to delay the development of 
pest resistance to pesticide. 
·
For structure treatment:
 Pesticides are mainly used for storage structural treatment 
before storing commodities. In this case, it is often integrated with other methods such 
as physical cleaning, screening or ventilation.

II.2.2. Type and quantity of pesticides envisaged to be financed by the project:  
 
According to the reports from consultant’s survey, the quantity of MB used for non-QPS in 
2004 is 142 tons, of which 37 tons is used for soil fumigation equivalent with 53ha land being 
fumigated, and 105 tons for store and structure fumigation. For alternative MB use, Vietnam 
needs to prepare enough pesticides for soil borne pest control and fumigation, that may 
include: 
1. For control of soil borne insect pests
:
it is necessary to prepare a quantity of 12.72 
tons of  pesticides for covering 53ha, requiring 68,900 - 169,600USD. This data is based on 
an average number of spraying up to 10 times (1 time for soil treatment and 9 times of foliage 
spraying) and  200,000 – 500,000VND (equal with 13 – 32 USD) is required for one spray. 
That  includes:  
-
53
ha
x
1
soil treatment/ year x 15kg/ ha x 10 years  = 7.95 tons of granule 
pesticides 
-
53
ha x 9 foliage sprayings/ years x 1 kg/ ha x 10 years = 4.77 tons 
Total cost accounted by 130 – 320 USD/ ha/ year x 53 ha x 10 years = 68,900 – 
169,600USD.  
 
2. For storag and structure fumigation:
 a total of 105 tons MB x 7 years = 735 tons 
equivalent with 1,400 - 2,450 mill. m
3
store and structure, will be fumigated with Phosphines. 
With the dosage of 0.6-1.2g phosphine/ m
3
,
the quantity of phosphine required for 7 years will 
be 840 - 2,940 tons. Among them, about 40% imported from China with average price is 
6,000 USD/ tons, and 60% imported from other Europe countries with average price is 
18,000USD/ tons, the total money required for Phosphine importation will be from 11.088 
mill. - 38.808 mill. USD. This quantity of Phosphine will be imported and met by fumigation 
company through fumigation service.  
 
It is a fact the above quantity of both pesticides and phosphine is not a big amount and can be 
easily met by international and domestic markets. Moreover, the project has selected various 
pesticides for rotationally use. Therefore, there will be no increase of dependence on 
pesticides during the project implementation.  
 
II.2.3. Circumstance of pesticide use and the ability of end 
–
users to handle products 
within acceptable risk margin
:
the end-user of pesticides may be divided into three groups: 
 
Page  19
18
·
Fumigators
:
All the workers from 42 fumigators have been trained on fumigation 
techniques and safe use of pesticides. They have also been equipped with protective 
gear and are familiar with phosphine and other pesticides like Termidor, Actellic used 
in treatment of stores and structures.  
 
·
Pesticides suppliers
:
This group may have access to pesticides through commercial 
process. This activity now is under strict control of Plant protection inspector. Further 
more, all pesticide retailers have been well trained in handling, storing chemicals and 
in using protective gears handling pesticides. Also, the alternative pesticides 
considered are mainly of low to medium toxicity. This helps reduce the risks when 
dealing with this group of pesticides  
 
·
Farmers
:
Almost all pesticides introduced as alternative are low to medium toxicity 
and are familiar to farmers. Some are being used and some are new botanical/ 
biological pesticides. Through IPM and other training programs provided by pesticide 
company on proper and safe use of pesticides, knowledge of farmers in the safe use of 
pesticides has been improved. Thus they can handle and use pesticides with reduced 
risks to their health and environment. Furthermore, farmers do not need to store 
pesticides at home since they can be readily available at retailers, which will reduce 
the risks of accidental poisoning. 
 
II.2.4. Assessment of risk
:
The potential risk of alternatives may come from storage, transportation and usage of all 
chemical pesticides, including phosphine. Since phosphine can corrode cooper and electronic 
equipment at high concentration (above 100ppm), it is important to carefully select the 
suitable equipment for transportation, storage, and targeted store when conducting fumigation 
.
Further more, phosphine is also a flammable and explosive product, humidity of product and 
store should be carefully monitored before conducting fumigation. The collection and 
disposal of remaining powder after fumigation also need to be carefully collected to avoid 
potential fire hazards or explosion.  These operations must all be performed by trained and 
licensed personel. 
 
The risk of other chemical pesticides may be divided in to 4 categories: 
 
·
Directly intoxicating users: This case may happen due to improper use of pesticide and 
shortage of protective gear 
·
Accidental spills or accidental use  
 
·
Indirect poisoning of consumers  exposed to food contaminated with pesticide 
residues.  
 
·
Environmental pollution: Pollution of surface and underground water, air, soil etc. 
may occur due to contamination, improper use and persistent toxic pesticides. 
 
To reduce those risks to environment and human health, the project’s activities should focus 
on following points:  
 
·
Strengthening training of technicians of fumigation companies and farmers to enhance 
their knowledge of proper use of pesticide to improve efficacy and protect human 
health.  
Page  20
19
·
Develop emergency response plans for each site according to guidance provided under 
annex 4. 
 
·
Assist PPD to establish the pest resistance control unit and setting a laboratory for 
early detecting of resistance and management 
 
·
Developing and selecting more effective, safe and economic techniques / products. 
 
II.2.5. Pre-requisites and/ or measures required to reduce specific risks associated with 
envisaged pesticide use under the project
:
In order to reduce specific risk associated with envisaged pesticide use under the project, a 
detail training program has been designed in project proposal aiming at improving capacity of 
fumigation companies in using of new alternatives for MB. In framework of the project, about 
800 technicians from 42 fumigation companies will be trained to ensure safe use of phosphine 
and new technologies/ chemical pesticides. In term of soil borne pest control, though farmers 
have been  well trained on safe use of pesticides through IPM and pesticides commercial 
promotion programs, the project will continue to provide special training courses to 300 local 
technicians and farmers on setting up demonstrations and using of new technologies such as: 
soil solarization, biofumigation, and safe use of pesticides.  
 
For safe handling of pesticide, PPD annually provide training course to pesticides agencies to 
update them with new regulations on production, formulation, transportation, packaging, 
storage of pesticide. The project will coordinate with training programs of PPD to raise 
awareness among pesticide agencies of techniques related to safe handling of new pesticides. 
 
II.3. Policy, regulatory framework and institutional capacity 
 
II.3.1. Policy on pesticide: 
Before1991, pesticides were freely purchased in Vietnam without 
registration and quality inspection system. From 1992, it was controlled by MARD through 
Plant Protection Decree which has been amended several times. The updated version, the 
Decree No. 58/2002/ND-CP, was issued by the Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam on June 3, 2002, to promulgate the regulation on plant protection, plant quarantine 
and pesticides management.  
 
Beside the Decree No. 58/2002/ND-CP, MARD has also promulgated and regularly amended 
the regulation on pesticide management which determines all legal requirements as per export 
and import of pesticides in and out of Vietnam.  The detailed legal requirements are stipulated 
in Decision No. 145/2002/QD-BNN.  The requirements involve detailed regulations on 
procedures for registration, production, formulating, re-packaging, export, import, trading, 
storage, transport, usage, disposal, labeling, seminars and advertisement of pesticides.  
According to this Decision, MARD is in charge of granting import licenses for restricted 
pesticides.  However, at end of 2005 MARD decided to authorize PPD to discharge this 
function on its behalf. 
 
MARD issues a list of pesticides permitted, restricted, and banned for use in Vietnam on an 
annual basis.  Methyl bromide, aluminum phosphide, and magnesium phosphide, are 
categorized as restricted pesticides in this list. 
Follow pesticide management regulation, all pesticides must be registed before 
commercialization in Vietnam. The procedure and duration of registration depends on the 
nature of pesticide, target crop and control pest. Normally, the registration should be 
processed in 2 years. Even though, in order to encourage the research development, 
Page  21
20
production and commercialization of safe and bio-pesticides, MARD agree to give priority to 
the registration of bio-pesticides with less than 6 months consideration. Furthermore, in case 
of necessary, MARD/ PPD may consider to authorize the exceptional importation for special 
use.  
 
Beside the registration scheme, the regulation also promulgates detailed articles related to 
production, formulation and distribution of pesticides. Follow it, all operations related to 
production, formulation and distribution of pesticide must be registed and controlled by PPD 
through inspection system. To get a license for production, formulation and distribution of 
pesticide, organizations/ companies or individuals must have a professional training certificate 
to ensure having good competence and knowledge in the above field. Up to date, there has 
been an exiting of accomplished licensing scheme for registration, distribution and using of 
pesticide from the central to locals. The regulation on local pesticide production and/ or 
formulation is also appropriately regulated. Thank to that, a strong system of pesticide 
formulation and distribution has been established enabling sufficiently meet pesticide 
consumption demand of the country. The pesticide need may be conveniently met through 
domestic development or importation from China, US and other Europe countries. 
 
II.
3.2. Country’s regulatory framework for control of the distribution and use of pesticide:  
 
1. 
Availability of trained inspector for pesticide control
:
To enforce its pesticide 
regulation, PPD has established its inspection network from the center to locals. The 
Inspection Board is entrusted to undertake regular and extraordinary inspection of 
conditions and whole schemes related to production, formulation, distribution and 
usage to ensure pesticide quality and proper use. To undertake this mission, inspectors 
from PPD and provincial sub-PPDs have been well trained on knowledge of 
professional inspection. During the inspection, inspectors may take samples for quality 
check which will be done by two Pesticide Quality Control Centers located in the 
North and South.  
 
2. 
Control of pesticide package and label
:
The issue of pesticide package and labeling 
has been also regulated in the 
Pesticide Management Regulation. 
Together with the 
pesticide promotion program,
 
pesticide companies are now paying more attention to 
the packing as a part of delivery system for convenient use and user safety. The use of 
bulk or mini bulk containers or small volume plastic bottles is suitable course for more 
convenient of farmers who have been still prevention of over dose usage. The move 
from liquid to granules and other formulations such as SP, SC, DF, ect. allows the use 
of simple bags or cartons for easy disposal. The design and content of labels are 
required by PPD  as compulsory documents for the registration process. The format 
and content of label is also controlled by PPD during deploying inspection. Therefore, 
all pesticides are properly packaged and labeled before and during releasing to the 
market. 
 
3. 
Measures to limit importation and usage of access to class II pesticides
:
The list of 
pesticides permitted to use in Vietnam is considered and renewed annually. During 
consideration, all pesticides belong to toxic group I may be stopped of using. They 
may be only considered as restricted to use in case of necessary/ or no effective 
alternatives available. With those pesticides, the license for commercialization and 
usage is issued only on a temporary basis. PPD will control the scope of usage and 
quantity imported. In case of necessary, PPD may consider approving an exceptional 
importation of high toxic pesticide for special and controllable use.  
 
Page  22
21
4. 
Quality control capacity
:
To strengthen capacities for enabling the monitoring of 
pesticide quality, the Government has invested its National budget to scale up two 
central laboratories belonged to Plant Protection Department (PPD) located in the 
North and South, by equipping them with more Gas chromatography (GC) units,  
High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrum 
chromatography. To strengthen the research capacity, the Government has agreed to 
set up one more laboratory at the National Institute of Plant Protection. So far, one GC 
and one HPLC have been installed and operated.  
 
Not only strengthening capacities for specific laboratories, the Government also funded an 
upgrade of other laboratories in order to make use of the untapped potential and capacity 
of other organizations. Other laboratories that offer pesticide quality control include the 
Institute of Post Harvest Technology, VINACONTROL, the National Central for 
measuring and Quality control.  
 
Besides upgrading equipment, the Government has mobilized supports from national and 
international cooperation projects for training of technicians to make them well 
undertaking control of pesticide quality.  
 
5. Availibility of poisoning statistic
:
The Government has assigned the Department of
 
Hygiene and food safety, under Ministry of Health to record all cases of pesticide poison 
through direct contact with pesticide application (both acute and chronic); pesticide 
contamination in food; and suicide.  Beside, MARD/ PPD regularly takes food samples to 
record level of pesticide contamination for warning and strengthening food safety control.  
 
6. Capacity of medical staff  to recognize and treat pesticide poisoning
:
During IPM and 
pesticide safe use training programs, symptoms of pesticide poison have been introduced 
to farmers and local medical staff. The guideline on first aid of pesticide poison is 
regulatory  being presented on pesticide label. The above training and information may 
enable local farmers and medical staff to perform first aid treatments. The continuous 
steps should be followed the professional instruction of Medical system. 
 
7. Disposal of obsolete pesticides
:
Obsolete pesticides may include those that are out of 
expiry date, non-registration, smuggled, inferior quality, and those banned for use in 
Vietnam. In framework of project activities, there may have contribution to the 
accumulation of obsolete pesticides from: (1). new pesticides imported for demonstration 
purpose but no longer use due to low efficacy/ negative impacts to environment/ or no 
registration process; (2). out of expiry date; (3). no longer  permitted to use due to annual 
renewal of pesticide list. Disposal of these pesticides must follow guidelines of  the 
Government number 64 regulating collection and disposal of obsolete pesticides. 
According to these guidelines, all sources of obsolete pesticides must be collected and 
properly disposed of by relevant or responsible organizations. In term of the project 
activities, the responsibility for disposal of obsolete pesticides will depend on the owner: 
 
·
In case they are maintained at pesticide agencies
:
the agencies will be responsible 
and pay for disposal fee;  
 
·
In case obsolete pesticides are under management of projects: the project can 
require assistance from the obsolete pesticides disposal program funded by 
Government; 
 
Page  23
22
·
In case obsolete pesticides are under management of farmers: farmer may request 
assistance from local PPSD to collect and dispose of such pesticides  with the 
support of the above program. 
 
Disposal of pesticides is only done by authorized/ permitted organizations 
 
II.3.3. Describe and assess all policy related to the restrictions of MB
:
The policy related to 
restriction of MB has been clearly manifested in the list of pesticide restricted to use in 
Vietnam. Follow it, MB importation and usage must be under control of PPD in both quantity 
and scope of usage regulated to other restricted pesticides. Further more, to strengthen the 
management of MB use when it is considered as special usage, MARD has issued the newest 
decision on Pesticide Management Regulation number 63/ 2007 QD - BNN dated 2 July, 
2007 by adding some of exceptional below terms specified for management of MB 
importation and usage: 
 
·
The importation of MB must follow any regulation to restricted pesticides and  
importer must have fumigation license. 
 
·
Importer must fully report to PPD the status of MB importation from previous year 
before applying for new importation license. 
 
·
MB is only sold to licensed fumigators.  
 
II.3.4. Institutional capacity for implementing IPM
:
As mentioned in II.1.3 part, the 
National IPM program has established an IPM network from the center to locals on the base 
of  IPM working group under PPSDs. This network has good capacity to conduct IPM 
activities such as training of farmers, setting up demonstrations and organizing 
propagandization within the local to raise farmer’s awareness of proper use of pesticides. 
Beside, there has been a research system developing researches on and providing techniques 
to IPM program. This is a strong network to implement IPM program on soil borne and store 
pest management.   
 
II.4. Strengthening of national capacities
:
All activities and components required funding 
from the project are delineated in the project proposal. However, to make it feasibility and 
successful deploy, the project need require Government and MARD supporting research 
institutions, through research projects, develop more effective and environment sound IPM 
packages for sustainable maintenance the success of project in future. More over, it is also 
necessary to facilitate pesticide and fumigation companies/ enterprises adopting new advance 
technologies for alternative of MB by giving them priority during accessing registration 
procedure and through financial encouragement policy (lower or free of tax etc.).
