FROM:  The President                                       June 7, 1982
TANZANIA - Proposed Amendment to the Urban Water Supply Project
(Loan No. 1354-TA of January 5, 1977)
Proposed Supplemental Credit
1.        I submit the following proposal for a supplemental credit of
SDR3.6 million (US$4.0 million equivalent) on standard terms to the United
Republic of Tanzania to help complete the Urban Water Supply Project in
Morogoro, for which the Bank made a loan of US$15.0 million (Loan 1354-TA)
on January 5, 1977.
The Project
2.        The project consists of the construction of a 1,650 meter long,
12 meter high earth dam across the Ngerengere River near Morogoro with a
tower intake, culvert and spillway, sufficient to retain 10 million m3 of
water at full capacity; the construction of production facilities,
including transmission pipelines, treatment and pumping stations, storage
reservoirs and reticulation extensions in Morogoro; provision of management
advisory services and vehicles to the Ministry of Water and Energy (MWE);
and a contribution to MWE's training program for the whole urban water
sector, consisting mainly of the expansion of training facilities at the
Water Resources Institute (WRI). The project is intended to satisfy
domestic water demand in Morogoro up to 1986 and to supply water to a newly
established industrial complex.
3.        The Borrower's performance under the project has generally been
good. The construction of water treatment facilities, pumping stations,
transmission pipelines and storage reservoirs has been substantially
completed. Establishment of a National Urban Water Authority (NUWA) which
is to own and operate major urban water supply systems in the country, as
an autonomous and financially self-sustaining entity, was approved by the
Parliament in April 1981. The Chairman and most of the directors of the
Board of NUWA have been appointed. The Government met the water tariff
tvvenant (which required maintenance of urban water rates at their July
1976 level in real terms) up to January 1981. Since then, the Government
has argued that further increases in water prices should be based on a
systematic nationwide study of the actual costs of producing and
distributing treated water in the urban areas. NUWA was established
primarily to permit improvements in urban water management (including more
efficient revenue collection at existing water prices), and the Government
regards these as more important in the next twelve months than adjustments
to water tariffs. Costs of supplying water may also have been over-
estimated. Various steps have been taken already to improve billing and



-2-
collection. Metering facilities are to be upgraded, financial deposits
will be required for major consumers and services will be disconnected more
systematically, when accounts are seriously overdue. As a result, the
Association has now agreed that a national study of urban water custs
should be carried out. The Government would commission consultants to
complete a water tariff study by April 30, 1983, in accordance with terms
of reference acceptable to the Association. The study would make specific
recommendations on the structure and levels of water charges to be borne by
various users, rnd these would be, implemented before June 30, 1983; the new
tariffs would be maintained at levels sufficient to cover at least the
maintenance and operating costs of urban water services, debt service on
borrowed funds and an adequate contribution to development costs in the
sector (Paragraph 4 of the draft Letter Amending the Loan Agreement). The
study would also recommend longer term econlomic and financial objectives
for water pricing and reassess the current uniform national pricing
system. The study is being financed by SIDA.
4.        Implementation of the project, however, has been dominated by the
poor performance of the main civil works contractor. After being given
several opportunities to improve his performance, the contractor was
dismissed in August 1981. The Government has since completed negotiations,
and signed a contract, with the bidder evaluated as second lowest at the
time of the original award (see paragraph 10 below).
Original Financing Plan
5.        The estimated total cost of the project when it was approved was
TSh160 million (US$19.2 million) including estimated duties and taxes of
US$0.7 million. Approximately TSh78.5 million (US$9.5 million) or 49% of
the cost was to be in foreign exchange. Physical contingencies of 15% were
added, except for the construction costs of the Morogoro dam where con-
tingencies of 20% were added because rock excavation costs were more
uncertain. Price contingencies totalled about 19%. The Bank loan of
US$15.0 million was to finance 81% of total project costs net of taxes -
100% (US$9.5 million) of the foreign exchange costs and, 61% (US$5.5
million) of local costs. The Government was to provide the remaining
US$4.2 million which included the US$0.7 million in taxes. The project was
expected to be completed on June 30, 1980 and the Loan Closing Date was
June 30, 1981.
Revised Project Costs
6.        The current project cost is now estimated at US$34.5 million, 80%
over the appraisal estimate of US$19.2 million, which reflects the new
civil works contractor's bid price for completing the dam and assumes
deletion of the WRI component of the loan (see paragraph 7). About half of
this cost increase is due to the poor performance of the original dam
contractor and the extended implementation period for the project. The
other half of the increase results from a substantial underestimation of
dam construction costs at appraisal. The appraisal team based its
estimates on recent contract awards for similar work in Tanzania and
neighboring countries at the time. However, an unforeseen escalation in
construction costs and the small number of bids received, led to a contract



-3-
price in 1978 which was more than twice the appraisal estimate. A
breakdown of the cost overrun by item is given below. (Further details are
provided in Annex I.)

Proposed Financing Plan
7.        Owing to the cost increase, the foreign exchange component of
completing the dam is now estimated at about US$11.0 million. About US$3.8
million undisbursed under the loan would be utilized for the dam'; an
additional US$7.2 million in foreign exchange is, therefore, required.
The Government sought additional financing for the project during annual
consultations with bilateral agencies over the period November 1981 - April
1982 and through specific approaches to donors with a previous involvement
in the water sector. Attempts were also made to reallocate external funds,
already earmarked for the sector, to completing investments at Morogoro.
These efforts, assisted by the Association, have not yet proved successful;
however, they will be continued during the second half of 1982e To permit
work on the project to be resumed, the Government has requested that the
Association provide supplemental funds to cover US$4.0 million (about 55%)
of the foreign exchange shortfall on the project. The Government would
provide the remaining US$3.2 million in foreign exchange, if necessary, and
meet the full local costs of the project from its own resources. The
burden of the financing plan on the Government will be substantial,
especially if it is unable to identify additional foreign funds; however,
further delays in civil works would add to total costs and complicate
project completion. It is hence considered necessary to proceed on the
basis of the current financing plan, despite the difficulties which this
implies for the Government.
1/ Part of this amount, allocated for training and expansion of the Water
Resources Institute (WRI) would be reallocated for completion of the
dam. Major disbursements for the training component have not yet
started, and the urgency of the original investments in WRI has now
been reduced by provision of training assistance from other sources.



-4-
Justification
8.        We have advised the Government in the past that it is not the
policy of the Association to finance cost increases in projects, except in
very special circumstances. We have also reminded the Tanzanians of their
obligation unider the Loan Agreement to complete the Urban Water Supply
Project. However, following unsuccessful efforts to identify alternative
financing for the project, the Government has requested that an exception
be made to Association policy regarding supplementary financing, for the
following reasons. First, with our encouragament, the Government has been
consolidating its public investment program; in particular, it is now
emphasizing the completion of existing projects and the rehabilitation of
existing productive facilities and infrastructure. We support the
Government's revised strategy and have attempted to focus new Bank Group
lending on restructuring and rehabilitation work necessary for general
economic recovery. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning
and Economic Affairs have examined the case for cancelling or completing
the Morogoro project and have concluded firmly that it deserves high
priority, even in a much constrained development budget. We agree with
this conclusion. Second, the Government's foreign exchange position
remains very strained. While lower oil prices have brought some relief
during the last six months, export earnings remain depressed and import
allocations ar; well below the minimum necessary for adequate maintenance
and operation of key facilities in the economy. Without supplementary
ftnancing from external sources, the Morogoro Project would almost
certainly not be completed. Third, the consequences of not completing the
project would be most damaging.    The new Morogoro water system is now
operating at about 20% of design capacity and, without completion of the
dam, water supply to the town as well as to the newly established
industrial complex would continue to be severely curtailed. Investments of
approximately US$250 million have been made in the Morogoro area on the
assumption that water supply would be substantially increased. These
investments include three other Bank loans (1385-TA, 1386-TA and 1607-TA)
and one IDA credit (833-TA) amounting to US$68 million. The industries
most affected by water shortages would be a tannery, canvas mill and
textile plant. While these industries currently face other constraints,
such as scarce imported suipplies, they would be permanently handicapped
without access to additional water. Completion of the project is hence
essential for ensuring adequate infrastructure for these enterprises.
9.        In the light of these considerations, and Tanzania's particular
circumstances, we believe the Government's request for supplementary
financing should be granted, on an exceptional basis.
Procurement and Disbursement
10.       The proceeds of the proposed credit would be used exclusively to
finance completion of the dam. The new contractor is a Canadian firm (MBL
International Contractors Inc.), based in Windsor, Ontario, with previous
experience in major civil works in Tanzania. MBL was the second lowest
evaluated bidder at the time of the original contract award in Decem1er
1978. The contract between the Government and MBL has been reviewed and



-5-
approved by the Bank. The credit would be fully disbursed by December 31,
1984 and applied to 50 percent of total expenditures for civil works. The
Closing Date of the existing Loan will be postponed to permit completion of
disbursements and closure of the loan account prior to withdrawing the
proceeds of the proposed credit.
Legal Instruments and Authority
11.       The draft Amendments to the Loan Agreement dated January 5, 1977
between the United Republic of Tanzania and the Bank, the draft Development
Credit Agreement (Urban Water Supply Project - Supplementary Financing) and
the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d)
of the Articles of Agreement of the Association are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
12.       I am satisfied that the proposed supplemental credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
Recommendation
13.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
supplemental credit in the amount of SDR3.6 Million (US$4.0 million
equivalent) .
