technical assistance\n            to CFP and small-scale industrialists.  Under the credit\n            component of the project, firms borrowing from CFP would\n            construct new or improve existing industrial facilities - or\n            purchase plants in selected industrial parks - and acquire\n            machinery, equipment and spare parts.  They would also\n            obtain permanent working capital to build up stocks of raw\n            materials and supplies.  Under the technical assistance\n            component, consulting services will be furnished to CFP to\n            help coordinate and monitor technical assistance to small-\n            and medium-scale industry at the regional level, to review\n            CFP's organization and make recommendations for\n            strengthening its regional offices, and also to carry out a\n            feasibility study on ways to mobilize additional financial resources."}, "docdt": "1984-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
