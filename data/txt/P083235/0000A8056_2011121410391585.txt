                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Within the context of the country's longer-term interests in disaster hazard mitigation, the development objective of the proposed Disaster Hazard Mitigation
                         Project (DHMP) is to: (i) minimize the exposure of humans, livestock, and riverine flora and fauna to radionuclides associated with abandoned uranium mine
                         tailings and waste rock dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area;(ii) improve the effectiveness of emergency management and response by national and sub-national
                         authorities and local communities to disaster situations; and (iii) reduce the loss of life and property in key landslide areas of the country. These objectives will
                         be accomplished through key mitigation measures designed to: (i) isolate and protect abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps from
                         disturbance by natural processes such as landslides and floods, and from leaching and dispersal processes associated with ground- and surface-water
                         drainage; isolate long-standing hazards and prevent their disturbance; (ii) create an effective disaster management and response system; and (iii) develop a
                         system to detect and warn against active landslide movements in about 20 key hazard areas.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project's objective of Component 1, reducing the potential risk of exposure to Uranium and other radioactive substances for human population, livestock and ecosystems in
                         Mailuu Suu has been substantially achieved. During the last 6 months about 80% of radioactive tailings stored atTailings Management Facility (TMF) 03 (which is at significant
                         landslide risk) have been relocated to a safe repository built on the footprint of the existing TMF 06. In a similar manner about 65% of the remaining radioactive waste rock at Waste

                         Dump (WD) 01 have been relocated to the safely engineered dump site at WD 02. Designs for the safe, sustainable closure of both TMF 03/18 and WD01 are currently being
                         prepared, including the final cleanup goals, allowable residual radiation levels and long term stable cover systems.
                         Component 2 (Disaster Preparedness and Monitoring) has suffered severe setbacks, as the landslide monitoring systems financed and installed by the project have become
                         dysfunctional due to vandalism and theft. Within the remaining project period a low cost , low tech approach for landslide monitoring and early warning will be conceptualized and -
                         given full community support and ownership - designed, installed and handed over to the communities for operation and maintenance.

                         Additional Financing (AF) of US$ 1 million was approved by the World Bank's Board of Directors on June 9, 2011 and has become effective on 20 November 2011. The AF is crucial
                         to deal with additional quantities of waste rock discovered at WD 01 as well as urgent repair works on the safe bypass of a landslide-prone road section that was built by the project
                         but heavily damaged by floods in spring 2009.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
