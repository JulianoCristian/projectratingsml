7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Within the context of the country's longer-term interests in disaster hazard mitigation, the development
objective of the proposed Disaster Hazard Mitigation Project (DHMP) is to: (i) minimize the exposure of
humans, livestock, and riverine flora and fauna to radionuclides associated with abandoned uranium mine
tailings and waste rock dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area;(ii) improve the effectiveness of emergency
management and response by national and sub-national authorities and local communities to disaster
situations; and (iii) reduce the loss of life and property in key landslide areas of the country. These
objectives will be accomplished through key mitigation measures designed to: (i) isolate and protect
abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps from disturbance by natural processes such as
landslides and floods, and from leaching and dispersal processes associated with ground- and surface-water
drainage; isolate long-standing hazards and prevent their disturbance; (ii) create an effective disaster
management and response system; and (iii) develop a system to detect and warn against active landslide
movements in about 20 key hazard areas.
