Original Project Development Objective
The Project Development Objective (PDO) for this Additional Financing is the same as that for
the Original Project (Original IDA Grant Number H096-KG), namely:

The development objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient (Kyrgyz Republic) in: (a)
minimizing the exposure of humans, livestock, and riverine flora and fauna to radionuclides
associated with abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area;
(b) improving the effectiveness of emergency management and response by national and sub-
national authorities and local communities to disaster situations; and (c) reducing the potential
loss of life and property in key landslide areas of the country.


Project description

The components of the project remain the same, with modifications to Parts A and C of the
Original Project.

The additional funds would enable repairing the flood damage inflicted during project
implementation on crucial road infrastructure necessary for the transport of radioactive
materials. Furthermore, the Additional Finance would also contribute to the relocation of
additional volumes of radioactive waste rock from Waste Dump 1 (WD1), which were
discovered during project implementation up to date, as well as the continued relocation of
radioactive tailings from Tailings Pond Number 3 (TP3). Lastly, the Additional Finance would
support monitoring activities for strengthening capacities of measuring uranium and other
toxicological elements in various water resources.

I. Introduction

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide the Kyrgyz
Republic an Additional Grant in the amount of US$ 1 million for the Disaster Hazard Mitigation
Project (DHMP) (Original PO number: P083235). The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic,
through the Ministry of Finance, has requested financing to cover modifications of Part A and C
of the Project in the following manner: (i) repairing flood damage inflicted on crucial road
infrastructure during the project implementation period, which is a key condition for achieving
the project objective of securing safe storage of radioactive materials from the uranium mine
tailings currently being relocated under the Project; (ii) removing and safely disposing of newly
discovered radioactive waste rock located on Waste Dump #01 (WD01) and removing/mitigating
the landslide risk at that location as well as continuing the relocation of radioactive mine tailings
from Tailings Pond #3 (TP03) and TP18 to a safe repository at TP06; and (iii) supporting
monitoring activities to strengthen the capacity of monitoring uranium and other toxicological
substances in various water resources.

2.       The IDA-financed Project remains to be complemented by a Grant from the Global
Environmental Facility (GEF). GEF financing of US$ 1 million is focused on: (i) contamination
prevention measures in the Kulmen-Sai valley, which is a tributary to the Mailuu-Suu River; and
(ii) establishment of monitoring and warning systems and promoting transboundary cooperation
on movement of hazardous waste by water. A US$ 1.95 million PHRD Grant (which has now
been closed) co-financed the following activities: (i) priority interventions for Mailuu-Suu; (ii)
strengthening the institutional and technical capacity for the disaster preparedness component;
and (iii) supporting project implementation and long-term investment component.

3.      The Project Development Objective (PDO), project components, institutional
arrangements and overall design remain the same as in the original Project and minor changes to
the results monitoring framework are being proposed. The Recipient’s representative remains the
Ministry of Finance and the Implementing Agency remains the Ministry of Emergency
Situations through its Project Implementation Unit.

II. Background and Rationale for Additional Financing

4.     An IDA Grant in the amount of SDR 4.7 million for DHMP was approved by the
Board of Executive Directors on June 15, 2004 and became effective on September 28, 2004.

5.     The development objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in: (a) minimizing
the exposure of humans, livestock, and riverine flora and fauna to radionuclides associated
with abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area; (b)
improving the effectiveness of emergency management and response by national and sub -
national authorities and local communities to disaster situations; and (c) reducing the
potential loss of life and property in key landslide areas of the country. These objectives will
be accomplished through key mitigation measures designed to: (i) isolate and protect
abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste dumps from disturbance by natural processes
such as landslides, floods, and from leaching and dispersal processes associated with ground -
and surface-water drainage; (ii) create a disaster management and response system that can
be administered effectively by national and sub-national authorities, and local communities;

                                                 1
and (iii) develop a system to detect and warn against active landslide movements in key
hazard areas.

6.      The need for Additional Financing due to modifications and additional project
activities arose because of the damage which was inflicted on critical road infrastructure
during the spring floods in 2010 (with a 1:100 occurrence) and because of additionally
discovered quantities of radioactive waste rock located on Waste Dump Number 1 (WD1)
during the relocation works from WD1 to Waste Dump Number 2 (WD2).

7.      The Project is currently rated satisfactory due to tangible progress in care and
maintenance of the remediation sites, waste rock relocation planning, public participation
arrangements and preparatory activities, initial relocation works and implementation of
environmental mitigation measures in the relocation of materials from Mine Tailing Number
3. Earlier delays in implementation arose due to the relocation of the Ministry of Emergency
Situations from Bishkek to Osh in May 2009 and the subsequent resignation of almost all
PIU staff. Moreover, when the new PIU had been established and contract for the relocation
of Mine Tailing materials signed, civil unrest severely disrupted all economic activities in the
South of Kyrgyzstan, starting in June 2009. The project is compliant with the key loan
covenants, including audit and financial management requirements (see paragraphs 25-27).

8.      The Project remains in line with the overarching theme of the original Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS, Report No. 25708; approved on May 15, 2003) of potential major
disasters affecting growth in agriculture, mining, tourism, and other sectors, and
subsequently derail poverty reduction. Government also remains concerned about the impact
of various disaster hazards on the economy and the population.

III. Proposed Changes

9.      The additional funds would enable repairing the flood damage inflicted during project
implementation on crucial road infrastructure necessary for the transport of radioactive
materials from their currently unsafe locations to the new and engineered disposal sites,
within the remaining project period. The road repair is also vital to ensuring long-term,
sustainable protection of the road from repeated damage by extreme flood events, thereby
providing a safe, and alternative transport route in Mailuu-Suu valley as a benefit for the
public. This would increase safety of public transport by avoiding sections of high landslide
risk on the existing road on the other side of the river bank.

10.     Furthermore, the Additional Financing would also contribute to the relocation of
additional volumes of radioactive waste rock from Waste Dump 1 (WD1), which were
discovered during project implementation up to date, as well as the continued relocation of
radioactive tailings from Tailings Pond Number 3 (TP3). This radioactive material is
currently exposed to erosion, dislocation and dissipation by the surface water network. In
addition, there is a risk of landslides occurring at the waste dump site, which could block and
dam up the river and subsequently trigger flood waves and mudslides (mixed with
radioactive materials) with catastrophic consequences for downstream population and

                                                 2
ecosystems. Lastly, the Additional Financing would support monitoring activities for
strengthening capacities of measuring uranium and other toxicological elements in various
water resources.

11.     The components will remain unchanged. Of the existing three components, new
activities will be added to Component 1: Uranium Mining Wastes Isolation and Protection
and Component 3: Project Management. The activities under the Additional Financing are
expected to be completed by the current Closing Date of March 2012.

12.       The Additional Financing would support the following Parts of the original Project:

         Part A: Uranium Mining Wastes Isolation and Protection would support activities in the
          repair of the flood damage inflicted during project implementation on crucial road
          infrastructure necessary for the transport of radioactive materials from tailings ponds
          TP03and TP18 to the new disposal site at TP06 as well as the continued relocation
          activities of the radioactive materials from TP03 and TP18. Furthermore, the component
          would support additional construction activities required for the relocation of additional
          volumes of radioactive waste rock from waste dump WD01 to WD02, which were
          discovered during project implementation. Lastly, the component would support
          additional activities strengthening the local laboratory capacity of measuring uranium in
          water.
         Part C: Project Management would support additional project management costs related
          to the Project Implementation Unit as well as necessary operational expenses. No new
          activities are foreseen under this component.

15.     The Additional Financing does not propose changes to institutional or implementation
arrangements. The Ministry of Emergency Situations will remain the implementing agency
for the project.

16.     The Additional Financing does not affect the project’s Development Objective.
However, some slight changes are proposed for the outcome indicators are summarized in the
table below.

17.     With regard to the proposed changes to the first outcome indicator, discontinuation of
pollution infiltration of radionuclides into the groundwater from selected high-risk mine
tailings and waste dumps is used as a valid proxy PDO indicator to measure the impact of
public health outcomes during the life of the project. The rationale is that, due to the slow
groundwater recharge and flow velocities, the impact of the remediation measures on the
groundwater downstream of potential pollution sources will only be measurable after project
closure. This approach is further corroborated by the risk assessment conducted as pa rt of
the design of the mitigation measures: This identified leaching and dispersal processes
associated with ground- and surface water drainage, and subsequent infiltration into the
ground, as the key exposure pathway for radionuclides into drinking water and thus the
human population.

18.      With regard to the proposed changes to the third outcome indicator, t he pilot
landslides were selected on the basis of a risk assessment and prioritization exercise carried
out. In total, there are 300 landslide areas in the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic. The
reduction of the number of landslide monitoring systems resulted from focusing on the
highest risk-ranked sites, which at the same time are the geologically and geotechnically
most complex landslides in the Mailuu-Suu area. Due to this technical complexity, the cost of
the single real-time landslide monitoring system was higher than estimated and thus only five
pilot sites could be selected.

IV. Appraisal Summary

19.     The institutional arrangements remain the same, with the Ministry of Emergency
Situations as the main implementing agency and the PIU responsible for procurement,
financial management, disbursement, and monitoring and evaluation. The National
Emergency Management Committee established under the original Project with membership
from relevant ministries and agencies involved in disaster emergency management and
response will maintain the responsibility for overseeing the Project implementation and
resolving any issue related to inter-governmental agency coordination of the Project
activities.
                                                          5
20.     Economic and Financial Analysis. Project benefits comprised of avoided loss of
failure of landslides and mine tailings and the probability of flooding, based on the sum of
losses from expected disaster events multiplied (or weighed) by the probability of
occurrence. The project focuses on reducing direct losses to personal and public property
throughout the Mailuu-Suu valley and into the Ferghana valley. The Mailuu-Suu valley has
an estimated 28,000 inhabitants, while 3 million inhabitants live downstream in the Ferghana
valley in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

21.     The project remains economically justified. In addition to the original benefits related
to avoided loss of failure of landslides and mine tailings as associated with the original
project, the repair of the technological road is now foreseen to withstand a flood event with a
1:100 occurrence. This provides additional substantial benefits to the local population and
applies especially to upstream residents in the Mailuu-Suu valley, who will have a
perspective to improved, safer access on the road to their villages.

22.     Technical. Technical, logistical, and institutional measures and conditions are in
place to proceed with the additionally required works speedily, as soon as Additional
Financing becomes available. The damaged section of the crucial haul road has already been
largely repaired under the ongoing contract for tailings relocation; and thus can now be used
again for tailings relocation from TP3 to TP6. Tender documents for the relocation of the
additional quantities of radioactive waste rock from WD1 to WD2 have been prepared. The
tender process is ready to be launched and relocation works could, given the approval of the
AF in June 2011, be completed within the construction season of 2011 (ending around
November 2011). The design for the relocation is analogous to the design produced for the
previous relocation campaign, and includes all required environmental and radiation safety
control and monitoring measures called for by international good practice. These same
standards and good practices will be employed during the planned additional relocation
works. The removal of the unstable slope opposite WD1 was investigated as one of the
options, but the removal is technically complicated and the works for partial unloading of the
landslide, in particular the access roads, may trigger in itself new instability of the slope.

23.     The quality of ongoing and completed construction works is satisfactory: river bank
strengthening measures/structures, as well as surface drainage systems for the existing TPs
are constructed solidly and with good craftsmanship according to international good practice.
The radiation safety requirements for tailings relocation works are being implemented in full
compliance with design and according to international good practice. All required structures
and installations (e.g., decontamination facilities, tire washing plants, groundwater
monitoring wells, dust monitoring points) have been completed and are fully functional. The
Contractor undertaking these works is well trained, and site supervision effective and
functional.

24.    Maintenance and repairs of already remediated facilities (e.g., regular clearing of
drainage systems) is being undertaken under the auspices of the newly formed National


                                                 6
Agency for Radiation Safety. The preparation of a detailed monitoring and maintenance plan,
which is an important requirement to ensure future sustainable practice, is ongoing.

25.     The elaboration of a practical, sustainable radiological monitoring concept for the
water resources of the municipality of Mailuu-Suu has made good progress, and a realistic
implementation scenario has been discussed and identified. In principle, the responsibility for
the monitoring would remain with the State Sanitary and Epidemiological Commission’s
branch, which supports a laboratory in Mailuu-Suu, provided the local government is able to
ensure that continuous operating costs of the analytical monitoring are met. These cos ts will
in turn be kept as low as possible. Only when elevated radiation levels are found in the
analysis, more detailed and more expensive analytical methods would be employed, which
are available only outside Mailuu-Suu.

26.     Financial Management Arrangements. The financial management arrangements will
apply as instituted for the original project. The overall financial management functions under
the Additional Financing, including the flow of funds, staffing, accounting, reporting and
auditing, will be handled by the Project Implementing Unit at the Ministry of Emergency
Situations. Details of the Financial Management arrangements are listed in Annex 3.

27.    Disbursement Arrangements. The Additional Financing will disburse in the same
manner as the original Grant. It will disburse through transaction-based disbursement
methods that include: reimbursements with full documentation, reimbursements on basis of
Statements of Expenditures for small expenditures with defined thresholds, payments against
Special Commitments, direct payments to third parties, and payments through the Designated
Account. Details are listed in Annex 3.

28.    Procurement arrangements as instituted for the original Grant will apply for the
Additional Financing. Details are listed in Annex 3 and 4.

29.     Safeguards. The Environmental Category for the AF remains B, the same as the
original Project. The Additional Financing does not require any exceptions to Bank policies.
The project locations relevant for the AF are entirely contained within the original project’s
geographical boundaries. There will be no additional areas affected, and no geographical
expansion of activities under the AF. The additionally discovered waste quantities will not
increase the footprint of the receiving safe repository.

30.     With regard to the relocation of the additional waste materials from WD1, the same
environmental and health mitigation and monitoring measures will apply as were in place
during the relocation works executed earlier in project implementation. The parent project
was designed to mitigate existing negative impacts by radioactive waste materials deposited
in multiple locations around Mailuu-Suu. The overall project impact is expected to be highly
positive, and the original environmental due diligence instruments addressed mainly
temporary impacts due to civil and construction works. The same principle applies to the AF
activities, which will only cover repair works of infrastructure built under the parent project,
and address additionally discovered quantities of waste.

                                                 7
31.    The original project included investments involving dams and minor land acquisition,
thus, Operational Policy (OP) 4.37 (Safety of Dams) and OP4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement)
were triggered. In addition, the project’s location on a trans-boundary waterway triggered
OP7.50 (Projects on International Waterways).

32.     OP4.12: Several families were resettled under the original project, as they had been
living on radioactive waste deposits. Meanwhile, all resettlement activities envisaged under
the original project have been successfully concluded and no major grievances or complaints
were recorded. The existing resettlement instruments and arrangements will remain
unchanged under the AF and no additional resettlement is envisaged. Although none of the
activities under the AF would, by themselves, trigger OP4.12, it remains triggered as a
precautionary measure.

33.     OP4.37: The original project triggered OP 4.37 as some of the tailings facilities have
dams of the relevant height and the area is overall seismically active. During preparation of
the original project, the necessary reports (geo-technical, risk management, hydrology, and
seismic) were prepared to ensure the tailing facilities' stability. The AF activities will not
involve tailings deposits with dams which would fall under OP4.37. The activities under the
AF would, by themselves, not trigger OP4.37.

34.     OP7.50: The original project triggered OP 7.50 as the Mailuu-Suu river is a trans-
boundary river that flows into the Naryn and Syr Darya rivers, which are defined as
international waterways by Paragraph 1(a) of OP 7.50. During parent project implementation
potential changes in water flow or deterioration in water quality during the construction
works would have been be mitigated through implementation of the EMP. As required by
OP7.50 a notification letter was sent to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan in February
2004 to inform these riparian states about the proposed project activities.       While the
applicability of OP7.50 remains valid, the AF activities are not expected to cause any
additional, or for that matter perceptible, impact on international water ways, which would
require an update of the notification.

35.    In summary, while the AF will not finance investments likely to trigger OP4.12,
OP4.37 or OP7.50, these policies remain triggered to avoid inconsistencies between the
safeguards documents (ISDS) of original project and AF project, as after approval the AF
merges with the original project.

36.    All safeguards documents originally prepared for the parent project remain valid for
the AF activities, which are entirely covered by their geographical and technical scope.
These safeguards documents include an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) which were prepared during preparation of the
parent project (financed by the EU-funded Joint Environmental Program), as well as a
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). In compliance with the Bank’s safeguards policies
these documents were disclosed in country (ESIA/EMP 03/30/2004, RPF 04/14/2004) and in
the World Bank’s Infoshop (ESIA/EMP 04/06/2004, RPF 04/14/2004). The safeguards

                                                8
documents have now been re-disclosed for the Additional Financing and were both published
in the Infoshop on 03/10/2011.

Project Development Objective (PDO):
The development objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in: (a) minimizing the exposure of humans, livestock, and riverine flora and fauna to
radionuclides associated with abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area; (b) improving the effectiveness of emergency
management and response by national and sub-national authorities and local communities to disaster situations; and (c) reducing the potential loss of life and
property in key landslide areas of the country.

   The development objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in: (a) minimizing the exposure of humans, livestock, and riverine flora
  and fauna to radionuclides associated with abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area; (b) improving
  the effectiveness of emergency management and response by national and sub-national authorities and local communities to disaster
  situations; and (c) reducing the potential loss of life and property in key landslide areas of the country.

  These objectives will be accomplished through key mitigation measures designed to: (i) isolate and protect abandoned uranium mine
  tailings and waste dumps from disturbance by natural processes such as landslides, floods, and from leaching and dispersal processes
  associated with ground- and surface-water drainage; (ii) create a disaster management and response system that can be administered
  effectively by national and sub-national authorities, and local communities; and (iii) develop a system to detect and warn against active
  landslide movements in key hazard areas.

DETAILED FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, DISBURSEMENT
      AND PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS


1.      Financial Management Arrangements. Particularly, all funds flow through the PIU,
which verifies all the payment supporting documents before processing the payments from the
Bank and Government sources. The financial management arrangements of the original Disaster
Hazard Mitigation Project (P083235) implemented by the PIU have been reviewed periodically
as part of the project supervision and have been found to be satisfactory. The last supervision
was performed in March 2011. According to the Financial Management Supervision results, the
financial management arrangements are satisfactory and good internal control procedures are in
place. The Client is in compliance with the audit covenant: audit reports have been received by
due dates and the auditor has given unqualified opinion on the project financial statements with
no serious internal control issues in the management letter. The overall FM risk for the project
remains Moderate.

2.       Similar audit arrangements to the original Project will be adopted for the Additional
Financing: the project audit will be conducted by independent private auditors and on terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank, and procured by the PIU. The annual audited project financial
statements will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year and
also at the closing of the project. The cost of the audit will be financed from the proceeds of the
credit. Project management-oriented Interim Un-audited Financial Reports (IFRs) - previously
known as Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) - will be used for the Additional Financing
monitoring and supervision. The existing formats of the IFRs will be used, and the PIU will
produce a full set of IFRs every quarter throughout the life of the project and will submit them to
the Bank no later than 45 days after the calendar quarter end.

3.      Disbursement Arrangements. To facilitate project implementation, a separate
Designated Account will be opened at the same financial institution as the original Grant. The
Designated Account, which will be managed by the PIU, will be replenished on a quarterly basis,
as needed. The total ceiling will be limited to US$0.5 million The Designated Account will be
audited annually in conjunction with the audit of the project financial statements. Disbursements
will be made on the basis of full documentation for (i) contracts for goods costing more than the
equivalent of US$100,000 each; (ii) contracts for works costing more than the equivalent of
US$1.0 million each; (iii) services under contracts of more than the equivalent of US$100,000
for each consulting firms and more than the equivalent of US$50,000 each for individual
consultants; and (iv) all incremental operating cost. Disbursements below these thresholds and
for expenditures against incremental operating costs and training would be made according to the
certified Statement of Expenditure (SOEs).

4.      For all expenditures financed under the Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) full
documentation in support of the SOEs will be retained in the PIU for at least two years after the
project closing date. This information will be available for review by Bank missions during
project supervision and by the projects auditors. SOEs will be audited in conjunction with the

                                                17
annual audit of the project. Further instructions on the size of the minimum application and on
how funds will be withdrawn from this Loan will be provided in the Disbursement Letter.

5.      Procurement Arrangements. Procurement Capacity and Risk Assessment:
Procurement under Additional Financing will be the responsibility of the existing Project
Implementing Unit established under the Ministry of Emergency Situations. The PIU is
currently staffed with one procurement specialist who has attended procurement trainings
organized by the Bank. The procurement performance under the main project is rated
moderately satisfactory at the time of preparation for Additional Financing. Risk assessment
is done through Procurement Risk Assessment and Management System (P-RAMS). The
main procurement risk identified would be potential delays due to the low capacity of the
PIU. Another risk would be low level of competition in procurement due to high cost of
doing business in the region and low capacity of local contractors. To mitigate these risks,
the Bank’s procurement team will provide advice and assistance on a regular basis. The
procurement packaging and plans will be carefully developed with a review to attract
adequate participation in bidding process; and procurement notices will be advertised widely.
The procurement risk is rated as medium due to limited number of new procurement
packages in the proposed Additional Financing.

6.      Applicable Guidelines: Procurement under the Additional Financing will be carried
out in accordance with the World Bank’s "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits" published in May 2004, and revised in October 2006 and May 2010
(Procurement Guidelines); "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers" published in May 2004, and revised in October 2006 and May 2010
(Consultant Guidelines); and the provisions stipulated in the Financing Agreement.

7.     Procurement Plan: The main procurement activities to be financed under the
proposed AF include additional civil works for relocation of additional volumes of
radioactive waste rock from WD1 (new procurement, national competitive bidding [NCB])
and cover of the repair of technological road for relocation of TP3 and TP18 to TP6 (ongoing
contract) as well as consultant services for water quality baseline establishment, project audit
and salaries of PIU staff.

8.      A Draft procurement plan has been developed covering the above procurement
activities for Additional Financing (Annex 4) and has been agreed at negotiations. Thereafter,
the plan will be updated as needed and each update will be subject to the Bank prior review.
The initial procurement plan plus the subsequent updates will be published on the Bank’s
external web site in line with the requirements of Bank Guidelines.

9.     Procurement Supervision and Ex-post Review: Routine procurement reviews and
supervision will be provided by the Procurement Specialist based in the Country Office. In
addition, two supervision missions are expected to take place per year during which ex -post
reviews will be conducted for the contracts that are not subject to Bank prior review on a
sample basis (20 percent in terms of number of contracts). One ex-post review report will be


                                                18
prepared per fiscal year, including findings of physical inspections for not less than 10
percent of the contracts awarded during the review period.

10.      Additional Provisions for National Competitive Bidding (NCB): The standard NCB
provisions for the Kyrgyz Republic, as included in the Financing Agreement, will be applied
to all the NCB contracts in the respective country.

11.    Procurement Thresholds: The thresholds for procurement methods and prior review
by the Bank are indicated in the table below.
