F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)




                                               ii
Within the context of the country's longer-term interests in disaster hazard mitigation, the
development objective of the proposed Disaster Hazard Mitigation Project (DHMP) is to:
(i) minimize the exposure of humans, livestock, and riverine flora and fauna to
radionuclides associated with abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps in
the Mailuu-Suu area; (ii) improve the effectiveness of emergency management and
response by national and sub-national authorities and local communities to disaster
situations; and (iii) reduce the loss of life and property in key landslide areas of the
country.

  These objectives will be accomplished through key mitigation measures designed to: (i)
isolate and protect abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps from
disturbance by natural processes such as landslides and floods, and from leaching and
dispersal processes associated with ground- and surface-water drainage; isolate long-
standing hazards and prevent their disturbance; (ii) create an effective disaster
management and response system; and (iii) develop a system to detect and warn against
active landslide movements in about 20 key hazard areas.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       The Kyrgyz Republic is located on the northern side of the Himalaya range and most of its
territory is occupied by the Tien Shan Mountains, made of a series of east-west trending high mountains
belts separated by lower intra-mountain basins. Most of the territory is known to be tectonically active
and prone to seismic activity and to related natural hazards, such as landslides. Within the country, a
series of mining districts are located within this belt 1 . Ore districts – including uranium - had been
exploited during decades, particularly before the 1991 independence, with little regard to either economic
viability or environmental impact, and are characterized by a legacy of environmental damages.

hazards - landslides, earthquakes and floods related to seismic movements - and quite an important
mining environmental legacy – poorly managed tailings and waste dumps, implying a significant risk for
destruction of these mining facilities and implying high risks for contamination and life affecting effects,
particularly in areas of earlier uranium mining. Strong negative impact was foreseen on health, or life, of
affected communities, as well as on economic activities, both within the mining areas and over long
distances downstream (for example, the fertile Fergana valley in neighboring Uzbekistan downstream the
main project area; the border is located 30 km downstream Mailuu-Suu).

3.      After independence (1991), the institutional and technical capacity of the Ministry of Ecology and
Emergencies (MEE) –later renamed as Ministry of Emergency Situations (MES), responsible to manage
these issues, was considerably reduced. It did not have adequate human resources, infrastructure or
modern operational procedures in place, or sufficient levels of resources allocated to carry out its
mandates. Emergency intervention criteria had not been developed in detail, and there was no well-
defined system of functions and responsibilities between the various departments in MEE and regional
and local administrations to allow for quick and effective intervention in case of emergencies.

    4. In 1996-1998, a survey of the uranium mining legacy in the CIS was funded by the EU
Commission's TACIS program, which identified Mailuu-Suu – the main project area - as one of the foci
of urgent environmental action. In Mailuu Suu, there was active uranium mining from 1946 until 1968
that left behind 23 radioactive tailings and 13 waste rock dumps which were constructed within the flood
plain of the Mailuu-Suu River (a tributary of the Naryn River, which flows into the Syr Darya). Being
mountainous, the Mailuu-Suu area is prone to floods and landslides, and is in a seismically active area.
More than 200 places around Mailuu-Suu were identified where potentially active slippage areas are
home to historically-active landslides. During the last 10 years an increase in landslide activity had been
observed, possibly due to a cycle of wet weather and a large number of seismic events. Two of these
landslide areas, named Tectonic and Koi-Tash, presented a high potential for further activation and
slippage down the valley slopes and threatened the integrity of a number of mine tailings. A few tailings
were earlier slightly damaged by landslides and also river erosion It was clear that a major landslide could
seriously damage tailings or push them into the Mailuu-Suu River, which could then wash the dangerous
substances through Mailuu-Suu town, and possibly further downstream to the Ferghana Valley, with over
6 million people in three countries, as well as major rice and cotton irrigation areas. Landslides could also
threaten to block the river, which could submerge tailings and cause major flooding in Mailuu-Suu. Any


1
  There are 7 inventoried areas with significant environmental mining legacies with radioactive waste in the Kyrgyz Republic, of
which Mailuu Suu, part of the project area, which most needed interventions to reduce the environmental impacts generated by
abandoned uranium mines (from UNDP’s Kyrgyzstan Uranium Tailings, 2008).

                                                               1
such event could cause long-term downstream contamination, potentially preventing the use of river water
for drinking and irrigation, and could cause potential damage to the socioeconomic structure of the upper
part of the Ferghana Valley. Government and a number of international organizations recognized the
urgency of interventions in this area.

5.       This concern for urgency for interventions by Government and several international organizations
is also shown by the execution of a report by TACIS in 2003 specifically focusing on the Remediation of
Uranium Mining and Milling Tailings in the Mailuu-Suu district to focus on evaluation of measures to
reduce the radiological exposure of the population and prevent environmental pollution by radionuclides
and heavy metals in case of loss of tightness of dams and damage to dumps and heaps from mining. The
study undertook radiological and borehole monitoring of the tailings, radon monitoring, and identified
short term and long terms measures to reduce the hazards of the tailings. Slow release of radionuclides
and other hazardous wastes like heavy metals and arsenic occurred to the ground- and surface-waters of
the Mailuu-Suu area, due to continued drainage and seepage from tailings and waste rock dumps.

6.      Rationale for Bank assistance. Government was concerned about the impact of various disaster
hazards on the economy and the population. Various pieces of legislation and strategies had been
prepared, but lack of technical and financial resources did not allow for their comprehensive
implementation. Major disasters could affect growth in agriculture, mining, tourism, and other sectors,
and subsequently derail poverty reduction, which was the overarching theme of the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS, Report No. 25708; approved on May 15, 2003). The CAS objectives were closely linked
to the priority objectives of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS). Due to the country’s
topography and geology, natural hazards such as landslides are often hard to prevent, but Government
was interested as a minimum in improving the capacity to monitor and predict potential disasters, and in
improving its ability to provide rapid warning against potential hazard events. The Government was
committed to improve the situation in the Mailuu-Suu area and to mitigate major environmental and
health hazards with respect to radioactive contamination, thereby alleviating current and potential risks to
the local population.

7.       There was little country experience in dealing with natural disasters and tailings rehabilitation in
an adequately coordinated and comprehensive manner and the World Bank had established a history of
assisting in environmental management activities and developing natural disaster reconstruction and
mitigation programs.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

8.        Within the context of the country's longer-term interests in disaster hazard mitigation, the
development objectives of the proposed Disaster Hazard Mitigation Project (DHMP) were to: (i)
minimize the exposure of humans, livestock, and riverine flora and fauna to radionuclides associated with
abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area; (ii) improve the
effectiveness of emergency management and response by national and sub-national authorities and local
communities to disaster situations; and (iii) reduce the potential loss of life and property in key landslide
areas of the country. These objectives were to be accomplished through key mitigation measures designed
to: (i) isolate and protect abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps from disturbance by
natural processes such as landslides and floods, and from leaching and dispersal processes associated with
ground- and surface-water drainage; isolate long-standing hazards and prevent their disturbance; (ii)
create an effective disaster management and response system; and (iii) develop a system to detect and
warn against active landslide movements in key hazard areas.

9.      Key performance indicators were: 1 (i): Evidence that applicable parameters are below hazardous
thresholds for humans, livestock and riverine flora and fauna in samples of soil, water and air from

                                                     2
monitored sites in the Mailuu-Suu area (via technical audit reports); 1(ii): Evidence of high satisfaction
rates among the local population in the Mailuu-Suu area regarding project outputs via sample surveys (in
preparation for the ICR stage); 2(i): Evidence that a disaster hazard monitoring, warning and response
system is functioning and being used effectively by cooperating national, oblast, and raion authorities,
and local communities (via technical audit reports); 2(ii): Evidence of high satisfaction rates among
national and sub- national authorities and the public living in hazard areas regarding disaster preparedness
operations and benefits (via brief sample surveys in preparation for ICR stage); and 3) Evidence that real-
time landslide monitoring, warning and response systems are functioning and being used effectively by
cooperating national, oblast, and rayon authorities, and local communities (via technical and social audit
reports).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.     The Project Development Objectives were not revised, but the key indicators were revised and re-
aligned as part of the June 2011 Additional Financing processing. The following changes were made to
the PDO indicators:
    -   PDO indicator 1(i) “Evidence that applicable parameters are below hazardous thresholds for
        humans, livestock and riverine flora and fauna in samples of soil, water and air from monitored
        sites in the Mailuu-Suu area”, was changed to “discontinuation of pollution infiltration of
        radionuclides into the groundwater from selected high-risk mine tailings and waste dumps” to be
        used as a valid proxy PDO indicator to measure the impact of public health outcomes during the
        life of the project.




        Figure 1 Conceptual scheme of the structure of groundwaters aquifers in the areas of uranium
        mineralization and tailings of Mailuu-Suu. Observe in the center of the section the outcropping of
        mineralized rocks at the level of the Mailuu-Suu river, representing a non antropogenic likely source of
        contamination.
    -   The rationale for the change was that, due to the slow groundwater recharge and flow velocities,
        the impact of the remediation measures on the groundwater downstream of potential pollution
        sources would only be measurable (long) after project closure. This approach was corroborated
        by the risk assessment conducted as part of the detailed design of the mitigation measures during
        the beginning of Project implementation. This identified leaching and dispersal processes
        associated with ground- and surface water drainage, and subsequent infiltration into the ground,
        as the key exposure pathway for radionuclides into drinking water and thus the human
        population. In addition, the existence of natural uranium mineralization underground which might


                                                           3
          affect the quality of water and could not be removed, as, for example the fact that rocks of the
          mineralized formation are exposed at the level of the tailings pond nr 3 (see Fig. 1 2).
      -   The target for PDO indicator 2(i) was revised from “Considerable evidence of improved
          effectiveness” to “Emergency Response Centers established and operative around the clock and
          the response time for all inventoried potential landslide areas lies below 24 hours”. The original
          second part of the target for this indicator “the National Emergency Management and Response
          Plan is in place, staff has been made aware of it and has been trained, as necessary. The plan is
          accepted and used by relevant authorities” was downgraded from PDO indicator level to
          Intermediate indicator but not included in the Results Framework as it would not be possible to
          properly measure such target. This second part of the target was not part of the original PAD
          Results Framework, but was included in the ISR reporting.
      -   The target for the PDO indicator 3 was revised from “Twenty landslide areas have been surveyed
          and monitoring and warning systems have been installed in an estimated ten of the landslide
          areas. Local population has been trained in response to warnings” to “Five landslide monitoring
          and warning systems installed and population trained in their use. Fully operational and
          monitored by local authorities and MES”. In total, there are 300 landslide areas in the territory of
          the Kyrgyz Republic. Pilot landslides were selected on the basis of a risk assessment and
          prioritization. The reduction of the number of landslide monitoring systems resulted from
          focusing on the highest risk-ranked sites, which at the same time were the geologically and geo-
          technically most complex landslide areas. Due to this technical complexity, the cost of the single
          real-time landslide monitoring system, including the maintenance of the original technologically
          based system (taking also into account the cost of replacing vandalized facilities), was higher than
          estimated and thus only five pilot sites could be selected.

11.     In addition, the June 2011 modified results framework does not take into account two PDO
indicators related to the “evidence of high satisfaction rates among the local population in the Mailuu-Suu
area regarding project outputs via sample surveys” and “evidence of high satisfaction rates among
national and sub- national authorities and the public living in hazard areas regarding disaster preparedness
operations and benefits” (PDO indicators 1(ii) and 2(ii)). While there was insufficient funding remaining
at Project Closure to undertake specific population satisfaction surveys due to the additional materials
discovered that had to be relocated (from Tailings pond No.3), there is however abundant reference in the
Project Implementation Unit’s (PIU) reports and Bank supervision Aide Memoires referring to
community outreach. The output/intermediary results indicators were also modified as follows, as part of
the Additional Financing:
    - the intermediate indicator and target related to Component 2 were re-phrased in a more
        concrete way related to the set-up of a communication system and ability to communicate in
        case of natural hazard as a step towards effective emergency management;
    - the third indicator and target related to the set-up of the landslide monitoring system was
        dropped because of similarities with the related outcome indicator 3; and,
    - the indicator and targets related to the performance of the PIU (Component 3) were not
        mentioned in the Additional Financing.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.       According to the PAD, the primary target beneficiaries would include: (i) people (population

estimated at 28,000 inhabitants), livestock, and riverine flora and fauna of the Mailuu-Suu area exposed to
radionuclides and contamination associated with abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps
(Component l) and (ii) people living near potential disaster hazard areas, including those living near some
of the major landslide areas in the country (Component 2).

13.     An estimated 3 million population living in the upper Ferghana Valley (of Uzbekistan) were
considered secondary beneficiaries as potential disturbance of the uranium mine wastes and rocks in the
Mailuu-Suu area by major landslides or floods could result in serious regional contamination
downstream.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

14.      The project comprised three components. Component 1 – Uranium Mining Wastes Isolation
and Protection (US$7.43 million or 63% of total IDA funds, 69% of total project funds) included
funding for works, goods, and services for interventions to isolate and protect abandoned uranium mining
wastes and rocks in the Mailuu-Suu area from disturbance by natural processes such as landslides and
floods, and leaching and dispersal by ground- and surface-water drainage. The component was divided
into two separately and clearly differentiated types of activities. Five “early” activities were already
clearly defined at appraisal and could be implemented with limited remaining preparatory and design
work and were identified to contribute to the prevention of an environmental disaster and show an early
visible impact. In parallel, investigations and designs were planned in order to determine larger mitigation
measures of some of the most dangerous tailings and/or landslides 3.

15.      These five early activities (US$3.34 million) for investigations, designs, and construction works
included: (i) removal of the unstable top on the south side of the landslide (referred to as ‘Tectonic
Triangle’) to reduce the risk of impact on uranium Tailing No. 3 (see map in Annex 2) in case of
movement of the soil mass; (ii) inspection of all 23 tailings and 13 waste rock dumps, and development
and implementation of required urgent interventions; (iii) design and construction of a surface water
drainage system around the upper boundary of the Koi-Tash Landslide to capture and remove water
runoff, so as to reduce the risk of landslide reactivation; (iv) installation of Global Positioning Systems
(GPS), piezometers, extensometers, and seismic monitoring stations on Tectonic and Koi-Tash
Landslides, and linkage through radio systems to central early warning system in Mailuu-Suu and
surrounding villages; and (v), design and construction of river bank protection works along priority
sections of the Aylyampa-Sai and Mailuu-Suu Rivers to prevent erosion of tailings, in particular Nos.
1,2,4,5,8 and 18.

16.     In parallel to the above interventions, investigations and a feasibility and design study were to be
undertaken to determine the subsequent necessary remediation works. Based on the detailed assessments


3
  At Project Appraisal, the complex nature of the problems in the Mailuu-Suu region was known, including the interaction of
manmade and natural hazards (i.e., uranium mine tailings and landslides/floods). A range of alternatives were considered for
implementation within the project as it was clear that there were not sufficient resources available to solve all the potential risks.
However it was decided that, rather than waiting with a project until all the possible activities would have been fully prepared and
sufficient funds have been made available from various interested donors, to start the assistance as soon as possible. The main
thrust of the project was therefore separated into short-term actions that could be implemented quickly and more long-term
solutions that required further feasibility investigation to confirm optimum utilization of available resources under the project and
to prepare documentation to attract additional donor funds. It was also stated that despite the fact that not all issues would likely
to be solved with the available project funds, at the completion of the activities proposed within this project the high likelihood
risks would have been significantly reduced and the institutional capacity to deal with disaster management improved. GEF
Funds were later added to the Project and were reported in separate Implementation Completion Memorandum.


                                                                  5
of the 23 tailings ponds and 13 waste dumps and risks assessments of each object, remediation actions
with high priority were to be identified and low priority remediation measures. The selection would done
according to the assessment of the risks shown by each of the 36 identified sites, and such selection was
executed based on the following criteria: (i) endogeneous geotechnical risks (instability of the waste
facility itself which may lead to release of contaminated material); (ii) exogeneous geotechnical risk (risk
of external forces such as floods and landslides to damage the facility and lead to release of contaminated
material); (iii) radio-ecological risk to the population (including all relevant exposure pathways); and (iv)
eco-toxicological risk to the population through the water pathway. The identified high-priority
remediation measures for the most dangerous tailings and/or landslides would be included in the project
(final results of the implemented measures are shown in Annex 2). The lower priority remediation
measures were to be left for follow up works. A team of international and national consultants would
carry out these investigations, surveys, studies, risk assessments and designs for all activities and would
be also responsible for construction supervision. The firm would work together with local design
institutions, government agencies and experts in order to maximize local experts in project
implementation, and ensure transfer of knowledge and training of local specialists in the preparation of
modern state-of-the art designs, identification and prioritization of remediation measures based on risk
assessment and in modern construction supervision practices.

17.      Component 2 – Disaster Preparedness and Monitoring (DPM; US$3.38 million or 29% of
total IDA Funds, 21% of total project funds) was to fund the provision of works, goods, and services
(mainly financed by the Japan PHRD grant) to: (i) improve the national system for disaster management,
preparedness, and response that can be administered and implemented effectively by national and sub-
national authorities, and local communities; (ii) establish real-time systems to detect and warn against
active landslide movements in key hazard areas, and provide equipment for seismic measurements; and
(iii) set up a monitoring system in Mailuu-Suu. In particular the project would include: (a) capacity
building (US$2.44 million) to strengthen the ability of the ministry, administrations at various levels, and
local communities to fulfill better their duties and functions, create better awareness, and be better
prepared in case of disasters. Spreading knowledge on disaster preparedness and encouraging government
agencies and local communities was to be a specific focus within the project areas (Mailuu-Suu and
villages near the selected landslide areas) and preparation of regulations and a National Management and
Response Plan (NMRP); (b) landslide monitoring and warning systems and seismic measurement
equipment (US$0.43 million) for those landslide areas which were identified as being able to cause major
human disasters in case of unloading of the landslides; and (c) monitoring system in Mailuu-Suu
(US$0.51 million) to implement and support Component 1 interventions.

18.     Component 3 – Project Management (US$0.95 million or 8% of total IDA funds, 11% of total
project funds) was to fund the provision of staff and the operations of the Project Implementation Unit
(PIU), responsible for timely and effective management and implementation of the project.

1.6 Revised Components

19.     The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

20.    Design, scope and scale of Component 1. The main part of the project funds were dedicated to
the remediation works related to the old tailings ponds (TP) and waste dumps (WD) in and around
Mailuu-Suu. An inventory of the sites had been carried out during project preparation – particularly in




                                                     6
coordination with the 2003 EU TACIS program. It was evident at the preparation stage that only high risk
sites in need of urgent remediation within the area could be considered under the DHMP 4, as dealing with
all sites would require a long timeframe and exceed the available financial resources. In addition, some of
the existing sites did not show an immediate impact and their remediation might not have made economic
sense at that stage. A key activity therefore at the start of project implementation was to prioritize, on the
basis of detailed site investigations and risk assessment, the most significant contamination sources, and
carry out the risk analysis for the tailing ponds and waste dumps and prioritize the important interventions
needed to minimize exposure, as well as identify the type of interventions required 5 (see paragraph 16).
This was in parallel to the five “early” activities that were already defined at appraisal and where
implementation already had started to contribute to the prevention of an environmental disaster and show
an early visible impact (see paragraph 15).

21.      As frequently in similar environmental remediation projects, additional detailed and expensive
investigations and risk assessments were required before actual starting of the handling of the
contaminated materials and restoration or removal of the sites. A risk assessment and a prioritization
study was carried out until 2005 in order to select the sites presenting the higher risks of contamination or
landslide in the areas where the population or water resources would be exposed – as it was out of
question that all mine tailings and waste dumps in the area could be handled (see map in Annex 2) due to
limited resources and the emergency focus of the project. In 2006, these sites were selected and detailed
surveys and the engineering planning could start, as a basis for contracting the civil remediation works.
Of the existing 36 sites identified, 15 were selected and remediated 6 – in addition to the broader and
“early” activities, such as strengthening of riverbanks, the partial removal of unstable materials at the top
of a landslide area dominating Tailing Pond No. 3 (TP3; the so-called “Tectonic Triangle”) and
infrastructure works to remove Waste Dump No.5 (WD5) and TP3. As this sequence and adjustment were
part of and built into the project, they would not classify as changes to the design of Component 1, and
the flexibility built in the project mechanisms is certainly commendable.

22.      Design, scope and scale of Component 2. The second sub-component, related to the
establishment of a real-time system to detect and warn against active landslide movements in key hazard
areas, had to be revised, including with respect to the associated outcome indicator (see paragraphs 10 and
11). The activity was properly implemented and stations at five sites were equipped with automated
instruments. However, the whole approach to the set-up of stations connected to a center for remote
warning had to be revised in 2011 because of two reasons: a) the cost of the equipment, its installation
and maintenance proved to be more complex and expensive than expected; and b) once installed, the
stations were vandalized. Considering the costs implied by the replacement of the instruments, a decision
was made to select a different technology, using low cost community-based monitoring approach. The
five communities where the vandalized stations were placed were trained how to monitor landslides and
alert the authorities in case of danger. Training materials were prepared with visual and easy to
understand explanations on landslides and monitoring techniques. The first training sessions were
oriented towards village elders and community representatives and a simplified presentation was prepared
for school children in one of the key landslide risk area, Taram Bazar. The ICR mission visited a school
in the Taram Bazar area –one of the five sites-, in which teachers and older students were training
younger pupils in order to spread the knowledge about landslides recognition and occurrences. The issue


4
  36 sites had been identified in the 2003 TACIS report (23 TPs and 13 WDs).
5
  An example is the Tailings Pond 3. While clearly identified as a very significant source of contamination, it had still to be
assessed whether remediation on site or the removal of the tailings material would be the most efficient intervention. The detailed
investigations and risk assessment showed that full removal represented a better option.
6
  Other activities which reduced the impacts of other sites, for example strengthening of riverbanks (e.g., of the Aylampa river, a
west side affluent of the Maillu-Suu river, south of the city, affecting TPs 1, 4 and 23) or on the Kara Agach river, a west side
affluent, upstream the city, affecting WD 6 and others. See map in Annex 2.

                                                                7
of vandalizing risk had been discussed during project preparation, but the government had opted in the
“high tech/high cost” option.

23.     Restructurings, Additional Financing and financing reallocation. As often in this type of
environmental remediation projects, the volume of works, and in particular the amount of waste materials
present in Waste Dump No. 1 and Mine Tailing No. 3 – and related time and costs – proved to be higher
than originally estimated, which caused an increase of funding requirements leading to the World Bank
Additional Financing (AF) of US$1.0 million equivalent (approved in June 2011) and re-allocation of
funds in March 2012 that was processed as a 2nd level restructuring.

24.    Extension of closing date. The project, due to the political events in 2010, increased volume of
the Component 1 works, unfavorable weather conditions and slower than expected progress in the
remediation works, had to be extended three times for a cumulative period of 2 years and 9 months, in
March 2010, March 2012 and finally September 2012 from the original closing date of March 31, 2010 to
December 31, 2012. All three extensions were processed as 2nd level restructuring, and the extension on
September 2012 was approved by the Regional Vice President.

25.     Timeline. The evolution of the project, including adjustments introduced, are summarized in the
following Table.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

26.      Soundness of background analysis. For the most part, the prevailing overall project context, as
well as the sites conditions, were correctly diagnosed during Project preparation, which took place during
the period of October 2003 to April 2004. Project preparation benefitted from the comprehensive work
(2003/2004) in the Mailuu-Suu under the TACIS program of the European Commission, which provided
most of the needed background information for the initial planning of remediation works in the area. The
background analysis included reviews of existing analytical work, as well as the preparation of an
Environmental Impact Assessment, carried out and disclosed during Project preparation. Environmental
issues to be addressed by the Project were prioritized, based on these studies’ findings. The PAD
contained an elaborate assessment of the Government’s capabilities – or lack of - to address
environmental liabilities as well as procedures to respond to natural hazards, with a thorough evaluation
of the institutional and regulatory framework, both at the national and international levels through
coordination with experts.

27.      Assessment of risks. The risks identified in the PAD (Section C.5, p.16) were overall properly
identified 9 and addressed. However, in hindsight, a few risks were underestimated or not fully
acknowledged, such as the risk to install high tech/high costs stations for landslide monitoring and the
risk of longer than expected implementation time due to short construction season in Mailuu-Suu area
together with the specific nature of the uranium mine tailing remediation works for which there are few
capable contractors in the country. For this more mitigation measures could have been designed upfront,
in particular assessing options for vandalized landslide monitoring stations and focusing on clearly
defined closing plans, clearly indicating when relocation of radio-active materials could stop and when
covering and drainage measures should start to “close” the site. Also the risk that capacity building and
preparation of National Management and Response Plan, including study tours and training, would be
insufficient for evidence of improved capacity for timely and appropriate response to disasters by
cooperating national and sub-national authorities should have been acknowledged and incorporated in the
risk section for the Project. Still, many risks were reasonably identified, based on previous projects
experience, such as such as resistance by local communities in Mailuu-Suu to the relocation of the mine
tailing material over the public road. The preparation work, which was quite comprehensive, included
work by other donor organizations, and the project could navigate surprisingly well through many
difficulties. Project design took into account existing experiences from post-disaster, reconstruction
emergency remediation projects, particularly with respect to project management, public communication/
transparency/ awareness building and institutional strengthening, which are key pillars to ensure
sustainability of the interventions and correctly identified risks related to cost overruns, O&M budget
allocations and local population.

28.      Incorporation of lessons learned. Numerous lessons learned in Central Asia and/or from post-
disaster projects funded by the World Bank were incorporated into the project design and certainly
contributed to the comparatively robust management capacity of the project, which survived the sudden
relocation of the implementing agency during implementation. A particularly positive point – even if
sometimes perceived as a “costly” option by the government – was the solid incorporation of international
experts into the project. Another positive aspect was the integrated approach selected for prioritization,
risk management and clean-up interventions. Experience sharing through visiting areas with similar


9
 E.g. controversy could develop surrounding intervention measures; occurrence of a major disaster before the project can
organize mitigation; unsatisfactory O&M budgetary allocations; national and local authorities do not work together to solve
hazard mitigation problems; local population unconcerned, and unwilling to support hazard mitigation activities in project areas.

                                                                9
intervention situations, such as the Wismut area in Germany, assisted the understanding of the Kyrgyz'
experts of the issues at stake and facilitated implementation of the Project. More and wider experience
sharing (f.i. Romania, Spain or the US) could have provided further benefits. However, the international
experts who participated in project preparation and implementation brought this experience, which
without doubt helped to ensure quality designs, appropriate environmental and health procedures, in
particular radiological monitoring of the workers and construction supervision procedures.

29.     However, at the time of appraisal, the Bank had still relatively little experience on interventions
specifically related to environmental mining legacy and tailings closure, which possibly caused the slow
start and an underestimation of time requirements for the studies and surveys still necessary to get to
works design and technical specifications for contracting. This issue is not unique to the DHMP and has
been experienced in similar project of that same generation (e.g., the Zambia Copperbelt Environment
Project).

30.      Implementation arrangements were straightforward at the Government level, as the
implementing agency was the Ministry of Ecology and Emergencies (MEE). later renamed as the
Ministry of Emergency Situations (MES), and particularly its Department for Emergency Monitoring and
Forecasting, and Mining Tailings Management 10 (DEMFMTM) which would oversee the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU). The latter would be composed by a manager, fiduciary and technical
specialists, and would be supported by technical international firms responsible to prepare the required
studies as well as helping in supervising implementation. This strong framework critically facilitated
project planning and implementation. A National Emergency Management Committee (NEMC) was
established with membership from relevant ministries and agencies involved in disaster emergency
management and response, responsible for overseeing the Project implementation and resolving any issue
related to inter-governmental agency coordination of the Project activities.

2.2 Implementation

31.      Government and MEE/MES 11 commitment. During project implementation, the Kyrgyz
Republic was affected by political and economic turmoil, particularly in 2005 and 2010, resulting in
changes of government. Surprisingly, according to the project records, these problems had only an
indirect impact on implementation, certainly causing delays in civil works execution and also affecting
mostly policy orientations of the institutions, for example:
              -    the lack of formal government adoption of the National Management and
                   Response Plan (NMRP), under Component 2 of the project, due to government
                   changes12. The lack of formal government adoption however did not impact the
                   implementation of the other activities under the Project.



10
   The Kyrgyz Government restructured this initial institutional framework in the early phase of project implementation, setting
up a Ministry of Emergency Situation (MES), which was later relocated from Bishkek to Osh. The PIU eventually was relocated
to Osh as well. Out of the DEMFMTH, a National Agency for Management of Tailings was set up in 2012, responsible for the
management of mining environmental liabilities in the country, and overseeing the project activities.
11
   The former Ministry of Ecology and Emergenciess (MEE) was restructured into the Ministry of Emergency Situations (MES)
in 2005. The MEE departments involved with the environment are now part of the State Agency for Environment Protection and
Forestry. The remaining departments of MEE and the Department of Civil Defense have been merged into MES. MES Head
Quarters were relocated to Osh in 2009.
12
   In order for the Government to formally approve the plan, a Government resolution was required. While the reconciliation
process with the respective Ministries was completed, the process had to be repeated due to the changes in Government and plan
had been resubmitted to the Interim Government. However, the recurring elections in the country made it necessary to go through
the reconciliation process a number of times and final formal Government adoption did not take place.

                                                              10
               -    the relocation of the Ministry of Emergency Situations to Osh in 2009, which
                    caused the need to build up a new PIU, originally based in Bishkek, from the
                    ground. This relocation caused the project to be downgraded to U status. The
                    project was upgraded once the new PIU was fully established again.

32.    However, government commitment at all levels, including ministerial, was maintained
under the different authorities, which ensured the success of most project components, including:
           - the establishment of an adequate institutional framework for the management of
               environmental legacies in line with good international practices (creation of the
               National Agency for Tailings Management, under the MES)
           - Completion of Component 1 activities under full government budget after closure
               of the IDA Grants and maintenance of the sites (for several years now, with
               respect to earlier completed works)
           - The maintenance and functioning of the Emergency Response Centers (ERC).

Project implementation – Component 1
33.      Capacity building. An important activity of the project which allowed its implementation and to
achieve its objectives, as well as to manage environmental liabilities in the long-term, relates to the
continuous capacity building, including both on-the-job training and the organization of workshops,
courses or stages at foreign facilities (e.g., extensive training of laboratory staff for monitoring purposes
in Ukraine). Compared with the pre-DHMP situation, the institutional set-up was improved, the
management capacity by government staff developed (including technical, environmental and social
aspects), as well as the capacity of local private firms (contractors, labs, design institutes, etc.) to deal
with tailings.

34.     Risk based selection of interventions. A key activity at the start of the project – identified as part
of the early activities identified in the PAD (see Section 1.5) - was to prioritize, on the basis of a risk
assessment, the most significant contamination sources and select, the most important interventions
needed to make a difference, as well as identify the type of interventions necessary 13.




13
   An example is the Tailings Pond 3. While clearly identified as a very significant source of contamination, it had still to be
assessed whether remediation on site or the removal of the tailings material would be the most efficient intervention. The risk
assessment showed that removal represented a better option.

                                                                11
35.      A risk assessment and a prioritization
study was carried out in 2005/06 in order to select
the sites presenting the higher risks of
contamination or landslide in areas where the
population or water resources would be exposed –
as it was out of question that all mine tailings and
waste dumps in the area could be handled (see
map in Annex 2) due to limited resources and the
focus of the project. In 2006 the sites were
selected; and detailed surveys and the engineering
planning could start, as a basis for contracting the
works. Of the existing 36 sites identified, 15 were
selected and remediated14 – in addition to broader
activities, such as strengthening of riverbanks,
which reduced the impacts from other sites where
no direct other works were taken place, the partial
removal of unstable materials at the top of a
landslide area dominating TP3 (the so-called
“Tectonic Triangle”) and infrastructure works to
remove WD5 and TP3.

36.      In order to achieve a credible
classification of individual sites (high priority, low
priority or no need for remediation, for more
details see Tables 1 and 2 in Annex 2), an Figure 2. Schematic sequence of the overall methodology
assessment and comprehensive decision process applied under component 1 of the DHMP (source
was implemented (see Figure 2). Based on the Geoconsult/Wisutech report, 2006).
national legal background and the international best
practice, the criteria applied were as follows:

               -    the effective dose for the population should be below 1 mSv/a15;
               -    uncontrolled release of mining and milling wastes (dump and tailings material)
                    due to erosion cannot be tolerated; and,
               -    threat to humans, livestock or property due to structural instability of waste
                    storage facilities (endogenous failure such dam or slope collapse, destruction by
                    exogenous events such as landslides or seismic activity) must be prevented.

37.      Remedial actions were deemed necessary for sites which, in their state prior to the Project, did not
satisfy any of these conditions. These objects were rated as high-priority. An important criterion in the


14
   Other activities which reduced the impacts of other sites, for example stremgthening of riverbanks (e.g. of the Aylampa river, a
west side affluent of the Maillu-Suu river, south of the city, affecting TPs 1, 4 and 23) or on the Kara Agach river, a west side
affluent, upstream the city, affecting WD 6 and others. See map in Annex 2.
15
   The amount of radiation or the `dose' received by people is measured in millisieverts (mSv). The Sievert belongs to the
international system of metric units. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP, http://www.icrp.org)
recommends limiting artificial irradiation of the public to an average of 1 mSv (0.001 Sv) of effective dose per year, not
including medical and occupational exposures. The Earth's crust is made up of materials that are naturally radioactive. Uranium,
for instance, is dispersed throughout rocks and soil, mostly at very low concentrations. They nearly all emit gamma rays which
irradiate the whole body more or less uniformly. The radiation doses vary according to the rocks and soils of the area and the
building materials in use but the global yearly average is 0.46 millisieverts. For comparison, radiation levels inside the US capitol
building are 0.85 mSv/a, because of the uranium content of the granite structure.

                                                                12
decision process was the added value to the society which could be achieved as a "side-effect" of
remediation (or, conversely, the public nuisance which comes from a remediation option). This
comparatively "soft" criterion could play a decisive role, especially regarding the acceptance of the
overall remediation strategy by public stakeholders and affected population groups. This was a clear
factor for the decision to relocate the entirety of the materials of Waste Dump no 1 to Waste Dump no 2
when the amount of disposed materials were higher than originally estimated.

38.      The activities planned under component 1 have been completed (98% at Closing Date, 100% at
ICR), in spite of many difficulties, including delays in preparatory planning and surveys, periodic
difficulties to monitor the contractors, difficulties by the PIU and the supervision consultant team16 to
make timely and sound decisions for timely implementation, and, not less, harsh and lengthy winter
conditions and accompanying muddy and rainy spring conditions in several instances, including during
the critical 2011/12 winter season.

39.      Monitoring of waters. The monitoring of water parameters is not relevant anymore due to change
of the indicator for PDO 1 following the restructuring in June 2011 (see paragraph 10 above). However, it
is and will be a critical instrument to control surface and ground waters in Mailuu-Suu, and the
establishment of a suitably 17 equipped local monitoring laboratory and detailed and specifically defined
monitoring program, including detailed training, represents one of the great achievements of the project.
At first, the monitoring was executed with the support of the German Geological Survey (BGR) during
the period 2006 to 2008, using foreign laboratories. Measurements were then carried out in January and
May 2015 18. The laboratory established in Mailuu-Suu is now able to continue monitoring using local
equipment and properly trained staff, which is much more sustainable.

40.      Also, sporadic hostility from communities caused implementation delays, e.g., in 2010 during
which activities progressed at a slow pace. Key concerns were related to relocation of radio-active
materials, preferences to relocate the materials much further away from the town and requests for direct
financial assistance as a financial compensation scheme for living in such area was available during
Soviet times. These conflicts were overcome through improved communication and consultation, the
Additional Financing, which provided sufficient funds to fully relocate Waste Dump No. 1 and pro-active
initiatives to bring the required national and international expertise by the PIU, the government and head
of the villages and community groups.

Project implementation – Component 2

41.      Subcomponent 2.1: the key activity under Component 2 was the capacity building to strengthen
the ability of the MEE/MES, administrations at various levels, and local communities to fulfill better their
duties and functions, create better awareness, and be better prepared in case of disasters. Spreading
knowledge on disaster preparedness and encouraging government agencies and local communities was a
specific focus within the project areas (Mailuu-Suu and villages near the selected landslide areas) and
preparation of regulations and a National Management and Response Plan (NMRP).

42.      The NMRP covers the full range of requirements in anticipation of or in response to major


16
   The long-term supervision contract between the PIU and the international technical firm specialized in remediation of uranium
tailings has been critical to the success of the component. However the relationship has been sometime challenging for different
reasons, including the perceived high cost of the activity, and caused at times negative effects regarding reporting (no detailed
final report has been produced, for example, for the remediation works at WD1 and 2, and TP3 and 18) and decision making.

disasters, accidents and other emergencies. It also provides the basis to initiate long-term community
recovery and mitigation activities. The NMRP establishes interagency mechanisms for government
involvement in, and coordination of, domestic incident management operations. This includes
coordinating structures and processes requiring: (i) support on a national basis for incidents of national
importance; (ii) support for incidents of regional or rayon significance; and (iii) support to incidents at a
village or community level. It distinguishes between incidents that require a national response and the
majority of incidents occurring each year that are handled by responsible local government or agencies
through other established authorities and existing Plans. In addition, the NMRP: (i) recognizes and
incorporates the various jurisdictional and functional authorities including local and regional
governments; (ii) details the specific management roles and responsibilities of the MES and other
departments and agencies; and (iii) establishes the multi-agency organizational structures and processes
required. The Plan is applicable to all government departments and agencies that may be requested to
provide assistance or conduct operations in the context of actual or potential disasters. This includes
organizations which have a role to play, such as community-based groups or NGOs.

43.     While the plan was prepared as part of the project, due to the Government changes, the plan could
not be formally adopted by the Government yet. However, the National Platform for Disaster Risk
Reduction (NP DRR) is supported by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction19 and other international
organizations, as part of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. It includes many of the
elements of the NMPR, for example the set-up of a communication network involving government, civil
society and international organizations, and including preparedness and response plans. The NP DRR and
NMRP are not yet fully functioning at the latter level and the MES continues to work on its
implementation.

44.     Subcomponent 2.2 – Based on the screening of landslide areas, risk assessments and prioritization,
five pilot landslide areas were selected for installing real-time landslide monitoring systems. These,
automated monitoring systems, with data transferred to computers in the community at risk were installed
and became operative in 2007. Later however, all of these sites became dysfunctional as a result of
vandalism and theft of instruments and infrastructure (not an uncommon feature in similar projects in
developing countries worldwide) 20. As a result of these events, the Disaster Preparedness and Monitoring
(DPM) component initiated a low cost/low tech approach for landslide monitoring and early warning in
2011. Training, awareness raising and landslide monitoring materials were implemented in the five areas
where the automated monitoring systems became dysfunctional. The training of and discussion with the
elders and decision makers was carried out for adult community members and school in Taram Bazar 21
which is of specific landslide risk. In addition, a repeater information and training campaign was
delivered to the school children in summer 2012.

45.      Subcomponent 2.3 - Monitoring system in Mailuu-Suu. The radiological analytical laboratory in
the local branch of the State Sanitary and Epidemiological Commission was established, installed and put
into operation by a team of international experts hired by the project and recommended by the
International Atomic Energy Agency. Local staff from the laboratory and the monitoring department in
the Ministry of Emergency Situations was internationally trained, and a detailed specific monitoring
program developed, and practiced with the designated staff responsible for sampling and monitoring.
Due to the very specialized nature of the laboratory equipment which is required for radiological

20
   This potential risk was suspected but Government at the time of project design opted for implementing the so-called high
tech/high cost option
21
   During the ICR mission, the school directly threatened by a potential landslide was visited, and teachers as well as students
were implementing the measures they had had been trained for.

                                                                14
monitoring in a low costs-low capacity environment the procurement and installation of the equipment
took longer than planned. Since 2012, Mailuu-Suu has now the capabilities to undertake analyses of gross
radioactive substances and the radiation levels in water and groundwater samples, thus enabling a more
precise picture of Mailuu-Suu’s risk situation regarding surface water and drinking water. However, the
long-term sustainability of the laboratory and regular state monitoring would require further institutional
and financial strengthening by the Government.

46.     Project management under Component 3 worked reasonably well most of the time, in spite of
being frequently the cause of implementation delays. Difficulties included: (i) a high turn-over of staff,
particularly during the initial stages of the project, and at the time of the relocation of the MES and the
PIU from Bishkek to Osh in 2009 when the entire staff had to be renewed and management functions
were stopped for about 6 months; (ii) temporary procurement problems around 2007; and (iii) more
frequently, problems in consultants and contractors supervision. However, the Ministries’ commitment to
implement the project was key in solving, together with the Bank team, these issues.

47.     No changes in PDOs or project activities were proposed at Mid-term Review (August 2007). At
that time, only a few sites had been rehabilitated in Mailuu-Suu under component 1 and the main works,
including TP3 and 18, and WD1 and 2 were still at the planning stage. Most activities under component 2
were on track.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

48.      M&E Design: The M&E Design depended on technical and social audit reports, sample surveys,
project progress reports and supervision and evaluation mission reports. There were no indicators for
which a quantitative baseline or target value was defined. There was also somewhat of a disconnect
between the scope and budget of the activities and the ambitious PDO and its indicators, which caused the
project indicators to not comprehensively cover the actual scope of the Project together with the fact that
not all tailing ponds and waste dumps would be subject to remediation under the Project. In addition, in
an area as dilapidated as Mailuu-Suu, it would be difficult to obtain high satisfaction from population, in
particular as there was direct financial compensation available during Soviet times for residents in the
area. Likewise for high satisfaction for disaster preparedness which population can typically only evaluate
during the times of disasters and measuring disaster response and is otherwise an abstract term. The
project’s monitoring indicators were revised and realigned in 2011 when detailed data became available
from the detailed design and the extensive environmental and geotechnical site investigations, executed as
part of the design for remediation works, and in order to monitor better actually measurable results rather
than less concrete targets.

49.     M&E Implementation: During implementation of Component 1 and after compilation of
evidences from the different studies, it appeared that there was a disconnect between PDO 1(i) (see
paragraph 8 and 10) and its indicator, which would be difficult to measure, if at all, during
implementation and probably a long time after the ICR. In addition, due to the natural background of an
area located within a uranium mining district (see Fig. 1), not all sources affecting quality of waters could
be removed by the Project. The indicators, and related targets, were consequently modified in June 2011
Additional Financing in order to be able for the project to measure results, introducing the concept of
discontinuation of contamination infiltrations at the selected processed sites, rather than monitoring the
impact on the water system. In addition, the targets for the two indicators applying to Component 2 were
also modified in June 2011 to use more concrete facts and based on the actual situation.

50.      In addition to the Results Framework, the PIU used a number of relatively strong instruments to
follow-up the progress on both Components 1 and 2, including the PDOs, and reported progress regularly
in its quarterly and annual reports.

                                                     15
51.      For Component 1, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was prepared on the basis of the
project EIA (2004) and a site specific EMP was drafted in 2008 regarding the removal of TP3 and its
relocation at the TP6 site. Both included physical as well as qualitative indicators and were implemented
carefully. With respect to Component 2, a M&E plan was set up with the support of an international
consultant. Results were reported regularly in the PIU’s quarterly reports. The supervisor final report
summarizes the main interventions and their respective results data22.

52.      Monitoring of rivers and groundwaters in the Mailuu-Suu area. A laboratory was installed
and equipped in Mailuu-Suu to monitor waters, and a series of weather as well as monitoring wells were
established under the project. During the period of 2006-2008, a water monitoring network was set up
(including about 36 measurement points and additional wells) with the support and funding of the
Geological Survey of Germany (BGR). Measurements upstream, at different Tailing Ponds or Waste
Dumps drainage location and downstream were regularly carried out.

53.      The importance of the role played by national and international consultants regarding monitoring
and evaluation has to be emphasized, for example through the Panel of Experts (PoE) regarding the
relocation of TP3, or by IAEA experts regarding the overall management of tailings and wastes and the
radiological monitoring, or ensuring that national and international standards were applied. M&E was
mostly rated as moderately satisfactory to satisfactory during project implementation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

54.     Procurement. Procurement management was rated satisfactory in project ISRs. The ratings were
downgraded twice during project life, to moderately unsatisfactory in 2007 as a result of preparation of
bids and bidding procedures which appeared to have been unrealistic and caused delays (several
procurement packages had to be canceled for reason of bids that by far exceeded the cost estimates) and
tendered again; and in 2009, as a result of the collapse of the PIU following its relocation to Osh. Apart
from a period of PIU relocation, it had adequate procurement staff.

55.      Financial management. Financial management arrangements were mostly rated as satisfactory
in ISRs during the project life. Due to the resignation of the PIU during its relocation to Osh, the FM
rating was downgraded temporarily. Financial Management Reports (FMRs) and audit reports were
prepared and delivered on time. Audit reports were unmodified (clean) for all years of implementation.
There was one issue related to the payment of taxes related to consultants’ contracts under the PHRD
Grant which was resolved through the use of MES counterpart funds. The Management Letter for the
final audit report highlighted an issue related to a financing gap that developed between early October and
early December 2012, due to unanticipated additional works carried out by Contractors in diversion from
design and without sufficient analysis of financial consequences. The Bank has received adequate
clarifications from the Government that the issue will be resolved through increase of counterpart funds
for the remaining part of the works executed after the Closing Date of the Grants.

56.      Safeguards. The project was not expected to result in any potential large scale, significant and/or
irreversible environmental or negative socio-economic impacts and the environmental screening category

   WISUTEC, November 2012. Assessment of the status of remediation projects financed by DHMP and current state of all
relevant objects of former Uranium mining in the area of Mailuu Suu with recommendations for further actions

                                                           16
was assessed as “B23”. An EIA and an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) were prepared, financed
by the EU-funded Joint Environmental Program (JEP). All safeguard documents, including the EIA and a
Resettlement Framework Policy (RFP) were disclosed in April 2004, both in the Kyrgyz Republic, at the
MEE (now MES), and at the Bank Infoshop, and public consultations organized. They were re-disclosed
in March 2011 as part of preparation of the Additional Financing.

57.     Compliance with safeguards policies has been rated as satisfactory during the whole project life
and no significant issues are mentioned in the ISRs or Aide Memoires. This result is due to the strong
involvement of national and international specialists 24 in project overlook during implementation,
including experts support to the Bank team.

58.     Among the Bank’s Operational Policies (OP) for Safeguards, three policies were triggered. These
were (i) Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), (ii) Safety of Dams (OP 4.37), and (iii) International
Waters (OP 7.50). A fourth policy, Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12), was triggered in 2008 when
families living on WD5 (Kara Arash area) had to be relocated before the removal of the waste dump.

59.     OP 4.12. A RFP had been prepared during project preparation, but the policy was not formally
triggered until 2008, when several families were resettled, as they had been living on the WD5 radioactive
waste deposit. Meanwhile, all resettlement activities envisaged under the original project had been
successfully concluded and no major grievances or complaints were recorded.

60.     The project addressed Tailing Dams safety and applied OP 4.37 - Safety of Dams. The
preparation team included the necessary expertise (including geo-technical, risk management, hydrology
and seismic) to review the tailing dams, which was done in sufficient depth. Included in the preparation
team was a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency to strengthen expertise with regard to
broader risk management associated with the radiological risks related to the tailings. Safeguards and
mitigations measures were included in the EMP, and implemented accordingly. Examples of description
of works can be found in the supervisor final report regarding the design and implementation of tailings
dam stability, in particular the largest one, TP6.

61.      The project triggered OP 7.50 - Projects on International Waterways, as the Mailuu-Suu River
flows into the Naryn River, which is an international waterway. Project interventions were foreseen to
improve the quality of water flows to downstream riparian states. A notification letter was nevertheless
sent in February 2004 to Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan to inform these riparian states about the
proposed interventions. Tajikistan and Uzbekistan responded in writing, and have reiterated their support
to the project activities.

62.     As agreed in the Grant Agreement, the decision to remove TP3 materials would trigger the
preparation of a site specific EIA, and the contracting of a Panel of Experts (PoE) to oversee and provide
advice regarding removal planning and implementation. The EIA, as well as an Environmental
Management, Monitoring and Mitigation Plan (EMMMP) were prepared during in 2007/2008, including
consultations at the local and national levels. The PoE included a Waste Safety (provided by the IAEA), a
Geotechnical and a Tailings Relocation specialist, who provided recommendations which were
incorporated in the TP3 documents and taken into account during implementation.



23
   The project, today, would probably be categorized as an “A”, considering the potential implications to deal with mining dams
However, it can be said that the prepared safeguard documents were comprehensive and would be acceptable for a category “A”
project.
24
   Particular mention has to be made to the strong continuous cooperation between the project, the Bank team and the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), from preparation to closure.

                                                              17
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

63.      The remediation measures for the tailings and waste dumps have been designed, using
international best practices, for robust performance and minimal maintenance and monitoring
requirements after finalization of the works and a detailed monitoring program that can use the locally
established and trained laboratory has been prepared. The Government has put in place the institutional
set-up for the maintenance of the waste dumps and mine tailings by transferring them to the established
National Agency for Tailings Management (NATM) who will have the responsibility for maintenance of
the tailings and waste bodies. Maintenance works on the cleaning of drainage ditches along the mine
tailings were already observed during the ICR mission. Also the Government finalized the remainder of
the works at the Mine Tailing Facilities Nos. 3 and 18 and Waste Dumps Nos. 1 and 2 with government
resources after the Closing Date and full utilization of the Grants.

64.      Budget and staffing challenges remain, however, both for the regular maintenance of the mine
tailings and waste dumps as well as for long-term monitoring of drainage, river and groundwater. Such
monitoring program is a critical activity to ensure the safety to use water for drinking or irrigation
purposes in Mailuu-Suu as well as downstream. Regular state monitoring would indicate whether there
exist potential additional sources of contamination 25 which should be dealt with. The monitoring
                                   26
laboratory and a detailed program have been set up under the project, but continued funding for regular
execution is a challenge. The Ministry has applied for additional support from the International Atomic
Energy Agency in this area. In addition, the community-based landslide monitoring system needs more
resources and continued retraining of the communities from the Ministry of Emergency Situations to
become fully functional in all the critical landslide areas.

65.     Considering the potential additional sources of contamination, as well as – mainly – the existence
of natural uranium mineralization underground which might affect the quality of waters and could not be
removed (see Fig. 1), there is also an important need for interventions in the water distribution area to
address the problem with quality of drinking water in a more comprehensive way, i.e., by upgrading the
existing water catchment station upstream and improving the distribution system.

66.     As the objective of the project was to focus on the highest priority interventions, there remains a
need for continued remediation works in the area for the tailing ponds and waste dumps not included in
the high priority category and as part of the 2005 risk assessment, for example TP2, 8, 13, 14 and possibly
TP18 27; as well as WD7 and 12 (see Annex 2). This need for further intervention measures dealing with
uranium mining rehabilitation is not only present in Kyrgyz Republic, but affects all countries with
uranium legacy issues. In order to better deal with these issues in the countries in Central Asia, the IAEA
has established a Coordination Group for Uranium Legacy Sites (CGULS) specifically for the IAEA
member states of Central Asia to provide a forum for information exchange and provision of technical
advice and coordinate the actions of the members to maximize synergies and avoid duplication of efforts.


25
   Many tailings and waste sites not included under the high-risk priority list of the project are still present in the area, not to
mention the possibility that some natural occurrence of uranium mineralization which cannot be removed might constitute
important sources of contamination.

Production Legacy Site in Kyrgyz Republic. Project report.
27
   A particular case of works which might be needed in the future is the potential removal of TP18 – a smaller deposit, possibly
resulting from a spill-over from TP3, on the banks of the Mailuu-Suu river, a short distance downhill the removed TP3 (see Annex
2) - the Government and the Bank team agreed, after long evaluations and discussions, that these materials did not represent a
significant risk and were left in place after coverage As there was insufficient funding and time remaining under the Project,
removal would have been unfeasible anyway. A team of IAEA experts visiting the area at the time of the ICR mission expressed
they would recommend its removal under a potential follow-up operation.

                                                                18
In order to increase financial support for increasing remediation activities and systematic management of
risks associated with uranium production legacy sites, the UN General Assembly Second Committee
approved a draft resolution on November 14, 2013, calling upon the international community to help
Central Asian states clean up uranium tailing ponds dating back to Soviet times. This resolution would
underscore the value of regional co-operation and would call upon the international community to share
knowledge on remediation of uranium and other radio-active tailings. The nine co-sponsors of the draft
resolution included Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.

67.     In addition, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic is presently working to develop mining
(mostly gold and base metals) industry and improve the management of the sector. Environmental
Management, including monitoring and mine closure are important elements of such a development and
will increase public support for mining activities. Combined mining and environmental management
represents an opportunity to further build up on the experience gained under the project and contribute to
the economic development of the country while addressing community concerns related to mining and
increasing public support.

68.      Under the project, a lot of experience has been gained regarding the management of mining
environmental liabilities, both by government regulators and technical staff, as well as by local
contractors. Such an experience is being shared through workshops and conferences as there is a high
demand for sharing experiences of actual radio-active mine tailing rehabilitation in Central Asia as this
project is the only one in the region with demonstrable experience of both planning and implementation
with accompanying technical information of radio-active mine tailing management. The demand for such
sharing of experiences can be witnessed by the regional conference which was organized by the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) to "Strengthen the capacity to respond to Emergency and Risk
Assessment in the Kyrgyz Republic and promote regional dialogue to establish cooperation”, where the
Ministry of Emergency Situations shared their detailed mining rehabilitation experiences. Further sharing
of experience with other countries in Central Asia is planned for the next CGULS meeting at IAEA in
Vienna.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

69.     Relevance of objectives and design. The Project’s objectives remain highly relevant, as well as
the premise that environmental sustainability is a prerequisite to a flourishing local, regional and national
economy. The relevance of the Project’s design reflects proper diagnosis at the time of appraisal, as well
as consistency with both the Project’s stated objectives and the Kyrgyz Republic’s development priorities
during the Project’s lifetime.

70.      The project’s objective and design remain highly relevant to the current Kyrgyz Republic’s
development and environmental priorities to ensure environmental safety. The Mid-term Development
Program of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2012-2014 specifically mentions ensuring environmental safety and
comprehensive safety of the population and the territory from natural disasters and catastrophes as one of
the key objectives, while referring to the high altitude characteristic of the overwhelming majority of the
country (96%) which predetermines high vulnerability of ecosystems to natural and anthropogenic
influences and the need for coordination of measures to ensure radiation safety within the framework of
the International Atomic Energy Agency. This is also evidenced by the establishment of the Coordination
Group for Uranium Legacy Sites (CGULS; see paragraph 68 above.

71.     The project’s objectives also remain consistent with the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy’s

physical infrastructure, while at the same time taking into account climate change, environmental
sustainability, and regional considerations.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

72.     The PDO consisted of three parts: (i) minimize the exposure of humans, livestock, and riverine
flora and fauna to radionuclides associated with abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps
in the Mailuu-Suu area; (ii) improve the effectiveness of emergency management and response by
national and sub-national authorities and local communities to disaster situations; and (iii) reduce the
potential loss of life and property in key landslide areas of the country. The overview of achievements of
the PDO indicators is outlined below.

73.      PDO Indicator 1 - Discontinuation of pollution infiltration of radionuclides and associated heavy
metals into the groundwater from selected high-risk mine tailings and waste dumps. Satisfactory. The
interventions planned and completed under PDO1 (Component 1), included elaborate and detailed
geotechnical and environmental site investigations and risk assessment focusing on the high-risk mine
tailings and waste dumps. The resulting cleanup and remediation measures were implemented with good
quality, completeness and according to the design. The completion report submitted by the international
construction supervisor 28confirms that the infiltration of pollutants such as radionuclides and associated
heavy metals into the groundwater from these objects has discontinued (e.g., TP3, WD1, WD2, WD5,
WD6, TP2, TP13 and others, see Annex 2). At the Closing Date, the remaining works included surface
drainage, landscaping and greening on some sites (TP3 and TP6), which have been completed during the
Implementation Completion period by September 2013. Thus the Project fully met this PDO Indicator
which was – in the sense of pollution management and the mitigation of risks for community health and
safety – the key priority of the project. Also, activities such as the isolation of hazardous mine wastes
stored at abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps, and their protection from disturbance
by natural processes, such as landslides and floods, and from leaching and dispersal processes associated
with ground- and surface-water drainage were the most complex challenges in the project. Among all
project activities Component 1 required the highest level of engineering and scientific expertise, and
posed the key challenge regarding supervision, oversight and decision-making. Consequently, the largest
portion of the project’s resources was allocated to the mine tailing and waste dump remediation.

74.      PDO indicator 2 - Evidence that a disaster hazard monitoring, warning and response system is
functioning and being used effectively by cooperating national, oblast and raion authorities, and local
communities. Moderately Satisfactory. The target value for this PDO indicator of “Emergency Response
Centers established and operative around the clock and the response time for all inventoried potential
landslide areas lies below 24 hrs” has been fully achieved, as Emergency Response Centers (ERC) are
established in Bishkek, Osh, Jalalabad, Naryn, Batken, Issyk-Kul and Talas and operative around the
clock and the response time of the Oblasts is now less than 24 hours as the reliable communication
system allows the national, oblasts and raion authorities to communicate directly and to coordinate a
response within a day. The Ministry had determined the establishment of the Emergency Response Center
network as a high priority task designed to ensure that activities of the Unified State Emergency
Prevention and Rehabilitation System, the Inter Ministerial State Emergency Committee and the activities
of the Ministry of Emergency Situations can be coordinated during natural and man-caused emergencies.
The system allows the ERC system to transfer to satellite communication link which provides for

responsiveness and reliable communication modes, with a back-up communication system available as
well. This reliable communication system was established – and operated and maintained now for about 7
years under the MES and already demonstrated its significant usefulness in cases of disaster and flooding
events and harsh winter conditions affecting populations and cattle (emergency fodder feeding) and many
avalanches disasters in the winter of 2011/2012.

75.      The National Management and Response Plan developed under this component, including the
extensive capacity building, training and study tours, covers the full range of requirements in anticipation
of or in response to major disasters, accidents and other emergencies. It also provides the basis to initiate
long-term community recovery and mitigation activities. The NMRP establishes interagency mechanisms
for government involvement in, and coordination of, domestic incident management operations. The Plan
is applicable to all government departments and agencies that may be requested to provide assistance or
conduct operations in the context of actual or potential disasters. This includes organizations which have a
role to play, such as community-based groups or NGOs. Due to the frequent government changes, the
plan could not be formally adopted by Government yet, for which reason the PDO indicator is rated as
Moderately Satisfactory. While the plan could not yet be formally adopted, the National Platform for
Disaster Risk Reduction (NP DRR) supported by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, including
the set-up of an inter-ministerial management Secretariat and involving the participation of NGOs, Civil
Society Organizations and multi- and bi-lateral aid organizations 29, includes many of the elements of the
NMPR and the MES continues to work on its implementation. Facilitation for the implementation of the
NMRP is further supported by the Bank/Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery through a
Grant to: (i) Improve Countrywide Operations of Management Center of Crisis Situations: (ii) Develop
the National Integrated System of Information and Warning of the Population; and (iii) Implement the
Single State Emergency Dispatcher 30.

76.      PDO indicator 3 - Evidence that real-time landslide monitoring, warning and response systems
are functioning and being used effectively by cooperating national, oblast, and rayon authorities, and local
communities (via technical and social audit reports). Moderately Unsatisfactory. The PDO indicator 3 has
been incompletely achieved. The target value of the indicator – the setting up of five automated landslide
monitoring stations equipped with remote control - was initially completed by 2007, but then did not
recover from severe setbacks related to theft and vandalism of the equipment. The high costs per site and
complex management of the automated stations and apparent difficulty in maintaining the system and
protect the equipment against theft prompted project to find and implement a different approach to a more
sustainable solution. A community-based landslide monitoring system, with simple, robust, low-tech
methods was designed and established and piloted at the five sites. The support and uptake of the head of
villages and communities was lower for this low cost community-based landslide monitoring system
except at Taram Bazar where this low tech/low costs landslide monitoring and warning system was
sustainable due to involvement of school children below the landslide area, a high participatory attitude
and degree of engagement and interest and follow up trainings and involvement of teachers. At the time
of the ICR mission, the system was operational in Taram Bazar and monitored by local authorities and


29
   According to the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNUSDR; http://www.unisdr.org/partners/countries/kgz), the main
objective of Kyrgyzstan National Platform is to establish effective disaster risk management mechanism, develop and integrate
program-targeted risk reduction activities into the national country development programs. It is targeted to advance and
implement disaster risk reduction (DDR) policies at all levels, coordination, analysis and consultation in the key sectors, which
require joint and coordinated actions involving all parties. It will provide for a process to involve all parties, including state
authorities, local administrations, international organizations, non-government organizations, civil society. The Secretariat has
been established under the coordination of the MES to provide organizational and technical support for the Inter-ministerial
Commission on Civil Protection of the Kyrgyz Republic, in order to address issues of interaction of this commission, and support
for the Disaster Response Coordination Unit, which is represented by international organizations and civil society.

                                                               21
MES, but needs scaling up to other high landslide risk areas and villages. A positive aspect is that the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic now possesses a model and template and all training materials which
could be easily replicated and deployed at other landslide areas (the information and training
documentation is available at MES and government staff has been trained).

3.3 Efficiency

77.      The original PAD includes an economic analysis (PAD Annex 9) based on the benefits of the
reduced annual probability of avoided loss due to reduced probabilities of failures of landslides and
tailings and the probability of flooding. However, while landslides involving precariously placed uranium
tailings at Mailuu-Suu over a 30 year period, killed people and destroyed buildings, the benefits in the
Project Appraisal Document were based on the assumptions of with and without project of failures of
landslides and to a certain extent fairly theoretical.

78.    For that reason, for the ICR a cost effectiveness approach has been used to compare the costs of
the remediation works at the mine tailings and waste dumps in Mailuu-Suu site with similar remediation
works in other countries, since there are no comparable works and therefore costs comparisons in the
Kyrgyz Republic.

79.     The comparison is based on the information from the amount of materials relocated from Tailings
Pond No. 3 and Waste Dump No. 1 and the total value of the contract. Based on this information, the total
costs for the specific remediation works on TPs and WDs represent US$ 25 per m3 of tailings material
and US$ 7 per m3 for waste dump material. Data for other countries range from less than US$2 to about
US$225, with an average varying from US$27 to 124 per cubic meter, depending of the country and
characteristics 31. The large range of unit costs is due to economies of scale achieved in very large clean-
up projects as well as the varying stringencies of national regulations in countries that have had clean-up
programs. The costs at Mailuu-Suu are reasonable in this comparison. In addition, the project follow a
risk based assessment in order to determine the highest priority mine tailings and waste dumps in order to
focus the funds on the maximum reduction of risk and only relocate materials with high priority and with
focusing on the closing plans also to stop relocating based on risk assessment rather than to remove all
materials present, including rocks. The time of preparation was efficient, and while implementation was
longer than foreseen, given the political events, harsh winters and rainy conditions during spring and
winter sufficiently efficient. Efficiency is therefore rated as Satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80.     The Project was successful in achieving its project development objective of minimizing the
exposure of humans, livestock, and riverine flora and fauna to radionuclides associated with abandoned
uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area by focusing on the highest priority
mine tailings and waste dumps, which was the primary focus of the project and to which the major part of
the project funds were allocated. Moreover, the project successfully introduced in the Kyrgyz Republic an
approach for addressing mining-induced environmental remediation according to international good
practice, with special emphasis on a risk-based approach. This approach was a novelty in the Central
Asian region and had not been previously tested. The most important achievements of the project in this
respect were the strategic prioritization of interventions according to a risk assessment methodology, and


31
   Based on data from the German Bundesministerium fur Wissenschaft (Ministry of Science), Studienreihe Nr. 90 (1999). The
costs in this study are estimated on a per ton basis, and they have been recalculated estimating a density of 1.7 per ton. Prices
updated to present day USD.

                                                               22
during remediation the constant updating of the risk situation, with a final evaluation of the residual risk,
and the analysis of the incremental risk reduction, and cost, that further remediation activities would
entail. This approach became especially important towards the end of the cleanup activities, when a “cut-
off” point needed to be determined, and the questions answered “how clean is clean enough”, i.e., an
acceptable and sustainable remediation goal determined. This final risk assessment in itself constituted an
innovative approach in Kyrgyzstan and opened a new methodological perspective for remediation and
pollution management projects. The project also led to the establishment of a functioning Emergency
Response Center network between the different provinces in Kyrgyz Republic and the development of the
National Management and Response Plan, including the extensive capacity building, training and study
tours, covering full range of requirements in anticipation of or in response to major disasters, accidents
and other emergencies. The establishment of real-time landslide monitoring, warning and response
systems was not successful and only one community-based landslide monitoring system could be put in
place. However, by learning from the failure of the initial “hi-tech” approach under Component 2 MES
piloted successfully a more robust, community based, low-tech approach, with much higher levels of
community ownership and participation, and thus a higher degree of technical effectiveness, cost
efficiency, replication potential and sustainability.

81.      Relevance of the objective is rated as Highly Satisfactory and the design is rated Moderately
Satisfactory, largely due to the disconnect between the scope and budget of the activities and the
ambitious PDO and its indicators, which caused the project indicators to not comprehensively cover the
actual scope of the Project. Part one of the objective related to the exposure reduction to radionuclides
associated with abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste dumps is rated as Satisfactory and
successfully introduced in the Kyrgyz Republic a methodology for addressing mining-induced
environmental problems according to a risk-based methodology, meaning that, in addition to addressing a
critical part of potential or existing contamination sources in the project area, the project developed an
integrated approach for tackling similar environmental issues rather than dealing with them in a piecemeal
fashion. Part two of the objective related to the disaster hazard monitoring, warning and response system
is rated Moderately Satisfactory and the third part of the objective related to landslide risk monitoring is
rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory. However, it can be said that the project also introduced in the Kyrgyz
Republic on a pilot basis a low technology and low cost community based methodology which could
easily be replicated in other areas of the country. Efficiency is rated as Satisfactory. As a result, the
overall Project Outcome is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

82.      One of the higher objectives of the project was to contribute to poverty reduction through an
improved management of natural hazards risks and, applied to the Mailuu- Suu area, addressing mining
environmental liabilities. No specific survey or study could be carried out at project end regarding these
issues, as all funds were required to complete the relocation and remediation works at the tailing ponds
and waste dumps and such direct link between addressing mining environmental liabilities and poverty
reduction would be difficult to establish in an evidenced-based manner. It can be mentioned that the
construction of the service road at the right bank of the Mailuu-Suu River, riverbank strengthening,
reconstruction of metal bridge and bridge passage over the Kara-Agach River all contributed to
improvement of access to the settlements located upstream the Mailuu-Suu town, such as Kara-Agach,
Sary-Bee, Kolmo and Kopuro-Basshi and this contributed subsequently to improving economic well-
being of the local population and ensured flood protection for the Kara-Agach population.




                                                     23
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

83.     The project contributed to the following institutional changes and strengthening:
      -  Monitoring and management of radiation safety and of mining environmental liabilities. As this
         was the first project in Central Asia actually implementing physical remediation measures for
         radio-active mine tailing and waste dumps, a lot of capacity has been built at government level,
         technical staff, contractors and engineers how to manage these environmental liabilities in line
         with good international practice. Knowledge development regarding how to address mining
         environmental liabilities, particularly those related to uranium mining, including assessment and
         monitoring capacity, as well as a better understanding and application of international standards
         as also been a result of the Project and such experience is now being shared through workshops
         and conferences as there is a high demand for sharing experiences of actual radio-active mine
         tailing rehabilitation in Central Asia.
      - Under the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the following departments and networks have been
         created:
              o a "National Agency for Atomic and Radiation Security" was established under the
                  Ministry responsible for the development of new legislation on radiation safety,
                  regulation of radiation safety, national implementation of IAEA guidelines, and for the
                  development of project proposals for external funding;
              o a National Agency for Tailings Management (NATM) responsible for the management
                  and maintenance of the mine tailings and waste dumps;
              o a communication network involving local, regional and national authorities
      - The establishment of an improved institutional framework for the management of natural
         hazards in general (training and capacity building). The National Management and Response
         Plan developed, including the extensive capacity building, training and study tours, covers the
         full range of requirements in anticipation of or in response to major disasters, accidents and
         other emergencies. It also provides the basis to initiate long-term community recovery and
         mitigation activities. The NMRP establishes interagency mechanisms for government
         involvement in, and coordination of, domestic incident management operations.
      - Awareness by communities regarding the identification and monitoring of landslide risks,
         though more needs to be done.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

84.      As part of the implementation of activities under Component 1, a number of civil works had to be
carried out to move materials from sites to other locations where they had to be deposited, particularly in
the case of WD5 and TP3 which were integrated in a re-designed TP6 (see map, Annex 2). A road and
two bridges, one of them over the Mailuu-Suu river (see Fig. 3, Annex 2) were build, which proved to
facilitate access to settlements located upstream of the Mailuu-Suu city. The road, as it was constructed,
also provides a protection against flooding to the village of Kara Agach on the western bank of the river.
Both measures contribute to economic benefit of the population, improving the transport of goods from
and to upstream villages, and protecting private properties in the Kara Agach case.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

85.      While beneficiary surveys or end-of-Project stakeholder workshops did not take place due to
project funds depletion, extensive stakeholder consultations were held during Project preparation (e.g., as
part of the EIA process) and implementation. Based on project reports and Aide Memoires, it appears that
the various stakeholders were generally supportive of the project, with strong participation after 2010
under the landslides monitoring subcomponent. Under Component 1, the population of Mailuu-Suu

                                                    24
expressed concerns from time to time (e.g., regarding the planned intervention of WD 1 and 2, located
immediately above the city). All the concerns were responded through workshops held during
implementation and lot of information about radiation safety and radiation safety monitoring. The project
communication specialist, based in Mailuu-Suu, facilitated communication with the communities. It was
also in direct response to community concerns that the additionally discovered materials on waste dump
#1 were decided to be fully removed to Waste Dump No. 2 located further away from the town and based
on which the Additional Financing was prepared and approved.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

86.     At project completion, all infrastructure investments and clean-up activities were complete and
the assets created were of good quality. Sustainability of outcomes is based on: (i) robust and low
maintenance design for the remediation of the mine tailings and waste dumps; (ii) established Agency for
Tailings Management under the Ministry of Emergency Situations now owns the mine tailings and waste
dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area and the responsibility for further maintenance; (iii) developed detailed state
radiological monitoring program for water and soil monitoring with supply of laboratory equipment to the
laboratory in Mailuu-Suu which only requires low costs for maintenance and operation.

87.       As mentioned, a key challenge will be represented by the continuous and reliable provision of the
state budget required for the monitoring and maintenance activities over the longer term 32 . Detailed
monitoring and monitoring programs have been established and staff trained extensively. Also, their
implementation is part of a clear mandate for the National Agency for Tailings Management. A positive
indication of Government commitment to sustain operation and maintenance (O&M) under its own
budget at the project site is shown by the fact that maintenance of some of the earlier constructed drainage
facilities next to the mine tailings have been undertaken the last four years and the closure plan for TP 3
and 6 have been implemented successfully after the Closing Date and end of World Bank financing in
December 2012. However, during the ICR mission, the MES authorities were still negotiating with the
Ministry of Finance the required budget for the coming year and there exists a risk they do not obtain the
sufficient resources to keep the O&M programs on-going at the adequate level.

88.      The risk to the development outcomes are rated as low for Component 1. Regarding Component 2
on the one hand, a realistic O&M framework has been specified and Government has been committed
thus far, on the other hand, there is the risk for future underfunding of the O&M programs; therefore the
overall development outcome risk is rated as moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

89.     Project Design. Bank performance during Project preparation was Moderately Satisfactory. The
Project team was very efficient during the preparation phase in preparing a comprehensive and coherent
plan, within a comparatively short period of time (8 months from concept review to Board approval),


32
  As an example, monitoring would require an estimated 50,000 USD/year, based on the mentioned Voitsekhovych O.V., 2012
report.

                                                          25
building up on an earlier detailed inventory 33 of the Mailuu-Suu environmental liabilities. The initial
work program was well thought, incorporating the implementation of well identified urgent remediation
works and, in parallel, the carrying out of a risk assessment and prioritization study which produced a
clear blue print for an integrated approach to address the required interventions under Component 1. The
team was supported by a competent team of international experts with extensive experience in the
management of radioactive tailings. Project preparation documentation was readily available and
detailed, as was the PAD.

90.      However, in hindsight, the M&E framework showed some weaknesses, including: (i) there was a
disconnect between the initial outcome indicators, the planned interventions and the natural background
of radionuclides (and other heavy metals contaminants) under Component 1, as an improvement of the
water standards could only be measured after a longer period following project closure and not within a
realistic time frame, if at all, considering the natural background concentrations of radionuclides, heavy
metals, salinity and hydrocarbons present in the Mailuu-Suu area. These indicators and targets were
revised in 2011 to provide a more realistic monitoring framework, based on the discontinuation of
contamination sources at the selected high risk sites (see paragraph 10 and section 2.3 above); (ii) some of
the targets under all indicators were relatively vague and difficult to objectively measure. However, it
would have been difficult to have such precise M&E framework at the outset, given the mentioned limited
experience of the Bank in such projects and the novelty of such projects in the Central Asia region.

91.      Another, already mentioned weakness corresponds to the second sub-component of Component
2, related to landslide monitoring, under which the planned high tech/high costs option failed and had to
be replaced by the more realistic approach through the community based low tech/low costs option. As
mentioned, the risk34 of poor maintenance, neglect and vandalism was not specifically identified in the
PAD even if discussed with the Government during preparation and the potential lack of support by local
authorities regarding the community/based solution might have been later underestimated. This said, the
Bank was instrumental and worked closely and consistently with the Recipient to find a remedy /
substitute for the failed landslide monitoring systems.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

92.     Overall quality of implementation support. Positive and successful aspects of Project
supervision were noted over the whole implementation period. These included:
         -       Flexibility by the task team to adapt to changing circumstances (e.g., the adjustment
         related to the monitoring of landslides)
         -       Team’s trusted partnership with the Government authorities and the PIU, facilitating their
         discussions with consultants and contractors, as well as the management of fiduciary matters,
         including safeguards, procurement, disbursement and financial management
         -       Systematic participation of international technical experts in the task team regarding
         (uranium) tailings management and site restoration, as well as landslides
         -       Constructive relationships with consultants and contractors when it came to facilitate
         decision making related to implementation of works. A particular positive example is related to
         the removal of the complex TP 3 materials (see Annex 2), as the team facilitated the identification
         of solutions to resolve a transportation bottleneck, which allowed to finalize the removal in time
         -       Team’s persistence, through frequent supervision missions and close follow-up, in
         completing the project plans which allowed for the achievement of the outcomes. As examples, it


33
     Ref. to the 2004 EU Commission’s TACIS report, already mentioned earlier.
34
     As mentioned, the identification of risks in the PAD was otherwise realistic.

                                                                  26
         can be mentioned the solution, together with the Government, difficult implementation
         arrangements such as the successive re-contracting of PIU staff; as well as preparation of the
         necessary amendments during the final phase of the project (Additional Financing, extensions,
         etc).
         -      High level of technical expertise in team, resulting in hands-on, highly substance-oriented
         missions with very concrete technical discussions and joint elaboration of solutions to especially
         complex problems and situations. This technical capacity of the Bank team was recognized and
         highly appreciated by the Client.
         -      Proactive networking of Bank team with other international organizations to bring
         additional expertise and perspectives to the project. These organizations included the Federal
         Agency for Geosciences and Resources (Germany) as well as IAEA (Vienna).

93.      Supervision would include the following short-comings in terms of follow-up of the M&E
framework – for example, insufficient funding remained for surveys on stakeholder satisfaction (in
preparation for ICR) as these funds were allocated for the finalization of the relocation and remediation
works for mine tailing 3 and waste dump 1. In a general way, while community relationships represented a
continuous activity during implementation, as reflected in the project documents, e.g., through
communications, consultations and workshops, more might have been done, (e.g., the set-up of a formal
information center as well as regular surveys; communication with local authorities).For these reasons, the
rating of Bank supervision is Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

94.      The Project was well designed as Disaster Hazard and Mitigation Project and was prepared
efficiently and with high input of relevant international experts, there could have been more emphasis on
the landslide monitoring component and a more realistic M&E framework. During implementation, the
Bank responded proactively to issues that arose during implementation and adapted to the unpredictable
circumstances in the country and inherent to this type of operation with numerous and frequent detailed
technical support to the Government regarding project implementation. The Bank proved a highly flexible
and creative partner to the Recipient, more emphasis could still have been given to community outreach
and stakeholder and public satisfaction surveys.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

95.      Overall, the Government was supportive of the Project and its objectives, which constituted a
critical factor to success. As mentioned, in spite of two major country/government crises in 2005 and
2010, with major changes, support to the project seems to have been continuous with comparatively
shorter periods of interruption of works. Before and during preparation as well as during implementation,
priority was permanently given to improving the natural hazards and environmental liabilities
management in Mailuu-Suu. MES and the Government are working on the set-up of a National Platform
for Disaster Risk Reduction (NP DRR). In addition the Government showed its commitment to the
project and its objectives through, for example: (i) the continuous provision of counterpart funds during
implementation; (ii) the set-up and implementation of maintenance programs for the mine tailings and
waste dumps during the latter part of the project, as well as after closure, under own funds. Outside the
political/government events, there were general delays in the works of the Contractor which caused
implementation delays and the closing plans for the sites should have been agreed to earlier. On this basis
the Government performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.


                                                    27
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

96.       The project was managed by a PIU under the MES (later under the National Agency for Tailings
Management (NATM), depending of MES). MES was committed at all stages to the project objectives,
for example in:
-         Solving problems related to the PIU staff, either at project start or after relocation of the ministry
to Osh
-         Hosting and maintaining since 2006 the Emergency Response Centers system, which proved its
usefulness at several opportunities (e.g., the harsh winter conditions affecting populations and cattle and
many avalanches disasters in 2011/2012)
-         Setting up the National Agency for Tailings Management who will be in charge of environmental
liabilities management in the future
-         Implementing maintenance of rehabilitated sites starting in 2010, and completing interventions
as well as the closure plan after project end in December 2012 until present (September 2013)

97.      The PIU – in spite, again of high turnover difficulties at the beginning of the project, or following
the decision to move it to Osh – operated in general in a satisfactory way. The PIU team was mostly
constituted by management specialists, including for the fiduciary functions, and was supported regarding
the technical aspects by a team of international consultants contracted for the whole life of the project. It
also included a communication specialist, based in Mailuu-Suu, who dealt with community relationships.
No particular major problem was mentioned with respect to procurement or financial management
besides temporary problems which could generally be solved. The unit produced comprehensive quarterly
and annual reports agreed in the Grant Agreement, including M&E aspects, and used the project Results
Framework, regarding indicators, and the Environmental Management Plan (EMP), regarding
implementation criteria, as its main monitoring tools.

98.     However, some limitations were mentioned in the mission Aide Memoires, particularly with
respect to consultants and contractors supervision. As mentioned, several difficulties regarding works
implementation under contracts had to be solved with the support of the Bank team in order to facilitate or
unblock bottlenecks. At the very end of the project, it appears that project management showed a strong
weakening 35, as the focus was on continuing removal of TP3, rather than starting the closure of the sites
according to the closure plan, which resulted in a moderately unsatisfactory ultimate rating for project
management. However, at the time of the ICR mission, all works, including the cover of the mine tailing
and drainage had been completed, which would have resulted in a satisfactory rating.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

99.    Considering the overall support, commitment and achievements of the Government, MES and the
PIU regarding the project, as well as the mentioned shortcomings, the Borrower Performance is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

100.      The DHMP represents a type of complex project which is not frequently implemented by the


35
   According to the project final ISR, this rating was due to weak site supervision, poor control of Contractor's performance, poor
management of the supervision Consultant and excessive tolerance towards interventions from MES, which resulted in delays
and cost increases. At the time of the ICR mission, the works were all finalized in good condition.

                                                                28
Bank 36 or other donors because of the difficulty to deal with activities involving very specialized
technical and scientific concepts as well as highly sensitive topics for communities such as mining
environmental liabilities, not to mention radioactive ones, which might or might not affect them. In that
sense, lessons from the project can provide a number of key lessons which would be important to include
in the design of similar operations:

-       Communication and community participation. Strong emphasis on sustainability through
community involvement should be made from the beginning. Communication and community
participation is a key element in the design, implementation and sustainability of natural hazards and
environmental liability remediation projects and baseline surveys should be executed in order to better
understand the project’s impact on beneficiaries but also other qualitative aspects related to welfare,
poverty reduction etc. Such beneficiary assessment can be a valuable tool in understanding the social
gains made under a project and funds should have been clearly put aside in a separate category to ensure
availability.
      Project design.
      o    PDOs and key performance indicators are crucial. Stronger, specific and technically valid and
           consistent indicators and targets can help not only to monitor project progress properly, but also
           to react more quickly or adequately to events. The identification of proper baselines for
           subsequent impact evaluations should be established right from the beginning. Particularly in an
           operation involving specialized scientific concepts, such as uranium or heavy metals
           contamination.
      o    The importance to involve international or national experienced specialist from preparation to
           closure has also been demonstrated under the DHMP in order to deal with scientifically or
           technically complex concepts. In order to ensure that such complex projects dealing with low
           radio-active materials can be designed, implemented and controlled properly, it is very important
           to involve consultants that have worked on similar projects in other countries to allow for sharing
           good international practices not only with government officials, but also with local design
           institutes, consultants and contractors.
      o Early Development of the plans to close the mine tailings and waste dumps, stop
        relocation works, based on risk assessment and design of covering, drainage and
        vegetation measures should be part of initial engineering planning. The closure plans of
        similar projects should be part of the initial or early engineering planning, in order to
        allow for sufficient time and clear guidelines to decide on the cut-off criteria based on
        risk assessment to determine when to stop the relocation of contaminated materials and
        what materials can be left safely at the original site, in line with international good
        practice. Such earlier agreement will strengthen the government capacity for assessing
        risks rather than unrealistic strict standards and can facilitate a smoother transition
        towards site closure procedures.
      o The time necessary for the preparation and implementation of relatively complex projects
        from a technical, institutional and communication point of view should not be
        underestimated, particularly when the occurrence of additional climatic or political
        interferences, or the potential for additional technical complexities, can be suspected.
        Such considerations should be considered when planning the necessary duration of such
        projects. In the case of the DHMP, the project included initial plan considered about 5.5
        years (9/2004 to 3/2010), when the complete implementation of component 1 required a
        total of 9 years (including post-closure activities).


36
     Examples of similar Bank project designed in the late 90s or early 2000s include Romania, Zambia and Argentina.

                                                               29
    o Planning for low hanging fruits. Considering the duration of engineering preparation and
      planning mentioned above, the DHMP included a series of activities which could be
      undertaken at the very start (the “early activities”), and which contributed to generating
      confidence in the project commitment to improve the environmental and natural hazards
      management. Equivalent experiences to address “low hanging fruits” have been found in
      similar projects (e.g., the Zambia Copperbelt) with similar effects and should be taken
      into consideration on the design of this type of project.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

101.     The Borrower’s Implementation Completion Report is provided in Annex 7 with a general
satisfactory assessment of the Project, its implementation by the Government and the Bank’s assistance in
preparation and implementation.

(b) Cofinanciers

102.     Co-financing included a Japan PHRD grant for capacity building (US$ 1.95 million), focusing on
Priority interventions for Mailuu Suu component, strengthening of the institutional and technical capacity
for disaster preparedness component and support for project implementation and long-term investment
plan component and a GEF Medium-Sized Project grant (US $ 1.0 million) from the Global
Environmental Facility. Details of the scope of the Grants are provided in Annex 8. The Closing Date of
the PHRD Grant was March 31, 2010, the Grant was 100% disbursed, no comments were raised on
implementation of the PHRD Grant.

103.    The Global Environmental Objective of the GEF Grant was to protect the integrity of the Mailuu-
Suu ecosystem by addressing trans boundary contamination of the Mailuu-Suu river and land degradation
in the surrounding areas. The GEF Grant co-financed the two components under the IDA Grant:
Component 1 – Uranium Mining Wastes Isolation and Protection; Component 2 – Disaster Preparedness
and Monitoring (DPM), the Project Management Component was only financed by the IDA Grant. The
Grant was extended from its original Closing Date in March 2010 as the delays impacting DHMP also
impacted the GEF-Grant in the same manner. When the Grant closed on October 31, 2011, it was
disbursed for 100%. For the GEF-Grant, a separate Implementation Completion Memorandum was
prepared in line with the requirements and template of the Global Environmental Facility.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

104. Other partners also coordinated their funding in relation to project activities within the area on
technical or social issues (e.g. ADB, BGR, EU, IAEA) and particularly the IAEA played an important
role as a technical partner, contributing to the implementation of best practices and standards in project
activities related to Uranium Mining Wastes Isolation and Protection Component.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1 – Uranium Mining Waste Isolation and Protection (UMWIP)

1.       This section provides a description of the outputs achieved under component 1 as well as the
prioritization process based on a risk and cost-benefit assessment of the 36 tailings and waste sites
inventoried in the Mailuu-Suu area, including a summary of the interventions implemented. The approach
used under the DHMP is illustrated in Figure 1.

Early activities

2.       The sequence for the sites selection
process was defined in the PAD, which included
as well a series of early interventions which had
been identified during preparation (see Figure 1),
to be implemented in parallel with the
prioritization of works as described further below.
These interventions included: (i) removal of the
unstable top on the south side of the Tectonic
landslide to reduce the risk of impact on uranium
Tailing No. 3 in case of movement of the soil
mass; (ii) diversion of surface water around the
Koi-Tash landslide area, to reduce risk of
blockage of the Mailuu-Suu river; (iii)
installation monitoring stations on the Tectonic
and Koi-Tash landslides; and (iv), strengthening            Figure 1. Decision making sequence regarding the
of the riverbank along priority areas of the             implementation of interventions in the Mailuu-Suu area.
Aylyampa-Sai and Mailuu-Suu rivers to reduce
the erosion risks of tailings or waste dumps located close to the streams.

3.      All these activities were completed during the period 2005 to 2006/07 under the project and, until
present, maintained by the Government (see Table 2), except at the Koi-Tash landslide as it was decided
not to set-up of a drainage system as proposed initially (PAD p.8) because of the limited effect it would
have on the landslide (MTR Aide Memoire July 2007).

Risk assessment and prioritization process

4.       Methodology. In order to achieve a credible classification of individual sites (high priority, low
priority or no need for remediation), an assessment and comprehensive decision process was carried out.
The overall approach is shown on Figure 2. Based on the national legal background and the international
best practice, the criteria applied were as follows (see Figure 3):
• the effective dose for the population should be below 1 mSv/a;
• uncontrolled release of mining and milling wastes (dump and tailings material) due to erosion cannot
    be tolerated; and,
• threat to humans, livestock or property due to structural instability of waste storage facilities
    (endogenous failure such dam or slope collapse, destruction by exogenous events such as landslides
    or seismic activity) must be prevented.

5.       Prioritization. Remedial actions were deemed necessary for sites which, in their project state, did
not satisfy any of these conditions. These objects were rated as high-priority. Objects which satisfied

                                                        32
these criteria might have deserved remediation, even though with lower priority. For example, the
principle common in the field of radiation protection, requires that doses should be As Low as
Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) which means that if doses which are below 1 mSv/a can be lowered
further with comparatively little effort, this should be done if the corresponding funds are available (e.g.,
by covering objects). It is here where remediation costs and other, mainly socio-economic, consequences
come in.

6.       An important criterion in the decision process was the added value to the society which could be
achieved as a "side-effect" of remediation (or, conversely, the public nuisance which comes from a
remediation option). This rather "soft" criteria can play a decisive role, especially in the acceptance of the
overall remediation strategy by public stakeholders and affected population groups.

7.       Risks by toxic elements which are released
by a tailings pond or waste dump to the
environment via seepage water into the ground or
surface water were deemed as negligible.
Moreover, seepage was observed only at a few of
the waste sites, and then in very small quantities.
Remediation for reasons connected with
groundwater contamination is only warranted if
there is a demonstrable risk to the population today
or, based on reasonable usage scenarios, in the
foreseeable future. However, in the Mailuu Suu the
population is supplied by a central, piped water
supply network with the possible exception of
house wells near TP 16 where samples had been
taken and analyzed. The results from these
analyses of tap and well water in houses around TP
16 clearly show that there is no elevated risk for
the population provided that the seepage from TP
16 is not used. This can be ensured by piping the
seepage into the Azbaz creek. Therefore, the water
pathway does not constitute a decisive factor in
determining the need for remediation.

Risk Assessment
                                                            Figure 2. Schematic illustration of the overall methodology
                                                            applied under component 1 of the DHMP (source
8.       In Table 1 below the risk assessment for the       Geoconsult/Wisutec report, 2006).
36 sites inventoried is summarized. From the results
shown on this Table, 13 objects (7 tailings ponds and 6 waste dumps) should be remediated with high
priority, 10 objects should be remediated with lower priority and 14 objects needed no remediation.

9.      The following risks were taken into consideration for the identification of high and low priority
remediation activities: (i) endogenous geotechnical risk (instability of the waste facility itself which
may lead to release of contaminated material into the hydrographic network); (ii) exogenous
geotechnical risk (risk of external forces such as floods and landslides to damage the facility and lead
to release of contaminated material into the hydrographic network); (iii) radio-ecological risk to the
population (including all relevant exposure pathways); and (iv) eco-toxicological risk to the
population through the water pathway.

10.     The investigation of potential remediation options took international best available techniques

                                                       33
(BAT), EU and international guidelines and recommendations into account. As remediation measures, the
following technical options have been considered: (i) relocation of wastes to a safer place; (ii) in-situ
remediation, including a) reshaping of surface contour and covering and b) riverbed strengthening
and erosion protection For the relocation of wastes, several site options were considered and compared
using a cost-benefit analysis. Relocation to TP 6 was clearly preferable to all other options.

11.     The project's objective of reducing the potential risk of exposure to uranium and other radioactive
substances for human population, livestock and ecosystems in Mailuu-Suu has been substantially
achieved. The following map (Figure 4) shows the location of the sites of intervention and Table 1 below
summarizes the works implemented.

12.     In 2005/2006 at the beginning of the DHMP and as the basis for the later conducted remediation
measures, a consultant firm 38 prepared a feasibility study for the Mailuu Suu Uranium Mining sites. On
the basis of data, sampled by the EU TACIS Project (2003) and own data, the consortium made a risk
assessment of all 36 sites, identified the high-priority objects for immediate actions and selected the best
suitable technologies and technical solutions. Several technical sub-projects were defined, tendered and
realized during implementation.

accomplished and proposing recommendations for further activities, on the basis of an updated risk
assessment 39.

14.     Summary of works under Component 1 and recommendations. Because of the limited funds
of the DHMP only the remediation of objects with the highest priority and related infrastructure measures
could be finally carried out. Summarizing, the following works, including improved infrastructure, have
been completed under the project’s component 1:
        - Relocation of material from the source area of the landslide area Tectonic (Triangle)
        - Relocation of WD 5 to TP 6, using of the material as dam for the storage cell
        - Riverbed strengthening of Aylampa Say river to protect the dams of TP 2 and TP 13
        - Reshaping and riverbed strengthening of WD 6
        - Relocation of WD 1 to WD 2
        - Reshaping and water catchment and diversion measures on WD 2
        - Relocation of TP 3 to TP 6, covering of TP 6 as storage cell
        - Water catchment measures and partial covering of “hot spots” on TP 5, TP 7 and TP 14 (rapid
        measures)
        - Positioning of warning signs on TP 5, TP 7, TP 14 and TP 16 (rapid measures)
        - Infrastructure measures
                 o Erection of a new bridge crossing the Mailuu-Suu river near TP 6 (see picture below).
                 o Construction of a new road on the west bank of Mailuu-Suu river
                 o Construction of a new bridge crossing the Kara Agach river

15.     From the same report, the supervision consultant recommended the following additional measures
to be implemented in the short term, based on an updated risk estimation, in order to achieve a safer and
sustainable situation:
        - TP 13 and TP 2 - relocation to a safer location (TP 1 and/or TP 4)
        - TP 16 - safeguarding of the water diverting system
        - TP 8 - dam toe, riverbed strengthening of the Mailuu-Suu river
        - TP 10 repair or new installation of the water catchment system
        - All objects with elevated radioactive radiation – erection of warning signs.
        - For the long-term regular, periodical maintenance measures on all objects are necessary.

dumps and 23 tailings ponds) identified initially, 12 were found to need no intervention measures, and 10
for which remedial action was of lower priority. For the remaining 14 objects remediation was
recommended with high priority. A second level of prioritization was needed to define a set of remedial
measures which would fit into the available budget and time frame of the project. These measures, their
results and recommendations are summarized in the Table 2 below.

Component 2 – Disaster Preparedness and Monitoring (DPM)

17.      Sub-component 2.1 – Capacity building. The objective was to contribute to the
improvement of the national system for disaster management, preparedness, and response to
achieve a more effective administration and implementation by national and sub-national
authorities, and local communities. Spreading knowledge on disaster preparedness and
encouraging government agencies and local communities to work together consisted in the most
important activity under component 2 (about 70% of its budget), as the international experience
shows that the best results are achieved when there is effective cooperation between citizens, civil
society groups, and regional and local authorities. The main activities included: (i) preparation of
a National Management and Response Plan (NMRP); (ii) training, awareness programs and
provision of equipment for more effective communication within MES at central and regional
level as well as a number of study tours.

18.      Institutional framework. The project contributed to the establishment of an improved
institutional framework for the management of natural hazards through training and capacity
building, the set-up of a communication network involving local, regional and national authorities,
and awareness by communities regarding the identification and monitoring of landslide risks.

19.     Awareness building and training campaigns about disaster preparedness and management
were carried out in different parts of the country, as well as in Mailuu-Suu (an area also prone to
earthquakes, flooding and landslides). Starting in 2007, workshops were conducted on emergency
management and response for officials of MES and ministries and agencies members of Inter-
ministerial Committee (established in 2006). Materials used for the workshops included draft
documents such relevant regulations improvement, functional evaluation of MES system, the
draft National Emergency Management and Response Plan and a manual on “Essential Principles
of Comprehensive Emergency Management”. Training also reached out to the rayon level,
including regional MES staff, emergency commissions at rayon administrations, as well as to
local authorities. At the community level, workshops trained and built awareness of the
population on early emergency response, particularly on risk analysis and assessment and on
landslide risk issues. A set of training materials on emergency response and management have
been prepared, which constitute a base for seminars at the central and oblast levels for national
and regional authorities as well as for NGOs and local communities.

20.     In September 2006 representatives of the MES, the Government and the PIU made a
study tour to the Asian Disaster Reduction Center.

21.     The government approval process of the National Emergency Management and Response
Plan was restarted a number of times (as part of an important participatory process with all
stakeholders, including participation by numerous national and international experts) and
discussed at the level of the Government, involving all ministries concerned due to the frequent
government changes. In parallel, MES is focusing to establish a National Platform for Disaster
Risk Reduction (NP DRR), with broadly similar objectives as the NEMRP including the set-up of
an inter-ministerial management Secretariat and involving the participation of NGOs, Civil
Society Organizations and multi- and bi-lateral aid organizations40.

   According to the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNUSDR; http://www.unisdr.org/partners/countries/kgz),
the main objective of Kyrgyzstan National Platform is to establish effective disaster risk management mechanism,
develop and integrate program-targeted risk reduction activities into the national country development programs. It is

22.      The draft NMRP (2008) covers the full range of requirements in anticipation of or in
response to major disasters, accidents and other emergencies. It also provides the basis to initiate
long-term community recovery and mitigation activities. The NMRP establishes interagency
mechanisms for government involvement in, and coordination of, domestic incident management
operations. This includes coordinating structures and processes requiring: (i) support on a
national basis for incidents of national importance; (ii) support for incidents of regional or rayon
significance; and (iii) support to incidents at a village or community level. It distinguishes
between incidents that require a national response and the majority of incidents occurring each
year that are handled by responsible local government or agencies through other established
authorities and existing Plans. In addition, the NMRP (i) recognizes and incorporates the various
jurisdictional and functional authorities including local and regional governments; (ii) details the
specific management roles and responsibilities of the MES and other departments and agencies;
and (iii) establishes the multi-agency organizational structures and processes required. The Plan
was meant to be applicable to all government departments and agencies that may be requested to
provide assistance or conduct operations in the context of actual or potential disasters. It also
included the participation of organizations which have a role to play, such as community-based
groups or NGOs.

23.       Sub-component 2.1 objective was to improve the national system for disaster
management, preparedness, and response that can be administered and implemented effectively
by national and sub-national authorities, and local communities. As part of the component,
Emergency Response Centers established were set up and equipped with data and communication
facilities. They were inaugurated by the President of the Kyrgyz Republic in June 2006. They are
operative around the clock and the response time for all inventoried potential landslide areas lies
below 24 hrs. A communication network at the local level was also set up. The ERCs function as
follows:
    •         Receiving from population, and communicating threats or facts of emergencies to
              general public;
    •         Analyzing and validating the received information, communicating it to the
              managing bodies, duty and dispatching services, territorial federal executive bodies
              whose scope of responsibilities includes responding to the received information;
    •         Notifying the Government, oblast authorities, the Ministry of Emergency Situations
              of the Kyrgyz Republic, heads of the MES oblast offices, and duty and dispatching
              services in accordance with the established procedure;
    •         Collecting from duty and dispatching services, environmental surveillance and
              monitoring services, oblast emergency monitoring and prevention centers
              information about threats or facts of emergencies, current situation and activities by
              the emergency response teams and facilities, and distributing such information
              among managing bodies, duty and dispatching services and territorial executive
              bodies;
    •         Processing and analyzing information about emergency situation, determining its



targeted to advance and implement disaster risk reduction (DDR) policies at all levels, coordination, analysis and
consultation in the key sectors, which require joint and coordinated actions involving all parties. It will provide for a
process to involve all parties, including state authorities, local administrations, international organizations, non-
government organizations, civil society. The Secretariat has been established under the coordination of the MES to
provide organizational and technical support for the Inter-ministerial Commission on Civil Protection of the Kyrgyz
Republic, in order to address issues of interaction of this commission, and support for the Disaster Response
Coordination Unit, which is represented by international organizations and civil society.

               operating mode;
      •        Online strategic decision-making.

24.       ERCs were used in the following disaster events:
          • In 2009, earthquake in Nura village (Alai district, Osh oblast);
          • Distribution of food for cattle in winter period in 2012 in Alai district of Osh oblast;
             Chatkal district of Jalal-Abad oblast;
          • During the annual snow avalanches, the Ministry of Emergency Situations cleans the
             roads and helps the affected population, for example, the road sections cleaning at the
             Bishkek-Osh road.

25.      After preparation of the National Emergency Management and Response Plan (as part of
an participatory process with all stakeholders, including participation by numerous national and
international experts and awareness building campaigns about disaster preparedness and
management were carried out in different parts of the country, as well as in Mailuu-Suu) and
discussed at the level of the Government, involving all ministries concerned, MES started to work
on the set-up of a National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (NP DRR), with broadly similar
objectives as the NEMRP including the set-up of an inter-ministerial management Secretariat and
involving the participation of NGOs, Civil Society Organizations and multi- and bi-lateral aid
organizations 41.

26.      Sub-component 2.2 Landslide Monitoring and Warning System- dealt with the
establishment of a real-time system to detect and warn against active landslide movements in key
hazard areas, and provide equipment for seismic measurements. Up to 2007, automated systems
had been installed in five landslide areas different areas. Computers, where all information was
gathered, are installed at control points in the village councils or schools. All five systems had
been launched and tested. The local population was aware of the warning systems and
monitoring appeared to have been a continuing activity.

27.     Unfortunately, afterwards, all 5 monitoring systems were found to be strongly
deteriorated and dysfunctional due to the theft of parts, particularly the transmission wires. The
Ministry of Emergency Situations investigated the damaged systems and identified the scope of
work for repair. However, considering the costs and the probability to have to face similar
vandalism events, the Government, with the support of the Bank team conceptualized a low cost -
low tech community based approach for landslide monitoring and early warning that would be
prepared and implemented over the remaining project period. Decision was also made at that time
to develop the community based landslide monitoring pilots, including at Taram Bazar, where a
landslide area is threatening a large school. The system in Taram Bazam is still operating at the

28.   Subcomponent 2.3 addressed the setting up of a monitoring system in Mailuu-Suu. It
      included:
       - the establishment of a monitoring network for surface and ground waters (set up
           with the cooperation of the German Geological Survey – BGR) during the period
           2006 to 2008 (including monitoring of water parameters during that period);
       - the installation of two water gauging station, one upstream at the town water facility
           and one downstream of Mailuu-Suu. The latter was then relocated at the laboratory in
           town.
       - The radiological analytical laboratory in the local branch of the State Sanitary and
           Epidemiological Commission was delivered, installed and put into operation by a
           team of experts hired by the project. Local staff was trained, and a monitoring
           program developed for the community, and practiced with the designated staff
           responsible for sampling and monitoring. Mailuu-Suu now has the capabilities to
           undertake analyses of gross radioactive substances and the radiation levels in water

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

29.     The original PAD based the economic analysis based on the benefits of the reduced annual
        probability of avoided loss due to reduced probabilities of failures of landslides and
        tailings and the probability of flooding. However, while landslides involving precariously
        placed uranium tailings at Mailuu-Suu in Kyrgyzstan over a 30 year period, killed people
        and destroyed buildings 42 , the benefits in the preparation Project Appraisal Document
        were based on the assumptions of with and without project probabilities of failures of
        landslides and to certain extent fairly theoretical.

30.     For that reason, for the Implementation Completion Report a cost effectiveness approach
        has been used to compare the costs of the remediation works at the mine tailings and waste
        dumps in Mailuu-Suu site with similar remediation works in other countries, since there
        are no comparable works and therefore costs comparisons in the Kyrgyz Republic.

31.     The comparison is based on the information from the amount of materials relocated from
        Tailings Pond no 3 and Waste Dump no1 and the total value of the contract. Based on this
        information, the total costs for the specific remediation works on TPs and WDs represent
        25 USD per m3 of tailings material and 7 USD/m3 for waste dump material. Data for
        other countries range from less than USD1.7 to about USD255, with an average varying
        from USD27 to 124 43 per cubic meter, depending of the country and characteristics (based
        on data from the German Bundesministerium fur Wissenschaft (Ministry of Science),
        Studienreihe Nr. 90 (1999, updated to comparable prices). The large range of unit costs is
        due to economies of scale achieved in very large clean-up projects as well as the varying
        stringencies of national regulations in countries that have had clean-up programs. The
        costs at Mailuu Suu are reasonable in this comparison.

32.     Based on the comparison report for decommissioning and clean-up costs of uranium
        producting projects on international basis 44 , the 14 uranium producing countries were
        investigated with regard to rehabilitation costs. The accumulated and estimated costs for
        the decommissioning and rehabilitation of the uranium-producing plants referred to in this
        study 45 amount to about US$ 3.7 billion (cost basis: 1993). The resulting specific
        rehabilitation costs range from a minimum of US$ 0.12 per lb of U3O8 (Canada) and US$
        0.12 per ton of tailings (South Africa), to a maximum of approximately US$ 40 per lb of
        U3O8 (Sweden) and US$ 68 per ton of tailings (UMTRA Title I Program, USA). This

   Original costs per ton have been translated into costs per m3, estimating a density of 1.7 kg/m3 for the tailings and
wastes materials.

   They represent a cumulative uranium production until and including 1992 of approximately 1.14 million tons of
uranium or nearly 3 billion pounds of uranium oxide (U3O8). This corresponds to approx. 63% of the entire cumulative
world production of uranium. This production is accompanied by about 1,681 million tonnes of processing residues.
780 million tonnes thereof are related to plants which produced or still produce uranium as a by-product.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
(if any)

33.   While there was no more funding available towards the end of the project to execute the
      planned stakeholder and beneficiary surveys as the funds were needed to finalize the
      relocation works of the mine tailing and the closing of the site (cover, drainage etc, for
      which the government also increased the counterpart financing at the end of the project),
      implementation of a consistent communication and participation strategy, including the
      set-up of an information center in Mailuu-Suu, has contributed to facilitate the
      understanding of the population of real risks versus perceived risks of such abandoned
      mine tailings and waste dumps and what can be done to manage and reduce these risks.

34.   These engagements, consultations and information exchange with the communities is also
      anticipated to lead to easier maintenance of the mine tailings and waste dumps in the
      future (e.g., avoid vandalism of fences or materials) of the tailings or waste dumps, etc.)
      and in the case of the landslide monitoring, participation of the school in Taran bazar has
      shown the definitive advantages of low tech/low costs options over the more sophisticated,
      expensive but easily subjective to theft option selected at project start.

35.   In the first quarter of 2008, the Consultant held training workshop for the government
      officials and representatives of the civil society on handling radioactive substances by the
      example of the Mailuu-Suu project activities for isolating and protecting uranium mining
      wastes. The Consultant also held the similar training in Mailuu-Suu town for the local
      authorities, civil sector and contractors based on the specific case of relocating Waste
      Dump No.5 and Tailings No.3 and 8. In the second quarter of 2008, the Consultant held a
      series of meetings with the Mailuu-Suu community in order to clarify all issues on
      transferring the radioactive materials to Tailing No.6.

36.   The public protest from June to September 2010 has hampered relocation of Tailing No.3
      to Tailing No.6 and relocation of the remaining part of wastes from Waste Dump No.1 (in
      2009 just a half of the wastes have been relocated from Waste Dump No.1 – 79.0 thousand
      cubic meters). Four outreach campaigns on the Disaster Hazard Mitigation Project
      (DHMP) were arranged for the population of villages Sary-Bee and Kara-Zhygach, and
      Mailuu-Suu town with the PIU staff, WISUTEC representatives, experts of the Ministry of
      Emergency situations of the Kyrgyz Republic, and representatives of the local
      administration involved.

37.   A good response from the local population represented by the Head of the rural
      Administration of Sary-Bee and the head of the villages has been obtained concerning
      construction of the service road at the right bank of the Mailuu-Suu River, riverbank
      strengthening, reconstruction of metal bridge and bridge passage over the Kara-Agach
      River contributed to improvement of access to the settlements located upstream the
      Mailuu-Suu town, such as Kara-Agach, Sary-Bee, Kolmo and Kopuro-Basshi. This
      contributed to improving economic well-being of the local population and ensured flood
      protection for the Kara-Agach population. Population was satisfied with relocation of the
      remaining part of waste from Waste Dump No.1 and with strengthening the banks of the
      artificial canal of the Kulmen-Sai River. The population remains concerned about TP18
      though.

         Project Description

 Original Objectives
 The Disaster Hazard Mitigation Project provided financial assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic with the
 aim to minimize the potential negative impact of landslides and uranium tailings in Mailuu-Suu area.
 The problems of uranium mining wastes disposal included accumulation in the environment of the
 radioactive and toxic substances continuously seeping from the tailings and waste rock dumps. High
 levels of radioactivity had been observed in water and bottom sediment samples from the Mailuu-Suu
 River. All Project activities were aimed at minimizing the risk of contamination spreading from the
 tailings and waste rock dumps, and minimizing the risks of the most potentially damaging landslides in
 Mailuu-Suu area.

The Disaster Hazard Mitigation Project (DHMP) was focused on the linkages between the natural disasters,
such as landslides, earthquakes and floods associated with the seismic activity, and significant
environmental heritage of the mining industry – poorly managed tailings and waste rock dumps imply
significant risk of damaging such mining facilities and have high risks of environmental pollution and
negative impacts on the population’s health and safety, especially in those areas where uranium have been
previously produced. Adverse effects on life and health of the population of the affected settlements as well
as on the economic activities both within the mining areas and within the long-distanced downstream areas

                                                         66
(e.g., at the area of highly productive Ferghana Valley of the neighboring Uzbekistan – downstream the
main project area; the border is 30 kilometers downstream from the Mailuu-Suu River) have been predicted.

Since Independence in 1991, institutional and technical capacity of the Ministry of Ecology and
Emergencies (MEE) responsible for such issues has been reduced considerably. The Ministry had no
sufficient personnel, infrastructure or modern operational procedures, neither the resource sufficient to
carry out its mandates. Criteria for taking measures in case of emergency have not been elaborated. There
was no a well-defined system of functions and responsibilities distribution between the MEE departments
and oblast and local administrations that would allow to respond quickly and effectively to emergency
events.

The concern of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic about the problems with landfilling uranium mines
has been recognized by the world public. Repeated missions by the World Bank experts and their reports
have served as the project justification. As per the WB classification, the Disaster Hazard Mitigation
Project has been classified as category ‘B’. The assumption was that the DHMP implementation would
improve social and economic indicators of the Mailuu-Suu Region.

Project Objectives:

    •   minimize the exposure of humans, livestock, and river flora and fauna to radionuclides associated
        with abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area;
    •   improve the effectiveness of emergency management and response by national and regional
        authorities and local communities to disaster situations; and
    •   reduce the potential loss of life and property in key landslide areas of the country.

    Implementing agency is the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Kyrgyz Republic. At the
    preliminary project appraisal stage, the Kyrgyz Government considered the National Strategy for
    Sustainable Human Development, adopted in May 1997, as the appropriate framework for risk
    management of disaster hazards. The overall objective of the government policy in this area was to
    reduce the vulnerability of the population and the economy to hazardous processes. In this respect, five
    specific goals have been set: (i) to provide timely warning to the public of the threat of natural and
    manmade disasters; (ii) to reduce and mitigate human and material losses from natural disasters; (iii) to
    establish a single monitoring system to ensure safety of the population; (iv) to improve disaster
    preparedness by training the population; and (v) to improve rescue services preparedness against
    disasters.

Revised objectives

Project objectives have been revised in June 2011 under Additional Financing Agreement and were as
follows: minimize the exposure of humans, livestock, and river flora and fauna to radionuclides associated
with abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area based on technical
data and experience gained during the Project implementation. The reasons for changes were:

     Relocation of additional volumes of radioactive waste rock from Waste Dump 1 to Waste Dump 2
      (2nd stage, a half of the volume of radioactive waste rock from Waste Dump 1 have been relocated
      in 2009).
     Construction of the protective structures for the service road along the Mailuu-Suu River damaged
      during heavy rains in spring and summer of the year 2010.
     Establishment of monitoring system “Discontinuation of pollution infiltration of radionuclides and
      associated heavy metals into the groundwater from the selected high-risk mine tailings and waste
      dumps” to be used as an effective substitution for PDO indicator to measure the impact of public

                                                         67
    health outcome during the life of the project, instead of the evidence that applicable parameters are
    below hazardous thresholds for humans and livestock in samples of soil, water and air from the
    monitored sites in the Mailuu-Suu area.

Original Components

This Project with the total estimated cost of USD 11.96 million consisted of three components:
     Component 1 - Uranium Mining Wastes Isolation and Protection
     Component 2 - Disaster Preparedness and Monitoring
     Component 3 – Project management

     Top priority activities:
     Subcomponent А1 - Tectonic Landslide Unloading;
     Subcomponent А2 - Tailings and Waste Rock Dumps Inspection and Rehabilitation;
     Subcomponent А3 - Koi-Tash Landslide – Diversion of Surface Water Runoff;
     Subcomponent А4 - Landslide Monitoring and Early Warning Systems;
     Subcomponent А5 – Riverbank Strengthening along Aylyampa Sai and Mailuu-Suu Rivers

     Activities for long-term improvement of the situation:
     Subcomponent А6 – Tailing Number 3;
     Subcomponent А7 - Koi-Tash Landslide

The goals and objectives would be achieved through implementing the key emergency mitigation
measures aimed at:
     isolation and protection of the abandoned uranium mining wastes from disturbance by natural
        processes such as landslides, floods, and leaching and dispersal by ground- and surface-water
        drainage
     establishment of an effective disaster management and response system which would be
        appropriate for national, regional and subordinated authorities and local communities;
     development of the real-time landslide monitoring and warning system in key hazard areas;

Component 2 – Improvement of Disaster Preparedness and Monitoring

The Component would include:
     • Capacity Building
     • Monitoring System in Mailuu-Suu area
     • Warning and communication system, and exchange of information
     • Technical, social and environmental audit
     • Operating costs for ERC equipment

This Component would provide goods, works and services to:
     (i)   improve the national system for disaster management, preparedness, and response that can
           be administered and implemented effectively by national, regional and subordinated
           authorities, and local communities;
     (ii) establish real-time systems to detect and warn against active landslide movements in key
           hazard areas, and provide equipment for seismic measurements; and
     (iii) set up a monitoring system in Mailuu-Suu area.




                                                     68
Following the terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement, the PIU submitted quarterly reports on
project implementation to the World Bank, and the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic to the
Ministry of Emergency Situations, which was the Implementing Agency for the Project.

Component under this Component remained unchanged

Strengthening the environmental regulatory framework

Besides International Conventions/Agreements ratified by the Kyrgyz Republic, a number of
international Central Asia agreements regarding cooperation in management and conservation of
natural resources, as well as dealing with trans-boundary matters concerning natural disasters,
including uranium mine tailings and water resources distribution, have been signed. Agreements that
are of the vital importance for the project are as follows:

      Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Government of the
     Kyrgyz Republic and the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan on joint efforts to
     rehabilitate areas of tailings and waste rock dumps that have trans-boundary impact had been
     signed in Tashkent on April 5, 1996;
      Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Government of the
     Kyrgyz Republic and the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan on using water and power
     resources of Syr Darya River basin had been signed in Bishkek on March 17, 1998. This

Project Design and Quality at the Initial Stage

At the project preparation stage a comprehensive site inventory has been carried out in coordination
with the EU-TACIS-2003 and under the Environmental Impact Assessment for the Project carried out
in 2004.

During the project preparation it was obvious that the Disaster Hazard Mitigation Project could cover
only areas of the highest risk and in need of urgent environmental recovery 46 as the activities covering
all areas would have required periods longer than those acceptable for the WB projects and beyond the
resources available.


     46
          As per the TACIS-2003, 36 sites had been selected (23 storage facilities and 13 waste rock dumps).




                                                                 69
Risk assessment and activities prioritization have been analyzed before 2005 in order to select the areas
of high risks of pollution or landsliding where the population or water resources could be affected since
processing of tailings and waste rock dumps at such areas was impossible because of the limited
resources and focus of the project. In 2006 the areas have been selected and it became possible to start
with detail surveys and engineering planning as a basis for contracting and procurement of the works.

     Project appraisal

The main project outcome indicators included:
      (i)   Evidence that the applicable parameters are below hazardous thresholds for humans,
            livestock, and river flora and fauna in samples of soil, water and air from monitored sites
            in the Mailuu-Suu area;
      (ii) Evidence of high satisfaction rates among the local population in the Mailuu-Suu area;
      (iii) Evidence that a disaster hazard monitoring, warning, and response system is functioning
            and being used effectively by cooperating national, oblast, and district (rayon) authorities,
            and local communities;
      (iv) Evidence that real-time landslide monitoring and warning systems are functioning and
            being used effectively by local communities.

In May 2005, the contract for design and supervisory services had been signed with the Consortium –
GeoConsult (Austria), WISUTEC and DMT (Germany) – as part of Component 1 implementation.
Survey consultant has provided the list of the sites for which it was required to take long-term
measures concerning the waste rock dumps and tailings (Conceptual Report)

As result of competitive bidding, the contract for services under Component 2 has been awarded to
Scott Wilson Ltd in cooperation with Crown Agents (Great Britain) and William Lettis & Associates
(WLA) Inc. (USA). Amount of the contract was GBP 523,941. This company also provided its services
under the ADB-financed project for reducing vulnerability of the poor population to disasters (amount
of the contract was GBP 326,075.00). In December 2006 the company had provided the inception
report.

International Geotechnical Expert (Luciano Minetti) assisted the Design Consultant in carrying out
stability analysis. International Consultant in cooperation with the local experts held additional
selection of the international regulatory and legal documents, technical standards and rules applicable
for the landslide unloading. A panel of international and local consultants has implemented
investigations, surveys, researches and projects for all activities of the components. Consultants’
services would be financed by the co-financing PHRD Grant.

     Panel of Independent Experts

Based on the feasibility and design study to be carried out for Tailing No. 3, it was concluded that the
preferred option for the long-term solution is re-location of the material, and a Panel of Independent
Experts had been established to review the results and recommendations of the study. The Panel
included a Geotechnical Expert and a Dam Safety Specialist.

In March 2007, based on Project Implementation Plan, terms of reference had been prepared for the
Panel of Independent Experts as it was decided to relocate Tailings No.3 and 18 to Tailings No.6 that
would require additional expert appraisal of the materials and documents, including EIA documents.
The terms of reference had been prepared for the Panel of Independent Experts (International
Consultants) specialized in geotechnics, methods and ways of radioactive material relocation, and
safety requirements for such works.

In April 2007, the contracts was signed with three experts (Fabrizio Pelli, Geotechnical Expert, Mike
Fossit, Expert for Tailings Relocation, and Peter Vagit, Expert for Wastes Safety) who, in general,
were expected to complete their tasks specified in the Terms of reference within four missions. The
first mission had been completed in April 2007. The Panel of Independent Experts had surveyed
Tailings No. 3, 18, 6, 11 and 15 in Mailuu-Suu Town and had examined materials of the Feasibility
Study for Tailing No. 3 Rehabilitation. In April, a meeting of the specialists from the MES, World
Bank, Panel of Independent Experts and supervisory bodies was held to discuss implementation of
long-term rehabilitation activities for Tailing No. 3 in Mailuu-Suu. All Mailuu-Suu sites had been
investigated in parallel with the WB mission. The second scheduled mission of the Panel of
Independent Experts was held in May, 2008, with the purpose to discuss the detailed project for
relocating Tailings No. 3 and 18.

     Outcomes and Objectives Achieved

The project was aimed at achieving the set objectives and outcomes by implementing two components.
Performance Indicators and the progress are provided in the Annex 1. Outcomes for the activities
within each component are presented below:

     Component - Uranium Mining Wastes Isolation and Protection

Tailings and waste rock dumps within the Mailuu-Suu area had been inspected under Component 1 and
General Rehabilitation Concept had been prepared. Based on national and international regulations and
standards, as well as on up-to-date practices of tailings rehabilitation, design and construction
supervision consultant consultants had analyzed the risk to which the abandoned 23 uranium mine
tailings and 13 waste rock dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area were exposed.

     The following activities have been completed for Component 1:
     1.       Consulting services for designing and supervision
     On May 20, 2005, as soon as technical and financial appraisal was over, the contract had been
     signed with the Consortium – GeoConsult (Austria), WISUTEC (Germany) – with amount of
     the contract of USD 1,177,500. Under this contract, design and survey works for riverbank
     strengthening along the Aylyampa-Sai River, equipment installation for monitoring and early
     warning systems for Tectonic and Koi-Tash Landslides, rehabilitation of Waste Dump No.6,
     rehabilitation of Waste Dumps No.1 and No.2, and for relocation of Waste Dump No.5 had been
     presented. Design and survey works for constructing service road between the Izolit Plant and
     Tailing No.6 had been completed. Design and survey works for relocation of Tailings No.3 and
     18 and preparation of bidding documents had been completed.

                                                     71
2.       Tectonic Landslide have been partially unloaded
Under this Component, a complete package of the project documents on landslide unloading had
been provided and the works for landslide unloading had been monitored. Luciano Minetti, an
international consultant hired specifically for this purpose, had provided an active support in
preparing project documents. Based on these project documents a tender was held and a contract
was signed with Naryngidroenergostroy JSC for landslide unloading. Landslide unloading works
started in mid-April, 2006 and was completed in November 2006. About 30,000 cubic meters of
soil was excavated.

3.      Construction works under fixed-term maintenance of the tailings and waste rock
dumps
Tailings No. 5, 7, 14 and 16 and Waste Dumps No. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 11 have been rehabilitated.
 In June 2007, a tender for construction works under fixed-term maintenance of the tailings and
waste rock dumps was held. As result, the contract for these works was awarded to
Naryngidroenergostroy JSC. Works ware started in September 3, 2007 and completed in
September 2008.

4. Koi-Tash Landslide – Diversion of Surface Water Runoff
Tender for installing equipment of the monitoring and early warning systems for Tectonic and
Koi-Tash Landslides was held in November-December 2006. Unfortunately, no foreign or local
companies had submitted tender offers. PIU and the Consultant has simplified equipment
specifications and the bidding documents have been approved by the Bank. However, as in the
first case, no contracting companies had showed their interest in the tender. The tender was
canceled.

5.      Temporary riverbank strengthening dams have been constructed along the
Aylyampa Sai River to protect Tailings No. 2 and 13.
As these works were recognized as high-cost activities, it was decided to construct temporary
riverbank strengthening dams along the Aylyampa Sai River. Considering urgency of the matter
due to spring flood, it was decided to sign an addendum to a contract with Naryngidroenergostroy
JSC. The works was started in May and completed in August 2006. The Consultant had executed
a proper supervision over the construction works along the Aylyampa Sai River.

On October 30, 2007, the World Bank approved construction of medium-term protective structure
along the Aylyampa Sai River by Kerbenzholkurulush JSC. Period of contract execution was set
as three months. As of the end of March 2008, all works have been completed. The length of
protective structure was 185 running meters.

6.      Rehabilitation of Waste Dump No.6
Contract for rehabilitation of Waste Dump No.6 was awarded through tendering to
Naryngidroenergostroy JSC. The amount of the contract was KGS 5,296,006. The contract was
signed on November 15. The works at this site have been completed in August 2007. Riverbank
protective structures along the Kara Agach River with length of 228 running meters have been
constructed.

7.      Relocation of Waste Dump No.5
Waste Dump No.5 has been relocated from Kara-Agach village. The tender was held in October-
November 2007. The works have been completed in December 2008 by the contracting company
Kerbenzholkurulush JSC. The waste rock dump with volume of 65.2 thousand cubic meters has
been transferred to the Tailing No.6 site.

                                              72
8.      Service road between Izolit Plant and Tailing No.6
Tender for procurement of works was held in May 2007. IDA approval of the Evaluation Report
on awarding the contract to the construction company Kerbenzholkurulush JSC was received on
June 2, 2007. As of the end of February 2008, all works at this site have been completed.

9.       Rehabilitation of Waste Dumps 1 and 2 along Kulmen Sai River
In September, rehabilitation works for Waste Dump 1 and 2 were put out to tender. On December
3, the contract was signed with LOI Company. The works have been completed in May 2009. A
half of the material (69 thousand cubic meters) from Waste Dump 1 has been relocated.
In May 2011, Rehabilitation of Waste Dumps 1 and 2 along the Kulmen Sai River Project
(Relocation of additional volume), DHMP/WORKS-16, was put out for National Competitive
Bidding. The company Kerbenzholkurulush JSC won this National Competitive Bidding. The
works have been completed in 2012.

Implementation of the activities aimed at long-term improvements:
10.     Preparatory works for tailings relocation. These works have been distinguished from
the relocation of Tailings No. 3 and 18 in order to speed up starting of the works. On April 29,
2009, a tender for preparatory works for relocating Tailings No. 3 and 18 was held and tender
offers were opened. As there occurred a delay in approving Tender Evaluation Report by the
World Bank, it was decided during the Bank mission held in November 2009 to include the
preparatory works into the scope of works under Relocation of Tailings No. 3 and 18. Preparatory
works included reconstruction of the metal bridge, bridge passage over the Kara-Agach River and
water conduit reconstruction.
11.    Relocation of Tailings No. 3 and 18 to Waste Dump No.6. In the period from January
to March 2010, International Competitive Bidding was held. On April 7, 2010, the contract with
LOI Company was signed. Relocation works have been completed in December 2012.
Component 2 - Disaster Preparedness and Monitoring
      1. Capacity Building
Capacity building program would be implemented to strengthen the ability of the MES,
administrations of different levels, and local communities to fulfill their duties and functions,
build better awareness and be better prepared in case of disaster. At the beginning of 2007, the
consultant delivered training on emergency management and response for the MES officials
(members of the working group), ministries and offices that are members of the Inter-Agency
Commission for Emergency Prevention and Response established in March 2006. To deliver the
training, the consultant used the best materials on the legislation improvement, functional
evaluation of the MES system, the National Emergency Management and Response Plan, and the
Guidelines for Integrated Emergency Management. In the 2nd quarter, the training seminars
continued for the members of the working group participating in the discussion of the other
materials set prepared by the consultant. Within the current quarter, the consultant proceeded with
delivering training at the district (rayon) level where he consulted officers of the district offices of
the MES, district emergency commissions under district state administrations, as well as the
officials of the local authorities where pilot communities selected by the ADB are situated. The
consultant also delivered training (3 seminars) for the local population on the early emergency
response, in particular, risk analysis and assessment, and landslide hazard.
       In the 2nd quarter of 2008, the consultant provided the PIU with the set of training
materials for civil servants related to emergency management and response that would become
the basis for a series of training seminars at the central and oblast levels. Civil servants of the
ministries and offices, officials of the local public administrations, and municipal officials would
be invited to participate in the seminars.

                                                  73
Based on the designed state strategy on awareness and dissemination of the materials related to
the management and timely response, the consultant had to expand the range of those involved in
training, namely engage local communities and NGOs. For those purposes, the consultant had
prepared a separate set of training materials aimed at the wide public including NGOs and local
communities. To some extent, the materials had been prepared under the ADB project. The
training materials were prepared by the consultant in quarter 1 of 2008 to deliver training to the
public, and to be used by the PIU to hold training seminars at central and district levels. The draft
of the National Emergency Management and Response Plan was discussed at the working
seminar in September 2007 in the light of other reports, particularly:
     • Emergency management cycles.
     • Types of emergencies by cycles.
     • Inter-agency cooperation by emergency cycles.
     • National Plan and Guidelines for Emergency Management and Response.
     • National Plan and legal framework.
     • Socio-economic disaster impact assessment.
     • Resettlement strategy in case of emergency.

In September 2006, the representatives of the MES and the Government, and the PIU were on a
study tour on the natural disaster management and early response to the Asian Disaster Reduction
Centre (Japan, September 19 – 27, 2006). The MES made the development of the Emergency
Response Centre (ERC) regional network a top priority in its development program.

The ERC is intended to support the operation of the unified state system for emergency
prevention and response, and ensure the activities of the inter-agency state commission for
emergency situations and emergency authorities to address the challenges related to prevention
and response to large-scale natural and man-made emergency situations on the territory of the
Kyrgyz Republic.

The following activities related to the ERC were performed in 2006: the ERC offices in Bishkek
and Osh were renovated; the furniture, communications system, and computers were provided.
Video conferencing equipment was installed at Bishkek and Osh ERCs. The Virtual Private
Network (VPN) Bishkek - Osh was installed. The main information transmission network is
Ethernet of the MES consisting of local area networks at Bishkek and Osh ERCs cities connected
by a direct communication channel via the KyrgyzTelecom JSC networks.

In 2008, the MES funded construction of the MES administration building for Jalal-Abad oblast
where the ERC was located for which the video conferencing equipment was purchased and
installed. In 2009, the MES administration building was constructed for Talass oblast to have the
ERC located, video conferencing equipment purchased and installed. Today, the video
conferencing equipment is installed at seven Emergency Response Centers of the MES, namely:
       - in Bishkek, Osh, Jalal-Abad, Talass, Naryn, Batken, and Karakol. There is a mobile
       station (KAMAZ-based).

Monitoring System in Mailuu-Suu
A comprehensive monitoring system covering climatic, seismic, hydrological, geo-chemical, and
environmental parameters in Mailuu-Suu will be developed and implemented to support and
complement Component 1 interventions, determine the baseline situation, and measure project
outcomes. The interventions will include a weather station, a river flow gauging station, water
quality monitoring devices, and radon capture devices.


                                                 74
In November 2006, the Terms of Reference for providing consulting services on measuring the
baseline water quality in the Mailuu-Suu area was drafted. The draft Terms of Reference was
agreed with the IDA head office in 2007. In 2008, the PIU, IDA, and BGR continued to exchange
ideas. The timelines assumed were 8 - 10 months. A potential consultant would have to cooperate
closely with the BGR team, and rely significantly on the laboratory basis of the municipal Center
for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision whose capacities were strengthened through the
project funds. The consultant would be required to design and implement a water quality
monitoring system in Mailuu-Suu. The monitoring focus will be the impact of tailings and waste
rock dumps on the water (rivers, springs, groundwater). On top of everything else, sampling
locations would have to be attached directly to the bodies of tailings and waste rock dumps.
Water quality monitoring was to be performed before the project commenced, during the project
implementation phase, upon the project completion, and prospective monitoring. The monitoring
system designed for the project had to be closely linked to the monitoring system designed by the
BGR experts. Under the mission of the World Bank that took place on September 12 - 15, 2010,
it was decided that the Terms of Reference for the consultant for measuring the baseline water
quality with the help of the “Wisutec” LLC experts should be finalized.

The proposal by “Wisutec” LLC was forwarded to the World Bank through the DHMP
implementation unit for approval in December 2010. After the proposal was approved by the
World Bank, a tender for consulting services would be arranged.

Water Quality Monitoring
In February 2008, the consultant submitted the final version of the technical specifications for a
small laboratory and automatic water quality monitoring stations considered by the PIU, and
tender documents for purchase of equipment were prepared in March. The following equipment
was purchased for the small laboratory of the municipal Center for Sanitary and
Epidemiological Supervision: an automatic water sampler, the technical specification on the
small laboratory envisages a spectrophotometer for determining the uranium content in water
samples (determines concentrations of more than 40 micrograms per liter). The equipment
enables to measure such basic water parameters as the pH value, electrical conductivity, reduction
potential, and the dissolved oxygen content.
In addition, the consultant submitted the technical specifications for two automatic water
quality monitoring stations.
Based on the results of the tender for purchase of the equipment for the laboratory and two
automatic water quality monitoring stations, the contracts were awarded to the Chu
Environmental Laboratory. The contractor accomplished the delivery and the works in May 2008.
The values of the contracts were KGS 3.6 mln. and KGS 3.75 mln., respectively.
Health Data Processing and Outreach
A research had been earlier conducted to define if there might be any connection between the
activity of uranium mines in the Mailuu-Suu area and the diseases related thereto, for example
cancer. The consultant examined the possibility of gaining a better understanding of the impact
that tailings could have on people’s health. The research monitoring could provide qualitative
information on the health and improve the data accounting system and the system for
disseminating data among the general public. In quarter 2 of 2006, a geochemist arranged the
meetings and consultations required in Mailuu-Suu city. A small-scale health care program was
designed by the consultant in July 2007. In September 2007, the program was transferred to the
municipal Center for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision, municipal medical institutions,
and other shareholders so that they could review the program, make comments and suggest
options for its improvement. In May 2008, a seminar was arranged in Mailuu-Suu to discuss the

                                               75
program and design activities for implementation thereof. In the future, four municipal medical
institutions headed by the municipal Center for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision would
have to actively support the program. The population residing in the neighboring villages of
Nooken area and Mailuu-Suu city was surveyed under these activities, and the outcomes of these
surveys were submitted to the DHMP implementation unit in November 2010.
Long-Term Water Quality Monitoring
The current situation in Mailuu-Suu should be taken into account when introducing a local system
for monitoring the uranium content and other water parameters. The attributes of the existing
water monitoring system are lack of equipment, shortage of skilled personnel, and
underdeveloped infrastructure.

The World Bank proposed the Terms of Reference for the long-term Monitoring Radionuclides
and Heavy Metals in Water Sources of Mailuu-Suu Program. The World Bank approved the
procurement plan and the Terms of Reference designed by the consultant of “Wisutec” LLC for
the long-term water monitoring in Mailuu-Suu on October 12, 2011. On October 31, 2011, the
consultant selection process was completed. In January 2012, the consultant submitted an initial
report and a draft of the technical specifications for a small laboratory and automatic water
quality monitoring stations considered by the PIU. Tender documentation for purchase of
equipment was prepared in March. The procurement process for laboratory equipment in Mailuu-
Suu was completed on July 31, 2012 and August 14, 2012.

The contract for UMF procurement was signed with Tekhnotsentr LLC, Russia, on August 2,
2012. As far as other laboratory equipment is concerned, the contracts were concluded on August
16, 2012, with the local companies, namely “Ilim” “Research and Production Association” LLC,
“Rosse –Techno” LLC, and “Delta-Lot” LLC. The laboratory equipment for the municipal
Center for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision in Mailuu-Suu was delivered.

River Stations in Mailuu-Suu
One gauging station was planned to be constructed for measuring the Mailuu-Suu river flow. The
data was required for the monitoring system installed in Mailuu-Suu to monitor the river flow in
different seasons of the year. This was important as there were cases recorded of different
substances washed out of tailings and waste rock dumps and further falling into the river.
In quarter 3 of 2006, the consultant undertook a study to determine the place where the gauging
station would be constructed, which was subsequently agreed with the PIU and the MES staff.
The consultant submitted the final technical specifications in January 2007. The design and
estimate documentation for the gauging station was submitted to the PIU in September 2007. The
tender took place in November, and the contract for KGS 3,899,886 was awarded to
Kochkorataayiylkurulush JSC. The construction began in January 2008. The gauging station was
commissioned in September 2008.
        3. Warning, Communications, and Information Exchange Systems
           Landslide Monitoring and Early Warning Systems
A large number of locations were under a serious threat of very large landslides. Landslides were
of great concern to the MES, the local authorities, and the residents living in the nearby valleys as
the potential threat of landslides was constant, and in case of any, it would cause people’s deaths.

The design was prepared by consultant Minetti in 2004. It was him together with the PIU
personnel who designed technical specifications for geotechnical instrumentation (piezometers,
extensometers, georobots, etc.) in 2005. A tender for goods and works procurement was arranged
in May 2006, and the contract was awarded to “Chu Environmental Laboratory” LLC amounting

                                                 76
to KGS 9,640.8 thousand (about US$ 250 million). The works commenced in June 2006. The
central control units were located in the buildings of respective municipal and rural authorities,
and the data was recorded on a continuous basis. Every community where control units were
installed (computation), had 2 specialists trained who had participated in the process of
construction, installation, and debugging. Every specialist was awarded a certificate confirming
their qualifications.

In December 2006, all of the facilities were accepted by special commissions, and acceptance
certificates were issued. Construction works on the landslide monitoring and early warning
systems in Osh and Jalal-Abad oblasts completed: geotechnical equipment for early landslide
warning was installed, namely 6 piezometers and 10 extensometers in set with the radio
equipment, for 5 pilot landslides in 3 localities including: 1) Taran–Bazar school in Taran-Bazar
village, Suzak district, Jalal-Abad oblast; 2) Gulcha – 2002; 3) Gulcha transport base in Gulcha
village, Alay district, Osh oblast; 4) Kok-Yangak Center; 5) Kok-Yangak Capital mine in Kok-
Yangak. The landslide monitoring and early warning systems were installed in 2006 and
transferred to the balance of ayiylny districts where the systems were located. The
instrumentation was well adjusted and was functioning in accordance with the technical
parameters set. However, soon after, the systems were broken and stolen by the local population.
In 2007, the equipment was reinstalled and commissioned. Unfortunately, as of today, these
landslide monitoring and early warning systems are out of operation.

Those events resulted in the following: in 2011, under the Component “Emergency Preparedness
and Monitoring”, the low-cost approach to landslide monitoring and early warning was put into
practice. The materials on training, outreach and landslide monitoring were introduced to the five
pilot sites where the computerized monitoring systems had ceased to function. Training and
discussion sessions were arranged for the public and decision-makers as well as the school
children in Taran-Bazar which is most exposed to landslide hazard. In addition, another training
and outreach campaign were arranged for the school children in the summer of 2012. Most
distinguished participants were defined and rewarded with valuable prizes.

Technical, Social and Environmental Audits
In 2008, Terms of Reference for all the three types of audits were drafted and submitted for
approval to the World Bank headquarters. Given the permanent technical supervision provided by
the consultant, PIU, and the World Bank technical expert during design, construction and
operation of the facilities within the warranty period, and inspections conducted by the relevant
authorities, and as agreed by the World Bank mission, it had been decided that no additional
technical audit was need. The mid-term social and environmental audits were scheduled for 2012.

ERC Equipment Operating Costs
The ERC equipment operating costs are the responsibility of the Ministry of Emergency
Situations as the Emergency Response Center has been transferred to the balance of the Ministry.

Component 3 - Project Management
The component provided adequate financing to the personnel and activities of the Project
Implementation Unit. Experienced international management consultants were engaged at the
very beginning for the period of up to one year to provide assistance to the PIU staff on the
project implementation, and arrange on-site training for the PIU personnel. That improved the
knowledge and skills of the staff, and allowed to quickly and adequately implement the project to
the full extent.

The required vehicles and office equipment were purchased to facilitate the PIU activities. Little
repair was done in the offices in Bishkek, Osh, Jalal-Abad, and Mailuu-Suu. Additional operating
costs (operation and maintenance of vehicles, travel and subsistence costs of the PIU personnel,
office and computer supplies, and other expenses) would be largely covered by the project funds.
Several technical and social audits would be conducted during the project implementation phase
to evaluate the project implementation and PDO indicators achievement. Annual independent
audits were also financed under the component.

The project implementation proceeded successfully for the most of the time though delays
occurred. The difficulties were as follows:
• high employed turnover, particularly at the initial stages of the project and in 2009, in the
   period when the MES and the PIU were relocated from Bishkek to Osh (the period when the
   personnel had to be completely replaced, and administrative functions were suspended for
   almost 6 months);
• short-term procurement problems in 2007;
• more frequent problems related to supervising the activities performed by consultants and
   contractors.

However, the commitment of the Government to the project implementation was the key to
solving the problems, the World Bank team participating.

Project Implementation Unit
A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) was established under the Implementing Agency to
implement the project. The Unit included substantive and auxiliary personnel, namely a manager,
a financial manager, a design engineer, a marketer, a monitoring specialist, a civil engineer, a
public relations officer, a disbursement specialist, an office manager, a translator/interpreter, and
drivers. Office supplies and equipment required by the PIU was purchased.

Activities by International Consultant, PIU advisor. Bernard Velz (Germany), the consultant
selected, completed all the three phases of consulting services provision within 2005 – 2006.
Technical support was provided to the PMU and concerned the issues on the project management
effectiveness, documentation maintenance file system creation, and financial and technical
monitoring development. Jointly with the PMU, work schedules were developed for international
and local companies engaged in project and tender documentation design. The contract amounted
to US$ 151,000.

PIU staff. In 2005, the PIU was established in Bishkek and consisted of seven professionals and
several auxiliary staff (drivers, and a secretary). In accordance with the order of the MES dated
May 15, 2009, the PIU was transferred to Osh. A new PIU director was assigned. As due to
family and other reasons, relocation to Osh was impossible, the manager, the disbursement
specialist, the cashier, the interpreter/secretary, the design engineer, the ICT specialist, and the
marketer were dismissed on June 15, 2009. In August -September 2009, the key positions of the
Project Implementation Unit were staffed, and the auxiliary personnel was in place.

Audits. To audit the Disaster Hazard Mitigation project, on February 27, 2006, the contract was
concluded with the “Jacobs Audit” amounting to US$ 3,800. The auditing services were delivered
in June 2006. The contract for DHMP signed for 2007 amounted to US$ 4,600; the contract value
in 2008 made US$ 5,500; and US$ 5,300 in 2009. To audit the DHMP 2010, the contract was
signed with “Marka Audit”, and the amount contracted was US$ 5,984; the amount of the
contract for 2011 was US$ 5,984; and the contract for 2012 amounted to US$ 5,984.

    Renovation of PIU Offices. Offices in Bishkek and Mailuu-Suu were renovated in May 2005.
    The office in Osh was renovated in October – November 2009.

    PIU Equipment. In 2007, the contracts of purchase were concluded for purchasing 3 vehicles,
    furniture, computers, and office equipment. In 2009, one “Chevrolet Niva” was purchased from
    the local company “ABM cars”.

Critical Analysis Performed by the World Bank, Government, and the Technical Support Group

    Appraisal of the World Bank and Other Partners’ Performance

    World Bank
    Key decisions facilitating the project implementation
    The project implementation was closely monitored by the Bank team which greatly assisted in the
    following:
    - design the legislation necessary to perform the activities planned under the components of the
        Disaster Hazard Mitigation Project;
    - design the tender documentation, terms of reference, environmental management plans, etc.;
    - disseminate the information related to the project by involving the Bank representatives in
        various workshops;
    - acquire timely response to our technical requirements or requests for assistance on issues
        related to the World Bank procedures;
    - successfully share the WB knowledge with the PIU regarding the transfer of radioactive
        waste, management, etc., as well as the procurement procedures;
    - ensure that the project implementation was properly funded by the government;
    - provide timely support, when additional IDA funding was provided for the Mailuu-Suu River
        bank protection along the service road and for transfer of additional volume of Waste Dump
        No.1;
    - acquire timely approval for project extension.

    A joint analysis of the activities from the beginning of 2006 performed by the World Bank and
    the entities responsible for the project implementation showed that it would be not possible to
    have the planned activities on the project whose closing date had been determined March 31,
    2010, accomplished. So, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic formally requested of the
    project extension with the closing date identified December 31, 2012. The request was acceded
    by the Bank, and the project was closed at the end of 2012.

    Co-financing included the PHRD grant by the Government of Japan for capacity building
    (US$ 1.95 mln.) and a GEF grant request for financing medium-sized projects (US$ 1.0 mln.).
    Other partners, to a certain extent, also coordinated funding of the project activities related to
    technical and social issues (for example, ADB, BGR, EU, IAEA, and UNDP). It should be
    mentioned that the IAEA played an important role as a technical partner that promoted
    introduction of the best practices and standards within project activities envisaged by Component
    1. No comments were received from the co-financing organizations.

    World Bank’s Supervision Evaluation
    The Bank played a key role in the identification, preparation and evaluation of this project.

                                                    79
The Bank provided support during the project implementation phase by monitoring and / or
implementing support missions, as well as analyzing and providing permits or, if necessary,
providing comments and recommendations on the procurement documents prepared by the
DHMP implementation unit.

Supervisory and support missions were carried out two times a year, on a fairly regular basis. The
missions were pragmatic, each including site visits and programs and operations analyses, and the
key personnel of the DHMP implementation unit had a lot to learn. When the PIU was relocated
from Bishkek to Osh, the World Bank team contributed greatly to the PIU capacity restoration, it
particularly concerned the administration, financial management and procurement procedures. A
special contribution that should be noted was the assistance of the World Bank Infrastructure
Consultant: not only did the Consultant provide technical advice during the Bank missions on the
project, but the DHMP implementation unit was provided with written recommendations on the
types of construction works had to be taken account when designing technical specifications for
the upcoming construction contracts and conducting monitoring visits to the sites.

It should be also mentioned that the World Bank team did its best in ensuring that the funds
required for the project implementation were provided by the government. Taking the
aforementioned into account, we consider the Bank’s performance as highly satisfactory.

Appraisal of the Government Performance at Project Implementation
Key decisions facilitating the project implementation
In general, the Government did support the Project and objectives thereof, which became one of
the decisive factors for success. As already mentioned, in spite of the two serious financial crises
of 2005 and 2010 accompanied by significant changes in the state administration, the support
provided to the project seemed to be continuous with relatively short work stoppages. Before and
during the project preparation and during project implementation, the focus was on continuous
improvement of the natural disaster prevention and mitigation measures and fulfillment of
environmental damage restoration commitments (particularly in Mailuu-Suu, the area situated
downstream from the river basin in Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan). The fact that the final
decision regarding the approval of the National Emergency Prevention and Response Plan (see
Par. 68 above) was frozen led to some doubts about the Government’s commitment to fulfill its
obligations on introducing potential disasters prevention and response measures. However, the
MES and the Government worked on the National Platform of the Kyrgyz Republic for Disaster
Risk Reduction, which confirmed the Government’s commitments.
In addition, the Government proved its commitment to the project and the project objectives by
continuously providing counterpart funding during the project implementation; and designing and
implementing technical management and monitoring programs during the last stage of the project
and after the project had been closed at its own expense.

1.      The project was implemented by the PIU under the MES (later under the Tailings
Management Agency (TMA) subordinated to the MES). The MES maintained its commitment to
the project objectives at all the project phases. Some of the issues concerned the following:
        - the PIU personnel at the beginning of the project and after the MES had been
            relocated to Osh;
        - location of and functioning support, starting from 2006, to the ERC system which
            proved to be useful (for example, severe winter of 2012 which affected the population,
            and numerous cases of landslides that took place in 2011-2012.)



                                                 80
        - establishment of the Tailings Management Agency which would be responsible for
          fulfilling the environmental damage obligations;
        - technical maintenance of the rehabilitated areas, starting from 2010, completion of the
          activities, and implementation of the closure plan, i.e. after closing the project in
          December 2012 until today (November 2013).

2.       Still, in spite of great difficulties with staff turnover at the beginning of the project and
after the decision taken on relocation to Osh, the PIU performance was satisfactory, on the whole.
The PIU team, for the most part, consisted of the experts specializing in management, including
experts on fiduciary issues, and the international consultants with whom the contracts had been
concluded for the duration of the project, provided assistance on the technical aspects. The team
also included a public relations specialist with the home base in Mailuu-Suu whose job was to
deal with local communities. No serious or specific challenges were mentioned with regard to
procurement, and financial management beside short-term challenges that, in general, were
resolvable. The PIU would draw comprehensive quarterly and annual reports as agreed in the
Grant Agreement including M&E reports, and would use the indicators of the Project
Performance Matrix and performance criteria of the Environment Management Plan as the main
tools for monitoring.

3.       However, some restrictions were mentioned in the Aid Memoires on the Mission. They
particularly referred to consultants and supervision of activities undertaken by contractors. As
already mentioned, several issues associated with contracts execution had to be resolved by
involving the World Bank team to correct or eliminate the deficiencies. At the end of the project,
it could be seen that the project management had significantly worsened, as the focus was on the
transfer of Storage Facility No.18, which had not been agreed upon, instead of focusing on the
implementation of the closure plan, as a result, the project management was evaluated as
moderately unsatisfactory. However, based on the Implementation Completion and Results
Report mission, all the activities performed including the closure plan had been completed, which
could lead to a satisfactory evaluation.

Key decisions preventing project implementation
- Adverse weather conditions, political events that took place in the country in 2005 – 2010; PIU
office relocation from Bishkek to Osh in 2009; the population protesting from June to September
2010 against relocation of Tailing No.3 to Tailing No.6. Four outreach campaigns on the DHMP
were arranged for the population residing in villages Sary-Bee and Kara-Zhygach, and Mailuu-
Suu with the PIU staff, “Wisutec” LLC representative, experts of the Ministry of Emergency
Situations of the Kyrgyz Republic, and representatives of the local administration involved.
Timely co-financing
No payments were delayed by the Government, except the last ones of 2012.
Government changes and impact on monitoring and evaluation
 ­   Based on the decision of the Government, the Ministry of Emergency Situations was
     relocated to Osh in 2009, so was the PIU which was originally based in Bishkek. As the
     PIU key personnel refused to relocate, a new PIU had to be established. The relocation
     adversely affected the project status, and it only improved when the new PIU started
     working in full force.
 ­   Considering the support, commitment and accomplishments of the Government, the
     Ministry of Emergency Situations and the PIU, as well as the above mentioned drawbacks,
     the Borrower performance was evaluated as satisfactory.

                                                 81
Key Lessons Learnt
The DHMP refers to the type of complex projects that are not often implemented by the Bank or
other donors due to the difficulties of the activities associated with highly specialized technical
and scientific concepts, and such sensitive topics for communities, for example the obligation to
restore environmental damage caused by mining enterprises, not to mention radioactive
enterprises, that may affect their interests. In this sense, the project has provided a positive
experience from which the Bank and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic could learn some
lessons to consider them when developing similar projects in the future:
Communities Interaction and Participation. From the very beginning of the project, the focus has
to be made on sustainability through community participation. The DHMP has proved that the
interaction and participation of communities is one of the key elements of the design,
implementation and sustainability of natural disasters and the responsibility of projects for
preservation and restoration of the environmental situation.
    o In case of activities on restoration of the environmental situation under Component 1:
         implementation of the coherent interaction and participation strategy including for
         example a proactive information center established in Mailuu-Suu could help the
         population to better understand the current plans, and simplify future maintenance (for
         example, avoid damages to fences or materials) of tailings or waste rock dumps, etc.
    o In case of landslide monitoring (Component 2): involving the school in Taran-Bazar
         highlighted certain advantages of unsophisticated / low cost options in comparison with
         the technically advanced and more expensive options selected at the beginning of the
         project.
    o Indeed, the integrity of interaction, training or awareness–building shall be provided
         within the institutional system making it a function, for example TMA / MES, as well as
         within municipal authorities or local schools administrations. Such capacity development
         shall be the incorporated in the project plan from the very beginning.

Project design.
    o The importance of involving as many experienced international and internal experts as
        possible from the design phase till the project closing time for the projects associated
        with complex scientific or technical concepts was proved by the DHMP.
    o Monitoring and maintenance sustainability. Project closing plans of similar projects
        should be integrated into the initial or early engineering planning phase to have sufficient
        time and clear rules for strengthening of the state capacity at the local, district, oblast and
        national level to smoothly move over to the project closing and ensure adequate long-
        term monitoring and maintenance of the project.
    o The time required for design and implementation of the relatively complex, in terms of
        technical, institutional or communications aspect, projects should not be underestimated.
        It particularly refers to the cases where we can assume probable additional climatic or
        political circumstances or other technical difficulties. Taking the DHMP as an example,
        the project implementation time targeted was 2004 – 2010, but in fact, given the project
        modifications, the project was extended to 2012, i.e. 9 years (including the time for post-
        project activities).

Productivity and Quality Evaluation of the World Bank - Government Relations at the
Project Implementation
The Government has completed the activities that remained to be performed after the project
closing-up, and established an institutional tool aimed to ensure proper maintenance of the

                                                  82
Mailuu-Suu area and the communications system for natural disasters. Pilot landslide monitoring
system at the community level is still operating, which is almost a year after the project was
closed. Despite the commitment of the current Government to fulfill its obligations and the focus
on the natural disasters, as well as the improvement of the ecological situation in the Mailuu-Suu
area, only in a longer term will it be possible to see whether the performance indicators of the
Tailings Management Agency (TMA), local government bodies, and local communities are
observed both in terms of the budget allocation when dealing with priorities in the economy and
development and in terms of adequate staffing.

Today, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic is working to develop the mining sector (related
mainly to gold and basic metals extraction) and improve the management of the sector.
Environment protection management including monitoring and mining sites closure is an
important element of such development. Joint activities on arranging mining operations and
environment measures could provide the opportunity to further develop the experience gained
through the Project, and contribute to the economic development of the country.

The Project contributed in acquiring great experience by public officials, technical staff and
local contractors in fulfilling their commitment to restore the environmental damage caused by
mining companies. Such experience should be shared through workshops and conferences.
