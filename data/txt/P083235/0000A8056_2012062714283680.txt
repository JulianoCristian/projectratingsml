                         Within the context of the country's longer-term interests in disaster hazard mitigation, the development objective of the proposed Disaster Hazard Mitigation Project
                         (DHMP) is to: (i) minimize the exposure of humans, livestock, and riverine flora and fauna to radionuclides associated with abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste
                         rock dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area;(ii) improve the effectiveness of emergency management and response by national and sub-national authorities and local
                         communities to disaster situations; and (iii) reduce the loss of life and property in key landslide areas of the country. These objectives will be accomplished through key
                         mitigation measures designed to: (i) isolate and protect abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps from disturbance by natural processes such as
                         landslides and floods, and from leaching and dispersal processes associated with ground- and surface-water drainage; isolate long-standing hazards and prevent their
                         disturbance; (ii) create an effective disaster management and response system; and (iii) develop a system to detect and warn against active landslide movements in
                         about 20 key hazard areas.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project's objective of Component 1, reducing the potential risk of exposure to Uranium and other radioactive substances for human population, livestock and ecosystems in
                         Mailuu Suu has been substantially achieved. However, a harsh and prolonged winter and additional quantities of radioactive materials discovered at tailings management facility
                         (TMF) 03 have prompted another extension of the project lifetime to September 2012. By now about 90% of radioactive tailings stored at TMF 03 (which is at significant landslide risk)

                         have been relocated to a safe repository built on the footprint of the existing TMF 06. In a similar manner about 85% of the remaining radioactive waste rock at Waste Dump (WD) 01
                         have been relocated to the safely engineered dump site at WD 02. Despite delays experienced during implementation the activities undertaken for the safe, sustainable closure of
                         both TMF 03/18 and WD01 continue to progress and closure and covering of TMF03 and WD01 is foreseen to start early summer 2012. By September 2012 final closure and the
                         finalization of long term stable cover systems is foreseen.
                         Component 2 (Disaster Preparedness and Monitoring) has suffered severe setbacks, as the landslide monitoring systems financed and installed by the project have become
                         dysfunctional due to vandalism and theft. However, the Ministry for Emergency Situations (MES) has commenced and continues to pursue a low cost , low tech approach for
                         landslide monitoring and early warning. In one community especially at risk a training of and discussion with the elders and decision makers was carried out, and now a modified
                         information and training campaign will be delivered to school children, who in the targeted community are specifically at risk. A subsequent activity foresees the installation and hand-
                         over of a simple monitoring system to the communities for operation and maintenance.
