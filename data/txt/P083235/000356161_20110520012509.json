        Additional Financing for the Disaster Hazard Mitigation\n            Project for the Kyrgyz Republic is to: a) minimize the\n            exposure of humans, livestock, and fluvial flora and fauna\n            to radionuclide's associated with abandoned uranium\n            mine tailings and waste rock dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area;\n            b) improve the effectiveness of emergency management and\n            response by national and sub-national authorities and local\n            communities to disaster situations; and c) reduce the loss\n            of life and property in key landslide areas of the country.\n            The additional funds will enable repairing the flood damage\n            inflicted during project implementation on crucial road\n            infrastructure necessary for the transport of radioactive\n            materials. Furthermore, the Additional Finance (AF) will\n            also contribute to the relocation of additional volumes of\n            radioactive waste rock from Waste Dump 1 (WD1), which were\n            discovered during project implementation up to date, as well\n            as the continued relocation of radioactive tailings from\n            Tailings Pond Number 3 (TP3). Lastly, the AF will support\n            monitoring activities for strengthening capacities of\n            measuring uranium and other toxicological elements in\n            various water resources. The AF does not affect the\n            project's development objective."}, "docdt": "2011-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
