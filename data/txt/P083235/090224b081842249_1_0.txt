                         Within the context of the country's longer-term interests in disaster hazard mitigation, the development objective of the proposed Disaster Hazard Mitigation Project
                         (DHMP) is to: (i) minimize the exposure of humans, livestock, and riverine flora and fauna to radionuclides associated with abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste
                         rock dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area;(ii) improve the effectiveness of emergency management and response by national and sub-national authorities and local
                         communities to disaster situations; and (iii) reduce the loss of life and property in key landslide areas of the country. These objectives will be accomplished through key
                         mitigation measures designed to: (i) isolate and protect abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps from disturbance by natural processes such as
                         landslides and floods, and from leaching and dispersal processes associated with ground- and surface-water drainage; isolate long-standing hazards and prevent their
                         disturbance; (ii) create an effective disaster management and response system; and (iii) develop a system to detect and warn against active landslide movements in
                         about 20 key hazard areas.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project's objective of reducing the potential risk of exposure to Uranium and other radioactive substances for human population, livestock and ecosystems in Mailuu Suu has
                         been substantially achieved. By now about 98% of radioactive tailings originally stored at tailings management facility (TMF 03, which is at significant landslide risk) have been
                         relocated to a safe repository built on the footprint of the existing TMF 06. In a similar manner all of the remaining radioactive waste rock at Waste Dump (WD) 01 have been

                         relocated to the safely engineered dump site at WD 02. TMF18 will remain in situ untouched, as it was found to present too low a risk to justify relocation.

                         The radiological analytical laboratory in the local branch of the State Sanitary and Epidemiological Commission was delivered, installed and put into operation by a team of experts
                         hired by the project. Local staff was trained, and a monitoring program developed for the community, and practiced with the designated staff responsible for sampling and monitoring.
                         Mailuu Suu now has the capabilities to undertake analyses of gross radioactive substances and the radiation levels in water and groundwater samples, thus enabling a more precise
                         picture of Mailuu Suu’s risk situation regarding surface water and drinking water.

                         The Disaster Preparedness and Monitoring component has commenced and continues to pursue a low cost , low tech approach for landslide monitoring and early warning. In one
                         community especially at risk a training of and discussion with the elders and decision makers was carried out for adult community members. Also a modified information and training
                         campaign was delivered to school children in summer 2012, who are at specific risk in the targeted community.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Despite delays experienced during implementation the activities undertaken for the safe, sustainable closure of both TMF 03/18 and WD01 continue to progress and closure and
                         covering of TMF03 and WD01 is foreseen for the end of 2012. There will be some recultivation, landscaping, drainage and greening of the sites that cannot be completed under the
                         project and will have to be carried out with financing from, and managed by MES (Ministry for Emergency situations).
