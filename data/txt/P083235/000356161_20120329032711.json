The reallocation is\n            necessary as the volume of civil works and consultancy\n            services is higher than originally estimated due to\n            increased quantities of radioactive tailings having to be\n            relocated from Tailings Management Facility (TMF) 03. The\n            current reallocation contains a small deviation from the\n            request from the Ministry of Finance in order to match the\n            revised amounts in the land and property and incremental\n            operating costs categories with the amounts actually\n            disbursed. This deviation has been approved by Ministry of\n            Finance on March 20, 2012. This will be the second extension\n            of the closing date and is expected that completion of the\n            works, including the relocation of the additional 38,000"}, "docdt": "2012-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
