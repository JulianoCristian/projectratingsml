                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Within the context of the country's longer-term interests in disaster hazard mitigation, the development objective of the proposed Disaster Hazard Mitigation
                         Project (DHMP) is to: (i) minimize the exposure of humans, livestock, and riverine flora and fauna to radionuclides associated with abandoned uranium mine
                         tailings and waste rock dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area;(ii) improve the effectiveness of emergency management and response by national and sub-national
                         authorities and local communities to disaster situations; and (iii) reduce the loss of life and property in key landslide areas of the country. These objectives will
                         be accomplished through key mitigation measures designed to: (i) isolate and protect abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps from
                         disturbance by natural processes such as landslides and floods, and from leaching and dispersal processes associated with ground- and surface-water
                         drainage; isolate long-standing hazards and prevent their disturbance; (ii) create an effective disaster management and response system; and (iii) develop a
                         system to detect and warn against active landslide movements in about 20 key hazard areas.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All activities undertaken by the project so far have reduced the risk, that radioactive material from tailings and waste dumps in the Mailuu-Suu area could be dislodged in significant

                         quantities and reach the Mailuu-Suu River, which would negatively impact downstream water users. The risk of landslide activation damaging mine waste facilities, resulting in
                         accidental spills of radioactive material, has also been significantly reduced. The remaining and ongoing works continue with the relocation radioactive material (mine waste and
                         tailings) to safe, managed storage facilities, that will further contribute to the avoidance of contamination of the environment and negative impacts on human health and safety.
                         A new emergency management and response plan that was prepared under the project is under consideration by Government and is scheduled to be ratified by the parliament. The
                         plan streamlines the way emergencies are managed in the country and includes specific measures for prevention of, and response to incidents involving radioactive materials.
                         After pointing out shortcomings in site maintenance in the project area during the last supervision mission, the Ministry for Emergency Situations (MES) has established an effective,
                         regular care and maintenance routine for remediated sites, thus protecting the investments made under the project and securing their long term physical integrity.
