for the Kyrgyz Republic had an overall moderately\n            satisfactory outcome, with the performances of the Bank and\n            the borrower being deemed moderately satisfactory as well.\n            Of the four project development objectives indicators\n            (PDOs), two were fully achieved, one was incompletely\n            achieved, and one indicator was dropped. Of the four\n            intermediate outcome indicators, two were achieved, while\n            the remaining indicators were dropped. The following\n            significant lessons were learned during the implementation\n            of the project: 1) communication and community participation\n            are key elements in the design, implementation and\n            sustainability of natural hazards and environmental\n            liability remediation projects; 2) PDOs and key performance\n            indicators are crucial; 3) the importance of involving\n            international or national experienced specialists from\n            preparation to closure; 4) early development of the plans to\n            close the mine tailings and waste dumps, stop relocation\n            works, based on risk assessment and design of covering,\n            drainage and vegetation measures should be part of initial\n            engineering planning; and 5) the time necessary for the\n            preparation and implementation of relatively complex\n            projects from a technical, institutional and communication\n            point of view should not be underestimated."}, "docdt": "2013-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
