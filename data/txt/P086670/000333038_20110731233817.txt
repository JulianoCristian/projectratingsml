I. Disbursement Profile
1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      The Health Sector Management Project was approved on May 13, 2004. The Loan
Agreement was signed on July 15, 2004 and became effective on September 15, 2004. The
Project was the second health supported project by the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (IBRD) 1. The Project complemented reforms supported by a series of
programmatic public sector management adjustment loans and the associated technical
assistance financed by the Dutch Trust Fund. One of the adjustment loans was the Public
Sector Management Adjustment Loan (PSMAL), which was approved at the same time and
supported policy changes in the Health Insurance Fund (HIF) contracting with hospitals and
the introduction of internal changes to strengthen financial management in the HIF.

1.1     Context at Appraisal

2.      At the time of independence, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was
economically one of the least developed of the six republics. In the years immediately
following independence, the economy contracted even more. During the period 1991-95,
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth was negative (averaging -3.1 percent per year);
inflation reached 400 percent per year. Efforts by successive governments during the period
1996-2000 brought about an average positive GDP growth rate of 2.9 percent per year, with
inflation declining to 2.2 percent per year. However, these gains on the economic front were
jeopardized by the outbreak of civil conflict in 2001.

3.      The Government in power in 2004 was committed to implementing reforms to
facilitate economic growth, poverty reduction and social stability. Sound management of
public expenditures was key to achieving these goals. The Government worked closely with
the Bank in implementing public expenditure management reforms. Achieving cost-
containment in the health sector without sacrificing the goals of quality and equal access was
a key element of the GOM’s public expenditure management program.

4.      Public expenditures on health had been in the range of 5.5 – 5.6 percent of GDP
during the period 2001-2004. This was higher than the average spending for lower middle
income countries (2.3 percent) and the average for the Europe and Central Asia Region
(ECA) which was 4 percent. Government spending on health as a percentage of total
government spending was also high in comparison to other lower middle income countries.
Private expenditures on health, both formal and informal, accounted for 3.3 percent of GDP
in 1999. This was high as compared with lower middle income countries.

5.      Despite high spending levels, quality was a problem. In opinion polls conducted
prior to appraisal, the public had persistently rated the health care system as “poor” or “very
poor”. Excess capacity was not a major problem. The number of doctors and nurses in the


1
  The first health supported operation (US$16.9 million) was the Health Sector Transition Project approved by
the Bank on June 20, 1996.



                                                   1
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYRM) was close to the ECA average. In
addition, the country had lower hospital capacity and higher number of dentists compared to
other ECA countries. The inpatient admission rate was much lower than the European Union
(EU) average, and the average length of stay (ALOS) was slightly higher than the EU
average. However, the occupancy rate in hospitals had steadily worsened and it was only 53
percent in 2004. Equally, allocative efficiency was a concern and a large proportion of
spending went to secondary and tertiary in-patient care. Low levels of investments in
primary health care (PHC) had resulted in a primary care system that provided poor quality
care, especially in rural areas. It was not surprising, therefore, that patients tended to by-pass
primary care in favor of treatment at highly specialized health care institutions (HCIs).

6.      Health care financing was and is still organized around a social insurance system
managed by the HIF. The HIF was and is still primarily funded through payroll
contributions although this source of revenue as a percentage of total HIF revenue was
steadily fallen from 75 percent to 63 percent in 2001. Most of the remaining revenues came
from the Pension Fund, the Unemployment Fund and general revenues. The HIF was
responsible for the allocation of 90 percent of government health expenditures. A
combination of factors such as shortfalls on the revenue side and poor expenditure
management had contributed to persistent cash deficits and the HIF had steadily accumulated
debts to suppliers estimated at13 percent of annual expenditures. Provider payment systems,
especially at the hospital level were inadequate and were major cost-drivers in the system. In
addition, the benefits package was and remains too generous as compared with available HIF
revenues and was contributing to the problem of implicit rationing and informal payments.

7.      Health services were delivered through a network of public and private health care
institutions. The number of private providers, especially in PHC and dental practices was
steadily growing. Hospitals were public, although the process of establishing private
hospitals had been initiated. In the medium-term, the government aimed to completely
privatize the provision of health care services, including some health care services in PHC.
The main challenges in health services delivery was weak capacity of health providers to
operate in the reformed health care environment where they were expected to operate as
managers of health facilities, poor quality of care (outdated clinical guidelines, lack of
continuity between the different levels of care) and the need to improve efficiency.

8.      A functioned review of the Ministry of Health (MOH) had been done prior to
appraisal. It showed that there was an urgent need to realign its roles and functions towards
the core functions of policy formulation and implementation, priority setting and monitoring
health system performance and coordination. In addition to the core functions, there was a
need to develop its capacity in budget formulation and human resources policy management.

9.      Although successive governments had implemented health reforms, many of these
reforms had been piecemeal, and had in some cases, generated new problems. For
example, a shift to HIF dependence on payroll contributions left the health system vulnerable
to shifts in formal employment. The choice of the “points system” to reimburse provider
proved unworkable leading to a problem of rapid growth in reimbursement claims. This had
caused HIF to revert to the old system of reimbursing against inputs which provided no



                                              2
incentives for providers to be efficient in the delivery of care. Notwithstanding these
problems, there had also been successes on the policy and program front. For example, the
HIF had introduced a capitation-based payment system for PHC and the MOH had focused
on improving the quality of newborn health care services.

10.     Despite these improvements, substantial challenges remained to reduce the fiscal
risks in the health sector and improve quality and access. Decentralization was seen as an
important policy priority of the government, although so far, the impact on the health sector
had been limited. To achieve the objectives of cost-containment and improved quality and
access, the Government had to focus on strengthening the capacity of the MOH, HIF, and
health providers with the objective of improving performance and enhancing transparently
and accountability across the various entities. The Government had identified policy reform
and capacity building of the HIF and MOH and providers as key to achieving its health sector
objectives.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

11.     The objectives of the Project were to: (i) upgrade MOH and HIF capacity to
formulate and effectively implement health policies, health insurance, financial management,
and contracting of providers; and (ii) develop and implement an efficient scheme of
restructuring of hospital services with emphasis on developing day-care services and shifting
to primary care.

12.     The achievement of the PDO was to be measured by the following performance
indicators as identified in the main text of the PAD2 and Attachment 3 of the Minutes of
Negotiations.

    1. Decrease by 15 percent the average length of stay (ALOS) in all hospitals.
    2. Increase out-patient surgery by 20 percent of total surgeries for indicators, selected by
       December 2006.
    3. Decrease by 30 percent the number of re-admissions for the same condition within a
       3-month tine period.
    4. Increase the amount of collected contributions by 5 percent, as well as the number of
       contributors.
    5. Reduction in administrative costs and personnel input for the issuance of the health
       insurance cards (blue coupons).
    6. Reduction in the number of drugs purchased in non-HIF contracted pharmacies and
       reimbursed by HIF.
    7. Reduction in the number of referrals to out-patient specialist and to hospitals by 10
       percent.



2
  The Results Framework – Annex 3 of the PAD contained the same set of indicators but in a different
order.



                                                 3
      8. Decline in out of pocket payments for health care and drugs among groups eligible
          for HIF co-payment waivers.
      9. Fifteen guidelines developed and distributed according to international standards.
      10. 30 percent of contracted health care providers complying with newly developed
          clinical guidelines.
      11. Yearly HIF audits acceptable.
      12. Average length of drugs registration process, for all drugs, decrease by 25 percent.
      13. All practicing doctors, dentists and pharmacists licensed in accordance with the new
          procedure.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

13.     The PDO and the Results Framework were not revised. Although agreement was
reached at the Mid-Term Review (MTR - November-December 2006) that the Results
Framework will be changed, no formal request was received by the Bank despite numerous
reminders, therefore, the indicators remained the same. In practice: (i) an additional PDO
indicator was monitored regarding execution of grants, and (ii) the indicator on the amount of
contribution and contributors was reported as two separate indicators. Accordingly, the data
sheet of this ICR reports on 15 indicators rather than 13 noted in the PAD.

1.4      Main Beneficiaries

14.     Direct beneficiaries of the Project investments included: (i) MOH and HIF who
benefitted from overall institutional capacity strengthening, computer hardware and software,
improved information systems, and training; (ii) hospital and other health institution
managers who benefitted from health management training; (iii) physicians who benefited
from family medicine (FM) re-training and for FM specialization; and (iv) health institutions
in municipalities and Skopje who benefitted from the Integrated Health Information System
(IHIS). The HIF specifically benefitted from the introduction of improved provider payment
mechanisms which are generating incentives for provider efficiency. Health care providers
also benefited from development of staff skills, introduction of new management methods
and instruments, new/updated clinical guidelines, and essential upgrades of units selected to
implement well defined sub-projects financed through grants. The population at large who
benefitted from improved understanding of the reform agenda through public relations
campaigns to explain the reform.

1.5      Original Components

15.      The Project had the following four components3:




3
  It should be noted that the allocations by component changed during project implementation. Please refer to
Annex 1.



                                                   4
        Component 1 – Policy Formulation and Implementation (US$1.04 million or 9%
of total project costs). The component supported the first-phase implementation of the
functional review of MOH to shift from its current day-to-day administrative functions to
that of priority-setting, policy making, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The
component had three sub-components: (i) support to overall health policy and strategy
development, (ii) public relations (PR) and communications, and (iii) improving MOH
management and business process.

        Component 2 – Strengthening HIF Governance and Management (US$3.45
million or 30% of total project costs). The objective of the component was to help
implement positive changes in various core HIF functions such as revenue collection, HIF
management, and purchasing. Strengthening of these functions was expected to improve
fiscal discipline, transparency and the effectiveness of service provided by the HIF. The
component included three sub-components: (i) eligibility criteria and revenue collection, (ii)
HIF management, and (iii) purchasing functions.

         Component 3 – Improving Service Delivery (US$5.58 million or 49% of total
project costs). The component aimed at improving the quality and efficiency of health care
providers by supporting development of staff skills, introduction of new management
methods and instruments and essential upgrades of units selected to implement well defined
sub-projects. These improvements were to enhance the management and operational
capacity of health care providers, putting them in a better position to respond to the
challenges and incentives of new contracting arrangements with the HIF. The component
included two sub-components: (i) hospital management and primary health care (PHC), and
(ii) a grant facility for improving service quality and efficiency.

       Component 4 – Project Management and Monitoring (US$1.27 million or 11% of
total project costs). The component was to ensure effective administration and
implementation of the Project by supporting the operation of a Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) to be responsible for all the day-to-day project implementation activities on behalf of
the MOH and HIF. The PCU was established prior to appraisal. The PCU staff reported to a
Principal Project Coordinator who reported to the Project Steering Committee.

1.6       Revised Components

16.    Although the components were not revised, there were several reallocations of
funds among components addressed on Section 1.7 below. For more details, also refer to
Annex 2.

1.7       Other significant changes

17.       There were four amendments to the Loan Agreement:

         The First amendment, letter of November 17, 2004 concurred with the
          Government’s request that the Front End Fee waiver of US$ 50,000 be reallocated to




                                             5
        an “unallocated” category. Accordingly, the Disbursement Schedule in the Loan
        Agreement was amended to create an “unallocated” category.

       The second amendment, letter of June 11, 20094 included reallocation of funds and
        extension of the closing date (see below). The reallocation of funds: (i) increased
        funding for some categories of expenditure (consultants’ services, training, and
        incremental operating costs) as a result of introducing some new activities 5 under
        Component 1, and (ii) reduced the scope of some original activities (grants’ facility
        and goods). The reallocation of funds increased funding for the activities mentioned
        above using savings generated by the reduction in the Grants activity (Component 3)
        and the implementation of the IHIS software, which the Government agreed to
        finance with its own funds (Component 3).

        In terms of consultants, the reallocation financed: (i) additional technical assistance to
        support the implementation of the Health Strategy (condition under PSMAL), and (ii)
        additional technical assistance related to the Public Relations Campaign to build
        capacity in MOH and HIF to communicate health reform plans to stakeholders and
        the general public (Component 1). Additional funds for training were needed to
        expand management training (Component 3) to allow hospitals to meet the
        performance targets under the contracting scheme (Component 2) and improve
        coordination between PHC and hospital providers under Component 3. Additional
        incremental operating costs (Component 4) were needed to support the operations of
        working groups (WGs) throughout the project implementation period (para 30). It is
        important to note that with this reallocation of funds; the original component
        allocations changed substantially (see Annex 1). It is also important to clarify that the
        hardware for the IHIS was procured under Component 3 although, as designed, the
        various elements of IT were programmed under the three components. In the view of
        this evaluation, the reallocations were justified. The additional activities were high
        priority to the MOH and HIF, important for the implementation of reforms under the
        PDPL 3, and were consistent with the original project description and PDO.

       The third amendment, letter of March 8, 2010 increased the percentage of financing
        of the Loan proceeds to 100% (the categories benefitting from this increase were
        consultants’ services and incremental operating costs).
       The fourth amendment, letter of June 8, 2010 related to the second extension of the
        closing date (see below).




4
   A second letter was sent by the Bank related to this amendment (letter of February 22, 2010) to correct
“typographical errors” on the June 2009 letter. The errors related to amounts under the training and front-end-
fee categories.

5
  Additional activities supported implementation of health reforms within the parameters of the project
description and the PDO.



                                                    6
18.    The closing date of the Loan was extended twice for a total of 18 months. The first
extension was for 12 months (letter of June 11, 2009) and was part of the second amendment
of the Loan agreement (from the original date of June 30, 2009 to June 30, 2010). The
extension of the closing date was required to: (ii) allow additional time for the procurement
of computer hardware to support the development of the Integrated Health Management
Information System (IHIS) under Component 3, (ii) expand activities resulting from the
development and adoption of the Health Strategy under Component 1, and support
implementation of PHC reforms under Component 3, and (iii) introduce activities associated
with the development of Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) under Component 2.

19.     The second extension (letter of June 8, 2010) was for six months (from June 30,
2010 to December 31, 2010). The second and final extension allowed for the effective
completion of the delivery, installation, configuration, and testing of the computer hardware
(1,695 desktops, 10 laptops, 30 servers, 70 UPSs, 40 racks for remote locations, and 200
printers) procured to operate the IHIS.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20.     The ICR team rates Design and Quality at Entry as Moderately Satisfactory on the
basis of the following features:

21.     Soundness of background analysis. The background analysis conducted during
Project preparation was Satisfactory. Project preparation was supported by a Policy and
Human Resource Development (PHRD) Grant in the amount of US$488,800, which helped
the GOM to develop project design. Project design also benefited from the findings of a
functional review of the MOH conducted during the time of preparation with financing from
the Department for International Development (DfID) through its Public Administration
Reform Project. The review found that there was an urgent need to re-align the roles and
functions of the MOH towards the core functions of policy formulation and implementation,
priority-setting, monitoring health systems performance, and coordination. In addition to the
core functions, the functional review noted the need to develop MOH capacity in budget
formulation and human resources policy management.

22.     Quality Enhancement Review (QER). A QER was conducted on July 16, 2003. At
the time of the QER the project comprised both health and social protection elements and it
was intended to be the result of a merger of two projects, which were at different stages of
preparation. The QER discussed with the team the genesis of the decision to merge the two
projects, which was determined by considerations from both the government side and the
Bank’s regional management. While the QER commended the two sectoral teams for the
decision to seek a QER at the early stage of the merged project, it highlighted the potential
risks associated with a combined operation, which would increase the complexity of the
Project thereby posing risks for Project management and coordination. Given the
circumstances, the QER proposed three alternative concepts: (i) a human development (HD)
loan in support of the second phase of the PSMAL; (ii) an HD investment loan focused on



                                            7
the introduction and application of modern information systems in social protection and
health; and (iii) separation of the two sectoral components into two different operations, one
a social protection investment loan, focusing on information systems with linked technical
assistance (TA); and a multi-sectoral (including health TA activities) TA loan linked to
PSMAL II. Subsequent to the QER, at the PCN Review meeting of October 7, 2003, the
decision was taken to split the project into two separate health and social protection projects.

23.     Assessment of Project Design. As the PAD states, the design of the Project
underwent several major changes, which are important to summarize. The Project began as a
stand-alone operation, but was subsequently merged with the Social Protection
Implementation Loan (SPIL) to benefit from synergies across the joint issues in both projects.
The decision to merge the two operations coincided with a shift in Government priorities
following the 2002 election, which primary strategy was to address waste and corruption in
the HIF. Therefore, during the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussions in 2003, it
was decided to merge the two operations into one smaller project, mainly to support PSMAL
conditionalities. This combined project was to be considerably smaller (US$15 million) than
the previous combined total of the two separate operations (US$35 million). Months later, as
noted above, the PCN review meeting decided to split the combined project into separate
Health and Social Protection projects, to be financed by two smaller investment loans
keeping within the general limit of US$15 million with the possibility to increase the loan
size of each of the two operations to US$10 million at the request of the Government.

24.     The ICR review agrees with the statement in the PAD that the decision to support
separate projects, and particularly an investment project in the health sector, was in line
with major Government objectives for the health sector supported by the PSMAL. These
objectives could have not be easily met without an investment type operation since reforms
in the health sector required considerable investments in information systems, training, and
consultant services. In addition, investments in health sector delivery systems could be used
to leverage rationalization and associated efficiency gains, which would otherwise be
difficult to achieve. In the view of the ICR team: (i) the project built on the findings of the
functional review of MOH and experience within the FYRM and elsewhere in the region, (ii)
the project tried to address the Government’s objective of cost-containment while promoting
improvement in quality and access, and (iii) it supported key elements of the CAS by
promoting the institutional development of the MOH and assisting the HIF in implementing
policy reforms included in the PSMAL. This said, this evaluation finds that: (i) the focus of
the PDO on implementing capacity building to formulate and effectively implement health
policies meant that the PDO narrowly focused on health care and not on health outcomes
while at the same time, the PDO indicators did not attempt to measure results of improved
capacity building, and (ii) while some of the indicators selected were appropriate for the
status of reforms at the design stage, perhaps some indicators were too specific for that
situation and more generic indicators may have been more appropriate. In addition, some
of the indicators could not be attributed directly or only to the Project as explained
elsewhere in this document

25.   Lessons Learned and Incorporated. The Project design addressed important
Government’s priorities and took into account key lessons learned from the implementation


                                             8
of the first Bank-financed operation in the health sector in the country as well as other health
reform projects in the ECA Region. Lessons included: (i) government ownership and active
involvement by government agencies in Project implementation is crucial for success and
sustainability, (ii) timetable for implementation should be realistic and flexible to allow
political risks to be managed, (iii) realistic assessment of the environment and capacity for
project implementation is crucial, (iv) good policy dialogue needs to be complemented by
efficient and transparent project coordination and implementation, (v) need for strong
technical assistance, training and information system development to support policy changes,
(vi) PR is necessary to ensure buy-in of the public for reforms and also to prevent unrealistic
expectations, (vii) involvement of local experts and end users in investment decisions is
crucial for the success of project progress as is the consensus between the professional and
political levels involved in decision making, (viii) need to increase the in-house capacity of
the MOH which remained weak, and (ix) M&E is key to project success.

26.     Risk assessment. The PAD identified six risks, whose rating ranked from Modest to
High. While the six risk assumptions reflected a good understanding of operating in an
environment of relatively limited institutional capacity, the Modest assessment of the risks
related to: (i) lack of resources for operation and maintenance of facilities, and (ii) lack of
counterpart funds, which were underestimated as evidenced during implementation. For
example, due to the lack of counterpart funding, the Bank increased the percentage of
financing from the Loan proceeds to 100 percent6. In addition, the PAD did not include a
risk associated with the institutional arrangements, which called for MOH to be responsible
for overall project management and implementation. Staff from MOH and HIF were
appointed Project Coordinators while consultants in the PCU were appointed as Assistant
Coordinators. In practice, the Project Coordinators did not devote adequate time to the
Project as they had other responsibilities in their respective institutions. Instead, the
consultants in the PCU functioned as de facto Component Coordinators. In addition, the
notion that the Project Principal Coordinator (a high-level MOH officer) would need to work
about 20 percent of his/her time on the Project to oversee the work of the PCU, was
unrealistic. Implementation experience demonstrated that this arrangement was not workable.
Although agreement was reached with the Minister of Health in early 2006 for MOH to
recruit a Chief Operating Officer to deal with day-to-day issues of project implementation,
this Officer was never recruited. Only during the last year of project implementation, when it
was clear that delay with the procurement of the hardware had reached a critical stage, did
MOH hire a Project Manager to provide overall coordination within the PCU.

 The category for incremental recurrent costs was to be financed by the Loan on a declining basis, starting at 95% down to
25% after January 2008, however with the amendment, the Loan financed this category at 100% of expenditures. The same
applied to goods and training which were initially to be financed at 83% for goods procured locally and at 83% for local
consultants. With the amendment, the loan financed these categories at 100%. The higher contribution from GOM noted in
Annex 1 reflects higher expenditures than initially estimated for recurrent costs, which went beyond amounts available
under the loan. During the last years of implementation, the MOH budget was able to cover the additional needs.

2.2    Implementation

27.     This evaluation rates implementation as Moderately Satisfactory. The Project was
successful in delivering most of the outputs under the four components, albeit with delays
that necessitated the extension of the closing date by 18 months. It was also successful in
achieving all PDO indicators and almost all intermediate indicators, over-achieving several
of them (see details in Table 1, Annex 2, Section 3.2, and data sheet). The Project was rated
either Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory during its life, in terms of both PDO and
implementation progress (IP). The one exception was a Moderately Unsatisfactory rating for
IP in December 2006 (as a result of the Mid Term Review). Some delays with
implementation are discussed in paras 34 – 36. In addition, the implementation of grants
took a long time to get started and only got off the ground after a great deal of discussions
during and between missions. Delays with procurement also affected implementation at
various stages. The most crucial delays related to the procurement processes for the software
(Government funding) and hardware (Loan) for the IHIS, which approaches changed several
times. By the end, both the development of software and the procurement of the hardware
were successful. The modules of the software, which were finalized, were installed and
tested; software development is to continue until May 2011. The hardware was procured,
tested and installed throughout the country prior to the revised closing date of December 31,
2010. Several factors affected implementation progress, both positively and negatively.

Positive factors and events that influenced project performance

28.     The Project was used strategically to support health reform activities and build
capacity. The Project provided the institutional under-pinning for the implementation of
health reforms under the PSMAL and the Programmatic Development Policy Loan (PDPL)
operations. The PSMAL, approved at the same time as the Project, supported important
policy changes in HIF contracting with hospitals and the introduction of internal changes
within HIF to strengthen financial management. Complemented by technical assistance
financed under a Dutch Trust Fund, the Project provided the necessary technical assistance,
training, and equipment to the HIF, with an emphasis on strengthening financial management,
contracting of providers, and pricing and reimbursement policy of pharmaceuticals. The
Project also provided hardware for the management information system. In terms of MOH,
the Project was instrumental in supporting the development/amendment of important
strategies and legislation in key areas of the reform agenda. All these activities were further
complemented with public relations activities to help inform the public and providers about
the reforms. Investments were critical for ensuring success of the reforms supported by the
adjustment operations, as well as for supporting the expansion of these reforms. This Project
was a good example of sector investments complementing a broader reform agenda
supported by adjustment operations. Project supervision was carried out in conjunction with
the design and supervision of the adjustment operations, ensuring consistency in the policy
dialogue and the messages delivered by the Bank to the GOM at the macro and micro levels.

29.    Flexibility was exercised within the parameters of the PDO to give priority to
pressing issues. Both MOH and the Bank team demonstrated flexibility at various stages of
implementation to make adjustments to Project interventions to provide more focus, better



                                            10
reflect evolving needs, and more closely align the Project activities with the overall reform
agenda. For example, in November 2005 the MOH and the Bank agreed to: (i) focus the
demonstration projects under the Grants sub-component on the seven pilot clinical centers
that were to enter into revised contracts with the HIF in 2006, and (ii) increase the Loan
allocation for technical assistance for health policy formulation under Component 1. At the
MTR of November-December 2006, agreement was also reached between the Bank and
MOH to: (i) improve the focus of project activities in the functional planning of the
restructured clinical center, (ii) establish a permanent management training facility, and (iii)
revise the approach to public relations and information to better support the government’s
long-term health policies. On June 11, 2009, the Bank agreed to a major reallocation of
funds among categories to reduce the allocation under goods from US$3.78 million to
US$3.35 and reduce the allocation for grants from US$2.36 million to US$1.60 million to
allow for an increase in the consultants’ allocation from US$2.65 million to US$3.50 million.
As explained in para 17, these reallocations were done together with the first extension of the
closing date and were within the overall parameters of the project description and the PDO.
While they required an amendment to the Loan Agreement, no changes to the project
description were needed7.

30.     Working Groups played an important role in the implementation of activities.
Although the establishment of WGs took longer than planned, one year after effectiveness
the MOH had established and appointed members of WGs to work on the various sub-
components of the Project. The composition of the WGs depended on the activities. Their
membership included not only staff of MOH and HIF, but also hospitals, the Republic
Institute of Public Health, Drug Bureau, Chamber of Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy,
different medical associations, and medical institutions. Participation of WGs in planning
and decision-making ensured a large constituency of stakeholders and thereby “buy-in” for
the reforms. According to Aide Memoires, the level of involvement by staff from all
stakeholders in the various WGs was impressive; the nature and tone of the discussions
showed increasing levels of maturity in terms of analytical and management content. During
the ICR mission, the ICR team had the opportunity to meet with the IHIS WG and was also
impressed by the level of interaction among members and their enthusiasm to see this
important part of the Project realized. To ensure the effective operation of WGs, the Bank
team showed flexibility in approving their operating costs by defraying the expenses incurred
in participating in the various meetings.

31.     Synergies between software development and hardware procurement for the IHIS.
Originally, the Loan was to support both development of software and procurement of
hardware for the IHIS. Early during implementation, it was decided with MOH that the Loan
would only finance the hardware and MOH the software. Agreement was also reached
between the Bank and MOH from the outset that both elements must be synchronized closely
to ensure the effective development of the IHIS. In fact, a condition for the first extension of
the closing date of the Loan was the signing of the contract for software development prior to

 Please refer to the memorandum of June 11, 2009 from Daniel Dulitzky (TTL) to Jane Armitage (Country
Director) on the extension of the closing date and reallocation of Loan proceeds.



                                               11
the launching of the ICB procurement of the hardware. Bank teams emphasized the need to
build a cadre of IT specialists, initially funded by Loan proceeds, who would remain in MOH
to manage and maintain the system. A WG was established in early 2009 to coordinate
implementation of the software development and hardware procurement, including
representatives from MOH and HIF, as well as IT experts hired through the Project.
Nonetheless, there were substantial delays in deciding on the approach to the procurement of
both packages and ultimately preparing technical specifications for the IT equipment. The
successful completion of this activity was threatened accordingly. The Bank mission of
October 2009 analyzed with counterparts: (i) administrative feasibility, (ii) architectural and
technical feasibility and justification, and (iii) broader context of IT development in the
sector. It provided guidance on the finalization of technical specifications and step by step
recommendations on the way forward. The Bank team provided close support to guide the
process during and between missions. This support included a detailed analysis of
architectural risks, integration of the IHIS and the HIF information systems and, in general,
guided the Government team to ensure successful procurement, testing, and delivery of
equipment throughout the country prior to Loan closing.

32.     It is important to underline that although not financed under the Loan, the Project
supported the broader conceptualization of information management in the health sector,
including PHC, hospital systems, and restructuring of the HIF information system. The Bank
used its position to leverage software development. General Practitioner (GP) modules were
already rolled out to PHC institutions and the restructuring of the HIF information system
started prior to Loan closing. In enabling the reform process, the GP modules have the
potential to put the FYRM ahead of countries in the region that started similar reforms much
before. The module for outpatient specialist care is the first of its kind in the region. The
DRG software is being integrated with the hospital management software, providing
synergies that only a few countries in the region have. The entire system, thanks to the
Project, is fully integrated with clear inter-operability features (databases talk to each other).
Beyond the software itself, the Project supported ownership of the software functionality
development, which guarantees synchronization of the reform process and software
development. This accomplishment should not be under-estimated. Similar activities
through Bank-supported projects have not been successful. More importantly, managers who
are responsible for the reforms now understand the benefits of IT and are fully in charge of
software features development to better guide the reforms. At this writing, good progress
continues to be made in the development of the software: (i) communication between IHIS
and HIF system is working well, (ii) the HIF system is providing needed data for the GP
modules and pilot inpatient module, (iii) development of the outpatient module has been
completed and its functionalities are being tested in five hospitals, (iv) training of physicians
and nurses in the application of the module has been completed, and (v) installation of the
inpatient module with DRG integration will start at the end of April 2011.

33.     Training elements under the Project were successful as readily acknowledged by
beneficiaries. While training was provided under each of the components (see Annex 2 and
Section 3.5(b)), two types of training were particularly effective for improving the capacity
in the sector. These were: (i) training for management and staff of hospital and PHC boards,
HIF Board, as well as for hospitals managers, and (ii) training for FM implementation under



                                             12
a contract with the University of Ljubliana Family Medicine Department. The hospital
management and leadership training program was particularly successful. By the end of the
Project, 500 staff had participated in the three-month training course. Exams were developed
and introduced as a requirement for all future managers of public health institutions. The
contract with the University of Ljubliana, includes: (i) revision of curriculum for FM, (ii)
preparation of curriculum for retraining of doctors in PHC, (iii) exam preparation, (iv)
training of professors to conduct exams, and (v) training of key mentors/supervisors. A
Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the universities of Skopje and Ljubliana
for future collaboration in these areas. Several of the training activities were complemented
with study tours to different countries to learn first-hand the pros and cons of various
approaches.

Less effective factors and events which detracted from Project’s achievements

34.     Frequent management and institutional changes. Several changes in Ministers of
Health (4 Ministers) and senior officials in MOH during Project implementation, including
deputy ministers (4) and Project Principal Coordinators (4), staff of the Policy Analysis Unit
(PAU), and HIF Directors (3), compromised continuity. Political commitment and Project
ownership were correspondingly affected and, ultimately, delayed Project implementation.
In addition, several changes in the PCU (Component 3 Assistant Coordinator, Procurement
Officer, and Financial Management Officer) necessitated training of new staff, causing
delays. Shortly after effectiveness8, the Minister, Deputy Minister of Health, and Principal
Project Coordinator changed. The contract of the international advisor hired to support the
work of the Policy Analysis Unit (PAU) in MOH was terminated because MOH felt that the
interests of the PAU and MOH were not being adequately served. Recruitment of his
replacement took several months. In addition, while a new Principal Project Coordinator was
appointed, he was also Chief of Cabinet of the Ministry, leading to frequent absences from
the ministry and unavailability for project management and oversight.

35.    One year after effectiveness, the Bank requested the appointment of a full-time
Principal Project Coordinator, but this did not materialize. As noted earlier, although
during the November 2005 mission agreement was reached with the Minister to hire under
the Project a “Chief Operating Officer”, the officer was never hired. During the last year of
implementation, when it was clear that delays with the procurement of the hardware had
reached a critical stage, MOH hired a Project Manager to provide overall coordination within
the PCU.

36.      Weak project management capacities in MOH and HIF and weak inter-
institutional collaboration caused delays. Implementation was delayed in the early years
due to weak project management capacity. Constraints in project management were
identified at an early stage, including weak coordination among financial management,
procurement, and planning of component activities. One year after Loan effectiveness,
limited progress had been made with Project implementation. To bring the Project back on

    The Loan became effective on September 15, 2004.



                                                   13
track, the Bank requested MOH to pay special attention to the performance of the project
management structure, including improving communications with and between Coordinators
and Assistant Coordinators, and establishing working groups. As a result of weak
institutional capacities, disbursements had reached only 8 percent of Loan proceeds at the
time of the MTR and the rating for overall implementation progress was downgraded to
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

37.    Change of indicators. Although agreement was reached during the MTR for
changes/refinements to the Results Framework, the Bank never received a formal request for
this change (despite numerous reminders by the Project team). Aide Memoires and
management letters up to April 2008 reminded MOH that a formal request was required.
However, with the change of TTL, the issue seemed to have been “forgotten”.

38.    MOH did not maintain the PAU until completion of the Project as stipulated in
Section 3.04 of the Loan Agreement. Despite Project investments in an international advisor
and equipment for the PAU, by January 2009 the MOH organization chart did not refer to
such a Unit. To rectify the situation, the December 2008 mission indicated that about
US$50,000 could be allocated from the Dutch Trust Fund to hire individuals for an initial
period. These positions could then be regularized with the individuals being converted to
MOH employees. Despite the availability of these funds, MOH did not reinstate the PAU.
Having a separate unit for policy analysis was no longer seen by MOH as necessary. MOH
argued that apart from entrusting analysis function of this unit to its senior staff, the NPHI
gets now more involved in supporting policy formulation (beyond the project). In the eyes of
MOH, the PAU, as a Unit, became irrelevant.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

39.     Design, implementation, and utilization of M&E are rated Moderately Satisfactory
for reasons elaborated below.

40.     Design. The PAD included 13 PDO indicators and 9 intermediate indicators. As
stated earlier, this evaluation finds that while some of the indicators selected were
appropriate for the status of reforms at the design stage, as the reform progressed some of
them became less relevant and there was a need to make changes to better reflect the new
situation. Perhaps the selected indicators were too specific for the design stage and more
generic indicators would have been more appropriate. The ICR team recognizes that it is
difficult to design appropriate indicators for a dynamic process of reform as it was the case in
the FYRM country where indicators in some cases loss relevance.

41.     Implementation. The PAU staff was to be responsible for providing overall input
and guidance on health policies and monitor the impact of health reform on the health status
of the population as well as on the financing viability of the health sector. The PAU was to
work with the PCU to evaluate the impact of project activities and monitor project
performance indicators for the duration of the Project. While the PAU played some role on
monitoring indicators during early stages of Project implementation, i.e. when the PAU was
fully staffed and had a foreign advisor, the PCU component assistant coordinators where the
ones who took the lead in this area obtaining information from various institutions as


                                            14
appropriate. Indicators were monitored regularly and reported in Aide Memoires. Tree types
of indicators were measured: (i) result indictors associated with investments/expenditures,
(ii) outcome indicators aimed at measuring the Project’s results in relation to its development
objectives, and (iii) intermediate indicators associated with Project components. Apart from
the 13 PDO indicators in the Results framework, the PCU monitored an additional indicator
related to progress with the implementation of the grants. In addition, the indicator related to
revenues and number of contributors to the HIF was reported as two different indicators,
making 15, rather than 13 PDO indicators. The NPHI was responsible for the collection of
the baseline data for the pilot health care institutions (see below). A patient satisfaction
survey was conducted in 2006 for six pilot hospitals, including the main Clinical
Center/Hospital in Skopje, the Specialized Orthopedic Hospital in Ohrid, and four general
hospitals in Bitiola, Tetovo, Kumanovo and Kichevo. The sample frame covered 15 percent
of the average number of patients per month. Some 1225 of the 1240 patients surveyed
responded. The responses reflected high level of patient satisfaction with the conditions and
quality of services in the departments and sections of the general or specialized hospitals,
which had recently undergone refurbishments or were equipped with new medical equipment.
Questions related inter alia to: (i) quality of physicians and nurses’ services, (ii) hygiene
conditions and waiting time prior to examinations, (iii) quality of admission procedures, and
(iv) ability to schedule appointments. The Specialized Orthopedic Hospital in Ohrid scored
the highest -- 92 percent acceptance.

42.     Utilization. M&E was used under the Project not only as a management tool to
evaluate the status of implementation of activities, but also to inform policy makers for
decision-making purposes to help prioritize activities to support the reform agenda. One of
the challenges supported by the Project was the introduction of well-defined key performance
indicators (KPIs) by which the HIF monitors service provision in primary, secondary, and
tertiary care. With technical assistance provided under the Project, HIF developed a
methodology for collection of the KPIs to be used for monitoring, review, and assessment of
the performance of the hospitals. Ten indicators were agreed upon and the regional institutes
of public health were put in charge of the completion of the forms and transcription of the
collected data into a software program. KPIs are an integral part of every contract made
between HIF and health institutions since 2007. Ten percent of the HIF funding of pilot
health institutions is linked to the hospital performance measured by the KPIs, thereby
playing an important role in improving performance.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

43.     The environmental impact of the Project was rated C. The loan did not finance civil
works as a category of expenditure. However, through the grant facility under Component 3,
the loan financed a number of minor rehabilitation-types of works in hospitals and other
health institutions. Prior to the selection of grants, and in accordance with the Project
Operational Manual (POM), the Bank was careful to remind the MOH that the Project could
finance only minor renovation works without triggering various environmental safeguard
policies. In terms of rehabilitation work, the grants included: (i) replacements of roofs,
windows, and doors, and toilets; (ii) painting of walls and floors; (iii) and improvements in
the sewage systems. In the cases of roofs, slope roofs were constructed on the existing flat



                                            15
roofs, covered with plasticized metal sheets to protect the facilities from leakage in the rainy
and winter periods. In one case, there was replacement of an existing roof cover made from
asbestos plates with plasticized metal plates. Accordingly to the PCU, the TOR of the
contractor ensured that the asbestos materials were disposed off in an environmental safe
manner. The Project did not finance goods requiring a Medical Waste Management Plan.

44.     Financial Management (FM) is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Performance of FM
arrangements at the PCU was mixed. During the initial implementation period and up to
mid-2006, FM arrangements, including accounting, reporting, budgeting and planning,
internal controls, and funds flow were rated Satisfactory. The rating was downgraded to
Moderately Satisfactory at the end of 2006 and downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory
(MU) by mid-2007. The MU rating reflected lack of reliability of the accounting system,
consequent inaccuracies in the quarterly financial reports, and, in some cases, lack of
application of key internal controls and procedures. By February 2008, some of the problems
had been resolved and the rating was upgraded to Satisfactory. By March 2009, FM ratings
were downgraded again to MU until February 2010 when it was again upgraded to
Satisfactory, which was maintained up to closing. The improved rating was a result of
significant improvement observed in 2009 and 2010, including a clean opinion issued by the
external auditors on the 2008 project financial statements. As noted earlier, disbursements
under the Project were slow during the first two years of implementation. Although the slow
disbursement at the time partially reflected the type of expenditures made (TA and training,
which have low monetary value), it also reflected delays in the procurement of IT hardware.

45.     As noted earlier, disbursements were only 8 percent of Loan proceeds at MTR
(November 27 – December 1, 2006), but accelerated after mid-term reaching 37 percent by
April 2008 and 45 percent by December 2008. During the last six months of the project,
disbursements accelerated with the procurement of hardware for the IHIS and at this writing,
they had reached 96% percent, expecting to reach 98 percent at the end of the grace period
(April 28, 2011). Withdrawal applications were prepared regularly, however, since the
Project follows the Treasury system, it meant that expenses had to be paid from the special
account and therefore large contracts that required more funds than available funds in the
Special Account were not sufficient to cover expenses for large contracts of IT at the end of
the Project. Agreement was reached with the Ministry of Finance to authorize the PCU to
process several withdrawal applications for direct payments for the IT hardware.

46.     Procurement is rated Moderately Satisfactory. As noted in para 34, the Procurement
Officer in the PCU was changed and the new Procurement Officer hired did not have
adequate experience with procurement under Bank-supported operations necessitating a great
deal of training through formal procurement courses and on the job training with the help of
the Bank. Procurement rating fluctuated throughout implementation between Satisfactory
and Moderately Satisfactory and at times Moderately Unsatisfactory when serious delays in
the processing of procurement packages and updating of the procurement plan happened. In
addition, at some points in implementation, there was limited coordination between
procurement and financial management planning and procurement plans included activities
well beyond the budget available under the Project. This issue was rectified and procurement
management improved during the last two and half years and the PCU was able to manage



                                            16
well complex procurement process related to hardware for the HIS of the HIF and for the
IHIS. Working together with the IHIS WG and technical assistance from a local company
with IT networking capability, the testing and acceptance of the equipment was handled
effectively and timely prior to the closing date. Procurement under the Project included: (i)
medical, office, and information technology equipment, and (ii) consulting services procured
under various types of procurement methods as per the loan agreement.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

47.     Support to the sector will continue through the ongoing DPL 1 and the proposed
Policy Based Guarantee (PBG) operation. Both of them include important health policy
reform areas. The former focuses on continuing improvements in FM and control within the
HIF through the implementation of a treasury function in the HIF to prevent over-
commitment and spending by the HIF and HCIs. This Single Treasury Account is fully
operational and has been rolled out to HCIs. This has been achieved with financing from the
second Dutch Trust Fund. The second policy area focuses on the adoption of a revised basic
benefit package (BBP) consistent with available financing resources for the health sector.
Draft options for a revised benefit package have been prepared. However, additional work is
required, including: (i) further analysis on costing of the various packages and of the
implications of the various cost-sharing rates on equity in service use and the solidarity
principle, and (ii) an assessment of the resources needed (staff and equipment) for setting up
the administrative arrangements that need to be in place at the HIF and at the facility level.
The PBG includes, inter alia, review of health insurance for the unemployed (to weed out the
self employed who register as unemployed to get health insurance), and further review of the
BBP package. In this context, actuarial analysis is being pursued to assess options for the
BBP to choose an option that is financially sustainable. The first health policy would ensure
that free health insurance is provided only to the vulnerable. The reforms would start to align
the country’s system to the EU-standards and could increase revenues in the health sector.
The second policy reform would improve the fiscal sustainability of the sector through
introduction of a treasury function within the HIF to increase efficiency in spending, and
overhaul of the BBP.

48.     In addition, an IDF grant for about US$0.5 million was approved in April 2011 to
inter alia, support the establishment of a modern accreditation system to help monitor and
evaluate the quality of care providers. The IDF will support technical assistance, possibly
through an internationally recognized twinning agency or a firm with established record in
the field of accreditation of health care institutions to establish a modern accreditation system
that could be recognized by the International Society for Quality in Health Care (ISQua).

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

49.    While the relevance of objectives and design are rated Substantial, the relevance of
implementation arrangements is rated Modest. This evaluation finds that the Project was
relevant and consistent with development priorities of both the Government (as articulated in



                                             17
a number of strategic documents, including the Government’s reform agenda) and the Bank
(the September 9, 2003 CAS) at the time the Project was approved – May 13, 2004. The
Project design addressed important Government’s priorities and took into account key
lessons learned from the implementation of the first Bank-financed operation in the health
sector in the country as well as other health reform projects in the ECA Region. At this
writing, the PDO continues to be relevant. The Project has had significant impact in
supporting implementation of health reforms in the country and was used strategically to
actively support health reform activities and build up capacity in the MOH and the HIF.
Shortcomings with implementation arrangements are discussed in Section 2.2.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives

50.      This evaluation rates achievement of PDO as Moderately Satisfactory for the
following reasons. First, although the Project achieved all 15 outcome indicators, over-
achieving seven of them, this evaluation finds that the PDO indicators did not attempt to
measure results of improved capacity building. Second, while some of the indicators
selected were appropriate for the status of reforms at the design stage, some indicators were
too specific for that situation and more generic indicators may have been more appropriate.
Third, achievement of PDOs measured through the PDO indicators cannot only be attributed
to the Project as many elements are at play, including the adjustment operations and technical
assistance provided through Dutch Trust Funds. The ICR evaluation was based on analyses
of outcome indicators and data linked to the development objectives of the Project, as well as
an evaluation of how project activities were linked to the achievement of the PDO. Table 1
illustrates how individual PDO indicators were linked to the achievement of each of the two
PDOs. Achievement of the PDO is further addressed in the subsequent paragraphs.

51.      PDO 1- Upgrade MOH and HIF capacity to formulate and effectively implement
health policies, health insurance, financial management and contracting of providers. As
noted above, although other interventions from domestic (HIF and MOH funds) and
international resources (Dutch Trust Fund) contributed to the overall objective of upgrading
MOH and HIF capacities, it is clear that the Project has been instrumental in helping develop
capacities to formulate and implement health policies and health insurance, thus contributing
to the sustainability of the health system. With the support of various interventions,
including the Project, much has been achieved in improving transparency, addressing the
internal controls, governance of the HIF, and strengthening HIF capacity in financial
management and performance monitoring of health care institutions (HCIs). It is difficult,
however, to specifically attribute to this Project, the success of these achievements as this
Project was supporting policy reforms under various adjustment operations and often the
activities under the Project complemented those supported by the Dutch Trust Fund and, at
times, also efforts by the MOF supported by the International Monetary Fund. In addition, as
the ICR for the PDPLs (2009) notes, budget planning and control, financial management and
procurement in HIF, MOH and HCIs were also improved. This said, a lot remains to be done
to ensure that the policy goals are met, including the emphasis on improving health outcomes
and setting the system on a financially sustainable path. Equally, the Project has been
instrumental in strengthening MOH’s capacity to formulate health policies through the
provision of technical assistance and training of staff. A number of strategies and legislation
were developed with support from the Project, which if implemented effectively, will further
contribute to improving the efficiency and equity of health care. These are: (i) National
Health Strategy, (ii) Public Health Law, (iii) Law on Pharmaceutical and Medical Devises (to
harmonize with EU legislation), (iv) Privatization Strategy, (v) Strategy for the IHIS, and (vi)
co-payment policy.

52.    In addition, with support from the Project, the Health Insurance Law was amended to
streamline the operations, decision-making and transparency of the Board of Directors of the



                                                       19
HIF 9 ; the Health Care Law was also amended. Reforms supported by the Project have
allowed a more efficient payment system for hospitals and PHC providers based on
diagnostic Related Groups (DRGs), payments for PHC based on capitation and performance
based payments, and introduction of the Treasury system for health insurance. The
managerial capacity of the HIF has improved, through technical assistance, training, and
improved information systems supported by the Project. In addition, efficiencies are being
realized through the competitive procurement of pharmaceuticals and changes in the payment
mechanism to providers. The improvement of the procurement of pharmaceuticals was one
of the most important achievements of the PDPL series. Savings of US$9 million were
reported from the ICB procurement that took place in 2007. After two subsequent ICB
rounds, the HIF Board instituted reference pricing10 and stronger controls over spending with
financial results improving markedly. It should be noted that intensive procurement training,
including for HIF officials was provided through the Project. The financial obligations of the
HIF to suppliers were cleared in 2007, while the obligations of the entire public health sector
fell from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2004 to 0.4 percent of GDP in 2008. This was achieved by
introducing hard budget ceilings for HCIs as well as strengthening ex-ante controls over
spending (accountants were appointed in hospitals to ensure compliance). Despite these
positive developments, HCIs again have started to accumulate arrears, which by mid-2010
reached 0.3 percent of GDP. Concerted efforts will continue to be needed to implement
further reforms outlined in the health sector strategy to continue to improve the efficiency
and equity of health spending, including further revision of the BBP to help improve access,
quality and fiscal sustainability (for example expanding the negative list of services,
restructuring co-payments and improving targeting). In addition, there is a need to adjust
cost of services, regulate cost of drugs, and provide autonomy for mangers of hospitals to
better benefit from DRGs.

53.     PDO 2 – Develop and implement an efficient scheme of restructuring of hospital
services with emphasis on developing day-care services and shifting to primary care. The
Project was effective in supporting development of key performance indicators (KPIs) for
hospitals, measuring efficiency and linking those efficiencies to the payment mechanisms as
a result of increased efficiency by: (i) reducing the average length of stay (ALOS), (ii)
reducing readmissions for the same medical condition, (iii) increasing bed occupancy rate,
and (iv) reducing the number of intra-hospital infections. Further, introduction of DRG
payments in the hospital sector created incentives for efficiencies in hospital services,
although more work is needed to adjust cost of services. The Project paid particular attention
to management training and capacity building (including the MOH, HIF, and HCIs), which
served to entrench modern approaches as part of the general management culture on the
sector, increasing the likelihood that the PDO was achieved and sustained beyond the closing

 The Members’ selection was revamped; the number of members was reduced, and stronger role of MOH and
MOF was instituted. In addition, the minutes of HIF Board meetings are published on its web-site.

   Rather than procuring drugs through ICB, under reference pricing the HIF would reimburse a fixed amount
covering the cost of a generic drug. Doctors and patients could choose which drug to use, but reimbursement is
made on the basis of generic drugs.

date. In the case of PHC, development and implementation of standard clinical guidelines,
licensing of physicians with continuous medical education, and promotion of FM have
contributed to efficiency at the PHC level. In addition, efficiency at the PHC level is being
achieved as a result of introduction of strong financial incentives, which represent 30 percent
of the salary element contracted by HIF for PHC for focusing on preventive services more
closely. These efficiencies are being further enhanced with the introduction of the IHIS,
which will help monitor accomplishments of prevention services more closely. Again, this
latter achievement should not be under-estimated as countries with more advanced family
medicine model implementation are still struggling to introduce financial incentives for
preventive services. Table 2 illustrates how all seven PDO related indicators were achieved.

Efficiency

54.     Efficiency is rated Substantial. The PAD assigned the major share of anticipated
Project benefits to improving HIF revenue collection and expenditure management, assuming
that the benefits from improved expenditure management will begin to accrue to HIF from
2007. By the closing date of the loan, strong performance can be reported in both fronts: (i)
13.2 percent increase in the amount of revenue collected by HIF, 12 percent increase in the
number of contributors over the base year (2004), (iii) reduction by 14 percent in the number
of drugs purchased in non-HIF contracted pharmacies and reimbursed by HIF, and (iv) 100%
reduction in the number of referrals to out-patient specialists and to hospitals. Ad discussed
in para 54, efficiencies are being realized through the competitive procurement of
pharmaceuticals and changes in the payment mechanism to providers. Savings of US$9
million were reported from the ICB procurement that took place in 2007. Most recently, the
HIF Board instituted reference pricing11 and stronger controls over spending with financial
results improving markedly. Overall, the economic analysis conducted at the ICR stage
(Annex 3) indicates larger benefits than those estimated at the time of appraisal (see Annex
3).

55.     Indirect benefits of the Project were not quantified. However, improvements in
ALOS have reduced the productivity losses associated with medical care. Having patients
spending less time in hospital receiving post-operative treatment that could be obtained in
outpatient care has also resulted in a direct productivity saving (see data sheet). In addition,
improving the management of HIF has improved staff performance and the efficiency of
operations, including reduced wastage and fraud through the application of appropriate
internal control established with support from the Project.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

56.     The Project’s overall outcome is considered Moderately Satisfactory based on the
Project’s achievements, its continued relevance, its contribution towards strengthening the

country’s health sector performance and making it more accountable. Major initiatives such
as the revision of the BBP, development of co-payment policies, improved licensing
procedures, more transparent HIF Board and management procedures, and better trained
managers throughout the health system should lead to more effective, high quality services
that are both affordable and accessible to the population. The clinical guidelines Cochran
database for licensing and quality improvements supported under the Project is serving as a
reference for updating clinical guidelines developed/updated under the Project and
continuous improvements in the quality of care. However, as discussed in this ICR, the
overall outcomes under the Project cannot entirely be attributed to the Project. For the future,
it will be important that MOH continues its work to establish a sector or at least a virtual
Agency for Accreditation and Quality Assurance to monitor actual adherence to the clinical
guidelines. This is to be supported by the IDF. Adherence to clinical guidelines will need to
be related to other reforms in the sector, including FM development. In addition, as noted
above, concerted efforts will continue to be needed to implement further reforms outlined in
the health sector strategy to continue to improve the efficiency and equity of health spending.
Further strengthening of the capacity of HIF, MOF and the HCIs will continue to be essential
to help limit cost pressures and reduce wasteful spending.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

57.     While the Project was not explicitly classified as a poverty-targeted intervention,
some aspects of the project had a positive impact on the poor. Some of the PDO indicators
can shed some light in this regard. For example, there was a 14 percent reduction in the
number of prescription drugs purchased in non-HIF contracted pharmacies. Further,
amendments to the Insurance Law (2008) supported by the Project allowed co-payments to
be retained at the health facility level contributing to the decline in out-of-pocket payments,
which affect the poor more disproportionally. The Project had no direct impact on gender
inequalities and imbalances and social development.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening

58.      It is difficult to attribute success in capacity building to a single project as other
intervening factors such as the Dutch Trust Funds 12 are always at play. Nonetheless,
during ICR discussions with MOH, HIF, the Family Medicine Education Center, and health
facilities, managers and staff recognized that project investments, including investments in
capacity building and technology, have resulted in substantial institutional development
impact. Significant progress was made through the Project in improving the capacity of
MOH, HIF and health care institutions staff to deal with modern management and policy

  A Dutch Trust Fund for technical assistance was implemented from 2000 until the end of 2008. It provided
support for implementation for some PDPL-related activities, including in the health sector. In 2007, the Dutch
Government approved a new Trust Fund for technical assistance, more closely related to the PDPL agenda,
which closed at the end of 2009.



                                                   22
analysis methods. The strong focus on management training and capacity building under the
Project have served to entrench modern approaches as part of the general management
culture on the health sector, thus helping to ensure that the PDO was achieved and could be
sustained beyond the closing date.

59.      Each of the components supported institutional strengthening in their respective
areas. The Policy Formulation and Implementation Component supported training on: (i)
clinical guidelines, (ii) licensing, (iii) preparation of pharmaceutical law and improvement of
pharmaceutical care, (iv) strategy development, (v) training of key mentors/supervision of
training of FM educators, (vi) FM specialization, (vii) MOH and journalists on public
relations, and (viii) BBP costing. The Strengthening HIF Governance and Management
Component financed technical assistance and training: (i) to provide training of trainers
(TOT) from MOH, HIF, and health care providers on budget reforms, (ii) through a study
visit to Germany for republic controllers for control mechanisms of HIF services and use of
DRGs, (iii) for hospital staff for coding using the DRG payment mechanism, (iv) costing
analysis and methodology, (v) rational drug use, and (vi) public procurement procedures
according to the new Procurement Law. In the case of the Improving Service Delivery
Component, the Project supported extensive training in management and leadership. Under
the Project Management Component, the Project financed training on project management,
procurement, financial management and attendance to various courses including the Flagship
Course on Health Financing.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

60.   Coordination and synergies with activities financed by the Dutch Trust Funds and
WHO have resulted in better outcomes for the sector. In addition, close cooperation among
government institutions, the Bank teams, and the IMF ensured the shaping of the design and
implementation of key reforms in the sector.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

n/a

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

61.     The risk at the time of the ICR that development outcomes (or expected outcomes)
will not be maintained is rated Moderate Although the MOH, HIF and other institutions’
ownership and commitment to sustaining gains are relatively strong at this writing, as shown
at various stages of implementation, this could change with new managers being appointed
and evolving priorities. However, as the ICR for the PDPLs indicated, probably the most
important reassurance of sustainability is the commitment across the political spectrum to the
development objectives of an improved public sector. In addition, these objectives are
strongly linked to the EU accession agenda, which is a broadly owned strategic goal of the
country. The recently approved IDF (para 48) can help in keeping the policy dialogue active,
but it will not be a substitute for a full-fledged investment project.




                                            23
5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

62.    Team leadership changed four times causing some adjustments in the way the Bank
guided implementation (see below).

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

63.     This evaluation rates the Quality at Entry as Moderately Satisfactory. As described
in Section 1.1, in the view of the ICR team: (i) the project objectives and scope were
appropriate to the stage of development of the sector in the country, (ii) the Project built on
the findings of the functional review of MOH by DfID, and experience within
implementation of health projects in the FYRM and elsewhere in the ECA Region, (iii) the
Project addressed the Government’s objective of cost-containment while promoting
improvement in quality and access, and (iv) it supported key elements of the CAS by
promoting the institutional development of the MOH and assisting the HIF in the effective
implementation of policy reforms included in the PSMAL. Nonetheless, as noted earlier, this
evaluation finds that while some of the indicators selected were appropriate for the status of
reforms at the design stage, perhaps some were too focused on the design stage and more
generic indicators would have been more appropriate given the relative small investments
under the project and what could reasonably be expected to be achieved with such limited
investment. The targets set at the time of preparation were not either easy or a foregone
conclusion. The fact that several of them were over-achieved is a testament to the
commitment of the Government to addressing these issues. In addition, in the view of this
evaluation, the PAD did not include a risk for the institutional arrangements. The notion that
the Principal Project Coordinator could devote 20 percent of his/her time to oversee project
implementation was unrealistic (see Section 2.1).

(b)    Quality of Supervision

64.     The ICR team rates the quality of supervision as Moderately Satisfactory. From the
outset it was recognized that given the limited institutional capacity of both MOH and HIF,
the Project would require close monitoring and a hands-on supervision approach to ensure
successful implementation. Supervision was intense with frequent missions, mostly in
conjunction with preparation or supervision of the adjustment operations. Thereby it ensured
consistency of the policy dialogue and the messages delivered to the GOM at the macro and
micro levels. The Task Team Leader (TTL), who was responsible for processing the Project
for approval, continued as TTL only for one year after Loan effectiveness. The second TTL
guided project implementation for nearly three years, i.e. up to June 2008. The third TTL
stayed with the Project for only about one year, and the fourth and last TTL saw the project
to the closing date, i.e. for about 16 months. The engagement of the Bank staff in the country
office was most helpful in ensuring continuity in the Bank team.

65.    For the most part teams were responsive to client needs and demonstrated flexibility
in adapting to evolving priorities within the parameters of the PDOs (Section 2.2). Equally,



                                            24
Bank teams for the most part were diligent in their communication with GOM and Bank
management, providing up-to-date information and analysis on the status and impact of
project activities, issues encountered, and options to address issues that arose as a result of
evolving needs. The Bank team was less effective in: (i) ensuring that the results framework
was formally amended as per agreements reached during the MTR; (ii) ensuring formal
changes to the institutional arrangements; (iii) ensuring that comprehensive Progress
Management Reports were prepared regularly and included an assessment of progress and
challenges for the Project as a whole (see para 71); and (iv) persuading the GOM of the
importance of proceeding promptly with the procurement of hardware and software for the
IHIS, especially in the broader context of IT development in the sector, which required close
coordination between the various IT-related activities being pursued in the health sector.
This procurement package became critical eight months prior to the closing date, resulting in
the need for a second extension to ensure effective delivery and installation of the equipment
throughout the country.

66.     During the crucial last 14 months of project implementation, the Bank team included
a Health Information Management Specialist, who played a key role to guide MOH and HIF
in the procurement of the IHIS hardware. The team provided close support for the process
during and between missions, including a detailed analysis of architectural risks and
integration of the IHIS and the HIF information systems, and in general guided the
Government team in ensuring successful procurement, testing, and delivery of equipment
throughout the country prior to loan closing. Perhaps more important was the Bank’s team
strong role in supporting the conceptualization of the overall information management in the
sector, using the Bank’s position as financier of the hardware to leverage institutional and
technical (software) development. The positive aspects and shortcomings of supervision can
be summarized as follows:

Positive Aspects:

      The overall focus on macro and micro issues, combined with close monitoring of the
       overall reform agenda, helped ensure that sector performance continued to improve.
      Missions were particularly effective in reviewing overall sector development in
       conjunction with Project specific progress. Most Aide Memoires comprised good
       analyses of overall health policy issues and recommendations, in addition to
       reviewing Project’s implementation progress.
      Financial management and procurement guidance was systematic.

Main Shortcomings:

      Team composition should have been strengthened earlier in the implementation
       process by the inclusion of a Health Information Management Specialist with
       experience in health systems to guide the conceptualization and planning processes of
       hardware and software. Early team composition appeared to have focused more in
       the procurement process per se.




                                            25
         The Bank team should have guided the PCU to ensure that the reporting of project
          implementation was carried out in a systematic manner as specified in the POM (see
          also para 71).

(c)       Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

67.    The ICR team rates the overall Bank performance as Moderately Satisfactory for
reasons described above.

5.2       Borrower Performance

(a)       Government Performance

68.     Government’s performance during project preparation and implementation was
Satisfactory. During project design, GOM engaged in detailed discussions during and in
between mission providing written comments on options to be explored and ways to finance
various aspects of the reform, including technical assistance. Prior to Project approval, the
GOM: (i) adopted the Decentralization Law, which mandated the representation of local
authorities on the boards of public PHC organization and gave local communities some
responsibility for health education, (ii) Produced the 2002 National Poverty Reduction
Strategy, and (iii) established a Steering Committee, which included the Minister of Health,
the Director of the HIF, and a representative of the Minister of Finance. During
implementation, the GOM in general and more specifically, the MOF recognized the benefits
of the Project in the implementation of the reform agenda supported by the various Bank-
financed adjustment operations.

(b)       Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

69.     Performance of the Ministry of Health was mixed. For the most part, the
commitment of MOH to the Project and the overall reform agenda supported by the Project
was high. WGs appointed by MOH worked well and their participation in planning and
decision making ensured a larger constituency of stakeholders and thereby “buy-in” for
reforms. However, as addressed in Section 2.1, several changes in Ministers of Health and
senior officials in MOH, including deputy ministers and Project Principal Coordinators, PAU
staff compromised continuity, reduced political commitment and project ownership and
ultimately delayed project implementation. As discussed in various sections of this ICR and
more specifically in Section 2.1, the project experienced institutional constraints, which
affected project implementation.

70.    The performance of the HIF was also mixed. With three changes in leadership
during Project implementation, the complexity of reforms being pursued meant that some
decisions were delayed pending adjustments at the top. Nonetheless, after a slow start, in the
view of this evaluation the HIF gained a substantial amount of implementation capacity and
much has been achieved in addressing the internal controls, financial management,
performance monitoring of HCIs, and governance of the HIF.




                                              26
71.      The PCU played an important role in coordination among all related institutions.
The PCU staff tried to build and maintain productive relationships at the different levels of
the health system. Its efforts were constrained at times by management changes in MOH and
TTLs, which necessitated adjustments to the way “of doing business” and at times changes in
priorities. After the departure of the Assistant Coordinator of Component 3, a staff of the
PCU was assigned to the position. However, she did not have the necessary experience to
guide implementation. Later, the Assistant Coordinator for Component 1 assumed
responsibility for coordination of both components, thereby increasing her workload during a
crucial time for the Project. The PCU also played an important role in M&E. While
recognizing that most of the indicators were achieved and that most activities were
completed, albeit with delays, it is clear to the ICR team that the reporting on the Project did
not do justice to the content and complexity of the work. The PCU did not prepare
systematic quarterly progress reports as required in the POM. Because the PCU did not have
a Manager, the reports that were prepared were not comprehensive for the entire project.
Instead, reports summarized progress with implementation for the individual components
since the previous mission, but did not provide an assessment of how the Project was
performing as a whole, nor did they discuss ways to accelerate Project performance. In
addition, at times, there were problems with coordination among staff in the PCU which led,
for example, to shortcomings with acceptance of works. One important example was lack of
follow up and acceptance of roof repairs in the Tetovo Hospital where the repaired roof
(financed under a project-supported grant) collapsed causing one fatality and several injuries.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

72.    The ICR team rates the overall Borrower performance as Moderately Satisfactory for
reasons elaborated above.

6.     Lessons Learned

73.    Lessons learned can be categorized into the following major headings:

Government ownership and capacity development

74. Strong Government ownership is critical, particularly with reform-oriented projects.
Reform does not only concern technical health-related changes, but relies heavily on the
political process. Government ownership and commitment were critical in the
passage/amendments of key laws such as the Public Health Law and the Health Care Law
and the adoption of the Health Sector Strategy and the Privatization Strategy.

75. Long-term engagement. Health sector reforms are complex and often take 5-10 years.
The Bank should adopt a longer-term approach in its support. Unfortunately this was not the
case in the country as the first health Bank-supported project did not focus much on reforms
and with the closing of this Loan the momentum gained will be lost.




                                            27
Coordination

76.    Understanding the roles and responsibilities of the two implementing agencies can
optimize benefits of reforms. While supporting the MOH in its role of priority setting and
policy making, Bank teams promoted strong coordination between MOH and HIF. With
membership from both institutions and joint training in various areas of the reform, WGs
helped the two institutions better understand their roles.

Implementation Guidance by the Bank

77.     Providing continuous guidance and actively engaging in the overall policy dialogue
in the sector was crucial to ensure consistency of the messages being delivered to the
Government. Bank supervision must be continuous and intensive and adequate supervision
resources must be allocated particularly in the context of a limited institutional capacity as is
the case in the FYRM.

78.    Close coordination between supervision of macro and micro issues is crucial for
better achievement of reforms. Health reforms supported by the Project and the health
aspects of the adjustment operations were supervised closely by the same health team
ensuring that the policy dialogue with the authorities was consistent and linked to the overall
macro level dialogue between the GOM and the Bank.

Other

79.      Different approach to the establishment of the Family Medicine Model. Although
the development of a delivery model at the PHC level is lagging behind other countries in the
region in terms of developing training, specialization, and academic cadre for FM reforms,
the focus in the FYRM has been in creating an enabling environment and functionalities that
are missing in other countries in the region in the FM model. This and the fact that the
country passed regulations introducing financial incentives for focusing on preventive
services in PHC have the potential to put the country on a fast track for achieving high results
in this area.

80.     Development and integration of health information systems in the heath sector is
complex. Given the different players in the system, it was essential to aim at establishing
early during project implementation a culture of better understanding the benefits of
information for policy making. As noted earlier, team composition should have been
strengthened earlier in the implementation process by the inclusion of a Health Information
Management Specialist with international experience in health systems to guide the
conceptualization and planning, and not only procurement processes.

81.     Authorities contacted by the ICR mission commented positively on the role the
Project has played in supporting the reform in the country, especially in strengthening the
analytical capacity of staff of both institutions. Both, the MOH and HIF noted that beyond
the investments supported by the Project they saw the Bank as a strong partner and wished
that another Bank-supported project could be processed to continue supporting the
development of the sector.

82.    The MOH provided comments on the draft ICR most of which were taken into
account in finalizing this ICR. One comment which was not taken into account relates to the
upgrading of the overall Outcome Rating from Moderately Satisfactory to Satisfactory. As
noted in para 56 and discussed throughout the report, the overall outcomes under the Project
cannot entirely be attributed to the Project.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The economic analysis conducted during preparation focused mainly on the direct
benefits derived from improvements in revenue collection and expenditure management of
the Health Insurance Fund (HIF). Here, this cost-benefit analysis is replicated to understand
whether the project did indeed achieve its expected benefits. As seen below, in fact, the
project exceeded its expected benefits.

2.      The objective of the Project was to upgrade capacity of MOH and HIF to formulate
and implement health policies, health insurance, financial management, and contracting of
providers; and (ii) restructure hospitals services with an emphasis on day-care services and
shifting to primary care.

3.     The economic analysis largely focused on Component 2 – Strengthening HIF
Governance and Management and Component 3 sub component 1 – Improving Service
delivery. The aim here was to improve revenue collection, HIF and expenditure management
and purchasing. Component 3 - sub component 1 focused on hospital management and PHC
and aimed to respond to challenges and incentives of new contracting arrangements with HIF.

4.      Much has been achieved during the project period in improving transparency,
addressing internal controls and governance of HIF and strengthening HIF capacity in
financial management and performance management in HCIs. However, that not all benefits
accrued can be directly attributed to the project as several other activities such as policy
based lending (PDPL) and technical assistance under the Dutch Trust Fund simultaneously
supported improved revenue collection and HIF expenditure management in the country.
Revenue collection improved by 13.2% from 14.9 billion denars in 2004 to 19.7 billion
denars in 2009. Contributions from salary increased from 9.5 million denars in 2004 to 10.7
billion denars in 2009, while a significant increase is seen in transfers from other levels of
Government to cover pensioners, unemployed, social care beneficiaries etc. from 5.9 billion
denars in 2004 to 8.5 billion denars in 2009.

5.      In terms of overall management the Project supported the amendment of the Health
Insurance Law to streamline operations, decision-making and transparency of the Board of
Directors of HIF. A new HIF Board was appointed for four years and through training HIF
management capacity was improved. Budget planning and control, financial management
and procurement in HIF and HCIs were improved. Administrative costs and personnel inputs
were decreased through an arrangement with the Post Office to issue blue coupons.
Competitive procurement of pharmaceuticals resulted in a savings of US$9 million or 378
million denars. The financial obligations of HIF to suppliers were also cleared. In terms of
improving purchasing function of HIF, the Project helped introduce global budgets and
DRGs for hospitals and capitation payments for PHC. This was done in conjunction with
other improvement in hospital efficiency. As seen, ALOS at hospitals has reduced
significantly from 11.5 days to 6.13 days and day-surgeries have increased by 32%.




                                           46
Costs and benefits of improved revenue collection:

6.      The estimated revenue, benefit and cost streams (2004-2011) from the PAD are
presented in Table 3-1A. Here, 2002 was used as the base year and revenues for future years
were projected adjusting for inflation. It was assumed that benefits from the Project would
start accruing in 2007 – increasing revenues by 5% in 2007, 7% in 2008, 9% in 2009 and
10% in 2010 and 2011. As planned during preparation, local and international technical
assistance, training and information systems were aimed to support these activities and the
total project costs were estimated to be 51,223,011 denars over the project period. Based on
these calculations, the HIF was expected to achieve a net benefit of 6.5 billion denars by
2011; as a result of project activities aimed at improving revenue collection. The net present
value of net benefits at 10% discount rate was calculated at 5.86 billion denars.

7.      A similar exercise was conducted at ICR preparation using actual revenues of HIF for
the period 2004-2009 and estimated revenues for the period 2010-2015. Estimated revenues
were based on actuarial analysis conducted in March 2011. As noted above during
preparation, the total project costs were estimated to be about 51,223,011 denars over the
project period. The actual expenditures, however, were much lower and only included 25%
of IT equipment costs as the first sub-component under Component 2 was cancelled when
revenue collection was centralized under the Public Revenue Office by Law in 2007. Thus
project expenditures attributed to revenue collection improvement activities under the Project
only amounted to $93,909.61 or 4,238,816.55 denars.

8.      Project activities under this component were to have been completed by 2007 as
originally planned, but stretched until December 2010. As it was difficult to get annual
spending on activities attributed to achieving improved revenue collection, it is assumed here
that component expenditures had the same distribution as total project expenditures over the
project period. As the loan only closed in December 2010, recurrent costs of project
spending were only estimated for the period 2011-2015 and calculated (based on project
appraisal assumptions) at 3% of IT investment expenditures attributed to improved revenue
collection while spare part costs were estimated at 5% of IT investment expenditures

attributed to improved revenue collection. As revenue collection improvement measures
were already in place by 2007 (with centralization of collection to Public Revenue Office)
here too we assume that project benefits began incurring in the form of increased revenues
starting 2007 - increasing by 5% in 2007, 7% in 2008, 9% in 2009 and 10% for each year
starting 2010. Based on these calculations, the HIF was expected to make a net benefit of 6.5
billion denars by 2011, as a result of project investments aimed at improving revenue
collection.

9.     As seen in Table 3-1B, the Net Present Value (NPV) of net benefits by 2011 at 10%
discount rate is higher than that estimated during preparation and is 7.31 billion denars.

10.      Given that project activities were only completed in 2010, here, the net benefits for
the Project are also calculated for a slightly longer period than was done during preparation
i.e., for the period 2004-2015. As shown below, total net benefit of project investments
during this period is 16.9 billion denars and far outweighs costs incurred under the Project.
The NPV of net benefits (at 10% discount) by the year 2015 is 15.21 billion denars.

Costs and benefits of improving HIF expenditure management:

11.     The estimated expenditure, benefit and cost streams for the period 2004-2011 in the
PAD are in Table 3-2A. Here 2002 was used as the base year and expenditures for future
years were projected adjusting for inflation. The total costs of improving HIF expenditure
management included the estimated costs of the second and third sub-components of
Component 2, strengthening provider capacity to respond to HIF provider payments systems
and contracting (first sub-component of Component 3), and 75% of IT costs. During
preparation, it was assumed that the project would generate savings in HIF expenditures
starting 2007 at the rates of 5% in 2007, 7% in 2008, 9% in 2009 and 10% starting 2010.

12.     A similar exercise was conducted during ICR preparation. Actual HIF expenditures
are used for the period 2004-2009 and actuarial projections of HIF expenditures were used
for the period 2010-2015. Based on actual project spending, the total expenditures on
implementation of improved expenditure management at the HIF incurred under Component
2- subcomponents 2&3 and Component 3 -Subcomponent 1 amounted to $5,114,580.40 or
213,902,568.11 denars. In addition 75% of costs of investing in IT equipment which is
attributed to this activity amounted to $281728.815 (12,716,449.65 denars). The total
expenditures on HIF expenditure management improvement under the Project was
US$5,020,670.79 or 226,619,017.77 denars. As the loan only closed in December 2010,


                                                 49
recurrent costs of project spending were only estimated for the period 2011-2015 and
calculated (based on project appraisal assumptions) at 3% of IT investment expenditures
attributed to improved expenditure management while spare part costs were estimated at 5%
of IT investment expenditures attributed to improved expenditure management at the HIF.
During ICR preparation too, it was assumed that the project generated savings in HIF
expenditures start in 2007 at the rates of 5% in 2007, 7% in 2008, 9% in 2009 and 10%
starting 2010. As shown in Table 3-2B, the totals savings by 2011 thus amounts to 7.95
billion denars at a net benefit of 7.72 billion denars and the NPV (10% discount rate) of net
benefits is 6.95 billion denars.

13.      Given that project activities were only completed in 2010, here, the net benefits for
the Project are also calculated for a slightly longer period than was done during preparation
i.e. for the period 2004-2015. As shown above, total savings as result of project investments
during this period is 16.85 billion denars and the net benefits at 16.59 billion denars and far
outweighs costs incurred under the Project. The NPV of net benefits (at 10% discount) by
the year 2015 is 14.96 billion denars.

1.       Revised Components

1.      During the course of implementation, several revisions were made to all major
Project components, and especially to the first, second and third components. In accordance
with the agreed PDOs and health reform agenda, some new activities were added, some were
shifted between components and few were cancelled as their planned objectives had been
already achieved outside the project. These revisions resulted in changes to the total budgets
(and resulting expenditures) of all four Project components/sub-components. The most
significant changes were the following:

Component 1: Policy Formulation and Implementation. This was the most ambitious,
complex and crucial component, which guided health sector policy development and health
reform implementation actions. Several new activities were added and the budget was
doubled from US$1.04 million to US$2.15 million by project completion.

2.      Sub-component 1: Support to overall Health Policy and Strategy Development.
A. Health policy related activities were expanded with reforms in the area of public health
care: revision of functions, organization and financing of the Public Health Institute and its
ten regional public health centres; and preparation of a new Public Health Law. B. IT
Strategy activities included TA for IT related schematic mapping survey implementation in
all public health care institutions, hiring of consultants and supervision of IT hardware and
system software delivery and installation in support to IHIS implementation. C. Quality
Improvement Strategy and Implementation mainly concentrated in modernizing the
licensing process for doctors, dentists and pharmacists and developing a quality strategy
chapter for the Health Strategy 2020. Evidence Based Medicine Clinical Guidelines
(EBMCG) were developed and 8 priority EBMCG were updated by the Working Group
(WG). The hiring of international TA was not needed and was cancelled. The rational drug
use and guideline development activity was cancelled because the HIF had achieved this
objective through guidelines and rules established within the contracts with PHC practices. E.
Privatization Strategy and Implementation Plan was cancelled because this objective had
been achieved with support of MOH staff and WGs. The process for privatization of
pharmacies, dentists and PHC ambulantas was completed by 2007. F. Pharmacy Strategy
support focused on the development of the new Law on Medicines and Medical Devices and
implementation of workshops for pharmaceutical care in the community.

3.     Sub-component 2: Public Relations (PR) and Communications. All activities in
this sub-component were completed to support the health reform agenda. A PR and
communication strategy was developed based on opinion poll survey results, and was later

   The Government of Macedonia submitted its contribution to the ICR on April 1, 2011. Annex 7 summarizes the full
report, which exceeds 50 pages. The full report is available in the Project Files.




                                                     55
amended on an annual basis. The budget for PR support was increased from US$185,000 to
US$774,000 to extend PRC assistance to all ongoing project activities.

4.      Sub-component 3: Improving MOH management and business process and
Modernization of the Basic Benefit Package (BBP). This sub-component was expanded
with activities related to the modernization of the BBP. The revision was approved at the
MTR on the basis of needs for redefinition of the BBP as per the PDPL. TA was engaged for
revision of the co-payment policy and BBP costing.

Component 2: Strengthening HIF Governance and Management. This component
underwent considerable restructuring as some activities envisaged were no longer necessary.
The total budget decreased from US$3.44 million to US$1.43 million.

5.      Sub-component 1: Eligibility Criteria and Revenue Collection. Planned activities for
this sub-component were cancelled because they were not relevant anymore.

6.      Sub-component 2: HIF Management. The funds for IT related activities, except for
making the HIF system operational (US$0.5 million), were transferred to Component 3.
Activities supporting development and application of the DRG system, as a new reporting
and payment mechanism for HIF and public hospitals, were initially developed under
Component 3, and subsequently transferred to Component 2.

Component 3: Improving Service Delivery. Component 3 was also restructured and the
budget increased from US$4.77 million to US$5.13 million.

7.      Sub-component 1: Hospital management and PHC. The major change in this
component related to increased funds for provision of IT related procurement. Funds were
transferred from Component 2 in support of the establishment of the Integrated Health
Management System (IHIS). However, it was decided that the loan will finance only IT
hardware (computers, printers and servers), networking equipment, office software and
additional storage system for HIF, and communication equipment (US$ 2.65 million), while
the IHIS software development would be financed by MOH. However, the Bank insisted
that evidence of the development of the software application was demonstrated prior to
supporting any expenditure on hardware and standard software.

8.       Sub-component 2: Grant Facility for Improving Service Quality and Efficiency.
Due to the restructuring of activities and the prioritizing of IT related support, the Grant
Facility Funds were decreased from US$2.36 million to US$1.45 million, decreasing the
amount planned for competitive grants. This was also partly due to the inability of the
institutions to absorb the funds available in a satisfactory manner.

Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation.

9.      Total budget in Component 4 was increased from US$0.84 million to US$1.25
essentially to increase incremental operating costs, which were underestimated at appraisal.
In addition, the loan extension by 18 months increased PCU costs. Restructuring in this


                                          56
component also included the hiring of a Project Manager 6 months before completion, based
on the recommendation by the WB TTL, which was not very effective from the point of view
of implementation, since all project activities were in the final phase of implementation.

10.     MOH and HIF were the two implementing agencies, while the Minister of Health had
ultimate responsibility. The Principle Coordinator (PC) was a high ranking MOH official,
usually the Deputy Minister of Health, who dedicated part of his time to coordinate activities.
Similar to the previous project, during implementation MOH and HIF suffered from frequent
changes of leadership (4 Ministers, 4 Deputy Ministers/PCs and 3 HIF Directors in 6.5 years).
Project management arrangements built on lessons learned from the previous project, which
resulted in MOH’s weak capacity, especially for policy formulation, due to the high degree
of autonomy of the PIU. The Project aimed at increasing the in-house MOH and HIF
capacity. Thus, it envisaged more integrated implementation arrangements, where technical
specialists (MOH and HIF staff) were appointed as Coordinators (two from MOH) and (four
from HIF) to be a formal part of the project management structure. It was foreseen that
MOH and HIF coordinators would take proactive roles assisted by the Component
Coordinators (initially called Assistant Coordinators) - hired competitively as consultants in
2004 during the final stage of preparation. A covenant was included in the Loan Agreement
to the effect that these individuals were to become MoH and HIF regular staff by the end of
the project. 15 This covenant, however was not fulfilled due to a hiring freeze in government.
The PCU structure included also a procurement officer, financial officer, logistic support,
administrative assistant, and a project manager agreed during the last 6 months of project
implementation. Two of the initial assistant coordinators remained throughout
implementation. The assistant coordinator for Component 3 changed three times during
implementation, contributing to the inconsistent performance of this Component. The
fiduciary staff also changed three times during implementation, imposing difficulties.

11.      The main coordinating role was undertaken by the “Assistant Coordinators” who
became de facto Component Coordinators, managing and coordinating all component
activities. Their responsibility included coordination inputs from MOH and HIF staff
involved in implementation of individual activities, playing more the role of “activity
coordinators” or focal persons for specific activities. These “activity coordinators” were
often changed during implementation and while HIF coordinators were generally active, only
the pharmaceutical coordinator from MOH was active in the first years of implementation.
Several “activity coordinators” left due to their regular workload, management inexperience
and lack of additional financial remuneration for the additional efforts required.

12.     A particular challenge faced was the frequent change of project leadership, which
accompanied each change of Minister and therefore the dedicated component one and
component two coordinators played critical roles in the project, ensuring implementation
sustainability and integration of ongoing activities within implementing agencies reform
agendas. In 2008, responsibility for the major part of Component 3 were shared between the


15
   Note from Bank ICR team: This was not a covenant in the Loan Agreement. The issue of incorporation of PCU
staff into the MOF and HIF was mentioned in the Project Operational Manual only.




                                                    57
first and second component coordinators, while in June 2010, the responsibility were totally
transferred to Component 1 Coordinator. The Coordinators worked closely with heads of
MOH sectors and the HIF or other staff appointed by the MoH/HIF to ensure smooth
implementation and strengthening of capacity within the implementing institutions. From the
perspective of project design, its successful implementation depended highly on the PCU
institutional memory, management skills and dedication, especially having in mind that
frequent project leadership changes were accompanied with changes of WB TTLs.

13.      The project was implemented under the guidance of a project Steering Committee
(SC) comprising: the Minister of Health, HIF Director and official of the Ministry of
Finance, while the Principal Coordinator reported on project progress activities. Due to
changes in project leadership, SC composition changed four times as well. Several WGs
were established to support implementation of key project activities; they played a crucial
facilitating role. Their work was organized and coordinated by the component coordinators
under the overall supervision and guidance from the PC. WGs were staff from MOH, HIF,
PHI, regional PH centres, hospitals, and representatives from all key health stakeholders
(Medical Chambers and professional medical associations).

14.      Although a Policy Analysis Unit (PAU) was established as a condition for loan
effectiveness, it never became fully functional and integrated in the MOH structure.
Component Coordinators were mainly responsible for project monitoring and evaluation
activities. At the beginning due to the Government hiring freeze, PAU staff were appointed
by the Minister from existing MOH, PCU and IPH staff to whom additional responsibilities
were assigned. Due to the changes in leadership, the PAU composition changed several
times. However, individual PAU staff due to their positions, skills and experience
contributed to the successful implementation through their participation in WGs, but not as a
separate functioning PAU. Information on all project activities was transparently shared to
all critical staff in MOH and HIF, with the aim of involving them in all critical analyses,
discussions and review of consultants’ reports. In addition, training and knowledge sharing
was arranged, thus ensuring sustainability of project results.


2.     Project Design, Implementation and Impact

15.      The design underwent several major changes during the planning phase beginning
initially from a stand-alone operation which was subsequently merged with the Social
Protection Implementation Project aiming to benefit from synergies across joint issues in
both sectors. However, a decision was made at the Project Concept Review Meeting to split
the project into separate Health and Social Protection projects and to increase the overall loan
size for each project considering major Government health sector objectives supported by the
PSMAL/PSALs. This decision avoided the potential risks associated with a combined
operation by providing more effective and tangible support to the health reform agenda.

16.     Although, the Project itself was complex, it was consistent with the Government’s
reform priorities. As a result, the project was very demanding and challenging, with many
objectives to be met. It should also be mentioned that at the start, crucial activities were



                                            58
dependent on prior development and acceptance of important strategy documents (long-term
Health strategy 2020, medium-term IT strategy, FM strategy etc.) that required dedicated and
insightful management and coordination of project activities. This was the main reason for
loan extension from June 30 2009 until December 31 2010.

17.     The development and intermediate objectives of the project were consistent with
ongoing health reforms. All objectives were in full compliance with the Government’s
health programme. Being an integral part of the reforms and financing the implementation of
health reforms, the Project played a central role in the health reform process. The design
was flexible to provide support to many priority activities that arose after the adoption and
endorsement of the Health Strategy 2020.

18.      The Project was also consistent with the three key development challenges and
opportunities for the health sector and the objectives of the 2003 CAS, which focused on:
institutional development and assisting HIF in effectively implementing policy reforms
included under PSMAL, improving capacity of health providers to operate effectively in the
reformed health care environment, provide quality health care, and strengthen capacity of the
MOH in policy making, regulation and monitoring and evaluation.

3.      Main Results achieved for Project Development Objective i.e., key performance

19.    The Project met its development objectives as demonstrated by achieving its PDO
indictors and Intermediate Indicators and in some cases over-achievement of KPIs and
Intermediate Outcome Indicators.

Objective 1 - Upgrade MOH and HIF capacity to formulate and effectively implement
health policies, health insurance, financial management and contracting of providers

20.    The Project contributed to the successful upgrading of MOH and HIF capacity to
formulate and effectively implement health policies, health insurance, financial management
and contracting of providers through a combined set of activities and achievements within all
three project components. A comprehensive set of strategies and laws were developed,
adopted and enforced, which are supporting the implementation of health policies.

-    Long-term health strategy 2020 and Action Plan were developed and adopted by the
     Government in 2006 and amended in February 2007. The Strategy is guiding health
     reform activities. The Health Care Law and HIL were amended several times to support
     health reform changes;
-    The Health Information Strategy and implementation plan were developed, as a
     precondition for further investments in making the HIF Information and Management
     system operational.       These documents enabled follow up activities supporting
     establishment of the IHIS and electronic patient card introduction;
-    Strategy for Family Medicine (FM) Implementation and Action Plan were developed and
     adopted, boosting the start of FM specialization in October 2009 and re-education of
     general practitioners as Family Doctors in December 2010;



                                           59
-   Privatization of PHC services, dentists and pharmacies was completed in 2007. All
    practices sign annual contracts with HIF; capitation based payment is applied for all
    doctors in PHC working as “doctors of choice”;
-   Policy documents for organization, operations and financing of public health services
    were prepared. The transformation of the Republic Institute and the National Public
    Health Institute and centres for public health took place and a new Public Health Law
    was developed and adopted in 2009;
-   The new Law for Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices was developed and enacted
    envisaging the establishment of the Drug Agency. HIF developed a reference pricing
    system for drugs used in PHC for insured persons. Standard prices were established for
    drugs from the essential list; duration of drug registration process was decreased;
-   All public health hospitals prepare business plans and sign annual contracts with HIF;
-   Debts in the health sector decreased and Financial Directors were appointed in public
    health institutions (PHI); improvements in procurement and financial management
    processes has been attained;
-   Training and guidance on how to improve financial management within public health
    institutions was provided through the project;
-   The Project supported numerous trainings of HIF staff through which skills, processes
    and systems required for effective management of HIF were developed (particularly in
    the fields of contracting, control and financial management);
-   DRGs have been introduced in all hospitals. The generation of viable DRG utilization
    data allows for effective comparisons between hospitals and modelling of acute health
    care budgets;
-   Basic Benefit Package (BBP) costing study was carried out to provide information on
    expenditures, included in the BBP. The findings were used in the preparation of
    recommendations for the revision of the BBP;
-   A Leadership and Health Management Course was developed and delivered for about
    700 participants. An exam for directors was introduced as a pre-requisite for
    appointment as director of all PHIs.

Objective 2 – Develop and implement an efficient scheme of restructuring of hospital
services with emphasis on developing day-care services and shifting to primary care

21.    There has been considerable progress with regard to implementing an efficient
scheme of restructuring of hospital services with an emphasis on developing day-care
services and shifting to primary care.

-   Emphasis was given to restructuring of hospitals and improving efficiency, quality and
    patient satisfaction. Fourteen hospitals benefited from grants to improve energy
    efficiency, patient satisfaction, safety, and quality of care. Grants financed repairs of
    roofs, refurbishing of heating systems, toilets, and replacement of windows and doors.
-   Competitive Grants supported provision of equipment to improve hospital services and
    decrease waiting lists. An X-ray unit for Erasmo Hospital in Ohrid; 10 dialysis chairs for
    the Nephrology Clinic in Skopje and its remote unit in 'Policlinic Chair'. Medical and


                                            60
    office equipment was provided to 17 rural ambulantas. The FM Educational Centre was
    reconstructed and teaching/office equipment provided. The MOH IT Central Data Centre
    was refurbished and a generator and air conditioning system installed.
-   Technical support was provided to the new Skopje City Hospital management to increase
    managerial and organizational development skills and to establish a functional
    organizational structure with emphasize on day-care services, networking, and better
    coordination with PHC units.
-   A Hospital Development Management Course was provided to hospital managers.
    Restructuring of hospital services was supported and better coordination with PHC in line
    with ongoing activities to introduce FM in the country.
-   By mid-March 2011, the relicensing of the majority of doctors had taken place. The
    Doctors Chamber has taken over PHC services were privatized in 2007 and activities to
    improve PHC quality were undertaken; HIF signs annual contracts with PHC units. All
    doctors are paid based on capitation.
-   HIF contracts with PHC doctors are promoting health prevention activities aimed to
    decrease some diseases or conditions among different age groups. Set Indicators need to
    be achieved to finance 30% of income on the basis of capitation fee for enrolled patients.
-   CME and relicensing of doctors was introduced after 7 years as a pre-requisite to get a
    relicensing responsibilities from MOH.
-   Further strengthening of PHC has been achieved through the introduction of FM
    specialists. FM specialization was initiated in October 2009 and the first group of PHC
    (chosen doctors) for FM retraining activities was selected in December 2010.
-   Based on DRG implementation, urgent hospital services have been restructured,
    emphasis is given to day-care service development and reduction of ALOS.

Outputs achieved by HSMP components/sub-components

COMPONENT 1: POLICY FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION

22.      This component successfully assisted MOH in the implementation of policy and
strategy formulation for the health sector, strengthen the regulatory framework, link budget
formulation to policy processes and carryout PR activities for different target groups. Project
activities contributed to the strengthening of MOH priority setting abilities, policy making,
monitoring and evaluation functions, thus fulfilling the recommendations of the MOH
Functional Analysis carried out by DFID prior to Project initiation.

23.    Sub-component 1: Support to overall Health Policy and Strategy Development.
This sub-component assisted MOH in preparing crucial national health policy papers, priority
laws and by-laws, increasing quality of health care, setting the ground for FM introduction,
and improving transparency in the pharmaceutical sector. All policy and law-related
development were supported through a series of workshops and consultations with all
relevant stakeholders.

24.   Development and adoption of Long term Health Strategy 2020 and its
Implementation Plan. Broad health sector situation analysis and consultation process were


                                            61
carried out with all key stakeholders in close collaboration with the health strategy WG and
WHO. Activities resulted in the development of the first formally accepted long-term health
strategy adopted in May 2006, initially covering 2006-2015 and amended in February 2007
to extend to 2020. The Strategy was adopted as the trigger mechanism (White Book) for all
major reforms in the sector. The strategy implementation plan was accomplished and
accepted by the Bank on July 20, 2005, also stipulated as a PDPL conditionality in 2005.

25.     Restructuring of Function, Organization and Financing of Public Health
institutions. Public health services were assessed and a policy paper for restructuring of the
function, organization and financing of public health services was developed. Workshops and
consultations took place with PH service managers and MOH. Government accepted the
proposed policy paper in 2008 and the Republic Institute for Health Protection was renamed
as the Public Health Institute, while 10 regional institutes became public health centres. The
basis was laid out for the preparation of a new Public Health Law, as a basic regulatory
framework to provide the legal basis for the new function and financing mechanisms for the
national Public Health Institute and its 10 regional public health centres.

26.     Development and Enforcement of a new Public Health Law. The Project
supported development of the new Public Health Law. Thorough analysis was performed of
the health systems and laws from EU countries and neighbouring countries. A broad
consultative process with all concerned institutions and other Ministries dealing with Public
Health took place. This process was also coordinated with MOF and HIF on issues related to
payment for public health services and with the Ministry of Local Self-Government to
increase its involvement on a regional and municipality level. A study visit for key MOH, PH,
WG to the Netherlands and Belgium was organized. The knowledge acquired was helpful in
finalizing the new Public Health Law, which was adopted in February 2010.

27.     Health Information Strategy. A Strategy for the development of the Integrated
Health Information System (IHIS) was prepared. The strategy emphasized the processes
and infrastructure that should be established to support future health information
developments, skills and capacity of health staff and the culture of the environment in which
they operate. The finalization and acceptance of the ICT Strategy was a precondition for
further project and Government investments for HIF’s Information and Management System
and for the implementation of IHIS.

28.     Technical IT Assistance, Schematic Mapping of Public Health Institutions and
Supervision of activities. A schematic mapping was carried out in all PHIs to assess
conditions, needs, prepare detailed schematic maps and plan necessary improvements to be
implemented prior to the finalization of technical specifications. Two IT consultants were
hired to provide support for IT activities, including development of specifications and
evaluation of bids. One of the IT experts, who remained to the end of the Project helped
coordinate the process of receipt, acceptance testing and installation of IT equipment. A
local company provided logistic support in updating schematic mapping data and supervision
of quality, acceptance testing of IT hardware, networking equipment, office software and
storage system for the IHIS.




                                           62
29.     Modernization of Educational part of licensing system for doctors, dentists and
pharmacists. A training curriculum, aiming to modernize the continuing educational part of
the licensing processes for doctors, dentists and pharmacists was developed. 120 mentors,
educators, and examiners were trained through a TOT methodology. This activity brought
three medical professions together and increased the quality of the management of the
licensing process. It was implemented jointly with the three medical faculties, professional
medical chambers, and professional associations. The three medical chambers received
support to upgrade their IT and teaching equipment in support of their new licensing
functions, which were transferred from MOH to the Chambers. The project also supported
equipping of a common computer educational and examination centre for the three medical
chambers. A two-year license access to Micromedex electronic database was provided to the
pharmaceutical chamber to increase quality of exams to obtain a pharmacist license.

30.     Development and implementation of Evidence Based Medicine Clinical
guidelines (EBMCG). MOH established a WG to develop Clinical Guidelines in 32 medical
areas, using the Cochrane database for evidence based medicine. 5000 CDs with clinical
guidelines were distributed to all doctors nationwide. Based on health priorities and data on
highest expenditures, and most common diseases, a manual was developed by the WG
updating nine priority EBCG. 3000 manuals were distributed to all doctors in PHC and
concerned specialists, libraries of all Health Homes, General Hospitals, and University
Clinics. Adoption of EBM clinical guidelines became a requirement for all doctors.

31.     Privatization of pharmacies and dentists offices, equalization of quality of care,
and introduction of capitation based financing for curative PHC services nationwide.
Based on the positive experience and evaluation of findings from the privatization process, in
September 2005, the Government adopted amendments to the Health Care Law, creating
possibilities for privatization of the remaining Public Dentist’s Practices and all public PHC
practices, except child health preventive services and emergency care. The privatization
process was finalized in January 2007 and capitation based payment introduced for all PHC
practices. In total 21 public pharmacies were sold, approximately 60 pharmacies were given
under concession and privatized, around 564 dentists’ practices, and 899 PHC practices were
privatized through concession and rented by the management of the Health Homes to the
PHC doctors that became private sector employees. Based on the performed privatization
process, around 876 pharmacists, 1,492 dentists, and 1,956 PHC doctors became private
sector employees.

32.     Family Medicine implementation and initiation of FM Specialization/retraining
activities for PHC doctors. The Project provided substantial support for the introduction of
FM. With technical support from the Slovenian Medical Faculty, chair of FM, the WG (in
collaboration with the Medical Faculty of Skopje, Doctors’ Chambers and Medical
Association) developed a Strategy and Action Plan for FM implementation. This was
adopted by the Government. The curriculum for 3-years specialization in FM was revised
and special curricula with different duration for practising PHC doctors were developed. On
May 25, 2009, the Ministry of Health signed a MOU with the Medical Faculty in Skopje for
the implementation of FM. The FM specialization started in October 2009, while the
retraining for the first two groups of PHC doctors started in February 2011. A new FM



                                           63
Educational Centre was renovated and fully equipped with office equipment, educational
models, teaching and computer equipment using competitive Grant Funds. Component 1
also supported first year specialization for the first 10 FM trainees. In September 2009 a
Study Tour to UK Imperial College and Nijmegen University in the Netherlands took place
and collaboration was established with these universities, acquiring better knowledge on the
educational processes and competencies of FM specialists. An MOU was signed between
Slovenian and Skopje Medical Universities. The new By-Law related to the new FM
specialization and retraining of PHC doctors was enforced In September 2009. The Project
supported establishment, selection and training of FM Educational Board members and the
first group of 16 key mentors/educators. They trained 90 educators/mentors. Bilateral
cooperation with Turkey was initiated to assist with the implementation of FM.

33.     Development and Adoption of the new Law on Medicines and Medical Devices.
In support to the reforms in the pharmaceutical sector, it was essential to develop a new Law
on Medicines and Medical Devices to harmonize with EU requirements. The Project
supported TA and the WG and the new Law was developed and adopted by the Government,
coming into effect in November 2008. The Law reflects changes to the functions of the Drug
Bureau and its transformation into the Drug Agency, generic prescriptions, structure of
employees in the pharmaceutical sector, provision of medicines, introduction of a drug
pricing system, and the drug registration process.

34.     Strengthening Pharmaceutical Care in the communities. Thirteen intensive three-
day training courses were carried out nationwide and about 550 community pharmacists were
trained on the establishment of good pharmacy practices. Due to major changes in the
pharmaceutical sector and the adoption of the new Law on Medicines and Medical Devices,
emphasis was placed on describing new roles, skills and attitudes of pharmacist within multi-
disciplinary health care teams, and closer relationships with PHC doctors. With this training
the community pharmacists acquired knowledge and understanding on how to provide more
patient oriented service beyond the scope of the traditional pharmacy practice.

35.     Printing and distribution of national Drug Formulary manual for doctors and
pharmacists. The Drug Bureau in cooperation with the Pharmaceutical Chamber and the
Faculty of Pharmacy developed the National Drug Formulary. This describes medicines and
their use in the treatment of diseases. The Structure of the Formulary includes standard
clinical disciplines and pathological conditions with up-to-date medicines available for
treatment. 5,000 copies of the Formulary were printed and distributed through the Medical
Chambers to stakeholders in the pharmaceutical sector and to all practicing physicians in
PHC, dentist’s practices, and pharmacies.

36.    Sub-component 2: Public Relations and Communications. This sub-component
provided effective PRC support to health reform implementation.

37.    Opinion poll implementation and development of PRC strategy and
Implementation Plan, PR support to MOH and strengthening of the PR department.
The Project supported preparation and implementation of opinion polls and the preparation of
a comprehensive PR and Communications Strategy. The PR firm, in close cooperation with


                                           64
the PCU, developed training materials and trained a WG and key MOH staff. In addition to
these activities, the Project supported PR advisory support to MOH to provide guidance for
the strengthening of its PRC department. The Project also supported additional training by
the London School of Public Relations for seven MOF, PCU and IPH. MOH’s PR
Department was also fully equipped with necessary office and computer equipment.

38.      Revision of PRC strategies and continuous PR support to MOH for health
reform implementation. The PRC strategy was revised and updated on an annual basis. An
improved relationship was established with the media and regular meetings were held.
Health reform information and other MOH activities were communicated in a timely and
more transparent manner. MOH and the PCU developed web sites and all relevant
information published and made available to the public. MOH received PR support and
guidance for all public appearances, and all public events were better prepared. The PR firm
provided regular analysis of published and broadcast media and provided PR support for
critical health reform activities. All materials that were published and the public appearances
were connected with the motto and the logo of the PR campaign (“Essential changes in the
health sector.....for healthy life”). A training manual was produced to provide guidance for
the management of PR activities within MOH.

39.    Cooperation with journalists. The Project supported regular and effective
cooperation with journalists active in the health sector. A study tour for 25 journalists,
including responsible staff for PR activities in MOH and PCU PR staff was organized in the
Netherlands; this proved to be effective. Objectives of ongoing health reform that were not
understood in the past were presented more fairly in the media. The PCU held regular
meetings with the media and provided periodical updates on health reform activities.

40.    Sub-component 3: Improving MOH management and business process. This sub-
component supported building of MOH staff capacity through training events, including the
WB flagship courses in Budapest. It also supported training to strengthen human resources
in the sector at Harvard University. MOH staff also benefited from training workshops
conducted by consultants to support reforms in the sector.

41.     BBP Costing Survey. The project supported activities related to the development of
a BBP costing survey methodology and survey implementation. The report provided data on
the real costs of BBP services, based on the analyses and calculation of costs of health
services in primary, secondary and tertiary care. It also provided recommendations that
formed the basis for inclusion of vulnerable groups that were not previously included in the
health insurance system.

42.      BBP and Co-payment policy revision recommendations. The Project supported
TA for MOH and HIF to analyse the current situation, costing, health needs and existing
health programs content. The consultants provided recommendations and guidance towards
the most effective approach for BBP revision and co-payment policy redefinition. These
activities formed the basis for preparation of several policy papers. This activity also
supported the fulfilment of one of the PDPL conditions related to the inclusion of curative
part of MOH health programs in the BBP. Activities in this area are continuing and several



                                            65
models have been proposed to MOH by the WG, based on additional support provided to
these activities by the DTF. This has been followed with support from WHO for actuary
analysis of BBP services.

COMPONENT 2: STRENGTHENING HIF GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT

43.      Sub-component 1: Eligibility Criteria and Revenue Collection. Support to
activities was cancelled because it was not considered relevant anymore. This activity was
realized through the Tax Payment Office, which became a centralized institution for revenue
collection, according to the Law in 2007.

44.   Sub-component 2: HIF Management - Improving HIF Information and
Management System. Purchasing of IT equipment (hardware and off-the shelf software) for
HIF was successfully realized to enable integration of the Central HIF Head Office with 32
Branch Offices. This activity was a step forward for supporting HIF Information
Management System and developing the IHIS by establishing a system with clearly defined
exchange of data through defined and well documented data interfaces.

45.     Budget reforms introduction. Numerous workshops for TOT for budget and
financial control were conducted for staff responsible for financial issues from HCI and HIF
branch offices. TA was engaged for training HIF and MOH staff to prepare them as trainers
on budget reforms to facilitate the budgeting reform process. Participation and presentation
of the budgeting process from its own aspect by professional teams from different institutions
(MOH, HIF, MOF, Clinical Center Skopje, SAO) institution were considered as a
precondition for successful implementation of budget reform process. In coordination with
the reform initiatives in the Health Strategy, discussions were organized to synchronize
implementation of financial and budget reforms in the sector.

46.    Improving performance of HIF Management Board. Training was provided for
Board members. A Manual:”Management Board of HIF” was prepared. The manual
incorporates, inter alia, rights, obligations, and accountability of the HIF Board. The manual
can be used by the all Hospitals Management Boards as a basic template.

47.     Strengthening control by upgrading the knowledge of Republic Inspectors
/Controllers (RC). A study visit to Germany for 12 RC was organized. RC gained practical
experience on mechanisms of control of health care services, including the way of financing
hospitals through DRGs. Staff became well trained to monitor and examine legal regulations
in the field of health insurance, as well as other laws and by-laws. They gained practical
experience in control and calculation and contribution payment for compulsory health
insurance; control of PHC; control of HCIs for specialist-consultative and hospital health
care; and control of the work of HIF branch offices.

48.     Control of transactions between HIF and HCIs. TA was engaged to deliver
training to Ex-ante Financial Controllers. Training of 40 Ex-ante Financial Controllers (from
the HIF Head Office and 32 HIF Branch Offices) was successful. It provided participants




                                           66
with knowledge on all aspects of control of transactions, including new payment models for
PHC and hospitals services, and introduction of contracting mechanisms.

49.     Sub-component 3: Purchasing Functions - Developing methodology for drug
reference pricing. A methodology for drug reference prices and a Rulebook defining the
reference drug prices were developed. This activity was a good background for completing
additional activities supported by the Dutch Trust Fund, such as: TA for advising on
establishment of Drug Regulatory Authority in the country and legal aspects of the regulation
on pricing policy of pharmaceuticals; TA on pricing and reimbursement policy of
pharmaceuticals; and TA for regulation on pricing policy of pharmaceuticals. Nowadays
reference drug prices are commonly implemented in the country. Rational drug use was put
into effect. 20 persons (HIF & Drug Bureau personnel) were trained by The National Drug
Information Center of the Faculty of Pharmacy in Skopje.

50.     Introduction of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Introduction of well defined
KPIs by which HIF should monitor service provision in primary, secondary and tertiary care
was realized. A consultant had been engaged to work with the RIPH to collate and analyze
data for this purpose. The KPI is an integral part of every contract signed between HIF and
HCIs. The evaluation of certain HCI specialist-consultative health care performance is
monitored by the following KPIs: the ratio between the first and repeated ambulatory
checking, the satisfaction of insured, and the number of referrals to other HCI. Each of these
indicators count for 5% of the overall budget. The evaluation of hospital care performance
is monitored by the number of inpatients, ALOS, the number of day hospital patients treated,
number of readmissions or surgeries (reoperations) repeated for the same diagnoses during
one month period after dismissal, and the number of intra-hospital infections. Each of these
indicators carries 2% of the overall HCI budget. The fact that HIF funding is partly
dependent on meeting performance indicator requirements is a motivating factor for HCIs.

51.     DRG implementation. The Project supported the Prime Minister’s and the highest
levels of Government priority for DRG implementation. In parallel, there is an ongoing
process for determining packages of health care services for outpatients and payments based
on performance. The project supported TA and bought the License to the Australian AR-
DRG system. The license provided the Government with the right to adjust the system to the
needs of the country. The application of DRG techniques has provided valuable data being
used in decision making to improve equity in the allocation of healthcare resources; health
policy and planning decision making at a national level; and the quality of care and health
outcomes. All hospitals are reliably reporting DRG utilisation data. This allows good basis
for the transformation of the financing system of hospitals from one that was based on
historical allocations to a prospective payment system based on outputs as measured by
DRGs. The relevant institutions included in DRG implementation are continuously working
on improving accuracy, discipline, and integrity of coding, grouping and costing.

52.    To learn from experiences of other European Countries in implementing DRG, the
PCU organized a few study visits to European Countries for MOH and HIF staff. The
trained staff are actively involved in DRG implementation in their role of HIF DRG
Controllers, or the HIF Contracting Department staff. Over 350 hospital staff have



                                           67
undergone training for coding, sessions of top-up coder training including the review of
coding problems identified during the Project.

53.     In parallel, a number of workshops have been realized for hospital finance staff to
familiarise staff with costing analyses and methodologies. Additional training, included on-
the-job training covering the key aspects of DRG implementation, including payment
formula, provider contracting, quality assessment and change management.

54.      HSMP supported activities provided: a better understanding about the objective and
features of DRGs and the key activities that comprise the implementation process; DRG
utilization data that allows effective comparisons between hospitals and the modelling of
acute care budgets; the opportunity for the 2010 HIF hospital budgets utilizing validated
DRG data; and development of skills that permit the sustainability of the DRG system.
However, it is understood that DRG implementation is an ongoing process needing
continuous improvements and coordination among all relevant institutions.

COMPONENT 3: IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY

55.     This component assisted health providers to improve the efficiency and quality of
services by upgrading their managerial and operational capacities and increasing
competencies and financial accountability of hospital management staff by provision of well
tailored management training. The component also managed and organized a series of
Continuous Medical Education courses for PHC practitioners funded with budget funds,
based on the curricula developed within the first WB-assisted Project. The second sub-
component provided Grants to improve selected medical facilities.

56.     Sub-component 1: Hospital management and primary care. This subcomponent
provided technical and financial support to two major health reform activities in the Health
Strategy 2020 and ICT Strategy (hospital management strengthening and support to IHIS
implementation) and disbursed more than a third of the total Loan funds (US$3.68 million).
Support to PHC was focused on the continuation of CME courses for PHC doctors using
curricula developed under the first project, development of training materials and
implementation of CME courses for dentists working in PHC practices financed with budget
funds (US$0.29 million). CME materials were upgraded and specially-designed curricula for
transformation of PHC practitioners into FM specialists. General CME courses were
replaced with re-training of PHC doctors to become family doctors. At the end of the re-
training and passing of specialist exams, PHC doctors become FM specialists, harmonized
with status of PHC professionals in EU countries.

57.     Health Management and Leadership Strengthening. A Health Management and
Leadership training course was developed (three-months duration) and over 500 participants
were trained. A special exam for directors of public health institutions was developed based
on the training course content, and in 2007 Government adopted and enforced a policy that
all Directors in the health sector have to pass the Director’s exam. This Course continues to
be implemented by the Medical Faculty teaching staff in coordination with MOH.




                                           68
58.     Hospital Management Development and Organizational and Managerial
development support to the New City Hospital “8th September” in Skopje. Based on the
needs, a well-tailored eight day Hospital Management Development Training Course was
developed containing four Modules on eight relevant topics. The course material was
developed jointly by TA, MOH, PCU, HIF and Public Health School professors. The
material was tested and training provided to about 30 staff of 8 general hospitals, selected on
the basis of their weak financial management results from the HIF and MOH findings. The
course will be used to train management teams from other hospitals. In addition, the experts
developed a simple instrument for monitoring of financial expenditures in hospitals and
demonstrated its content and use to the financial managers or heads of financial departments
from all hospitals and university clinics in the country.
59.     This activity provided also support to the new Skopje city hospital when the majority
of the staff in the former Military Hospital under Ministry of Defence were transferred to
MOH. The new management received constructive guidance and support to increase their
managerial and organizational skills. In addition to the hospital management development
training, they received training and guidance for implementation of a new model of
organizational structure as a pilot model for other hospitals. This was a crucial part of the
overall hospital reform agenda, as the capital city of Skopje (that has almost a third of the
national population) received its first general hospital. With the gradual increase of hospital
care for the population of Skopje in this hospital (secondary level), the tertiary level
(university clinics) will focus on a higher level of care and will be able to promote their
teaching and scientific work and accomplishments.

60.    Business plans Development. Through this activity, general hospital management
staff were trained and guided on business plan development. Based on the subsequent
proposed business plans, 14 hospitals were selected to benefit from the Grant Facility
demonstration phase fund as listed below.

61.     IHIS implementation. This sub-component provided support and the biggest single
financial input (US$2.65 million) to a single activity. Funds were used for the procurement
of IT hardware (1,650 computers, printers, servers, networking equipment and office and
antivirus off-shelf software) for all public health institutions based on the schematic mapping
findings and continuous monitoring results and additional storage system for the HIF. This
was an essential support to complement the government’s supported software development.

62.    The approach towards IT support was revised several times, followed by shifting of
funds between the second and third components. These activities started late due to the prior
requirement to develop and adopt an IT strategy and initial support through the project was
focused on making the HIF IT management system functional. Due to the high costs of
investments in building an e-health society, the Project couldn’t finance all needs. Therefore,
agreement was reached between MOH and the Bank for the loan to finance the hardware and
MOH’s budget to finance the development of the software for IHIS.

63.    However, due to WB requirements to synchronise timing of Government and loan
support to IT activities, IT procurement activities were substantially delayed because of the
long Government’s tender process. During the procurement process, based on additional HIF



                                            69
needs to improve its storage capacity to ensure the IT management system functional
complementarities with IHIS and central data safety before transferring to IHIS central data
base, HIF changed its decentralized IT management system to a centralized structure. The
Project also covered the purchase of additional storage for HIF. The process for the
preparation and approval of specifications for the IT related procurement also took longer
then planned, and after resubmitting the evaluation report in which LOT2 (IT hardware) was
re-evaluated based on the discussions and clarifications provided at the videoconference held
in April 2010, the WB approved the evaluation report on April 27, 2010.

64.     Contracts with Kontrax (Lot 2 - consisting computers, printers and laptops), Kernel
(Lot 3 – IT networking equipment and Lot 4 – consisting of office and antivirus software)
and Asseko (Lot 1 – servers for hospitals, HIFM storage system and switches) for a total
value of about US$2.65 million were signed on June 16, 2010. All procurement, installation
and acceptance activities were finalized by December 2010. The Project also supported with
Grant Facility Competitive Funds, the establishment of the IT Central Data Base through the
reconstruction of premises and provision of adequate air-conditioning system and generator
for the central data base for IHIS.

65.     Sub-component 2: Grant Facility for Improving Service Quality and Efficiency.
The activities in this sub-component supported developmental changes in the network of
public health providers improving efficiency, availability and quality of health services. The
aim was to connect to the process of key strengthening of hospitals related to improving
efficiency, quality of services, patient satisfaction and safety, and better coordination with
other institutions in the provider network in primary and tertiary care.

66.     Grant Facility demonstration Projects. GF demonstration funds (US$0.74 million)
supported essential upgrades and improvements in 14 public health hospitals nationwide,
based on the positive evaluation of proposed business development plans. The demonstration
projects showed early results in improving quality and efficiency of health care services. The
following improvements were made: (i) hospital energy efficiency was improved, activities
comprised heating system improvements and its rationalization in unused facilities,
replacement of windows and doors, training of hospital staff and patients on heating saving
possibilities; (ii) patient satisfaction was increased, the waiting rooms, entrances and toilets
were renovated and services for better information of patients established; (iii) patient safety
increased, roof reconstructions took place, improving functionality and elevators and stares
safety, the height of the balconies and ramps were corrected, access to the toilets for persons
with special needs was improved and measures for food and water safety undertaken; and
(iv) quality of care increased, activities focused on decreasing of clinical mistakes and
introduction of changes aiming to safe funds for hospitals and improve patients’ healing
outcomes, decrease hospital infections by installing more sinks and increasing hygiene. The
demonstration GF funded projects were successfully completed in the following public
health institutions:

1. Kocani General Hospital - replacement of windows and doors;
2. Struga General Hospital - replacement of windows and doors;
3. Stip General Hospital - replacement of roof construction;



                                            70
4. Skopje Health Home, Policlinic “Bit Pazar” - roof reconstruction;
5. Gostivar General Hospital - reparation of roof construction;
6. Gevgelija General Hospital - reconstruction of roof, chimney and central heating
    system in supplementary hospital facility and registration patient room renovation;
7. Resen Health Home - roof reconstruction;
8. Rostuse Health Home - Roof reparation;
9. Bitola Clinic Hospital - reconstruction of sanitary facilities;
10. Kicevo General Hospital - reconstruction of roof, sanitary facilities, and drainage
    system;
11. Strumica General Hospital - reconstruction of ambulanta and sanitary facilities;
12. Tetovo General Hospital - roof construction over open roof terraces;
13. Kumanovo General Hospital – replacement of hospital outer surface
14. Ohrid Special Hospital “Sv. Erazmo” – replacement of windows in certain hospital
    wings, reparation of old one and a new elevator installation.

67.     Grant Facility Competitive Projects - (US$1.45 milliion) for activities aimed at
achieving PDOs supportws implementation of 6 sub-projects: (1) procurement of GPRS
devices and establishing of functional GPRS systems for monitoring of vehicles in the
emergency medical services in Skopje and Bitola health Homes; (2) essential reconstructions
in the new central data base for IHIS and provision of generator; (3) procurement and
installation of x-ray unit for the Special hospital Erasmo in Ohrid; (4) procurement of 10
chairs for dialyses for Nephrology Clinic and its remote dialyzes unit in policlinic “Cair”; (5)
medical and office furniture and medical equipment to 17 new rural ambulantas; and (6)
support to project design and reconstruction of premises of the new FM Educational Centre
in Skopje, and provision of all necessary office, medical, and teaching equipment.

      GPRS devices were procured and installed in 40 vehicles in Skopje and Bitola Health
       Homes’ Emergency Health Services in May 2010. With the immediate online
       monitoring of movement of emergency vehicles by Skopje and Bitola emergency
       services, dispatcher centers improved coordination and strengthen control on EHS
       teams’ work, with optimal use of their capacities to timely respond to urgent needs.
      Rooms for the Central Data Base for IHIS were reconstructed according to
       international standards and an air-conditioning system was also installed. To avoid
       any possible damages to the central data base due to possible electricity cuts and to
       insure continuity in data availability, flow and safety, an additional competitive grant
       supported provision and installation of a generator. The provision of necessary
       hardware, servers and IHIS software was complemented with Government funds;
       these activities are still ongoing.
      Based on additional needs and successive to their business plan and competitive
       project acceptance, procurement and installation of x-ray unit for the Special hospital
       Erasmo in Ohrid was realized.
      Based on essential needs for adequate treatment of patients which life depends on
       performing 2-3 times weekly dialyzes, 10 chairs for dialyses were procured and
       installed partially in Nephrology Clinic and the rest in its remote dialyzes unit in
       policlinic “Cair”.



                                            71
      To ensure availability and quality of PHC in deprived rural communities, government
       supported the construction of 17 rural ambulantas. To complement these efforts,
       competitive grants supported provision of necessary office and medical furniture and
       a set of basic medical equipment for all 17 rural ambulantas.
      To facilitate FM implementation, MOH provided a facility for the new Skopje FM
       Educational Centre and a competitive grant supported: (i) design and supervision of
       reconstruction activities, (ii) works in rooms and sanitation facility with replacement
       of windows and doors, provision of office equipment and air conditioners, (iii)
       educational models for clinical exercises, (iv) medical furniture and equipment for
       clinical education, and (iv) provision of teaching equipment, photocopier.

COMPONENT 4: PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING

68.     The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was established to ensure overall project
management and coordination, and effective administration of day-to-day implementation on
behalf of the two implementing agencies. The PCU comprised the Principle Coordinator
(who changed four times during project implementation), 3 Assistant Coordinators (that
became Component Coordinators), Procurement Officer, Financial Officer,
Administrative/logistic assistant, Secretary/translator and 5 Coordinators (that played a role
of activity Coordinators - 4 from HIFM and one from MOH). Several WGs were established
to support implementation: (i) health strategy development, (ii) IT strategy development, (iii)
modernization of licensing process and quality improvement, (iv) Primary Health Care, (v)
Basic Benefit Package redefinition, (vi) reforms in pharmaceutical sector, (vii) public
relations and communications, (viii) DRG implementation, (ix) public health reforms and
public health law development, (ix) EBM clinical guidelines implementation, (x) Family
Medicine Implementation, and (xi) hospital management development. Within this
component, the PAU was established to be involved in project implementation. This
component also provided a project implementation advisor.

Project Coordination and Management

69.      The Principle Coordinator was the deputy Minister of Health (except in one occasion
when the Chief of the Minister’s cabinet overtook that role), who dedicated part of his/her
working time to coordinate the PCU and HSMP implementation. The PC worked closely
with the Component Coordinators, fiduciary staff and other project staff, including project
manager employed in the last 6 months of project implementation. The Project was very
complex with extensive number of activities and a huge number of stakeholders. Therefore,
not only the Project Manager, but any new staff would need time to understand the project.
However, her contribution covered responsibilities from managing and supervising project
activities and reporting to MOH, Government, and the World Bank; assisting the PC in
addressing and resolving issues that arose during the implementation of the IT activities;
daily management with the PCU; and contributed in following up project documents signing
with the Minister. The PC also coordinated activities of several WGs and provided crucial
political support and guidance for important health reform actions. All crucial project
decisions were discussed and approved by the SC, composed by the Minister of Health, HIF
Director and high official from MOF. Project progress was presented by the PC in many
occasions also by the responsible Component Coordinators. Monthly reports were prepared


                                            72
by the Component Coordinators for MOF and periodical action plans and reports were
provided to the WB, MOH and HIF and to the Government for relevant health reform
activities supported through the Project.

70.     The Component Coordinators of Component 1 and 2 (full-time employed by the
project), effectively coordinated overall project implementation in their respective
components and in many occasions supported MOH and HIF on other issues related to health
reform implementation. The Component 3 Coordinator changed 3 times, causing delays in
the implementation of planned activities. Due to the weak capacity of the 3rd Component 3
Coordinator (the office manager was acting coordinator at the time), some of the
responsibilities and tasks from Component 3 were divided between the other two
coordinators and on June 2009, Component 1 Coordinator became coordinator for both MOH
components (1 and 3). The Component Coordinators liaised with other projects and
programmatic loans and ensured that project funds were spent in accordance with the
procurement plans and in line with PDOs. They managed all contacts and coordination of
WGs, participated and contributed to the WG deeds, coordinated the work and inputs of
international and local consultants and provided effective monitoring of project activities
implementation and progress and follow of KPI. For this purpose, component coordinators
collaborated with all relevant institutions and PAU members and reported regularly to the
WB. Project implementation was constrained due to the often change of both fiduciary staff
(3 times during the project), which slowed down project implementation, overloading the
component coordinators temporarily with the overtaking of their duties as well. The
fiduciary staff, especially the Procurement Officer was heavily engaged in the last 2 years of
implementations, when many procurement packages were processed (IT, Grant facility and
hiring of TA). The most sensitive issue relates to the PAU work. Although lots of efforts
were displayed, it did not succeed to be incorporated as such in the MOH structure.

4.     Lessons Learned

        Clear responsibilities and lines of communication should be established;
        'Assistant Coordinators'/Coordinators functions in the initially envisaged project
structure did not work and could have been appointed as Component Coordinators to start
with;
        Need for 'motivation', additional incentives (payments) to staff working in other
institutions, if one wants things to work efficiently and to ensure 'ownership', WG, PAU or to
identify appropriate 'champions' for implementation;
        Need to ensure covenants are maintained, with regard to the establishment of
effective PAU in MOH, and to employment of Component Coordinators based on agreement
reached and promise made at the beginning of the Project and reflected in the ICR that was
accepted by the Steering Committee for the HSMP and the World Bank.

5.     Project Impact in the implementation of health sector reform

71.     Although the project was very complex and challenging with an extensive number of
health reform activities concerning all aspects of health care and especially ambitious health
policy development, it was adequately designed to meet the Government’s reform priorities.


                                           73
The Project played an important role as a vehicle for health reforms and made significant
impact in reforming the health sector. In particular, HSMP made significant achievements in:
(i) overall health policy development and strengthening of the regulatory system; (ii)
implementing PHC reforms, privatization and establishing consistency in the quality of care
and initial activities for the establishment of FM; (iii) strengthening hospital management,
quality, efficiency and reporting mechanisms, introducing the DRG system; (iv) improving
HIF contracting processes with all health providers, regulating the referral system and
strengthening its strategic purchasing function; (v) reorganization of public health services
and enforcing of new Public Health Law; and (vi) enforcement of new Law on
pharmaceuticals and medical devices and introduction of referent and unique drug pricing
system; (vii) providing crucial support to the development of the IHIS; and (viii) better
quality of health care by introducing evidence based medicine guidelines in everyday
practice enforced by regulation and establishing the base for a better monitoring mechanisms
for their implementation.

CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE WORLD BANK,
GOVERNMENT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

Assessment of World Bank performance during preparation and implementation:

72.     WB team’s continuous assistance and direct supervision was highly significant both
for project preparation and for the implementation stages. Preparation of the Project was
supported by extensive analytical work and technical assistance of WB experts and
experienced consultants hired during the preparatory phase under the PHRD Grant. The
Project objectives were in line with the Government reform priorities and health reform
objectives. However, prior to the implementation of crucial activities, the major project
requirement enforced by the Bank was to complete a broad consultative process with all key
stakeholders, and to accept and enforce set of strategies (Health Strategy 2020, Information
Strategy and FM implementation strategy), before being able to proceed with the
implementation of the most crucial project activities.

73.      Key decision that facilitated project implementation. Changes to the Project
components/sub-components made were in accordance with the PDOs. Financial re-
allocations were made during the Project lifetime, which significantly facilitated
implementation and supported priority health reform actions in a flexible manner. During
this process, the Bank team showed an understanding and empathy with the needs and
facilitated or, in some cases, initiated the necessary changes.

74. Key decision that hindered project implementation. The frequent changes of TTL,
four during the project lifetime was a major obstacle to the continuous and effective WB
support to the Project. Each TTL had to pick up where his predecessor had left off, pass
through a steep learning curve and when paired with the similar frequency of change in
implementing agencies leadership, imposed additional burdens and had a negative impact on
the Project. In some cases, this occurred at critical times and the Project experienced either a
lack of follow-through or change in emphasis. This was reflected in Project delays and some
changes in project plans and activities. Nevertheless, this disadvantage was successfully



                                            74
bridged with the enormous dedication and great efforts made by existing team members and
notably the local WB team and the PCU component coordinators, who between them
provided the necessary continuity and 'institutional memory'. The WB support varied during
implementation related to the different TTL’s during implementation. They established
different ways of communication with the PC and the PCU, of which some were more
effective than others. The TTLs and the overall World Bank supervision team should follow
the agreed lines of communication through the PCU and the management. One of the
samples of miss-communication can be considered the unforeseen increasing of the value for
the IT related procurement. Similarly, from the point of view of Project implementation, the
role of the Project Manager should have been included in the organization chart from the
beginning.

76.     As a final point one of the conditions for project effectiveness was that the
Government should employ the PCU staff by the end of the project, this still has not
happened and as it was a condition imposed by the WB should be more supportive and create
effective mechanisms together with the implementing agencies to put in effect, the decisions
that were stipulated and agreed within the frames of the official project documents.16

Key Lessons learned

77.     Although some changes of TTL may sometimes be necessary, WB should try and
limit these to the extent possible:

        If changes of TTL are necessary, these should not occur during key stages, for
example, following the MTR several decisions were made concerning the implementation of
the project, however, many of these were not properly formalised or during project time
extensions that should provide time, adequate management support and guidance to complete
ongoing project activities.
        Clear understanding on the monitoring of the identified KPIs has to be made before
project start. In this case, discussion on the number and content of KPI continued through
the first project years that resulted in collection of various data, not only the one related to the
first list of KPI (from PAD). The often change of the TTLs also resulted in unclear
understanding from the PCU that any change of KPI has to be reflected in the Amendment of
the Loan Agreement, which was not emphasized to resolve this situation in a proper way.
        The other lesson learned is that due attention should be given to appropriate selection
of KPI, that can have baseline data at the beginning of the project, but that can be followed
through to the end of the project as well.

Assessment of Government’s actions during preparation and implementation:

78.    The Key Decision was the appointment of a knowledgeable, politically influential and
dedicated PC who triggered many important project activities and provided adequate support

     Note from Bank ICR team: This “condition” was not included in the Loan Agreement.




                                                        75
and guidance for successful component coordination and project activities implementation.
This was especially positive and crucial with the last PC, who coordinated implementation
since October 2008. It is worth mentioning the impact on the progress with FM and EBM
implementation, DRG system introduction and project support to IHIS.

Key decisions (or lack of) hindering project implementation

79.      Based on negative lessons from the previous project, the underlying issue was how to
integrate knowledgeable and experienced project staff in the regular MOH and HIF structures
to upgrade their capacities especially in the field of policy formulation and implementation.
Hence, the POM foresaw integration of key PCU staff in the MOH and HIF structures during
project implementation. However, although integration was discussed and was acceptable to
the project leadership, by the third month of the project grace period (project completion
period) this issue has still not been resolved, while the concerned project staff continued their
support to the project completion activities. However, many unplanned difficulties are
apparent even for their financial remuneration for the support to the completion of project
activities. Moreover, although many inputs are still required, the dedicated project staff that
carried the great burden for the successful support to the health reform implementation,
ensuring effective project realization during all leadership changes, are currently working pro
bono and their future employment in MOH is still unknown. This means that the lessons
from the previous project have not been learned, although the bases for PCU staff
employment in MOH were being built, their work was positively evaluated and they
expressed their willingness to be employed in the MOH.

80.      The two loan extensions were partially triggered by project inactivity periods caused
by changes in the project leadership. Critical project outputs were ensured by project staff
hired with Loan funds, especially “component coordinators” initially titled assistant
coordinators supporting project sustainability and building links and cooperation with
relevant staff and sectors within both implementing institutions. The wide range of health
reform activities supported required broad links and cooperation with all key health
stakeholders, while the weak capacity within the implementing institutions, huge workload
and absence of financial motivation for the technical “activity coordinators” although
initially foreseen as crucial project staff in the project structure, were not as effective as
planned, and only few individuals were active. Some of them, however, did make significant
contributions to various project activities as members of WGs where they received some
additional compensation.

81.    Counterpart funds timely availability. There were some delays at the beginning for
the provision of budget funds for CME implementation which was overcome and activities
were implemented.

82.    Monitoring by Ministry of Health and PCU. Activities were successfully
monitored by the PCU and although MOH and HIF leadership changed 4 times, except
during certain gaps during the periods when Government was changing which had negative
impact. However, the monitoring was re-established soon afterwards, which was effective
especially due to the high MOH function of the PC.



                                             76
Key Lessons learned

        The Principle Coordinator was a crucial figure throughout the project and in many
circumstances the successive coordinators ensured a positive political environment for
critical reform changes to become effective. The general lesson is that highly motivated and
experienced staff should be engaged to work full time with the project to ensure successful
project implementation.
        Successful implementation of such a complex and ambitious health reform project
would require hiring a larger number of full time project staff to manage individual project
activities under the guidance of coordinators and timely engagement.
        Including staff from public administration or MOH officials in the formal project
structure has proven to be ineffective due to the impossibility of providing adequate financial
motivation paid out of project funds for their additional work and from their perspective due
to a lack of time to perform additional functions in addition to their regular working
obligations in resident institutions.

Assessment of the efficiency and quality of the relationship between the World Bank
and Government during project implementation

83.     Since 1996 the Government has had a constructive and successful relationship with
the WB. The Health Sector Management project as a second WB-supported project was
implemented from 1994-2010 and significantly contributed to the success of major country
health reforms implementation and policy development. The effective partnership between
the Government and the WB, created a constructive environment to advance forward many
difficult health reform actions in a complex environment that required broad consultative
processes and strategies’ development prior to the implementation of crucial project activities.
However, it cannot be emphasised enough that this relationship should be based on mutual
respect and trust and a key individual that should be instrumental in maintaining this should
be the TTL.

Assessment of the performance of various organizations (i.e., HIF, etc.), firms and
technical assistance during project implementation (costs vs. benefits)

84.    Despite frequent changes in MOH and HIF leadership, the Project generally enjoyed
strong support and a good working relationship with MOH and HIF. Even though the PCs
were also changed four times, the Project generally benefited from the enthusiastic Project
leadership and the committed PCU Component Coordinators supported by the PC. The PCU
also benefited from a strong team of technical staff through the various WGs. Besides, the
implementing agencies, the IPH, regional PHC, three Medical Chamber (Doctors Dentists
and Pharmacists), Medical Association, Medical Faculty, pharmacies, PHC doctors and the
management teams of all health facilities were also key participants in project
implementation. PCU staff had regular and close interaction with all MOH and HIF
departments and regional branches, including MOH bodies: Drug Bureau, Health and
Sanitary Inspectorate and Food Directorate and various training institutions. In this context,
during implementation the project established good cooperation with Ministries and PCUs




                                            77
from other countries, and especially with the Slovenian MOH, Serbian MOH and PIU,
benefiting from their experience and lessons learned.

SUSTAINABILITY OF PROJECT INVESTMENTS

85.     The Government is very committed to build on achievements to continue with the
modernization and optimization of health services to improve access to quality and efficient
health care for the population, with an accent on the availability of essential PHC services to
rural communities. This commitment is evidenced by the dedication to meet Health Strategy
2020 goals and increasing the budget for the sector. Factors during implementation that have
impact on sustainability have been discussed in detail in this annex.

CONCLUSIONS

86.      Although the HSMP was a very complex and challenging project, it was adequately
designed to meet the Government’s reform priorities. Its objectives were crucial and project
activities effectively supported the health reform process. The Project built on the
achievements of the HSTP project and successfully upgraded established processes. The best
example is the great progress with PHC reforms: completion of privatization process and
introduction of capitation based payment model for PHC doctors and Initiation of FM
specialization and re-education for PHC doctors. Draft curricula for specialization developed
within the first health project was updated and the trained educators that firstly continued
with CME courses implementation received additional training and became key
mentors/educators within the newly established FM School at the Medical Faculty in Skopje.

87.      The Project itself was flexible and according to the Health Strategy 2020 priority
goals included additional activities in line with the project development objectives. The
Project in a harmonized way successfully liaised and coordinated project implementation
activities with the other projects and programmatic Loans (PSMAL, SPIL, DTF, PDPL, and
DPL) and triggered greater Government financial support to the health sector. The Bank and
the Government became synchronized partners aiming to improve conditions, quality and
efficiency of care in the public health institutions by introducing health information systems
with emphasis on the implementation of the IHIS in the health sector. This is especially
evident in the last project years when the political commitment of the Government to meet
the health sector goals significantly increased.

88.    Being part of the health reforms and providing adequate financial support to ongoing
processes, the Project played a central role in the following main areas:

(i)    strengthening MOH and HIF capacities for effective and sound formulation and
       implementation of health policies, improving financial management capacities and
       skills of managers in the health sector, establishing sound and more transparent health
       insurance mechanisms and controls, strengthening of contracting processes with all
       health providers in the primary, secondary and tertiary health care and improving of
       public relations and communication activities;




                                            78
(ii)   improving conditions, quality of care and efficiency of hospital services, introducing
       business plans preparation processes by increasing knowledge and skills of hospital
       management teams, restructuring of hospital services, introducing DRGs system in
       the acute hospital care, increasing number of day-care services and strengthening the
       gate keeping function of PHC introducing at the same time better control mechanisms
       for the hospital referral system implementation.
