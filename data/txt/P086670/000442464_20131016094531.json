Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            close coordination of policy lending and investment lending\n            can greatly facilitate achievement of reforms. Although the\n            policy lending included reforms across several sectors,\n            there was a sustained sector focus on health that was\n            central to achieving important synergies with the investment\n            operations. Political obstacles can be overcome with\n            effective planning and consultation, but will be\n            insurmountable otherwise. The project manager should be\n            chosen by agreement between the Bank and the Ministry of\n            Health (MOH) as a bridge person, someone with political\n            access but who is not reporting and subject to the MOH on a\n            daily basis. Information technology (IT) components of\n            health sector reform frequently encounter delays, whose risk\n            can be mitigated through careful planning and flexibility.\n            Qualified regional experts can be extremely effective as\n            consultants and trainers. These consultants also contributed\n            important demonstration effects of successful reform in\n            other parts of the region."}, "docdt": "2013-09-25T00:00:00Z"}
