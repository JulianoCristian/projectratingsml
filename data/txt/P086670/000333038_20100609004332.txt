FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA 
HEALTH SECTOR MANAGEMENT PROJECT  
LOAN No. MK-4733  
 
Restructuring Memo for Extension of Closing Date 
 
1.  The closing date for the FYR Macedonia, Health Sector Management Project LOAN 
NUMBER 4733 MK, will be extended from June 30 until December 31, 2010. The extension 
was requested for 3 months, but following discussions and exchange of correspondences with 
MoF and MoH it was agreed to propose a 5 month extension    
2.  The project objectives continue to be relevant and achievable and will not change.  The 
implementation continues to be satisfactory albeit delays in procurement of Information 
Technology equipment for the health care system. Those delays are the result of a very long 
evaluation process as a result of weak IT capacity in the Ministry of Health and PCU. All 
other activities and procurement packages are progressing albeit with some delays but are 
expected to be completed before the Closing Date of the Loan. There are no outstanding 
audits of the project and no safeguard issues will be triggered by the extension.   
3.  The proposed extension is necessary to complete procurement of Information Technology 
equipment.  Bidding procedures are completed and contracts for Information Technology 
equipment will be signed as soon as the extension of closing date is granted.  The activities 
that will be completed during the extension include delivery, acceptance and quality control 
of equipment. 
4.  This will be the second extension of the project. The first extension was for a period of one 
year and the second one is proposed for six months.
