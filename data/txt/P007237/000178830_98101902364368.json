Adjustment Loan and\n            Credit Project will support a comprehensive economic program\n            designed by Guyana to stem the deterioration in the economy,\n            stimulate economic growth and restore balance of payments\n            equilibrium. The economic program aims at improving\n            productive capacity, especially of exportable commodities\n            and manufactured items produced by the private sector, and\n            completing the execution of the 1980-82 public sector\n            investment program. The Bank Group financing of the program\n            would provide foreign exchange to meet critically needed\n            inputs for export-oriented industrial and agricultural\n            operations in both the public and private sectors. In the\n            case of the manufacturing sector the Bank loan would finance\n            a revolving Export Development Fund; for this purpose, the\n            Government would onlend US$8 million to the Bank of Guyana,\n            with the same grace and repayment periods and interest rate\n            of the proposed Bank loan, and with other terms and\n            conditions satisfactory to the Bank. A related technical\n            assistance loan which is being submitted separately would\n            support institutional arrangements and policies to promote\n            development of Guyana's exports, and improve the\n            systems for monitoring execution of the public sector\n            investment program and for expenditure control."}, "docdt": "1981-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
