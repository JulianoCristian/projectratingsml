            2.       The project achievements include the following: (i) the construction of 1,880
            classrooms (i.e. 219 schools out of the planned 291) through community-based
            contracting for school construction. An additional 46 schools are currently under
            construction and the remaining 26 have started construction in early December 2012,
            which will result in an additional 233 classrooms; (ii) 713 community grants were
            provided to support poor children to go and complete primary education; (iii) a series of
            training for primary schools teachers were carried out to improve the quality of teaching;
            and (iv) the capacity development activities are also making good progress and are
            expected to be finalized prior to project closing. Overall project disbursements stand at
            100 percent for the original Grant H0840-LA, 92.10 percent for the original Cr. 3886-LA,
            and 65.04 percent for the Additional Financing Grant H541-LA. The PDO are well on
            track and remain achievable. The proposed reallocation is necessary to increase the
            amount available for sub-grants and training activities under Grant H541-LA. These
            additional funds will enable more children to attend school (especially in remote areas),
            increase their chances of completing primary education, while supporting the
            Government’s goal of increasing primary school enrollment and completion in the 19
            poorest districts of the six poor provinces. No changes are proposed to the PDO,
            components, performance indicators, results framework, safeguards classification,
            institutional arrangements, financial management or procurement, and there are no
            outstanding legal covenants or audit reports.
