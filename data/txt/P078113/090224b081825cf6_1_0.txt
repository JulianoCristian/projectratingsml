                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation is progressing well: Community-Based Contracting for School Construction (CBC), making steady progress, with 219 schools (out of 291) are now completed
                         and fully operational, and 46 schools are under construction. The construction of the remaining 26 schools will start by December 2012. The Community Grants was delivered to the
                         communities and the teacher upgrading training has been carried out during the summer vacation. The project team and government will closely monitor the progress of
                         implementation activities between now and project closing date on August 31, 2012. The Mid-Term Review Mission, conducted in October 2012, found that: i) the Ministry of
                         Education and Sports (MOES) has strongly reaffirmed its commitment to ensure that the project is implemented effectively and efficiently to achieve the project development
                         objectives; and ii) MOES Departments involved in the project have taken the opportunity of the project implementation to address issues beyond the original scope of the project.
