  A glitch in the system did not capture the AusAID contribution as part of the additional financing or

Furthermore, the formally revised disbursement estimates were entered into the Portal but not recorded by

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country Context. In 1997, the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR)
had an estimated per capita income of US$400 and was one of the poorest and least
developed countries in the East Asia region. Although public expenditures on education
had increased from 1.6 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1991 to 2.8 percent
in 1997, they still remained among the lowest in Asia, were heavily dependent upon
donor financing, and their impact was often limited. At the time of appraisal, a main goal
of the Government of Lao PDR (GoL PDR) was to graduate from least developed
country status by 2020. To achieve this goal, the government developed the National
Poverty Eradication Program (NPEP), which aimed to stabilize the economy, support
improvements in basic services, maintenance and capacity, while strengthening
partnerships. The NPEP identified 72 districts as “poor”, of which 47 were identified for
priority investments. The NPEP goals were also the goals of the World Bank Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2000-2002. At the time, the CAS linked poverty alleviation
with economic growth, social and cultural development, and participation through
decentralization. It aimed to reduce income gaps through more equitable access to
resources, public goods and services. In education, the CAS highlighted inequitable
access and a high degree of inefficiency due to lack of complete schools, trained teachers,
and materials as hindering factors to growth.

2.      Sector Context. The Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES) Strategic Vision
up to 2020 was expressed in the Five Year Development Plan (2000-2005), as well as in
the NPEP. Priorities in the Vision included universalization of compulsory primary
education, abolition of illiteracy, expansion of vocational and higher education,
development of science and technology, gradually raising standards to international
levels, and improving management. Cross cutting issues (and strategies) include equitable
access (infrastructure, private sector development, programs targeting disadvantaged
groups), quality and relevance (learning materials, teacher training, curricula, linkages
with private sector for vocational and technical education), and decentralization (training).
In education, the NPEP prioritizes achievement of universal completion of quality
primary education for the poorest. It planned to increase education’s share of the public
budget to 15 percent by 2005/06 and the share for primary education to 50 percent, and to
improve the predictability of salary payments. A Joint International Development Agency
(IDA) – International Monetary Fund (IMF) Staff Assessment supported the GoL PDR's
strategy, but stressed the need to further prioritize and cost the programs, link the
programs to public expenditure policies, and make greater efforts to improve
transparency in the management of public resources. In order to support Lao PDR
achieve the NPEP priorities and strategies for primary education, the government
requested IDA funding for the development of the Second Education Development
Project (EDPII).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

3.       The objective of the project was primary enrollment and completion increased in
the nineteen poorest districts in the six poorest provinces, quality improved, and
capacities strengthened to develop policies and strategies to monitor and manage primary
education. The original key indicators selected to monitor progress toward Project
Development Objective (PDO) achievement were: (i) lower construction costs; (ii)
increased enrollments in target districts (number enrolled and net enrollment percentage);
(iii) increased primary completion rates in target areas; (iv) reduced repetition rates in
grades 1 and 2 target districts; (v) reduced gap in net enrollment rates between target
districts and national average; (vi) reduced national enrollment gap between poor and
non-poor households; (vii) contract teachers upgraded to qualified status in project
villages; (viii) all teachers in project schools trained in multi-grade methods; (ix)
student:textbook ratio at 1:1 in rural areas; (x) improved learning outcomes in rural and
ethnic minority areas; (xi) policies and strategies increasingly made on the basis of
information; (xii) increased education expenditure; (xiii) increased recurrent capital
expenditure; and (xiv) increased expenditure on primary education.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

4.       The PDO was not revised during project implementation. However, at the time of
the 2010 additional financing, the PDO level indicators were modified. The project paper
states that the original results framework would be modified based on the 2007 mid-term
review (MTR) recommendations to reduce the number of overall indicators to 23 and that
the additional financing results framework would focus on the newly introduced IDA
Core Indicators. Therefore, the additional financing results framework combined the
agreed 2007 MTR PDO level indicators with the new additional financing indicators for a
total of 12 PDO level indicators. The combined list of PDO level indicators included: (i)
primary completion rate for entire country; (ii) gender parity index for entire country; (iii)
system of learning assessment; (iv) increased number of classrooms built and rehabilitate
under the project as a percentage of total number of required classrooms at primary level
in target districts; (v) increased number of teachers received training in multi-grade
teaching as a percentage of the total number of primary teachers in the targeted districts
and schools; (vi) lower construction costs; (vii) increased enrollments in target districts;
(viii) all teachers in project schools trained in multi-grade methods; (ix) improved
learning outcomes in rural and ethnic minority areas 2 ; (x) policies and strategies
increasingly made on the basis of information; (xi) increased education expenditure; and
(xii) increased recurrent capital expenditure.

 There are approximately 130 different ethnic groups with four basically different language groups.
Approximately 50.2 percent of the overall population are Lao. The remainder can broadly be categorized as
Mon-Khmer, Hmong-Yao, Hmong-Mien, Tai-Kadai, and Sino-Tibetan and approximately 80 percent of the
population in the project villages were in these four categories.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

5.      The main target population was villages and school aged children in the 19
poorest districts (out of the 72 NPEP designated poor districts) in six provinces
(Phongsaly, Oudomxay, Louangnamtha, Houaphanh, Attapeu and Xekong) with
incomplete schools and sufficient population to provide five years of education using
multi-grade teaching. All school aged children nationwide benefitted from improved
educational materials. Other target groups included education managers within the
District Education and Sports Bureau (DESB) and Provincial Education Service (PES) as
well as staff at the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES).

1.5 Original Components

6.      Component A. Increase Access and Completion of Primary Education in the
Poorest Districts (US$6.5 million). This component supported three interventions to
raise primary enrolment and completion rates, and reduce repetition and dropout. These
were: (i) community based contracting for classroom construction (CBC) that would
allow incomplete schools to gradually offer a complete five grades of primary education 3;
(ii) community grants for schooling (CG) program accompanied the CBC program to
lower the cost of education to communities. The CG provided resources for operations,
maintenance and subsidizing the poor and scaled up the experience of the IDA supported
Basic Education for Girls Project (BEGP), which targeted villages without schools in the
same districts; and (iii) in-service teacher training that provided multi-grade teacher
training to all teachers in participating villages and an in-service upgrading program for
all untrained contract teachers to enable the expansion of access through multi-grade
teaching.

7.     Component B. Improve the Quality of Primary Education (US$2.10 million).
This component: (i) provided textbooks and teachers’ guides aimed at ensuring that
teachers and students in grades 1-5 had the required textbooks, and built greater capacity
to manage the cycle of textbook production and distribution; and (ii) supported the
Assessment of Student Learning Outcomes (ASLO) which aimed to establish a
permanent national assessment system that would develop student assessment
instruments to monitor achievement of basic competencies.

8.    Component C. Strengthen Capacities for Policy Analysis and Management
(US$4.2 million IDA and US$0.2 million PPF). This component had four sub-
components: (i) strengthening policy and strategy development to support capacity

  At the time of preparation, almost half of the schools in the 19 target districts operated multi-grade
teaching with 24 percent of the schools having one classroom and 78 percent of the schools having two
classrooms. Given the population density, the most common type of complete school would a three
classroom/five grade multi-grade school.



                                                     3
building of the MoES to make information-based decisions, policy studies and
dissemination on key education issues, the Ethnic Group Development Plan (EGDP) and
project impact evaluation; (ii) strengthening information systems to support improved
collection, analysis, reporting, filing, storing and maintenance of data and information;
(iii) capacity building to strengthen capacity in management and administration; and (iv)
project management and strengthened capacities in coordination, procurement and
financial management.

1.6 Revised Components

9.      On January 12, 2010, the Bank approved an additional financing grant in the
amount of SDR 9.7 million (US$15.5 million equivalent) to scale up successful aspects
of the CBC and CGs under the project. The project components were not revised but the
additional financing supported Components A and C.

1.7 Other significant changes

10.    On July 7, 2005 there was an agreement between IDA and GoL PDR that the
financing parameters for all expenditure categories were to be set at 100 percent IDA.
This meant that the US$500,000 counterpart funding included in the original project
design was eliminated from the overall costs of the project, reducing the total project cost
to US$13.0 million equivalent.

11.     On June 15, 2007, IDA agreed to GoL PDR’s request to reallocate funds in part
due to the elimination of counterpart funding (i.e. to cover the costs of activities initially
financed by the government).

12.    The Bank and the Government of Australia entered into an administrative
agreement, signed and counter-signed on April 23, 2008 and April 29, 2008 respectively,
for an AUD 2.5 million 4 contribution to EDPII. This led to the signing of a trust fund
agreement between the Bank and GoL PDR on May 15, 2008 in the amount of AUD
2,336,139 to provide support for EDPII’s Component A package of school construction
(127 additional schools 5), community grant scheme and teacher training.

13.    On November 18, 2008, the Bank agreed to re-allocate funds of the original grant
and credit to respond to adjustments in implementation progress.

14.     On July 9, 2009, the Government of Australia provided additional funds to the
existing trust fund in the amount of AUD 940,500 for a total grant of AUD 3,276,639 due
to a depreciation of the Australian dollar to the Lao Kip. At the same time, the Letter


4
 AUD 163,861 were set aside to cover Bank-related administrative fees and supervision costs.
5
 After the AusAID funding was provided, the number of schools was reduced to 125 because the villages
where the schools were to be constructed were resettled away from the designated construction sites.
Therefore, the ICR analysis is based on AusAID target of 125 schools and villages.



                                                 4
Agreement between Lao PDR and the Bank was modified, an additional expenditure
category for consultant services was added, and funds were reallocated between the three
existing categories and the new category.

15.    As indicated above, on January 12, 2010, the Bank approved an additional
financing grant in the amount of SDR 9.7 million (US$15.5 equivalent) to continue
support of the successful activities under Components A and C and extended the project
closing date to August 31, 2013. The additional Financing Agreement was signed
February 8, 2010 and the Grant became effective on May 8, 2010.

16.     On August 10, 2010, the Bank approved the government’s request to reallocate
proceeds under the original credit and additional financing grant per routine adjustments
of tasks during implementation. The notification letter to GoL PDR was sent on August
20, 2010.

17.    On January 23, 2013, the Bank approved the government request to reallocate
proceeds to increase the amount available for sub-grants and training activities.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

18.      Project Preparation. In 2002, the Lao government and IDA decided to support
the EDPII with a combined IDA credit and IDA grant under the eligibility category of
“IDA grant for debt vulnerable”. The original CAS proposal was to provide a 10-year
Adaptable Program Loan (APL) that would deal with the NPEP issues of inequitable
access and inefficiencies due to the lack of complete schools, trained teachers and
materials. The 10-year APL was replaced with the EDPII design due to limited MoES
capacity, knowledge base and donor coordination required to prepare an APL. In
addition, it was decided to shift strategy and target IDA funding toward primary
education and policy development in light of substantial needs in those areas. A choice
was also made to target investments to the six poorest provinces and the 19 poorest
districts within those provinces in order to concentrate resources and raise the provinces
closer to the average in a shorter period of time than would be possible otherwise.
Therefore, the EDPII continued to address the CAS priorities of improving primary
education for the poorest.

19.     The Bank preparation and appraisal teams consisted of technical experts that were
appropriate for the development of the project. The preparation process included peer
reviewers that provided sound guidance on the project design and there was a Quality
Enhancement Review (QER) during project preparation. Project preparation was also
spread over 20 months, which allowed for: (i) the full development of the project with the
MoES, (ii) an agreement with MoES on the use of a project preparation facility (PPF)
grant; and (iii) a dialog with other donors on project design. Once agreed, the PPF grant
was particularly appropriate for this project because it allowed the MoES to help meet the
project conditions for negotiations, conditions for effectiveness and to lay the foundation



                                            5
for the full implementation of the project. The PPF grant supported the: (i) preparation of
the CBC operations manual; (ii) development of CBC questionnaires aimed at collecting
school data on all villages in the target districts in Phongsaly and Luangnamtha, which
were the first two provinces to begin implementation of CBC and CG activities; (iii)
development of a teacher upgrading program; (iv) development of procedures for setting
up accounts and authorizing transfers and payments; (v) development of plans for the
revision and production of textbooks and teaching materials beginning with grade 1; and
(vi) hiring of consultants to assist in the implementation of the CBC, CGs, procurement
and financial management, and provincial program advisors for Phongsaly and
Luangnamtha. The project preparation process was thoughtful, collaborative, and
technically sound. In addition, and with the support of the PPF, the preparation process
gave the MoES the opportunity to be ready for a quick start-up once the project became
effective. This was especially important since this was the first IDA-supported education
project in Lao PDR that mainstreamed project implementation within MoES. The
preparation took approximately two years during which there was a deliberative process
between MoES and the Bank on how best to deliver education services at the local level.
This process was important because education services have been decentralized to the
local level and CBC and CG activities have been institutionalized within the education
sector.

20.    Project Design. The EDPII project design fit squarely into the government’s
NPEP, the MoES's Strategic Vision up to 2020, as expressed in the Five Year
Development Plan (2000-2005), and the Bank’s CAS 2000-2002. They shared the
common objectives of providing equitable access, quality and relevance of basic
education for the poorest and most disadvantaged children in Lao PDR. The project
design took into consideration comments from peer reviewers during the concept and
appraisal review meetings as well as the QER. In addition, the design team drew lessons
from previous Bank-supported projects in Lao PDR, which informed the development of
the CBC, CG and multi-grade teaching package of pilot activities.

21.     The overall project design was simple; focused on access and quality in the
poorest areas, and supported the government’s efforts to decentralize services to the local
communities. The design also included the mainstreaming of project management within
the different MoES departments both at the central, provincial and district levels. As
mentioned, this was the first education project to include mainstreaming of project
management and implementation, which supported the government’s move toward
decentralization. The structure included: (i) Provincial Education Service and Sports
(PESS) and District Education Bureaus and Sports (DEBS) implementing units (IUs) for
CBC and CGs; (ii) a project management unit (ECU) in the Department of Planning
(DP), which provided overall project coordination; (iii) MoES IUs that allocated staff
time to implementation of project activities; and (iv) a project steering committee chaired
by the Vice Minister of Education with department. This was an appropriate structure and
was ultimately effective in implementing the project.

22.   The project PDO was appropriate for the project design. Originally, there were 14
key indicators selected for measuring progress toward achieving the PDO and 19



                                            6
intermediate output indicators. The intermediate indicators were included to assist the
MoES with monitoring implementation of the project components since this was the first
Bank-supported project where implementation was mainstreamed within the MoES.
However, the results framework could have been more focused, and in some instances,
could have included more realistic targets as well as details on the institutional
responsibilities for updating indicators. In September 2006, a Quality of Supervision
Assessment (QSA) highlighted the number of indicators and recommended modifications
at the mid-term review (MTR). The project design also piloted a package of interventions
(CBC, CGs and multi-grade teaching) at the local level in an effort to empower
communities and improve the quality of education service delivery as well as foster
ownership of the project. This package was a new approach in Lao PDR, which proved to
be highly appropriate and is now being used for most education projects in Lao PDR. The
design also included an impact evaluation of this package of interventions that was used
by MoES and donors. The preparation team identified project risks and proposed
adequate mitigation measures.

23.     The 2009 additional financing (AF) did not modify the original design. The
additional financing added US$15.5 million equivalent to the project to: (i) scale up the
successful implementation of the CBC and CGs under Component A by adding 270 more
schools with four classrooms to allow for the possible expansion of the school to cover
pre-school; (ii) provide CG grants to these additional schools; (iii) offer multi-grade
teaching to 700 more teacher; (iv) train 800 more VEDC members; and (v) provide
continued support for capacity building within MoES for service delivery and project
management under Component C. The capacity building support was particularly
important for the MoES because they had made good progress with the mainstreaming of
project management but also recognized the need to continue capacity building support.
At the time of the AF, the Bank team took the opportunity to formally modify the results
framework in line with the recommendations of the 2006 QSA and the stated
modifications to the framework in the mid-term review (MTR) aide-memoire which
reduced the list of indicators to 23, on the basis of relevancy, availability of data, and
measurability. This action reduced the PDO level indicators and intermediate indicators
and modified some of the input targets. The task team also used the opportunity to
incorporate Tier 1 Bank “IDA core indicators” into the results framework. These
indicators were national in scope and were to be used to monitor progress toward
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which the Bank team
judged to be also appropriate for monitoring PDO progress of the AF. In retrospect, these
indicators, while appropriate for monitoring the MDGs, were not focused on the six
project provinces, making project attribution difficult. However, they proved to be useful
for comparing provincial progress vis-à-vis national level progress.

2.2 Implementation

24.   As mentioned above, implementation began with the PPF grant that allowed
MoES to have access to an advance, which was used to lay the foundation for the full
implementation of the project. The PPF was instrumental for ensuring that the
government met the conditions of effectiveness and that project implementation staff and



                                            7
consultants were in place. There was a project launch workshop that included participants
from the project provinces, MoES, MoF, and the National Assembly. During the
workshop, each IU identified risks for implementation of their activities with suggested
mitigation measures. This project readiness led to early project disbursements of 4.4
percent, which were slightly ahead of the original projections. By 2006, implementation
was fully underway with: (i) construction of the planned classrooms in the targeted
villages completed; (ii) completion of the first full round of testing for ASLO; (iii)
completion of the data gathering on the number of teachers to be trained and training of
trainers underway; (iv) work underway on preparing for the publication and distribution
of revised textbooks and teachers guides for Grade 1; (v) the launch of technical
assistance contracts to support the design of the National University of Laos (NUOL)
new Bachelor of Education Administration and Management Project; and (vi) the
establishment of a baseline for the evaluation of the impact of the community-based
development component. Financial Management (FM) was emerging as a constraint to
project implementation because of slow replenishment of the special account and slow
payments to village development committees (VDC, later renamed Village Education
Development Committees - VEDC), national and international consultants and living
allowances to long-term trainees. However, at the suggestion of the task team, a separate
project accounting system was put in place to mitigate the risks, and the cumbersome
government processes were streamlined, which led the Bank task team to rate FM risk as
substantial even though the country risk was high. This was considerable progress in one
year considering the MoES had never mainstreamed implementation of a Bank-supported
project prior to the EDPII. In May 2007 there was an additional financial management
issue. A national consultant (a district engineer) misused funds, which was discovered by
the ECU manager who promptly informed the Bank. There was a follow up with a
communication to the Bank’s Institutional Integrity (INT) unit, which resulted in the
ECU’s termination of the consultant's contract and recovery of the funds. INT responded
by noting this to be a minor matter and suggested possible administrative sanctions that
the government could impose on the district engineer. These sanctions were carried out
and by October 1, 2007, INT declared the case closed.

25.     The 2007 MTR determined that the project was still relevant, the development
objectives remained valid, the PDO was achievable, and disbursements were on track
with 43 percent of the implementation period elapsed and 34 percent of the IDA funds
disbursed. The MTR did agree to modify some project activities as follows: (i) reduce the
number of schools to be constructed from the original target of 400 to 319 due to a 17
percent higher unit cost 6 than originally projected and to build more classrooms per
school; (ii) reduce the number of indicators as suggested by the 2006 QSA; (iii) complete
the purchase of textbooks and teacher’s guides at quantities that were 36 percent higher
than planned; (iv) train all teachers in the target districts on the use of the revised
textbooks and teachers guides; and (v) seek additional funds to expand the community-
based targeted programs. In 2008, AusAID added additional funds to the EDPII project to


6
  It should be noted that the MTR did indicate that US$62/m2 was still significantly lower than the unit cost
of comparable donor programs.



                                                      8
expand the CBC, CG and teacher training activities to more schools. These activities
were relevant to the support of the government’s decentralization program and AusAID
wanted to support the program.

26.     Since EDPII implementation was progressing well, the Lao government, in
December 2009, requested US$15.5 million additional financing to scale-up community
based targeted programs, which was approved by the Bank. The additional financing was
to support the scaling up of the successful CBC and CG programs, expand the multi-
grade teacher training and continue the capacity building of the VEDCs, DEB and PES.
At that time, the project had disbursed 95 percent (approximately US$12.4 million) of the
IDA funds, all time bound actions had been met, there had been full compliance will all
covenants, and the public reception of the project was very positive as indicated based on
an independent beneficiary assessment.

27.     By the end of the project, the MoES had been able to implement all original and
additionally financed activities in the project despite the remoteness of the locations. This
finding was supported by a review that showed: (i) all project classrooms were completed
using the new CBC; (ii) community grants were enabling communities through the
VEDCs to purchase teaching and learning materials for children; (iii) teachers were
trained in multi-grade teaching and the new grade 1-5 curriculum and textbooks, (iv)
textbooks and teachers guides were provided for project schools and were being used; (v)
two rounds of grade 5 learning assessments had been administered with results published
and the experience gained being incorporated into the new grade 3 assessment; (vi) the
Education Management Information System (EMIS) was strengthened; and (vii) project
management was successfully mainstreamed into the MoES.

28.     There were also challenges during implementation. In 2010 the project conducted
a quality audit of the EDPII schools because the CBC was a new concept and the project
schools were in the most remote and hardest to reach areas. The audit identified
weaknesses in the system that led to construction errors or weaknesses in building quality.
To resolve these issues, the Bank team hired a consultant to do an analysis of all levels of
the CBC production system. The consultants made recommendations for quality
assurance, quality control, and process improvements. These recommendations were
taken seriously by the MoES and all have been incorporated into the CBC operation
manual. In addition, the MoES put together a central quality control team that is
responsible for visiting all CBC project schools and providing training for PESs and
DEBs on quality control. The other challenge for the project was financial management.
The delays in liquidating advances were the main factor in rating implementation
progress as moderately satisfactory four times during the life of the project. The ECU
has taken steps to improve this process and continues the capacity building efforts at the
village, district and provincial levels. These challenges, however, did not undermine the
project’s ability to complete all activities.

29.     There were 18 Bank review and implementation support mission from March
2004 through August 2013. The makeup of the Bank teams was well balanced with
financial management, procurement, construction, safeguards, and monitoring and



                                             9
evaluation specialists as necessary. There was a cancellation of US$2,054,254 equivalent
(approximately SDR 1,340,000) due to SDR:US$ exchange rate gains. The additional
financing grant activities were all completed by August 31, 2013. There was a
cancellation from the Australian trust fund of approximately US$360,800 equivalent
(AUD 410,400). This was due to delays in construction of the last group of schools as
indicated above. However, all the other AusAID supported activities were completed as
designed. The total project disbursements in US$ equivalent were approximately
US$29.87 or 92.52 percent of the combined total of approximately US$32.28 million7
equivalent.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

30.     Design. The M&E design was twofold. The monitoring of the results framework
and project outputs was to be done by the ECU while the impact of the community-based
interventions would be assessed through an impact evaluation, with the help of technical
assistance that would evaluate any changes at the school and village level of the project
interventions. The impact evaluation was to utilize a control group design to estimate the
effects of the CBC and CGs. As stated previously, the original results framework could
have been more focused, and in some instances, could have included more realistic
targets as well as details on the institutional responsibilities for updating indicators.
However, the Bank team took the opportunity to modify the results framework at the time
of the 2010 additional financing, taking into consideration the QSA recommendations,
which was appropriate. The intermediate indicators were linked to the components and
were appropriate to measure intermediate level achievements. The inclusion of the
original impact evaluation was highly relevant and an important design feature for
understanding the effectiveness of project interventions.

31.     Implementation and Utilization. The ECU and MoES/EMIS regularly provided
Bank missions with data and information that allowed teams to make judgments on
progress toward achieving the PDO and the project’s overall implementation. This
information was consistently reported on by the Bank in aide-memoires and
Implementation Status and Results (ISRs) reports. The ECU also monitored the project
outputs and used the information to make the appropriate adjustments in its annual plans
and progress reports. In addition, the project supported the EMIS system, which has had
an impact on monitoring and managing the education system. EMIS data is being used at
the national level as well as the district level. Workshops, using EMIS data, are being
carried out in every district to facilitate school plans. As a result, all districts have
completed plans that identify needs based on enrollment and school data, which was
extracted from EMIS and GIS. This can have long lasting effects in improving the
efficiency in the use of resources, especially schools and teachers, by promoting the use
of data for planning at the district level.




7
 This amount includes exchange rate fluctuations as the total funds at the time of their approval amount to
US$30.7 million equivalent.


                                                    10
32.     The project impact evaluation was carried out during the project period as
originally designed. During the analysis of the data it became evident that, as a result of
the community grant and new school buildings, families sent their children to school. The
value of education was increased and many village chiefs encouraged parents themselves
to obtain a certificate equivalent to level five through non-formal education routes.
Comments made during focus group meetings connected to the assessment also showed
that parent teacher associations (PTAs) became more active. The report considered the
project activities at local levels to have led to significant changes. An independent
beneficiary assessment also showed that with the community grants and the construction
of the new primary schools, there was increased demand for provision of a pre-school to
accommodate younger siblings of primary school pupils and lower secondary school
students.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

33.      Procurement. Procurement was consistently rated satisfactory. Initial delays due
to quality of bidding documents were addressed so that the project was able to carry out
its activities. Procurement plans were prepared and routinely submitted for review by the
Bank, found to be acceptable and used as a basis to judge overall implementation
progress. There was initial confusion regarding which sources of funding to use for a
given procurement package during the time that the project unit increased the number of
projects it managed. However, this confusion was quickly dealt with and the proper
resources were used to process bidding packages and award contracts. Bank supervision
missions carried out ex-post reviews and also confirmed that the project was in
conformity with the project’s and Bank’s procurement rules and guidelines.

34.      Financial Management. Financial management remained moderately
satisfactory throughout the life of the project mainly due to delays in liquidating
outstanding advances, initial delays in submitting unaudited interim financial reports
(IFRs), record keeping challenges and delays in flow of funds to decentralized structures.
However, these challenges did not significantly impact the project’s ability to complete
its activities. Furthermore, the project’s accounting system “ACCPAC” was deemed
satisfactory and able to generate accurate reports, and audit reports consistently issued a
clean opinion throughout the life of the project. Steps taken to increase the flow of funds
and reporting included: (i) increasing the Special Account ceiling in 2007 and again in
2011; (ii) establishing an operating account at the ECU level for small expenditures; and
(iii) intensive technical assistance by the Bank’s financial management team. As a result,
IFR submission significantly improved, disbursements accelerated and outstanding
advances being on track to be fully cleared before the end of the grace period. Going
forward, ACCPAC should be expanded to allow for separate tracking of different sources
of funding and IU expenditures, which would facilitate ECU implementation progress
monitoring and reporting.

35.     Safeguards. Environmental safeguards were rated satisfactory. The project was
rated a category “C”, which did not require a separate Environmental Impact Assessment
to be carried out. Instead, an environmental safeguards analysis was conducted and



                                            11
mitigation measures included in the Operations Manual. The project provided training to
district and provincial level staff in charge of ensuring adherence to safeguards guidelines,
and the project was found to be in compliance. Suggestions for improvements in terms of
school designs were related to reducing risk factors. There is a possibility that some
building material used for classroom ceilings sold to VEDCs might contain asbestos. This
was reported by the ECU based on the realization that such materials resurfaced on the
market and could therefore have been sold to villages for school construction. Given that
many of the building materials were unmarked, the MoES has undertaken a review of the
materials used on each individual school to determine if there is documentary proof that
the material is asbestos free. Thus far, no asbestos cement materials have been found.
There are 68 schools where no photographic proof has been documented to show that the
materials used are asbestos-free. However, MoES has launched the process of testing the
ceiling materials of these schools for asbestos. Should the tests confirm the presence of
asbestos, MoES will either replace the ceiling material or train the community on
asbestos management. This has been deemed as a safe and practical approach by the
safeguards team and the architect assisting the government with quality control.

36.     No major social safeguards issues were encountered during the life of the project.
Rare cases of minor land acquisition were adequately documented and compensation
provided. 8 The project also developed an Ethnic Group Development Plan (EGDP) to
support non-Lao speaking grade 1 students from ethnic villages, which showed positive
results and led to an expansion of the number of schools being covered. Further
accomplishments by the EGDP are discussed under Annex 2. The project also confirmed
that female representation was adhered to with one or two women being part of each
VEDC.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

37.     The community based targeted programs have become the cornerstone of basic
education for the government. The current Global Partnership for Education (GPE)
project (formerly EFA-FTI) incorporated the EDPII community activities. The new IDA-
supported Early Childhood Education (ECE) project, and new GPE project, both
currently under preparation, have also included the community-based programs in the
design. These next operations, which the Bank is working on with MoES, will build on
the success of the EDPII project and will: (i) continue to rely on the cost effective CBC
method for construction of project classrooms in the most disadvantaged districts; (ii)
provide community grants that enable communities, through the VEDCs, to purchase
teaching and learning materials for children; (iii) provide scholarships to minority girls to
become teachers in their villages; (iv) provide health and disability screening for children
ages 3-5 in the poorest villages; and (v) pilot school-based management (SBM) in the
designated 56 disadvantaged districts. The Second Global Partnership for Education
project currently under preparation will include: (i) school based management which

  Although the last aide-memoire makes reference to a household potentially not having been compensated
adequately, it has become apparent that this particular household was not a beneficiary of this project. The
MoES has, however, confirmed that the land was given to the government for the construction of the school.

Grades 1 and 2; (iii) strengthening the capacity within MoES to conduct research
activities and assessment; and (iv) develop school-based financial reporting.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

38.     Relevance of Objectives. The project development objectives were highly
relevant to the country’s sectoral needs when the project was developed. The objectives
fit squarely into the government’s 2020 strategic vision, NPEP, and the Bank’s 2000-
2002 CAS. They shared many common objectives, the most relevant for this project
being universal completion of quality primary education for the poorest. The project
objectives continue to fit into the FY2012-16 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Lao
PDR, which in turn is closely aligned with the 7th National Social and Economic
Development Plan (NSEDP) 2011–2016, in which each have indicated that education is a
national priority and core part of the Government’s overall development strategy, which
has centered on the main objectives of achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) by 2015 and graduating from Least Developed Country status by 2020.

39.      Relevance of Design. The project design was highly relevant and appropriately
aligned with the MoES’s 2020 Strategic Vision and focused on 19 poorest districts,
which was highly relevant for the NPEP. In addition, the project design was simple to
allow for mainstreaming implementation into the MoES’ daily work. The PDO was
appropriate and, again, focused on the poorest districts. The original PDO indicators were
appropriate to measure project impact; however, a sub-set or fewer indicators, as
suggested by the QSA, would have been more appropriate. The PPF grant was important
for ensuring the smooth start-up of project activities for which the design team should be
commended. The inclusion of the assessments, tracer studies of the NUOL graduates and
quality audits of the CBC, again, was a relevant design feature and provided valuable
information on the impact of project activities. The additional financing also used the
opportunity to formally modify the results framework based on the MTR and QSA
advice. The project risks and mitigation measures were also appropriate. The additional
financing used to scale up the project activities was highly relevant. The impact of
continuing the community activities at a pivotal time proved to be important for the
institutionalization of the CBC and CGs. These ideas are now being built on with the
piloting of SBM in the new GPE support education project.

40.      Relevance of Implementation. The relevance of project implementation is
judged to be high. As indicated above, implementation of the majority of project
activities was successful. All project activities for both the original grant and the credit
and the additional financing grant were implemented. Where the MoES and ECU
encountered implementation challenges, such as with the financial management and
quality of construction, they were able to work with Bank staff to find solutions to the
problems and resolve the issues. The lessons learned are now being incorporated into the
ongoing work of the MoES. This is commendable considering the limited experience and



                                            13
knowledge MoES and ECU had with Bank projects and procedures. The project was
consistently rated satisfactory, except in June 2013 and August 2013, when
implementation and progress towards achieving project objectives were rated
moderately satisfactory. The decision to lower the ratings in 2013 was based on the
need for current data for the PDO indicators which was not yet available at the time of
project closing. The data was available during the preparation of the ICR. The last ISR
rated overall implementation as moderately satisfactory because of the difficulties with
financial management, and the Bank team’s cautionary approach regarding the ECU
being able to collect and analyze the final data in time for the ICR. Latest information
available at the time of ICR writing, however, revealed that the ECU: (i) had been able to
clear the project liquidation issues; and (ii) provide the needed data which recorded
current evidence of the project’s final achievements. These were positive developments
and an indication of increased capacity.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

41.     The project development objective was primary enrollment and completion
increased in the 19 poorest districts in the 6 poorest provinces, quality improved, and
capacities strengthened to develop policies and strategies to monitor and manage primary
education. This section evaluates the outcomes against the PAD results framework that
was modified at the MTR and formalized at the time of the additional financing. In
addition, the analysis includes the three PDO level indicators that were added at the time
of the additional financing. More details on project outputs can be found in Annex 2.

42.     Increased enrollment and completion increased was to be measured by the
following PDO indicators: (i) increased enrollment in target districts, (ii) primary
completion rate for the entire country; (iii) gender parity index for the entire country, and
(iv) lowering construction cost to be at par or lower than other schools built with other
sources of funding. There was considerable progress in these PDO level indicators. In
target districts, actual enrollment went from 72,700 in 2005 to 104,205 in 2013
surpassing the target of 95,000. In addition to the increase in actual enrollment, the net
enrollment rate increased from 50 percent in 2005 to 94.4 percent in 2013 with a female
net enrollment rate of 93.6 percent by 2013. 9 Looking at differences in enrollment
between targeted schools and non-targeted schools within targeted districts, the effect of
the rehabilitation/ completion of schools is clear. Enrollment in grade 4 and, especially
grade 5, grew much faster in beneficiary schools than other schools in the same districts
(13 percent vs. 9 percent). Since much of the construction that the project financed went
to complete existing schools that did not have enough classrooms to provide a full cycle



9
  The net enrollment rate indicator (NER) was dropped during the 2010 restructuring because EMIS could
not accurately calculate these enrollment rates due to the fact that, at that time, population numbers were
only projections. Beginning in 2010, the EMIS data collection system was modified to collect population at
the village and school levels, thereby making the NER indicator a valid measure for the purposes of ICR
analysis.



                                                    14
of primary education, it is unlikely that the village children would have been able to
attend schooling in the absence of the project. (See Annex 3 for details.)

43.     The primary completion rate for the entire country increased from 64 percent in
2009 to 92.8 percent in 2013, exceeding the project target of 76 percent. The gender
parity index for the entire country improved from 0.88 in 2009 to 0.95 in 2013 just
missing the target of 0.96. Interestingly, the project districts have a gender parity index of
0.96 in 2013. During the project period, the construction cost for the project schools and
classrooms were consistently lower than those of schools built with other sources of
funding. For example, in 2009 EDPII schools were being constructed for an average cost
of US$94/m2 while schools built with other sources of funds had an average cost of
between US$100 and US$250/m2. (See Table 4 in Annex 3 for the full comparison of
costs.) The other PDO level indicator was increased number of teachers received training
in multi-grade teaching as a percentage of the total number of primary teachers in the
target districts. The percentage of teachers increased from 25 percent to 100 percent
surpassing the target of 47 percent. The MoES was able to accomplish a full 100 percent
by combining support from EDPII and other donor operations. The actual number of
teachers trained was 843, exceeding the original target of 540. In addition, the number of
qualified teachers (i.e. those with 8+3 years of education) in target schools increased
from 67 percent to 80 percent between 2005 and 2013.

44.     Quality improvement was measured by the PDO indicators: (i) System for
Learning Assessment and (ii) improved learning outcomes in rural and ethnic group areas.
The project had a substantial impact on developing a system for learning assessment. The
project supported two rounds of the grade 5 assessments on Lao language, mathematics,
and the “world around us” (i.e. general science studies). The government, and particularly
the Research Institute for Educational Science (RIES), has gained experience in
managing the assessment process, including data gathering, analyzing and reporting.
Experience from the grade 5 assessments also helped inform the development and
administration of the grade 3 assessments under the EFA-FTI project in April 2012,
further improving the relevant assessment tools and strengthening capacity in data
processing. Lastly, experience from the assessments highlighted the opportunities for
closer collaboration between the policy and research centers of the MoES, which the
ministry will take into account when administering the next round of grade 3 assessment.
The experience for EDPII is being used to inform the further expansion of RIES under
the new GPE-supported education project. RIES is looking to refine the purpose and
scope of ASLO Grade 3 and Grade 5 in the context of the early grade reading assessment
(EGRA). RIES is keen to introduce ASLO in a formal way in Grade 3 potentially to help
teachers identify and support students that are falling behind their peers. In the future,
RIES wants ASLO to evolve into a competence-based assessment to monitor the
acquisition of key skills in literacy and numeracy.

45.    Improved learning outcomes in rural and ethnic group’s areas was measured by
conducting a 2006 and 2009 national sample assessment of students outcomes in grade 5
against six skill levels identified in each of the subject areas of Lao language,
mathematics, and world around us. The results from the 2009 assessment were mixed



                                             15
showing that the Lao-Thai ethnic group performed better in all three areas compared to
the other ethnic groups. The Hmong-Mien were second best, especially in mathematics
were the scores were almost identical to the Lao-Thai group. A comparison of the 2006
and 2009 assessments again, show mixed results. In the three areas tested, the results for
the six basic criteria do not necessarily show much improvement. However, a major
contribution of the project has been the considerable capacity building in assessment and
institutionalization of assessment within MoES. (See Annex 3 for details.)

46.     Capacities strengthened to develop policies and strategies to monitor and
manage primary education was measured by the PDO level indicators: (i) increased
education spending of total government expenditure; (ii) increased ratio of recurrent to
capital expenditure; and (iii) policies and strategies increasingly made on the basis of
information. All of these PDO level indictors were met. Lao PDR increased education
spending of total government expenditure from 10 percent in 2005 to 18.6 percent in
2013, surpassing the original target of 15 percent. In addition, the government increased
the ratio of recurrent to capital expenditure from 40:60 in 2005 to 74:26 in 2013, again,
surpassing the target of 70:30. The project supported the establishment of a policy
analysis division within MoES, the Education and Sport Research Center (ESRC), to
manage the ministry’s policy analysis program. This division carried out three research
studies on: (i) education financing; (ii) grade repetition; and (iii) economic relevance of
education, supporting informed policy and sector decision making. In addition, the
project supported the ESRC by training MoES central, district and provincial staff in
action research and research methodologies and conducted rapid assessments on
textbooks.

3.3 Efficiency

47.     The economic analysis shows that the project has achieved its objectives. The
project was also financially sustainable. Enrollment and survival rates in target districts
and schools have increased, more than the national average. The analysis also shows that
this was done in a cost-effective manner, especially the construction through community-
based contracting. The project also supported important reforms and improvements in
capacity: supporting SBM, institutionalizing student learning measurements, improving
the information system and promoting its use for policy making, as well as establishing
an Education Management program at the National University. An ex-post cost-benefit
analysis done for the project shows that the benefits of the project greatly outweigh its
costs. Considering the patterns of enrollment in grades 4 and 5 as shown in Annex 3 and
using a simple assumption that: (i) the project increased educational attainment of
beneficiaries by 1 year; and (ii) the returns to education in these districts are half of the
country average (which is about 10 percent 10), the project investments will bring in more
than US$28 million in income for beneficiaries. (See Annex 3 for full details.)

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

48.      The overall outcome rating of the project is moderately satisfactory. The
relevance of design was high. The design was simple and focused on the government’s
decentralization of education with a recognition of the need to support local communities
for the delivery of education in remote schools. It shifted the orientation of the MoES and
sector to focus on the community and provided a good entry point for a dialogue with
government on the best delivery system of quality education. While the project
preparation dialogue with government took approximately two years, it proved to be
highly beneficial for setting the overall framework for the delivery of education services
at the local level. In that the project was implemented at the community level, it
empowered VEDCs and teachers and presented a marked and positive shift from the
centralized structure of delivery. This community empowerment approach with CBC and
CGs has also become a key feature of ongoing reforms within MoES. The design also
was instrumental in mainstreaming implementation of donor supported projects within
MoES, which has now been institutionalized. The relevance of implementation was high.
While there were challenges during implementation with the quality of the CBC and
financial management, the MoES and ECU, working with the Bank team, have made
considerable modifications to the implementation manuals. They also continued to focus
considerable attention on strengthening capacity at the local levels to ensure quality of
construction and improvements in the financial management system. Efficacy is rated
moderately satisfactory. The PDO indicator achievement along with the recorded
improvements in local VEDC participation in the delivery of education, the
institutionalization of data collection through the EMIS system, and institutionalization of
the ASLO all contribute to the efficacy rating. Finally, the project was implemented
efficiently.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

49.    The project has played an important role in increasing female participation with
the VEDCs. Upon completion of the project 26 percent of VEDCs included female
representatives compared to approximately 13.8 percent at the beginning of the project.


                                                       17
This increase is a reflection of the focus of the VEDC training, which was supported by
the project, on the importance of improving female participation in the local
communities. During the implementation of EDPII the enrollment gap between poor and
non-poor districts were improved from 50:80 to 70:85, and for girls in particular the
enrollment gap between target districts and the national average is now 86:91. With
regard to social development, the same team that developed the Ethnic Group
Development Plan EGDP also, with project support, initiated a pilot to measure the effect
on learning competency of three pedagogical methods of Lao language teaching among
ethic grade 1 students in 12 schools in three districts. Based on observations in the pilot
areas, the project developed a teacher upgrading program for grade 1 teachers to improve
their Lao language teaching. The pilot proved so successful that MoES, with project
support, expanded the new methods to six provinces and began to use the methods to
teach grade 1 mathematics. The MoES continues to expand the use of the methods
developed by the project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

50.     The government has fully embraced the CBC which has now become the norm
for the construction of pre-primary and primary classrooms in rural Lao. The project
helped to institutionalize CGs, which has strengthened the capacity of VEDCs to assist in
the delivery of education services. The success of the CBC and CG activities has now
evolved into implementation of SBM, which will bring together all village level activities
and further strengthen capacity of villages to implement the government’s
decentralization program. The project was also responsible for the establishment of the
education and management bachelor degree program at the National University of Laos.
Since the start of the program in 2006, seven intakes produced a combined total of 295
graduates and a tracer study showed that graduates were entering the civil service as
planned. The advances in the EMIS have increased the amount of data available as well
as the processes for data collection, data entry and verification. Reporting has greatly
improved. Data are collected yearly at the beginning of the school year, and are available
before the end of the natural year. The data are also reported through a variety of formats
including a Statistical Book, a CD, a website and, notably, mobile apps. Another long-
lasting contribution of the project to the quality of the system was the institutionalization
of the ASLO. The availability of learning outcomes data will help MoES and schools
identify strengths and weakness of student competence against curriculum standards.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

51.     An unintended outcome of the distribution of community grants and construction
of primary schools was the demand for provision of pre-schools to accommodate younger
siblings of primary school pupils. This demand has led to an increased focus by MoES on
early childhood education. The challenge for MoES has been that teachers and principals
were not prepared for the number of children wanting to enter pre-school nor did they
have the proper early childhood training. In response to this, and as stated above, the next
IDA-supported project will focus specifically on early childhood education with a focus
on access and training for teachers, principals, parents, and VEDCs.

Not applicable

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

52.     There were four issues identified as risks during the original project preparation
with an overall rating of moderate (formerly referred to as modest). The ratings were
primarily related to barriers to access due to poverty, ethnicity, limited government
resources to hire the needed number of teachers and capacity constraints. The mitigation
measures incorporated in the project, with the relevant targeting, capacity building in
every component and development of the EGDP, were appropriate and ultimately
responsible for ensuring smooth project implementation. The additional financing
identified ten risks that maintained the moderate risk for the project. Again, the ratings
were primarily related to capacity constraints, which were mitigated through continued
training. The additional financing specifically identified financial management as a
substantial risk. However, the introduction of the mitigation measures of having one
bank account, upgrading the accounting software, and increasing staff, the financial
management risk was judged to be moderate. Going forward, the risks identified during
preparation of the new operation should remain moderate given there is increased
capacity within MoES to implement donor supported projects. However, the financial
management risk is likely to be substantial given the increased decentralization of
financial responsibility that will require considerable capacity building at the local level.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

53.     The project preparation team ensured that the project design was closely aligned
with the 2020 strategic vision, NPEP, and the Bank’s 2000-2002 CAS. The design was
simple, the PDO and the results framework were appropriate, albeit lengthy, for
measuring progress toward achieving the PDO. The design took into consideration the
recommendations of the QER, comments from peer reviewers and lessons learned from
other Bank-supported projects. The design team ensured that project management was
structured to operate through the MoES and not an external management unit. This was a
new concept for donor-supported projects in Laos. The design team’s utilization of a PPF
grant helped to ensure a smooth implementation start-up and continued ownership of the
project. The preparation team identified the appropriate risks and incorporated design
features to mitigate them and included the relevant technical specialists to develop the
project. The additional financing phase of the project continued to be closely aligned with
the FY 2012–2016 CPS and the 7th NSEDP 2011–2016. The design team used the
additional financing phase to formally revise the MTR modifications to the results



                                             19
framework, which was based on the Bank QSA. The additional financing did not modify
the original design but added US$15.5 million to scale up activities, which was
appropriate given the growing implementation capacity exhibited by MoES. All-in-all,
the quality at entry for the EDPII project was satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

54.     As previously mentioned, there were 18 Bank review and implementation support
missions which included a mid-term review. The project team was actively engaged in
supporting the government in its efforts to implement the project. Whenever
implementation challenges arose, the Bank team worked with government to find
solutions that would not compromise the integrity of the design. As indicated earlier, the
Bank team worked quickly to resolve the INT case, restructured the results framework at
the time of the additional financing, provided ongoing support for financial management,
and quickly dealt with the quality issues raised with school construction. The supervision
teams consistently reported on financial management and procurement progress during
supervision missions and worked with the ECU team to build their capacity in these areas.
As already indicated, they also systematically documented project progress in aide-
memoires, back-to-office reports and ISRs, all of which kept Bank management informed
of progress and provided the foundation for the ICR analysis.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

55.     Based on the implementation analysis above, overall Bank performance is rated
satisfactory

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

56.      At the time of preparation, the government was fully committed to the project.
MoF and MoES were responsive to the utilization of the PPF grant and sent the formal
request to the Bank with adequate time to utilize the PPF grant during preparation. As
stated previously, this is viewed as being of importance for ensuring the smooth start-up
of the project. MoES agreed and worked with the Bank to design a simple project which
would be relevant to the needs of Lao PDR. All parties actively participated in the project
launch workshop and remained committed to the overall goals of the project. As
mentioned above, MoES has embraced the CBC and CG of the EDPII design and
institutionalized it as the government’s way of delivering pre-primary and primary
education in the most disadvantaged districts.




                                            20
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

57.      The ECU was responsible for coordinating all aspects of implementation. If faced
with implementation challenges, the ECU was able to work effectively with the other
MoES departments and the Bank to resolve them. In addition, the ECU, very early during
implementation, quickly identified the misuse of funds by one district engineer, reported
it to the Bank and resolved the entire issue quickly and to the satisfaction of the Bank’s
INT group. The liquidation of advances was a consistent problem but this was mainly due
to weak capacity at the local level. The ECU continues to work to build local capacity
and improve the liquidation of funds. The project’s procurement performance was also
consistently rated satisfactory due to fact that procurement files were in proper order and
post-reviews revealed that procurement guidelines were followed. Based on these aspects,
the implementation agency performance is rated satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

58.     Based on the implementation analysis above, overall borrower performance is
rated satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

59.      Lesson 1. Decentralization of school construction to remote rural
communities increases ownership and commitment to education. The EDPII project
introduced CBC and CGs which substantially lowered the cost of classroom construction
and led to increased interest in education in the project areas. A beneficiary assessment
showed that parents were more willing to send their children to school when they
participated in the CBC and when CGs were provided for teaching and learning materials.
It also showed that CBC was more effective in the project villages rather than in villages
where the community based activities were mandated by the authorities, donors or
development partners.

60.     Lesson 2. Mainstreaming implementation within government agencies
requires ongoing capacity building. EDPII was the first Bank-supported project that
mainstreamed implementation within MoES. The project supported capacity building
which has led to substantial skills upgrading within MoES for project management. There
are still implementing units within MoES where capacity needs to be strengthened,
particularly in financial management. However, mainstreaming of project management
was institutionalized within MoES during the life of EDPII and is the now the norm for
all donor supported education projects in Lao PDR.

61.     Lesson 3. Strong financial management systems are critical for ensuring the
efficient use and accounting of resources. Lack of a fully functioning financial
management system led to delays in liquidation of advances throughout the project period



                                           21
and reporting delays during the early implementation period. There was substantial
improvement in reporting during the implementation of the project. However, there is
still a need for improvement in the liquidation of advances. The MoES continues to use
technical assistance to support capacity building in this area and follow-on projects
continue to focus on improving the financial management system.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

62.    Initial progress towards achieving project outcome and meeting output targets was
measured by 14 PDO indicators and 19 intermediate indicators. Following the 2007 mid-
term review and the additional financing, the revised results framework included 12 PDO
and 10 intermediate indicators. 11 This annex uses the combined indicators as listed in the
revised results framework to assess output achievements.

Component 1: Increase Access and Completion of Primary Education in the Poorest
Districts (Original grant: US$6.60 million; AusAID funding: approx. AUD 3.28
million 12; and Additional Financing grant: US$10.565 million).

63.     Original component activities: The aim of the original component was to
support three interventions in the 19 poorest districts in six provinces 13 to raise primary
enrollment and completion rates, and reduce repetition and drop out by: (i) piloting a
community-based contracting (CBC) and maintenance program for classroom
construction to provide the physical access to allow incomplete schools to gradually offer
all 5 grades of primary education; (ii) providing community grants (CG) for schooling to
accompany the CBC program to lower the education cost for communities; and (iii)
conducting in-service teacher training to all teachers in participating villages in multi-
grade teaching, and upgrading untrained contract teachers through an in-service
upgrading program. Additional Financing component activities included the scaling up
of the successful CBC and CG programs, expand the multi-grade teacher training as well
as capacity building of VEDC, DEB and PES.

64.     Sub-component 1.1: Community-based Contracting (CBC) for School
Construction. Progress of this sub-component was to be measured by the following
indicators: (i) incomplete dilapidated primary schools replaced to accommodate 5 grades;
(ii) CBC grants distributed equitably (50 percent of schools in ethnic minority villages;
and 50 percent off the road 14 ); and (iii) increased number of classrooms built and
rehabilitated under the project as a percentage of total number of required classrooms at
the primary level in target districts.

65.    The following results have been reached: (i) the end-target for completing 714
dilapidated schools with 2,409 classrooms 15 was exceeded, reaching a combined total of



11
   The indicator “communities receive school grants” was listed as a new indicator in the AF results
framework. This indicator will not be listed separately in this ICR because progress is already being
reported under the original indicator “CG grants awarded to CBC villages”.
12
   The actual amount is AUD 3,276,639.
13
   The target provinces were Phongsaly, Oudomxay, Louangnamtha, Houaphanh, Attapeu and Xekong.
14
   “Off road” is defined as schools not connected to a numbered national road but accessible via informal
roads such as feeder roads to measure school remoteness.
15
   The end-project target of completing dilapidated schools was modified per the April 2007 mid-term
review aide-memoire: MOE decided to reduce the number of schools from 400 to 319 but increase the
number of classrooms from 800 to 957 classrooms. The new overall targets are comprised of 319 schools


                                                   24
781 schools 16 with 2,462 new classrooms; (ii) 82.4 percent of all schools having received
CBC grants are located in ethnic minority villages and 60.6 percent are located “off road,”
exceeding the 50 percent target; and (iii) 102 percent of the required classrooms were
constructed over the life of the project, thereby meeting the end target.

66.     In addition to these achievements, the project piloted the community-based
approach for school construction, the success of which led to additional financing for the
project from AusAID in the amount of AUD 3,276,639 and IDA in the amount of
US$15.5 million equivalent. There is also evidence that CBC was more cost efficient
than classrooms financed by other projects (see Annex 3 for details) as well as effective
in building schools in very remote areas. Net enrollment rates in the target districts have
risen, suggesting a possible positive link between project interventions and net enrollment.
Although school construction activities encountered initial delays due to the novelty of
the CBC approach, measures were taken in 2010 to strengthen local capacity and improve
quality assurance. As a result, weaknesses could and were addressed during
construction 17. The project also conducted a Safety and Quality Audit that was able to
identify schools needing retrofitting or rehabilitation given that some structures dated
back to 2005. This audit was an important aspect of the project implementation for
ensuring the ongoing quality of the school buildings.

67.      School construction under the original project included toilets and water tanks,
which were challenging for communities to build and at times required improvements.
Due to these challenges it was agreed that the UNICEF WASH program would be
responsible for construction of toilets and water tanks under the additional financing
phase of the project. There were delays in the construction of the toilets and water tanks.
However, UNICEF has confirmed that all project schools will receive the required toilets
and water tanks and they are in the process of retrofitting these schools. Capacity
building of PES’ and DEBs was carried out and basic office equipment procured to
facilitate their respective roles in the CBC and CG activities which, in addition to VEDC
training, helped strengthen the foundation for the government’s decentralization agenda.

68.     This component also supported achievement of the project’s objective through
two PDO indicators: (i) lowering construction cost to be at par or lower than other
schools built with other sources of funding, which was met; and (ii) increased enrollment
in target districts, which rose from 72,700 to 104,205. In addition to the increase in actual
enrollments in absolute terms, the net enrollment rate increased from 50 percent in 2004
to 94.4 percent in 2013 with a female net enrollment rate of 93.6 percent by 2013.


(957 classrooms – original project), 125 schools (372 classrooms – AusAID TF) and 270 schools (1,080
classrooms - AF), reaching a new target of 714 schools (2,409 classrooms).
16
   318 schools (953 classrooms) were financed under the original grant, 125 (372 classrooms) with AusAID
funds and 338 (1,137 classrooms) with resources provided under the additional financing.
17
   Steps taken to strengthen the quality assurance process included: (i) updating/clarifying the CBC
operations manual and roles/responsibilities of all actors involved in the quality assurance process; (ii)
increasing the original 3-member VEDC to 5 or 7 members depending on the CBC and CG program
demands; and (iii) strengthening district and provincial education officials in supporting villages during the
construction process and carrying out regular supervision missions.


                                                     25
69.     Sub-component 1.2: Community Grants for Primary Education. Progress of
this sub-component was to be measured by the following indicators: (i) CGs awarded to
CBC villages annually (number of villages; and cumulative grants); (ii) number of
VEDCs established; (iii) percentage of village committees that include representation of
all ethnic groups and women; and (iv) participatory beneficiary assessment carried out.

70.     Achievements under this sub-component included: (i) a total of 1,893 CGs were
provided by project closing, missing the intended target of 2,142 CGs 18 due to initial
construction delays; (ii) 781 VEDCs were established, exceeding the combined target of
714; (iii) 100 percent of VEDCs include one member from all ethnic groups present in a
given village and at least one woman, meeting the end-target; and (iv) an impact
evaluation, which includes a beneficiary assessment, of CG and CBC recipients was
carried out in 2009 and showed an increased interest in pre- and secondary school spaces
as a result of project interventions. The CG program helped reduce the cost of schooling
especially for the poorest by financing school uniforms, school bags, and teaching and
learning materials. A small percentage was set aside to help with school maintenance.
The project also helped train 5,467 VEDC members in the use of CGs and application of
the CBC approach, exceeding the combined target of 2,007. 19 Efforts are being made to
further strengthen VEDC’s participatory approach especially to encourage members not
accustomed to speaking up and ensure their active participation.

71.     An additional outcome was the use of bank accounts to transfer CBC and CG
funds down to the school and village level, which was an innovative project design
feature. This has been repeatedly highlighted by beneficiaries as a major improvement to
previous practices of traveling long distances to collect funds.

72.     Sub-component 1.3: Teacher In-service Upgrading. Progress of this sub-
component was to be measured by the indicator increased number of teachers received
training in multi-grade teaching as a percentage of the total number of primary teachers in
the targeted districts and schools, 20 which was exceeded: 100 percent of the 3,832
teachers in the project areas were trained in multi-grade teaching of which 843 were
supported through the project, surpassing the initial target of 540 teachers. The project
also trained 116 master trainers (11 females) on the use of the new textbooks. The master
trainers trained 4,764 teachers (1,447 females) on how to use the new textbooks and
curriculum for Grades 1-5.




18
   This figure is based on the stated goal to provide 3 rounds of grants to 319 schools under the original
project (i.e. 957 CGs instead of the 1,469 as stated in the original results framework), 270 schools under the
AF (i.e. 810 CGs), and 125 schools constructed with AusAID funds (i.e. 375 CGs).
19
   1,207 villagers under the original project and 800 villagers per the additional financing project paper.
20
   This AF indicator also reports on the original PDO indicator “All teachers in project schools trained in
multi-grade methods” to avoid reporting duplication.


                                                     26
Component 2: Improve the Quality of Primary Education (Original credit: US$2.30
million).

73.     The objectives of this component were to: (i) provide textbooks and teachers’
guides to ensure that teachers and students in grades 1-5 had the required textbooks and
guides, and building MoES capacity to manage the cycle of textbook production and
distribution and (ii) conduct the ASLO to establish a permanent national assessment
system that would develop student assessment instruments to monitor achievement of
basic competencies.

74.     Sub-component 2.1: Textbooks and Teaching Materials. Progress of this sub-
component was to be measured by: (i) primary textbooks procured and delivered to
schools and (ii) teachers’ guides procured and delivered to schools, which were both
exceeded. The project procured and distributed 3,087,000 grade 1–5 textbooks to schools
compared to the target of 2,240,000 textbooks and 300,000 teachers’ guides compared to
the 196,600 target. As mentioned above, the project also supported training of teachers in
the application of these revised learning materials. To ensure sustainability and
replacement of textbooks, the government has used revenues from the Nam Teun II dam
to periodically replace approximately 11 percent of the textbooks to ensure that schools
have an adequate supply.

75.     Sub-component 2.2: Assessment of Student Learning Outcomes. Progress of
this sub-component was to be measured by the PDO indicator System for Learning
Assessment, 21 which was met. The project supported two rounds of the grade 5
assessments on Lao language, mathematics and “world around us” (i.e. general science
studies). The government, and particularly RIES, has gained experience in managing the
assessment process, including data gathering, analyzing and reporting. Experience from
the grade 5 assessments also helped inform the administration of the grade 3 assessments
under the EFA-FTI project in April 2012, further improving the relevant assessment tools
and strengthening capacity in data processing. Lastly, experience from the assessments
highlighted the opportunities for closer collaboration between the policy and research
centers of MoES, which the ministry will capitalize from when administering the next
round of grade 3 assessments.

Component 3: Strengthen Capacities for Policy Analysis and Management (original
credit: US$2 million; original grant: US$1.3 million; additional financing grant:
US$3.575 million 22)

76.     Original component activities: Component 3 aimed to: (i) strengthen policy and
strategy development capacity of MoES to make information-based decisions; (ii)
strengthen information systems for improved collection, analysis, reporting, filing,
storing and maintenance of data and information; (iii) build capacity for better


21
   The original project PDO indicator “improving learning outcomes in rural and ethnic minority areas” will
be reported on under this AF PDO indicator.
22
   US$1.36 million remained unallocated.


                                                    27
management in a broader effort to strengthen capacity in management and
administration; and (iv) finance project management and strengthen capacities in
coordination, procurement and financial management. Additional financing activities
supported the next phase of implementation of these policy reforms to help implement
the ESDF, and modification of project management activities to help MoES move in a
systematic and phased manner towards SWAp implementation.

77.     Sub-component 3.1: Strengthen Policy and Strategy Development. This sub-
component was to be measured by the PDO indicator policies and strategies increasingly
made on the basis of information, which was met. The project supported the
establishment of a policy analysis division within MoES, the Education and Sport
Research Center (ESRC), to manage the ministry’s policy analysis program. This
division has carried out three research studies on: (i) education financing; (ii) grade
repetition; and (iii) economic relevance of education, which supported informed policy
and sector decision making. In addition, the project supported ESRC by training MoES
central, district and provincial staff in action research and research methodologies and
conducted rapid assessments on textbooks. The project also hired a firm to conduct an
impact evaluation of the CBC and CG interventions. The evaluation showed that parents
were more inclined to enroll their children in schools and sought to educate themselves.
ESRC’s capacity to manage education sector issues has been strengthened with five staff
members having pursued Master’s degrees in social science, economics, education,
finance and education management. ESRC was also supporting the development of the
ESDP, which was endorsed by the local education working group, and helped establish a
harmonized approach to investments in the education sector. The endorsement of the
ESDP also helped attract education sector funding, including a US$30 million from EFA-
FTI and AUD 20.26 million in support of the Education for All-Fast Track Initiative
project.

78.     In 2004, MoES established the EGDP to support awareness raising and teacher
training on how to better teach grade 1 ethnic minority students. With project support,
EGDP initially developed teaching and learning materials for teaching Lao language to
non-Lao pupils in 12 pilot schools and trained 221 teachers. Based on positive results
observed, the program was expanded to ultimately cover 48 schools in 6 provinces, train
an additional 253 teachers and develop materials to teach grade 1 mathematics to ethnic
minority students. The project also helped produce and distribute a total of 6,652 manuals
and books, which benefitted a total of 814 students. By project closing, the EGDP team
trained 56 teachers from all 8 teacher colleges, mainstreaming these training modules into
the pre-service teacher training curriculum.

79.      Although GoL PDR did not complete the transition towards a SWAp, it has made
important progress towards a sector-wide support to education. In addition to developing
an ESDF (which ultimately resulted in the ESDP mentioned above), the ESRC and
Faculty of Education initiated a multi-departmental education research support network,
which currently functions on an informal basis but with the intention of being
institutionalized. The government also developed a Medium-Term Strategy and
Performance Improvement Plan (MTSPIP) in 2011 to facilitate using the country’s



                                           28
financial management systems. A manual covering financial management, accounting
and procurement was developed and is currently being revised. Approval of the manual’s
final version is expected soon to allow for its application starting fiscal year 2013-14.
Furthermore, MoES is in process of developing an education sector results-based
monitoring and evaluation matrix. A number of workshops to discuss respective draft
documents have been conducted with an initial focus on developing the matrix for the
pre-primary and primary sub-sector. This matrix is expected to serve as a model for the
expansion to other education sub-sectors. The first draft of the primary and pre-primary
sub-sector matrix was piloted in August 2013 and this activity is being continued under
the EFA-FTI project.

80.     Sub-component 3.2: Strengthen Information Systems. This sub-component
was to be measured by the intermediate indicator, education management information
systems strengthened as evidenced by the publishing of statistics yearbooks, which was
met. The project supported the strengthening of its EMIS system, including the
installation of improved software. Although there were initial delays in setting up the
EMIS, the ministry and international technical assistance were able to overcome these
challenges and improve overall data collection and statistics reporting. Some of the main
achievements include: (i) publishing statistical yearbooks and other education
information online and making them accessible via the web or mobile applications; (ii)
providing education information disaggregated by gender and ethnicity; (iii)
incorporating personnel and financial information down to school levels; and (iv) linking
EMIS data collection and analysis with GIS. The EMIS team has also provided extensive
training at the central, provincial, district and school levels on a range of information
collection, analysis and management aspects, including the use of GIS.

81.     Although requests for ad-hoc information by other MoES divisions have faced
delays in the past, the EMIS team continued to improve data gathering, generation and
dissemination. The activities related to the gathering of GIS data were also delayed. This
was due to the government’s re-drafting of village parameters, which has now been
completed and will allow the EMIS team to start collecting the relevant information. The
project supported the establishment of a “Documents Center” to establish norms and
standards for filing and storing MoES information. Although the EMIS team, which is in
charge of these centers, has routinely uploaded documents since 2006, MoES still needs
to ensure that the appropriate human and financial resources are made available so that
the EMIS team can continue to carry out its mandate.

82.    Sub-component 3.3: Capacity Building for Improved Management. This sub-
component was to be measured by the intermediate indicator, program on education
administration and management established, which was met. The project successfully
supported the FOE at the National University of Laos in establishing a department of
education administration and management (EAM) and developing an EAM bachelor’s
degree program. Since the start of the program in 2006, seven intakes produced a
combined total of 295 graduates. A tracer study on first intake graduates conducted in
2013 showed that of the 41 graduates, 40 were employed as civil servants in the MoES
and one pursued a Master’s degree. EAM has also developed a master’s degree syllabus



                                           29
and started offering weekend classes in 2008. In 2013, NUOL prepared the curriculum
for a full-time master’s degree course, which is currently being considered for approval.
The project also supported 8 NUOL staff pursuing a higher education degree, leading to
three PhD and five master’s degree holders, who were instrumental in helping, develop
the EAM bachelor’s degree program and continue to work closely with the NUOL.

83.     Project Management. The Project Management Unit (PMU), under the guidance
of a steering committee, was tasked with managing project implementation, coordination
of activities with implementing units (IUs), and all fiduciary and safeguards aspects of
project activities. In 2010, the PMU changed its name to “Education Sector Development
Program Coordination Unit (ECU)”. The IUs implemented the aspects of the project for
which they were responsible and the ECU successfully carried out its mandate of
overseeing and monitoring overall project implementation, coordinating with internal
departments such as the departments of finance, planning and inspection, and organizing
joint donor review missions. ECU, along with the IUs, was effective in identifying
implementation challenges and addressing them, and strengthening CBC and CG
implementation oversight despite the remoteness of many project sights. Initial weak
capacity of IUs to carry out advanced planning led to some delays, which were addressed
with targeted and ongoing capacity building. The ECU also regularly collected
performance indicator data and reported on overall progress, and the procurement
management process was consistently rated satisfactory. Although financial management
challenges related to the advance liquidation process persisted, no major irregularities
were          identified        and      all       audits        were       unqualified.




                                           30
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

85.      The economic rationale for this project as stated in the PAD was based on four
objectives: access, quality, efficiency and equity. Based on these objectives, the PAD
reported an approximate Economic Rate of Return greater than 10 percent. However, no
details were given on how it was calculated or under which assumptions due to the fact
that no data were available at the time of preparation to carry out a thorough cost-benefit
analysis. A simple ex-post calculation using recently available data on returns to
education shows that the benefits did indeed outweigh its costs. However, even without
providing a cost-benefit analysis, the economic justification for the project was
straightforward. The standard arguments for investing in education all applied in this case,
such as externalities and constraints in access to capital. Furthermore, the expected
benefits from expanding access and improving quality of education in the poorest
districts in the country (higher productivity, higher wages, and better health) were likely
to outweigh the cost of the project.

86.     The project components were aligned with the PDO, and the target districts were
well defined and justified. The PDO of the project was to increase enrollment and
completion in the 19 poorest districts in the six poorest provinces of the country, as well
as strengthening capacities to plan, budget, manage and monitor results. The six poorest
provinces and, within these, the 19 poorest districts were identified based on the results of
the most recent Lao PDR’s Poverty Assessment at the time. The project 23 deliberately
focused all resources on these 19 poorest districts to address gaps in access to primary
education between these districts and those in other parts of the country. Citing the need
increase survival rates in target districts, the construction component was focused on
completing and rehabilitating existing incomplete schools instead of building new ones.
The quality component focused on providing these schools with improved inputs such as
trained teachers, operational resources, textbooks and community participation. The
quality and capacity building components sought to introduce important long-lasting
reforms.

87.     This economic analysis shows that the project has achieved its objectives. The
project was also financially sustainable. Enrollment in target districts and schools have
increased, more than the national average. The analysis also shows that this was done in a
cost-effective manner, especially the construction through community-based contracting.
The project also supported important reforms and improvements in capacity: supporting
school-based management, institutionalizing student learning measurements (ASLO),
improving the information system and promoting its use for policy making, or
establishing an Education Management program at National University.

88.     This annex explores first the contribution of the project to the PDO, then
discusses the cost-effectiveness of some of the project interventions before looking at its
financial sustainability, including a simple cost-benefit analysis.

89.     Contribution to the PDO. The project contributed to improving access to
education in the targeted districts through a combination of school construction and
rehabilitation, school grants for materials and the provision of textbooks. The project
increased the number of classrooms available in targeted districts by 2,462 classrooms in
781 schools, building or rehabilitating classrooms in almost half of all the schools in the
targeted districts.

90.      This increased access to education has translated into better educational
attainment in these districts. Both enrollment rates and survival rate to grade 5, which
were two of the main objectives of the project, have improved in target districts and have
done so slightly faster than the national average. In EDPII districts, net enrollment rates
increased from 84 to 93 percent, whereas the national average went from 89 to 95 percent.
The difference in the increase in the completion rate was similar. However, while the
differences were small, taking into account that target districts were disadvantaged to
start, converging to the national average should be considered an achievement.

91.      Perhaps a cleaner estimate of the impact of the school construction is to look at
differences in enrollment between targeted schools and non-targeted schools within
targeted districts, especially in grades 4 and 5. When comparing these two groups, the
effect of the rehabilitation/completion of schools is clear. Enrollment in grade 4 and,
especially grade 5 grew much faster in beneficiary schools than other schools in the same
districts, indicating that the completion of the school had an effect on enrollments. Since
much of the construction that the project financed went to complete existing schools that
did not have enough classrooms to provide a full cycle of primary education, it is unlikely
that these children would have been able to attend schooling in the absence of the project.

92.     Construction was not the only input the project provided. In line with existing
evidence of the importance of school-based management and community involvement,
the project provided community grants of 3,000,000 Lak per year for three years to a
number of these schools. As previously mentioned, these grants were provided to the
VEDC’s to buy teaching and learning materials for the school as well as uniforms, pens,
school bags, sports equipment, school maintenance etc. In addition, the project provided
in-service teacher training for teachers in these areas. Overall, the interventions were
designed and implemented as a package of physical infrastructure, materials and teacher
training, which was complemented by institutional changes aimed at increasing
community participation and school management of resources.

**Schools constructed using AusAid funding near the end of EDPII. One round of grants was funded under
EDPII. The final two rounds were paid from the AF budget.

93.     The provision of all this inputs contributed to reducing the cost of attending
school for parents in beneficiary districts. While no data exists on average expenditure
for households in project districts before or after the project, the likelihood that the
project reduced the cost of attending school and therefore facilitating enrollment and
attendance, is high. The construction of new schools and classrooms in existing schools
reduced the transportation cost. The community grants of 3,000,000 LAK per year for
three years were used to offset the previously-mentioned schooling, which
parents/community would normally have to pay. The grants were designed to reduce the
costs to parents and in this they were fundamentally successful. The publishing and
distribution of textbooks and teachers guides also reduced the cost to parents as they did
not have to purchase textbooks.

94.     Beyond the quality improvements and cost reductions for parents that the
provision of inputs brought, the introduction of community grants and community
involvement in managing education funds contributed to setting the foundation for
transforming the way the education system is managed. In line with the decentralization
and community development efforts of the GoL PDR, this project introduced these
community grants and was a precursor to the existing school block grants later introduced
by the government. While still in the early stages, considering existing evidence on
school-based management and the importance of strong community involvement in
school-based management, these institutional changes could potentially have very large
effects in the quality of education in the longer term.

95.     Community-based construction: As shown in Table 4, the average cost of
building per square meter is between a quarter and half less than the cost using traditional,
centralized construction contracts. While the initial limited capacity to supervise
construction resulted in some quality shortcomings, these processes have been greatly
improved. By the end of the project, the quality of the construction was at least as good
as that in other projects that used contractors for construction. Given the considerable
school infrastructure deficits remaining in Laos, the introduction and improvement of this
method will have very significant effects on the capacity of Lao PDR to attain its
ambitious goal of increasing access to education.

96.     EMIS. The advances in the EMIS with the support of the project were impressive.
Not only has the amount of data available through EMIS been increased, but the
processes for data collection, data entry and verification, and reporting have been greatly
improved. Data are collected yearly in the beginning of the school year, and are available
before the end of the natural year. This is an impressive turnover. The data are also
reported through a variety of formats including a Statistical Book, a CD, a website and,
notably, mobile apps. In addition to publishing data, the project supported using EMIS
data at the district level by carrying out workshops in every district to facilitate the
development of school plans at the district level. As mentioned, all districts now have a
completed plan that identifies needs based on enrollment and school data from EMIS
(including GIS). This can have long lasting effects in improving the efficiency in the use
of resources, especially schools and teachers, by promoting the use of data for planning at
the district level.

97.    ASLO. A second long-lasting contribution of the project to the quality of the
system was the institutionalization of the ASLO. During the 2005-10, the ASLO team in
RIES developed the instruments for monitoring achievement of basic competencies,
carrying out a baseline test in Grade 5 in school year 2006/7. A further ASLO test for
Grade 5 was carried out in 2008/9. Used mainly as a diagnostic tool, the use of the results
to design interventions is still a challenge. However, the mere availability of learning
outcome data can potentially bring tremendous benefits to the MoES and to schools,
helping to identify strengths and weakness of student competence against curriculum
standards and designing interventions specific to the learning challenges of different
students.

98.    Quantifying the impact of these institutional changes is not possible, but the
contributions of this project to systemic change are clear. The improvements in data
availability and use, institutionalization of learning outcome assessments, the increase in
community involvement in managing education resources are all characteristics of well-
performing systems. 24

99.     Cost-Benefit. The original economic analysis estimated at approximately 10
percent the IRR of the investment, but no data or methodology were provided for the
calculation. While the institutional investments of the project are hard to quantify, an
attempt is made to provide an ex-post estimate of the cost-benefit analysis of project
interventions. Because of the limitations in analyzing the benefits of institutional reforms,
the focus of this analysis on the effect of increasing access to education will mainly
focused on construction. In terms of benefits, the analysis only considers the income
associated with the increased educational attainment associated with increased enrollment
and completion brought about by the project-supported investments. As for cost, the total
amount of the project is being used to estimate a per student cost based on the number of
beneficiaries in target schools. As a consequence, estimates are probably lower-bound
estimates of the actual benefit of the project, since the social returns to education have
been shown to outweigh private returns. In addition, the cost estimates are likely to be
higher of the per student cost, since we allocate all the cost of the project to the
beneficiaries in schools, whereas institutional reforms affect all students in the country.

100. Even with these conservative assumptions, the ex-post cost-benefit analysis shows
that the benefits of the project greatly outweigh its costs. Considering the patterns of
enrollment in grades 4 and 5 shown in the previous section and using a simple
assumption that: (i) the project increased educational attainment of beneficiaries by 1
year; and (ii) the returns to education in these districts are half of the country average
(which is about 10 percent 25 ), the project will bring in more than US$28 million in
income for beneficiaries which is a very positive return.

101. The project investments were largely financially sustainable and the current
budget trends are a small threat to its sustainability. The financial sustainability of new
projects is an important concern in Lao PDR, considering that recent budget trends have
left very little space for non-wage recurrent costs to be absorbed by the government
budget. Between 2010 and 2012, capital spending has remained relatively constant in real
terms, while salary spending has increased by 150 percent. As a result, by 2012, only 8
percent of the budget was for non-wage recurrent spending. In this context, the
construction of new classrooms invariably leads to increased needs for teachers, and even
though the evidence on enrollment indicates that the new classrooms were well targeted
to schools with enough demand, the current budget situation raises some questions about
the overall sustainability of salary spending.

I.     Main Beneficiaries and Outputs under EDPII

102. The Grant Agreement clearly identified the expected beneficiaries through the
project development objective which was “primary school enrollment and completion
increased in the 19 poorest districts of the six poorest provinces.” The original EDPII
objective and project components as shown below remained unchanged through the
EDPII Additional Funding and reflected the main strategic goals of the Education
Strategic Plan. The project development objective was achieved through the
implementation of three components each of which had their own objective.

103. The project will benefit thousands of primary school students, teachers and
Education staff in the future through a range of interventions at all levels to improve
quality and effectiveness of the education service. In addition to this, the community
construction sub-component has made a significant contribution to enabling equitable
access to education provision at local level and improving school facilities as well as
strengthening responsibility, ownership and understanding of local people for their school
and the community it serves.

Component A: Increase Access and Completion of Primary Education in the
Poorest (19) Districts in six provinces.

104. Community Based Construction. Students, teachers and the community were
the beneficiaries. The activities were: a) construction of schools: from 2005 to February
2010 under component A the project constructed 443 schools (125 funded by AusAID)
comprising 1,325 classrooms (372 funded by AusAID) from a target of 400 school (800
classrooms). The Additional Funding from February 2010 – August 2013 (EDPII- AF)
increased the total number of school constructions by 338 (1137 classrooms) against a
further target of 270 (1080 classrooms).

105. The EDPII +AF combined total number of 781 schools (2,462 classrooms)
against a combined total target of 714 schools (2,409 classrooms) will benefit primary
school children for generations to come by providing the facilities for them to receive a
full five years of primary education and thus enabling them to move on to lower
secondary and at least complete the full nine years of basic education as stated in the
MoES education strategic plan. Regular access to education will in turn give the
opportunity for the community to improve health, business and the resulting reduction in
poverty.

106. Another benefit was that by using community based construction, the project kept
construction costs to a minimum when compared with other methods, while at the same
time encouraging ownership and developing capacity of the community.

107. Community Grants. Students, teachers and the community were beneficiaries of
this activity. Further benefits to the school, teachers and students were provided in the
form of community grants of 3,000,000 Lak per year for three years. These grants


                                           44
enabled the community, through Village Education Development Committees (VEDCs)
to buy teaching and learning materials for the school (e.g. uniforms/ pens/ school bags /
sports equipment, school maintenance). A total of 1,079 community grants were
disbursed during the original EDPII period of 2005 – 10. An additional 814 grant
disbursed through EDPII-AF increased the total number of grants to 1,893 by 2013. The
additional 47 schools constructed at the end of EDPII-AF did not receive a community
grant.

108. Teacher Training. Students and teachers benefited from this activity. Teachers
(and students) also benefited from in service teacher training. During the life of the
EDPII project, 48 Master trainers (4 females) were trained on multi-grade methods. This
benefited 843 (165 female) teachers who, in turn were trained in multi grade teaching,
methods. Training in multi grade methods continued to be funded through EFA-FTI after
2010. It continues to benefit countless teachers and students. A further 116 (11 females)
Master Trainers were trained on use of the new textbooks. This directly benefited 4,764
teachers (1,447 females) who were subsequently trained on how to use the new textbook
and curriculum for Grades 1 – 5. Teacher upgrading during the AF period was funded
through EFA-FTI.

Component B: Improve the Quality of Primary Education.

109. Under component B students and teachers further benefited from delivery of new
textbooks at Grades 1 – 5 together with the corresponding teachers guides. Table 4 below
shows that 3,078,000 textbooks were printed and distributed against a target of
2.24million. 300,000 teacher’s guides were printed and distributed against a target of
196,600.

110. Instruments for monitoring achievement of basic competencies were developed
under this component by the Assessment of Student Outcomes (ASLO) team during 2005
– 10. The baseline test in Grade 5 was carried out in school year 2006/7 and the results
were disseminated in school year 2007/8. A further ASLO test for Grade 5 was carried
out in 2008/9. The results of these tests will be of great benefit to the MoES and to
schools when the strengths and weakness of student competence can be objectively
measured against curriculum standards. The information will lead to more interventions
which can be put in place to increase performance.

Component C. Strengthen Capacities for Policy Analysis and Management.

111. The MoES was the main beneficiary of Component C. The main objective of this
component and its sub-components was to support capacity building of the MoES staff
and leaders to make decisions based on reliable information.

112. EMIS. This designed to strengthen the EMIS function in order to benefit all
departments of the MoES and all Implementing Units (IUs) of the program by providing
timely, accurate statistics and data for effective education management. By 2013 the
EMIS office had supported the production of EduInfo, an easily available database of all
education statistics. It was also engaged in training provincial and district staff on how to
use SPSS for data analysis and how to use the GIS mapping program. These activities
help to strengthen capacity for analysis and management of the MoES staff at all levels
and help them to gather clear information on which to base future planning. Building on
the work funded through EDPII and AF the department is using EFA-FTI funding to
further strengthen the planning process by hiring a consulting firm, “Network Solutions
Services (NSS) Co. Ltd. to make revisions to the EMIS system which will link it to
personnel and finance management information systems

113. ESRC. This unit was originally called the Policy Analysis Division. It then went
on to be called Strategic Research Education Analysis Centre and is currently known as
the Education Strategic Research Centre (ESRC). It was established during EDPII and
conducted three important research studies. These were: (i) financing, (ii) grade
repetition, and (iii) economic relevance. These key research reports and other related
studies were produced as a basis on which to make sector decisions and inform policy.
Research skills were further strengthened by sending five MoES staff on long-term
training to gain Masters Degrees in the following subjects: social science, economics,
education finance, and education management. Increased capacity in research and
education management also has a longer term benefit to the MoES as a whole.

114. NUOL: Staff from the National University of Lao and ultimately their students
have benefited greatly from the Education Administration and Management Program
(sub-component C3). The Department of Education Management and Administration was
established in 2006 funded by EDPII. The new Department offered a Bachelor Degree in
Education Management and Administration. The first intake of students in 2006 included
41 participants of which 13 had just left secondary school. The remaining participants
were serving teachers or administrators. There were three intakes during the life of
EDPII. These were intake (i) 42 trainees; intake (ii) 41 trainees; intake (iii) 50 trainees.
The program was continued under EDPII-AF and intake 7 brought the total number of
lecturers trained to 295. In addition to this, at the start of the program eight NUOL staff
were offered scholarships to study for higher degrees. All of these scholarship
beneficiaries are still working in close association with NUOL and have helped to build
capacity of many others over the years.

115. In 2013, under EDPII-AF the Department of Education Management and
Administration prepared the syllabus for a full time Master’s Degree in Education



                                             46
Management and Administration. It is currently ready for presentation to the academic
board.

116. Ethnic Group Development Plan. More than 117 central, district and provincial
education staff as well as teachers and by association, their countless students in
Oudomxay and Luang Namtha benefited from cultural and gender awareness training in a
workshop to disseminate the positive findings of three different pedagogical methods of
teaching Lao language among ethnic group Grade 1 pupils in Oudomxay province. This
work was continued during EDPII – AF when teaching materials and teacher guides were
piloted and then expanded to other districts.

117. Project management. Under the sub-component on Project Management the
MoES and project staff benefitted from training in procurement, accounting and financial
management.

II.    Key Factors Affecting Performance.

118. On the whole the project experienced very few barriers to achievement of original
goals. However there were areas where the project did not meet the planned levels of
performance. On 2 June 2008, the government accepted a trust fund granted by AusAID.
This included funding to build 127 schools in Component A: Community Based School
Construction. These schools were not in the original target numbers. However two
schools planned to be constructed with AusAID funding were removed from the 127
because the villages where the schools were to be constructed were resettled away from
the designated construction sites. The remaining 125 were all constructed successfully
and were in full use before EDPII was scheduled to finish. Overall the project exceeded
the original target of 670 schools (1880 classrooms) by constructing 781 schools and
2642 classrooms.

119. Delays in reporting in general at central, provincial, district and local level
affected clearance of advances and delays in withdrawal applications. In addition,
planned development of the GIS system was delayed due to the fact that newly
established district borders were not clearly defined. However work started again in May
2013 and was completed by the end of the project. It will eventually be mainstreamed
into the main ESIC work. The Department of Inspection was able to prepare the
monitoring tools without assistance from an international TA and these tools are currently
in the process of gaining MoES approval.




                                           47
III.   Achievement of Overall Project Objectives.

120. This section of the report will summarize the extent to which the project achieved
the objectives.

121. Increased access to 5 years of primary education. Access was increased during
EDPII through construction of 443 schools with 1,325 classrooms. This exceeded the
target of 400 schools with 800 classrooms. EDPII – AF had a target of 270 school
constructions with 1080 classrooms. This too exceeded the target with a total of 338
schools and 1,019 classrooms. This resulted in a combined total of 781 schools with
2,409 classrooms against a combined target of 670 schools with 1,880 classrooms.
Increased access was also evidenced through increases in enrollment which exceeded the
targets. The net enrollment rate in target districts rose from 50 percent to 88.3 percent (86
percent girls) during EDPII and again to 94.4 percent (93.6 percent girls) during EDPII-
AF.

122. Lower costs to parents. Activities carried out by the project aimed at reducing
costs to parents were as follows: (i) construction of additional schools potentially reduced
travel costs; (ii) community grants of 3,000,000 LAK per year for three years were used
to offset various costs of schooling such as school uniforms, books, school bags, teaching
and learning materials for the school, which parents/ community would have been
expected to pay for. The independent beneficiary assessment (Evaluation of Impact of
Community-based Interventions by Madecor Career Systems Inc.) found that in EDPII,
as a result of the community grant and the new school building, every family was obliged
to send their child to school. The value of education was increased and many village
chiefs encourage parents themselves to obtain a certificate equivalent to level Grade
through non- formal education routes. The report considered the project activities at local
level during EDPII to have led to “significant change.” The independent study concluded
that the community grants were “successful and effective.

123. Improved school quality. School quality was improved in a number of ways. In
addition to the replacement/refurbishment of the school buildings and classrooms
themselves, the use of the community grants to buy teaching and learning materials and
the distribution of new textbooks together with teachers guide books, the following
activities also helped to improve the quality of teaching and learning.

124. Teacher Upgrading. (i) 100 percent of the 3832 teachers in the project area
received multi-grade teacher training. 843 of these teachers (165 females) were supported
by EDPII; (ii) 4,764 (1,447 female) teachers were trained in use of the new text books
and teachers guides; (iii) over the life of the project the number of qualified teachers
(those with 8+3 or higher) in target schools rose from 67 percent to 80 percent and finally
to 100 percent by the end of EDPII-AF; (iv) a national assessment of student learning
outcomes was developed and piloted. The learning assessment tests were developed by
teams of specialists from the Assessment of Student Learning Outcomes team (ASLO),
supported by an international consultant, to ensure that the test items measured



                                             48
achievement against the learning outcomes in the curriculum. They were designed to
measure achievement in three subject areas: literacy in Lao language, Mathematics, and
World Around Us. Six skill levels were identified in each of the subject areas under
consideration.

125. The Ethnic Group Development Plan (EGDP). The Ethnic Group development
plan team was formed to carry out research on the quality of teaching Lao language to
Grade 1 children from ethnic groups. The final report completed in 2008/9 showed that
pupils in the pilot schools performed better than the pupils in the non-pilot schools.
Overall, boys scored higher than girls. A survey of the teachers and school principals in
the pilot schools showed that they appreciated the training. They agreed that the new
methods were effective and could be scaled up for use with any ethnic group. The
outcome of the research was used as a basis for expansion of the pilot to 6 provinces and
ultimately 48 schools in EDPII-AF as well as training on teaching and learning in Grade
1 mathematics for ethnic pupils.

126. The main lessons learned from the EGDP team during EDPII were: (i) frequent
follow up was essential to maintain momentum, encourage the teachers and to check on
the learning outcomes; (ii) teacher exchange visits between pilot schools was a cost
effective way of sharing lessons learned and examples of good practice; (iii) the most
effective teaching and learning materials were those which were based on the real life
ethnic diversity of the students; (iv) gender balance was a cross cutting theme in all
training and materials and (v) more research was needed to identify the key issues which
affect the learning outcomes of ethnic pupils.

127. The EGDP main objectives for the work under EDPII-AF were: (i) to expand the
work on teaching Grade 1 language for ethnic group children to five further provinces
covering 840 (416 girls); and (ii) to research the best way to improve learning outcomes
in Grade 1 mathematics for children from ethnic groups. The extension period offered the
team an opportunity to prepare a comprehensive set of teaching and learning materials
and to train teachers on how to use them effectively. 253 teachers (53 female) were
trained during EDPII-AF. By 2012, under EDPII-AF the team had completed a teacher’s
guide for teaching Lao language for Grade 1 for ethnic students as well as games for
teaching Lao language, exercises for beginners in Lao language, a teacher’s guide for
teaching mathematics for Grade 1 and exercises in mathematics. In 2012/13 the team
extended the teacher training of Lao Language at Grade 1 from 12 schools in each of six
provinces (36 schools) to 48 schools in the same 6 provinces, extending the number of
children to 814. During that year 6,652 manuals and books were distributed to teachers
and students in the 48 target schools (36 original schools plus 12 extended schools).

128. In January 2013, the EGDP team shared the assessment results on the pilot
teaching Lao language and mathematics at Grade 1 to 814 ethnic students in 36 schools.
Participants were schools principals, provincial and district PAs, and Grade 1 teachers.
An agreement was made during the workshop that the schools should continue to use this
teaching methodology and the program should expand to the other schools with proper
training and refresher training for the teachers. In July 2013 the EDGP trained a total of



                                           49
56 teachers from the 8 teacher training colleges on how to train pre service teachers to
teach Grade 1 Lao Language and Mathematics to children from Ethnic groups. A further
20 staff from the MoES, and provincial offices also attended (total 76 participants, 38
female). This will assure the sustainability of the program.

129. Key things which contributed to the success of the team activities during EDPII-
AF included: (i) a clear monitoring plan with sufficient budget; (ii) good cooperation
between the staff of the 6 target provinces and staff of the 36 target schools; and (iii) the
increased capacity and experience of the EDGP central team.

130. The main lesson learned by the team under EDPII-AF was that more teacher
training is needed nation-wide to improve the quality of teaching and learning for
children from ethnic groups. The program for teaching Lao language at Grade 1 for
ethnic pupils is now ready for a nation-wide rollout.

131. Lower repetition and higher completion rates. Technically the MoES operates
a system of progressive promotion. This means that only the very poorest performing
students will be required to repeat. These repetition rates are collected by the EMIS team.
At the start of EDPII in 2005 the repetition rate in Grades 1 and 2 in target districts was
40 percent. The target was to reduce repetition in the target districts to 20 percent. At the
end of EDPII repetition was 32 percent in Grade 1 (girls 32.2 percent) and 13.4 percent
(girls 13 percent) in Grade 2. By 2013 under EDPII-AF, repetition had reduced to 22.5
percent (girls 22 percent) in Grade 1 and 9.6 percent (girls 8.8 percent) in Grade 2.
Primary completion rate in target districts was 50 percent in 2005 at the start of the
project. The target for improvement was 70 percent. By the end of EDPII in 2010 actual
achievement was a small increased 54.7 percent overall with 53.9 percent for girls. This
had slightly decreased by 2013 to a total of 51 percent (girls 50.3 percent). These figures
should be seen in a context of increasing enrollment rates and where the gap in net
enrollment rate in target districts compared with national enrolment figures was steadily
reducing. See below for further discussion under “Reduced enrollment gap between poor
and non-poor districts and for ethnic groups”.

132. Village empowerment and support. The project constructed new schools where
VEDCs were established in villages The VEDCs comprised 7 members of the
community, including women, representatives of local ethnic groups, teachers and school
principals. Each project related VEDC had three sub committees. One was responsible
for the management and coordination of all project funded activities in their village. The
second sub-committee was responsible for making an annual development plan for their
school and managing the community grant in accordance with the plan. A third sub-
committee, with support from a district engineer appointed by the project, assisted with
procurement of construction materials and a contractor to build the school. The head of
the VEDC was the legally recognized representative of the village with regard to school
construction. The VEDCs received regular visits from their district engineer during the
school construction phase. From a target to establish 400 VEDCs between 2005 and
2010, the EDPII team established 402 new VEDCs to assist the project implementation at
local level and trained 1,207 villagers to become effective VEDC members. Under



                                             50
EDPII-AF 338 new VEDCs were established and 3,718 villagers were trained to support
the project activities between March 2010 and August 2013 when the project closed.

133. Reduced enrollment gap between poor and non-poor districts and for ethnic
groups. Both EDPII and EDPII-AF were successful in achieving this indicator. In 2005
the baseline was 50:80 with a target of 70:85. The gap had reduced to 88: (girls 86) in
target districts compared with a national average of 93 (girls 91). The gap in enrollment
rates between target districts and national average continued to decrease to 94:96. The
gender gap also reduced. 93:94 in target districts compared with a national average of
96.8:96.

134. Increased public expenditure on education. Under EDPII the target for
increased public expenditure on education was 15 percent against a baseline of 10
percent. However, during EDPII- AF, by school year 2012/13 public expenditure on
education had risen to 18.6 percent.

135. Improved policy analysis. During the life of EDPII a number of key activities
were implemented to improve policy analysis. These included commissioning reports on
financing, grade repetition, economic relevance and research on development of teaching
methodologies to help students from ethnic groups to learn Lao language effectively. A
beneficiary assessment (Evaluation of Impact of Community –based Interventions by
Madecor Career Systems Inc.) and work on the assessment of learning outcomes were
also started during EDPII. The results of these reports and research have been used to
improve policy analysis. A summary of the findings from the work of the EGDP is
included in the section on improving school quality.

136. The Education Statistics and Information Centre (ESITC) was established in
2007. It was originally known as the Statistics and Information Technology Division
(SITD) but later changed its name to the Education Statistics Technology and
Information Centre. (ESTIC) A documentation centre was established in 2008. The
Centre was originally designed to be a resource for MoES staff and others to access
published information on the work of the MoES. However, development of the MoES
website and further strengthening of the EMIS means that the role of the documentation
Centre is becoming integrated into the work of the ESIC. The EMIS IU was divided into
two main activities. One was tasked with implementing improvements and extensions to
the function of EMIS, the second was responsible for developing the Geographic
Information System (GIS) as well as establishment and maintenance of the
Documentation Centre. In 2006, the Bank used its own budget to carry out a stocktaking
and diagnostics study of the EMIS system, supported by an international consultant. The
study was designed to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the EMIS system. It was
completed by April 2007 and the MoES agreed to work towards integrating EMIS
information throughout the MoES to enable it to produce sector wide reports. This was
further strengthened during EDPII and to date the EMIS team has strong capacity to
provide a wide range of basic information and statistics. It is currently providing valuable
training to provincial and district staff on using GIS and analysis of SPSS data to identify
needs and solve problems. This together with the EMIS system expansion is detailed in



                                            51
the section above on component C beneficiaries. Despite these crucial achievements there
is still a need for further development to enable IUs to obtain timely information as a
basis for monitoring, evaluation and decision making.

137. Project Management. Key Activities carried out across EDPII and EDPII-AF
carried out were: (i) established a project working group and monthly meeting schedule
comprising IU heads, chaired by the Project Director; (ii) maintained positive and
productive relations with the World Bank, and other development partners; (iii)
developed capacity of MoES central staff in the IU’s to clearly manage and implement
their EDPII and AF activities in accordance with the agreed development objectives; (iv)
maintained a clear overview of disbursement and encouraged IU’s to complete their
planned activities and budgets in a timely manner while paying attention to potential
impact on achievement of project goals; (v) operated within a framework of good
governance to ensure transparency and accountability; (vi) encouraged and where
possible, facilitated and enabled synergy between different areas of the project, especially
with Community Construction and Community Grants; (vii) held regular meetings with
the Steering Committee to monitor progress and find solutions to project issues; (ix)
monitored timely implementation of the procurement plan (x) created a small but
effective management team with clearly delegated responsibilities within the ECU to
support and monitor timely implementation of IU activities across EDPII-AF and the
EFA- FTI program; and (xi) ensured that Project Audit reports were submitted on time
and were unqualified.

138. Procurement. Throughout the life of both EDPII and EDPII-AF .the project has
encountered no significant procurement issues and procurement has been rated as
satisfactory throughout the project.

139. Financial Management. A project financial management manual was approved
by the Bank at the start of EDPII and is the foundation of financial management for the
project. The first quarterly Financial Management Report (FMR’s) using the standard
tables set out in the Financial Management manual was approved as satisfactory by the
Bank and subsequent FMR’s have all been submitted on time. The reports have
encountered issues of variable quality throughout the project lifetime, particularly in the
area of matching the physical progress report with expenditure There is still more work
needed to ensure that correct financial information is provided to the ECU on a timely
basis In part the problems are due to working within the government system which can be
time consuming given the number of departments involved in the process. Disbursement
was slow at the start of the project but has increased steadily over the years.

140. Female Representation. By the end of EDPII 26 percent of VEDCs (against a
baseline of 13.8 percent) included female representatives. Learning achievement and
completion rates of girls in target districts were similar to those of boys.

141. Representation from Ethnic Groups. There are approximately 49 different
ethnic groups with four basically different language groups, living in Lao PDR. These are
Lao-Thai aprox. 66 percent; Mon-Khmer aprox. 24 percent; Hmomg-Mien aprox, 8



                                            52
percent; Sino-Tibetan including Chinese Ho and Tibeto-Burnam aprox. 3 percent.
Approximately 80 percent of the population of Project target villages were from at least
four of the country’s ethnic groups. These were Mon-Khmer, Hmong-Mien, Tai-Kadai
and Sino-Tibetan. Therefore, all project activities and results can be seen within the
framework of supporting capacity development and encouraging demand- led initiatives
from non –Lao ethnic groups.

Sustainability.

142. Component A1. School construction is a totally sustainable activity which will
benefit countless numbers of children over the coming years.

143. Component A2.1. Community Grants in themselves are not sustainable as
villages receive only 3 rounds of community grant. However the community grants have
been moved in to the government “Block Grants” program and are therefore sustainable.
The training received by the VEDC’s and the experience they have gained in managing
the Grants mean that they will be better equipped to manage the government Block
Grants in the future.

144. Component C1. The work of the Ethnic Development Group on development of
teaching materials and strategies for teaching Laos Language Grade 1 children from
Ethnic Groups is sustainable since it is becoming mainstreamed.
145. Component C2.1. Training in the use of GIS for school mapping at District and
Province level will be sustainable in that, over time, it will result in clear information on
the location of schools and their distances from local landmarks. This will enable the
MoES to more accurately plan the national school construction strategy in the coming
years.

146. Component C2.2. Data analysis using SPSS training for technical staff from
MoES is a sustainable activity as it will develop the MoES staff capacity to analyze the
data collected from the provinces and elsewhere. This will enable more effective results
based management and decision making.

147. Component C3. The establishment of a full-time Master’s Degree in Education
Management and Administration at NUOL will be a valuable addition to the mainstream
portfolio of the Education Management and Administration Department within the
NUOL and contribute to long term quality improvement of Education Management and
Administration nation -wide over the coming years.

148. Long Term training of seven MoES staff. This will result in sustainable long
term benefit to the MoES. In addition to increasing the number of internationally trained
staff in the MoES, these staff will share their knowledge and skills, thus contributing to
overall institutional development.

Lessons learned

149. Quality improvement and community based interventions have resulted in a
significant rise in enrollment and completion over the life of EDPII and EDPII- AF. This
has led to demand for a program to expand access to lower secondary education and
number of trained teachers.

150. Community based construction and incentives are used more effectively in
villages where social cohesion is already strong rather than in villages where the
community based activities are mandated by the authorities, donors or development
partners.

151. Monitoring and Evaluation capacity within the IU’s was adequate. More focus
and training on M+E is needed in the future.

152. Given the difficulties in ensuring quality of construction, especially when using
the community construction procurement method, the CBC team, ECDM, ECU and
other stakeholders should work together to further strengthen reporting on quality
monitoring.

Key enabling factors

153. The majority of the target villages which received the community grants had
previous experience of working with International projects through e.g.; Unicef, WFP,
EU, GTZ, UNDP. This helped them to more quickly understand the processes they
needed to follow for CBC and community grants.

154. The final Independent Impact Evaluation of Community Based Interventions (by
Madecor Career Systems Inc.) stated that achievement of project objectives at local level
was strengthened because of the close link with government and the support of the
District Education staff who were regularly monitoring progress.

155. At central level there was a strong, permanent management/ coordination team
with oversight of all activities. Central level staff from the PMU/ECU and the IU’s made
frequent visits to the project sites to gain a full picture of the real situation on which to
base management / implementation decisions.

156. The World Bank, AusAID and other development partner staff provided advice
and support where needed. They made regular visits to the project sites in the provinces
to clearly understand the issues.

157. Conclusion. The EDPII and EDPII – AF successfully achieved the majority of
the performance indicators. Teacher training and school construction exceeded targets.

158. The key factors which contributed to the success of EDPII and EDPII-AF
were: (i) excellent leadership and management both from the MoES Management Team



                                             54
and the World Bank Management Team; (ii) a country context where the development
partners and MoES work positively to create a clear strategic plan, clear development
goals and a policy monitoring framework against which to monitor achievements; (iii) an
environment where communities support and embrace the development of education
provision; and (iv) finally, of these factors the first is the most important--a good leader
makes sure that everyone understands the issues, works towards achievement of common
goals, is not afraid to admit to problems and motivates staff to find positive ways to solve
them. The program was very fortunate to have these in both the Program Director and the
Task Team Leader.
