PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KENYA
FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT (LOAN 1680-KE)
PREEACE
This  is  the  Project  Completion  Report   (PCR)  for  the  First
Telecommunications Project in Kenya, for which Loan 1680-KE in the amount of
US$20 million was approved in March 1979. The loan became effective in August
1979 and was closed in June 1984, one year behind schedule.
The PCR was prepared by the Industry and Energy Operations Division,
Eastern Africa Department of the Africa Regional Office, based inter alia on tha
Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan and Guarantee Agreements; supervision reports;
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments but none were received.

PROJ?CT COt4PLTION REPORT
UNY
FIRST TELECMMIUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 1680-KE!
EVALUANTION SUMHARX
1.       The Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC) was
established Ln 1977 following the breakup of the East African Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (EAPTC), and is responsible for the
provision of all domestic and international postal and telecommunications
services in Kenya. The Government of Kenya requested Bank assistance in
financing KPTC's first fve-year telecommunications development program
(1979-1983) in 1973.
2.       The First TelecommunIcations Project supported this program which
was designed to alleviate serIous disruptions in planning and investments
ia the sector caused by the breakup of EAPTC. The objectives of the
program were to extend local services and high quality long distance
circuits using the latest available techniques, and further to concentrate
cn providing basic telecommunications facilities to rural areas which were
poorly served. The project also focused on Lastitution building by
improving KPTC management procedures and its financial management
capabilities.
3.       The loan for $20 million became effective on August 16, 1979, and
was closed on June 30, 1984. The project completion slipped by one year
to December 31, 1984 which was mainly due to startup delays at the
procurement stage. KPTC substantially achieved its objectives, and its
performance was satisfactory considering that the project was the first
major task for the newly established KPTC. However, the target for
connecting new subscribers has not been met (only 39,202 against 65,000),
due to insufficient availability of line materials and subscriber plant
equipment, a consequence of:
a)   import and foreign exchange restrictIons; and
b)   weak store management and organizatioa of outside plant
installation works.
4.       The financial performance of KPTC was satisfactory, and covenants
an rate of return and debt service coverage were met throughout the project
period. The economic rate of recurn for the project has been estimated at
30Z, compared to the appraIsal estimate of 50%.



- iii -
5.       The project has assisted KPTC Co Lmprove its accounting        -
procedures. It has also supported a decentralization of the organization,
establishment of a corporate planning department, and transfer of
responsibilities for project planning and execution to the Deputy Managing
Director. The Incorporation of KENEXTEL (Kenya External Telecommunications
Company LiOeted) into KPTC in 1982 , which resulted in the complete
consolidation of teleCommunications services of the country into one
entity, was also advantageous.   Overstaffing of KPTC remained a problem
and escalated by merger of KENEXTEL at the completion of the first project,
but Is expected to be resolved during the on-golng second antd third
projects.
6.       The lesson to be learned is that a more comprehensive list of
performance Indicator targets covering project Implementation progress,
quality of service, operational efficiency, and outstanding arrears should
have been discussed and determined at the time of negotiation to monitor
the project thoroughly.
7.       As a result of this project, KPTC developed experience and is
better equipped to deal with further expansion of telecommunications
services to meet the country's needs in this sector.  The Bank has
continued to assist KPTC by participation in KPTC's second and third
projects. Under these projects, the lessons in 6 above have been well
followed up.



pRQJECT CoMPLnION REPORT
FIRST TELECOIM UICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 1680-RIB)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Kenya.Posts and Telecom3unicat0ans Corporation (KPTC), an
autonomous governmant-oumed entity established it 1977 following the
breakup of the East African Posts and Telecommunicatiots Corporation
(EAPTC), is responsibla for the provision of all domastic and international
postal and telecommunications services in Kenya.  Tha Bank Loan 1680-KE for
US$ 20 million was the first loan to the t'slecommunications sector In Kenya
aftAr the breakup of EAPTC. (The Bank had extended three loans, 483-EA
675-EA, 914-EA to the EAPTC amounting to a total of US$56 million).
sI. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Frearation ADOraisal and Nerotiatilons
2.01     KPTC prepared a fIve-year telecom-taications development program
(1979-83) to alleviate deficiencies in the sector, a Tesult of insufficient
Investments in the past and of disruptions in planning and investmeant after
tha breakup of EAPTC. The Government asked the Bank to participate in the
financing of this program, and a Bank identification mission visited Kezya
In May 1978. Subsequently, appraisal took place in September 1978.  The
amount of the loan proposed was $20 millIon.
2.02     Negotiations were held between January 22 and 26, 1979.  The
Bank's Board approved the loan on March 29, 1979. The loan agreement was
siSged on April 11, 1979 and became effective August 16, 1979.
2.03     Through loan approval, no major project issue was raised, although
KPTC's weak financial reporting system and its unclear relationship with
Kenya External Telecommunications Company (KENEXTEL), both of which were
partly caused by the breakup of EAPTC, were brought to attention of the
Kenyan delegation.
Proiect Objective
2.04     Under the project, KE-TC was to extend local atd long d'stance
,services using the latest available techniques and further to give
licreased attention to providing basic telecommunications facilities to
rural areas which were poorly served. These sector objectives were to be
met by:
(a) expanding local networks in Nairobi;
(b) expanding access to telephona service in rural accrs by lncrasing
capacLty of small exchanges and opening of new public call offlces
in rural communitles;



-2-
(c) improving the quality of local service;
(e) impcoving KPTC management procedures and f!nancial management.
capabilities.
(d) upgrading and expandin7 the long distance netwock to handle
additional demand for traffic; and
The Project
2.05 The project was a high priority self-contained part of KPTC's 1979-83
program and consisted of the followin&:
(a) a total of about 65,000 additional lines of local automatic
exchange equipment with associated cables and subscribers line
plant and a total of about 46,000 additional connections;
(b) long distance public call offices to provide services in about 200
urban, rural and market centers then without service;
(c) eight microwave radio systems, three UHF radio systems, a number
of VHF systems providing a total of 190 channels, and multiplex
equipment to accommodate about 3,100 additional channels on these
systems;
(d) eleven long distance automatic exchanges with a total of about
3,600 terminations and extensions to existing such exchanges by a
total of about 1,800 terminations; and
Ce) buildings to house equipment.
Eut, there was no specific component for institutional building despite the
project objective(e) (para 2.04).
Covenants
2.06     The loan agreement required the Government to undertake a review
to define the relationship between KPTC and KENEXTEL, work out an agreement
which should govern the allocation of revenues in respect of external
telecommunications services between these agencies and submit the result of
the review to the Bank for comments by June 30, 1980 (Section 4.02). The
review was completed in June 1981 with one year delay. Following Bank's
comments KENEXTEL was integrated into KPTC in July 1982.



-3-
2.07     The project agreement required thatt KPTC should:
(a) retain nct later than December 31, 1979, a financial aidviser, whose
qualifications, experienze, and terms of reference were
satisfactocy to the Bank, to review existing accounting routines
and assist In the implementation  ' new routines when necessary
(Section 2.02);
(b) maintain recocds identifying goods financed by the project and
furnish progress reports (Section 2.0Sb);
(c) furnish project completion report not later than six months after
the closing date (Section 2.05c);
fd) have its accounts audited by an independent auditor and furnish
the 22duk with copies of accounts and auditors' report within six
months of the end of each financial year (Section 4.02a);
(e) not use telecommunications revenues for purposes other than
telecommunications development and operations unless these
revenues were in excess of such requirements (Section 4.03);
(f) not incur long-term debt without prior approval by the Bank,
unless KPTC's internal cash generation in the preceding 12 months
would cover maximum future debt service at least 1.5 times
(Section 4.04);
(g) maintain tariffs at levels sufficient to achieve at least 10% rate
of return or revalued average net fixed assets in operation
(Section 4.05a):
(h) revalue the book value of its fixed telecommunications assets as
at December 31, 1979, and annually thereafter, on the basi's of
sound and consistently maintaIned methods acceptable to the Bank
(Sertion 4.05); and
(I) furnish to the Bank for comments the result of a study on the
tariff structure before December 31, 1979 (Section 4.06).
2.08     Details of the compliance with these covenants is at Annex 1.
KPTC has complied with the financial covenants in paras (f) and (g) above.
Requirements under paras (a), (c), and (i) were met with delays.  Progress
reports and audited financial statements have always been submitted late
(paras (b), (d)]. Revaluation of assets (para Ch)] had not been done by
the end of 1984 pending final agreement on the division of EAPTC assets and
liabilities, which was reached in 1984. Para (e) has not been complied
with, because the pcof'table telecommunIcations services have ccntiaued to



-4-
fin'ance the steadily increasing deficits incurred b) the postal operatioas
pince 1978. Between 1979 and 1983 the fLnancial support rendered by the
telecommunication services to the postal services amounted to K Sh 230
million. However, a postal tariff increase effective January 1, 1985 is'
expected to allow the postal operations to decrease its deficits
substantLally in the next few years.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-uo 
3.01     The loan became effective August 16, 1979, only a month later than
envisaged at appraisal. The signing of a subsldiery loan agreement,
satisfactocy to the Bank, between the Government and KPTC was a condition
of effectiveness.
3.02     On loan effectiveness KPTC engaged a firm .o assist in preparing
and issuing bid documents and technical specifications for procurement of
Bank financed goods, as well as in bid evaluation and contract preparation.
ProJect Revision
3.03     There was no project revision.
Implementation Schedule
3.04     The project completion date envisaged at appraisal was December
31, 1983. This date slipped by about one year due to start up delays in
procurement and delays in civil works. After KPTC had retained an
engineering consulting firm to assist in the bidding process, KPTC managed
to avoid further substant4lal delays.
Reporting
3.05     KPTC prepared quarterly progress reports for January/March 1980
onwards. Those reports were generally satisfactory, though they were often
late. A draft completion report was furnished to the Bank in June 1985.
Submission of audited financial statements was delayed throughout.
Procurement
3.06     Procurement presented no major problems except initial delays at
the bid preparation stage due to delayed appointment of consultants. The
consultant flrm carcred out its work satisfactorily.  Details of the
procurement processes are shown at Annex 2. Contracts for all Bank
financed items had bee: signed by March 1981, 15 months after the appraisal
schedule.

I/ Loan No. KE-P5
208      At appraisal, Government was expected to provide KPTC with US$22.9
million equivalent in foreign exchange; this was supposed to come either
from Government's own resources or through additional financing from
external sources. An OECF loan of US$22 million equivalent was obtained
for the purpose.

Due to the devaluation of the Kenyan Shilling the comparison is made in
equivalent US dollars. The revised foreign cost in USS equivalent is about
3% lower than the appraisal estimate whereas the local cost is about 62.9%
higher when counted in KSh and about 9.7% higher when computed into USS.

The cost overrun of the local components was primarily due to the fact that
She cost of buildlngs (Including access roads) were moce than tripled
Lecuse of the local iaflation.   Counted in USS, the actual total cost Is
almost the same as the appraisal estimate.
Disbursements
3.10     The estimated and actual annual cumulative disbursements of the
loan are as follows:

1/ The revised closing date of the loan was June 30, 1984.  Minor committed
payments were made until December 31, 1984, when $19.80 million had been
disbursed. The remaining amount of the loan, $0.20, has been cancelled.
The slow disbursement of the loan during 1980 and 1981 was caused by deldys
in the Initial procurement process.   However, by March 1981 contracts for
all Bank finAnced items had been signed, and the loan had been fully
committed.

l/ Included in Category 1.
In February 1980, KPTC and Ministry of Finance requested that a new
category, Consultant Services, be inserted and the Bank approved it in May
1980. In April 1983, the Ministry of Finance requested another
reallocation of funds among different categories, but in June 1983 the Bank
was advised that the reallocation could be deferred. Apparently no further
action has been taken on thls matter on either side. Meanwhile, the actual
disbursements have been made as shown in Table 3.3.
Implementation
3.12     For major switchlng and transmission contracts, equipment was
installed by the suppliers, and was subject to one year guarantee after
commissioning. For rural telephony, cable networks and subscriber plants,
installation was made by KPTC staff, in some cases under suppliar
supervision. The equipment performance has been satisfactory.



Performance of Consultants. Contractors, Suppliers. and Borrower.
S.13     A consultancy firm was retained to assist KPTC in facilitating the
pcocurement of equipment. Its performance was satisfactory.
3.14     At negotiations, it was agreed that a financial advisor be
retained to assist KPTC in reviewing its accounting procedures and in
implementing new procedures. The expert was employed In August 1980 for
two years and his performance was satisfactocy. Thus KPTC's accounting has
improved substant'ally.
3.15     The performance of suppl6ers and contractors was satisfactory.
3.16     With the exception of a one year slippage due to delays in the
initial bidding stage and significant delays in connection of new
subscribers due to poor initial plannIng, KPTC performed well in the
project implementation.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01     During project implementation, connection of new customers has
been behind the schedule. In December 1978, KPTC had an installed exchange
capacity of 98,317 exchange lines (automatic 83,574; manual 14,743). By
the end of 1984, the capacity was 157,462 exchenge lines (automatic
131,592; manual 25,870), which exceeded the project target by 8%. However,
the rate of connection of new subscribers has been lower than expected at
appraisal, though it has been improving. At appraisal, the number of DELs
was forecasted to be 131,884 at the end of 1984, but the actual number was
106,146 or 20% below the target. The estimated and actual exchange
capacity and connected lines are at Annex 4.
4.02     Within the project, subscriber trunk dialling  service was
introduced in 11 additional long distance exchanges or group switching
centers.  In addttion, the interconnecting trunk routes were upgraded to
high quality microwave radio systems. Expansions were carried out on
existing microwave radio trunk routes by the provision of multiplex
equipment. The automation of most of the trunk switchIng centers has
moreover enabled the introduction of international subscriber dialling in
most switching centers in the network.
4.03     Quality of local telephone service is fair with the call
completion rate averaging 45% for 1984 in the major cities compared to at
least 75% typical of good local networks. The low completion rate results
from higher traffic per DEL than planned and KPTC's inability to meet
demand for more DELs from bus$ness subscribers. A high ratio of faulty
lines contribute also to the inadequacy of the service. The number of
faults average 1.2 per telephone per annum (a reasonable target would be



- 10 -
0.5), and or&ly about 30X of the faults were cleared the same day (1984).
FPTC's networks show thus a scope for improvement in maintenance of cable
networks and subscriber plant as well as in the quality of repairs.
Measures for the relevant improvements are included in the ongoing seqond
and third projects..

2/ As per Bank's estimate in SAP, 5517-KE for the Third Project. Revaluation
of assets has not been undertaken (see paras 2.08, 6.07).
5.02     For 1979 and 1980, operating revenues were the same as those
projected at apprdisal despite coanection delays, but the connection delays
caused lower revenues for 1981 and 1982 in spite of a significant tariff
increase implemented !a April 1982.  The sharp increase in revenues in 1983



- 11 -
resulted from (l) KPTC's taking over of KENEXTEL, whose accounts were
pcluded ia those of KPTC as from 1983; (ii) the full effect of the tariff
Lcrease in 1982.. If KENEXTEL's revenues of KSh 200 million (1983) are
excluded, the actual revenues would be lower than estimated at appraisal
by about KSh 80 million (oL by 9%) ma±nly due to delayed connection o£ new
customers and to lower telex revenues than forecasted (1983 telex revenues:
appraisal KSh 236 million vs actual KSh 133 million). The decline in telex
traffic is primarily because of the slowdown of the economic and business
activities of Kenya.
5.03     The operating ratio was approximately the same as expected at
appraisal. The rate of return (both computed on book value of assets and
on a revalued basis) was satisfactory and has been at or above the
covenanted level of 10% although lower than anticipated. The rate of
return on revalued assets (Bank's estimate) has also declined from 15% in
1979 to 10% in 1983. The lower return is due to:
(a) delays in connection of new subscribers which have limited the
revenue generation potential of the plant;
(b) cost increase from both inflation and unwarranted staff expansion;
and
(c)  the higher KSh value of assets due to KSh's successive devaluation
against fore'gn currencies in which a substantial part of  KPTC's
fixed assets were procured. This situation was not compensated
fully by tariff increases.
5.04     Operating costs (before interest, depreciation) and operating
revenue per DEL have been calculated at constant prices to measure the
efficiency of KPTC.

5.05     Figures in Table 5.2 are not completely comparable due to
different treatment of international services for revetue and cost.
Revenue per DEL cont'nued to fall until 1982 in spite of tariff increases
in April 1982. The recovery in 1983 was mainly due to the incorpoLItion
of KENEXTEL. Operating cost per DEL has been on a downward trend up to
1982, and increased slightly in 1983. The greater fall of revenue than
cost is due to the connection of customers with less traffic than existing
ones, as the access increases, and to the decrease in utilization in
connected lines as additional lines become available. It resulted in
continuous decrease of net operating revenue until 1983.

1/ Book Value.
5.07     KPTC's financial position has been satisfactory.  Net fixed assets
in operation per DEL are higher due to continued devaluation of KSh against
foreign currencies as discussed previously and connection delays. Current
ratio gives an impression that the peformance was better than expected at
appraisal. However, this is not necessarily true, because the actual
current assets in 1982 include KSh 265 million of transfer to
postal services (KSh 58 million at appraisal) and 131 days of receivables
(91 days at apprdisal) and a substantial portion of both assets lacks
short-term solvency.
5.08     The appraisal estimate of 91 days of receivables could not be
attained; the actual figure for 1978 was 136 days and the average for
1979-82 was 131 days (1983 is not comparable due to the consolidation of
inland and international accounts).  A performance indicator for measuring
collection efficiency was not established at appraisal, and this issue was
not addressed during supervision.

5.10     Appraisal and actual performance is comparable for 1979-82, but
not for 1983 due to the consolidation of KPTC's and KENEXTEL's accounts as
from that year. Both debt service ratio and net internal cash generation
ratio are satisfactocy, though these ratios are lower than expected. Lower
'ratios are due to devaluation of the KSh which has resulted i: a higher
amount of borrowing and debt service when counted in KSh. Changes in
capital are the results of foreign exchange losses adjustment (1979-82) and
the taking over by KPTC of KENEXTEL (1983). During the project period, the
Government has not provided any additional equity fund to KPTC as expected.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organizatioa and Management
6.01     KPTC was formed in 1977 as an autonomous government-owned
corporation supervised by the Ministry of Power and Communications. In
1980, KPTC decentralized its structure and functions to facilitate the
implementation of the project and network expansion. Briefly, the
structural changes involved the following:
(a) main function of headquarters would be to formulate policy, to
direct matters affecting planning and procedures, and to act
generally as aa advisory and moan'coring body. The headquarters
has now six departments responsible for telecommunications, postal
services, finance and accounts, personael aad training, buildings,
and corporate planning;
(b) establishment of five regions, each under a regional manager
responsible to the managing director for policy matters and to the
relevant departmental head for functional matters. The regional
managers control all staff posted to the regions, and all
operational matters, and have suitably delegated powers; and
(c) creation of a department responsible for corporate planning and
programming, computer services, management information services,
international relations, and organization and methods.
At the same time, at the Bank's suggestion, KPTC transfered
responsibilities of the project planning and execution from the Director of
Telecommunications (DT), to the Deputy Managing Director (DMD), who had
considerable experience in Bank financed project execution from the time he
was in charge of the execution of telecommunIcations pcojects In the
Eastern African Community (para 1.01).   The change has enabled: (i) DT to
concentrate on maintenance and operation, and (i') DMD to be more actively
involved in resource coordination and programming for project execution.
With these structural changes having been effected, the efficiency of the
organization as well as overall control of the project has improved.
6.02     The Managing Directoc of KPTC since August 1979 was alert to the
requirements of the organIzation and has delegated powers suitably, which
has led to significant operational improvements.
6.03     However, as telecommunIcations services expanded, there was a
continuing need to redssess organizational structurA and procedures, as
well as KPTC's need :"  sigaificantly upgrade its capabilities to deal with
the increased scale a-.d complexity of service improvement and expansion.

Management consultants will be provided under the third project.
gtaffing, Recruitment and Training
6.04     Staff details of KPTC are at Annex 8.  At the ead of 1979, KPTC
had 4,975 employees in telecommunications, giving a ratio of 69 per 1,000
DELs. The number of staff increased to 10,722 at the ead of 1983
equivaleant to 112 employees per 1,000 DELs against the appraisal
projections of 5,666 in tocal and 48 per 1,000 DELs in 1983. The variance
between actual and appraisal f'gures is 5,056 or 64 per 1,000 DELs. Even
after adjusting for 1,039 employees absorbed from the incorporation of
KENEXTEL into KPTC, the actual total number of employees is still as high
as 9,683 or 81 per 1,000 DELs. Such an extraordinary increase is mainly
due to the facts: (a) that KPTC (as well as KENEXTEL), being among the few
profitable parastatals in Kenya, has been particularly susceptible to
external pressures to employ an increasing number of people, even though
these people are operationally redundant; and (b) that KPTC has been unable
to meet the target for increasiag the number of DELs (see Highlight para
3., para 7.01).   While such overstaffing was not followed up by
supervision missIons, uader the third project, KPTC has agreed to take
measures to limit the growth of staff so that the total staff/DEL ratio
would decrease to 62 per 1,000 by end 1988.
6.05     KPIC's training facilities comprise (a) the Central Training
School (CTS) for Intermediate and advanced training in telecommunications
techniques and postal operations, accounting, and administration; and (b)
the Regional Training School (RTS) for vocational training of technicians.
Specialized training has been introduced at CTS and KPTC is upgrading such
courses by the liatroduction of digital technology. Although training
capacity is sufficient, comprehensive manpower planning is still lacking
and training programs should be better tailored to meet KPTC's needs. This
is expected to be done within the third project.
Accounting System
6.06     In compliance with a covenant in the project agreement, a
financial advisor was retained in August 1980 for two years to assist KPTC
in reviewiag its accounting procedures and in implementing new procedures.
Subsequently, KPTC has made significant progress in its accounting and
financial management, and now produces acceptable annual financial
statements. However, the systems in place remain fragmented and are not an
effective tool for management decision-making and coatrol.   Although the
telecommunications and postal operations are separate and exchange rate
adjustments are recorded, commercial accounting (accrual system) is only
used at year-end and such accounts are only available six moaths after the
end of the fiscal year. Day to day recording of all revenues and
expenditures is done on a cash accounting basis. Revaluation of assets



- 17 -
covenanted under the loan agreement has not been undertaken pending final
agreement on the division of EAPTC assets and liabilities, but the Bank
estimated revalued costs of assets at the appraisal for the third project.
During the negotiations for the third pcoject, the assurances.were obtained
that the terms of rtference for a consulting firm to be retained under. the
pcoject will include upgradiag accounting system and revaluation of assets.
Audit
6.07     The Controller aad Auditor General of the Kenyan Government makes
the external audit. Though effects of the KENEXTEL merger on the 1983
accounting should have been explained in detail, neither KPTC nor the
auditor made such presentatioa. KPTC has coatinued to fail to comply with
the covenants of submitting its audited statements within six months of end
of each fiscal year although the Bank's supervision missions repeatedly
asked for improvements. The major reason for such delays is that, as
mentioned in 6.07 above, commercial accounting is used only at year-end and
such accounts are only available six months after the end of the year.
Retention of a consulting firm for improvements of accounting system under
the third project is expected to facilitate accounts preparation Lnd
auditing process subscantially. Meanwhile, under the third project, KPTC
is required to submit draft financial statements within six months of the
end of its fiscal year and then corresponding exterual audit report three
months thereafter. Under the current circumstances, this covenant is more
realistic and effective than the one in the fIrst project where draft
statements are not required.
Tariffs
6.08     KPTC's telecommunications tariffs before &nd after the 1982
adjustment are in Annex 9. As agreed at negotiations, KPTC conducted a
tariff study and increased tariffs as of April 1982.   Connection fees were
increased by 100%, rentals by 60% and all call charges by 30%.  The
connection and rental charges were differentiated for subscribers connected
to manual and automatic exchanges. However, local calls are still untimed
while long distance calls are pulse-metered without difference between busy
traffic time and slack time. No substantial differentiation between
private and business subscribers has been incorporated, except that advance
deposits for certaIn categories of business subscribers have been
introduced. Rental charges were increased to make low traffic DELs
profitable, but the increase was not high enough to compensate for the
fixed capital cost per DEL. The increase in connection charges was aimed
at reduciag the high disconnections/reconaections rate, but KPTC indicated
that the trend has persisted even after the tariff increase. While tariffs
had been maintained at levels to minet the covenanted rate of return of 10%
until 1983, it was likely that another tarIff increase would be requIred to
maintaIn KPTC's financial capabilIty satisfactorily and continue to meet



- 18 -
this covenant after 1983, due to cost iacreases as discussed previously
(para 5.05). Also, there is no periodic review aad adjustment of tariffs
'to ensure the application of Goveramenc's policy stipulating that KPTC be
financially self sufficient. Under these ctrcumstances, tariffs were
raised as a condition of loan effectiveness for the third project which was
approved La June 1985.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Prolect Achievemeat
7.01     The project substantially achieved the objectives set at
appraisal. A major difficulty was that KPTC has not been able to meet the
varget for coanecting new subscribers in relation to the increased exchange
capacity. Annex 10 compares performance indicators anticipated at
appraisal with actuals. Major reasoas for the slow connection are: (a)
weak planning and organization of installation works; (b) difficulties to
obtain foreign exchange and import licenses to pcocure miscellaneous
network and subscriber plant materials and telephone sets. Overstaffing
and a one year delay in implementatioa were also problem for efficient and
effective project management. No project component specifically covered
iastitutional building though it was included in the project objectives.
Despite these, all of which have been followed up under the secoad and
third prqJec.s,  KPTC has created a satisfactory financial base and
developed a capability to carry out sizeable projects efficieatly and to
plan effectively for further expansion. The accounting system should be
put on accrual basis though and the amount of arrears reduced. Even so,
the overall performance is satisfactory coasidering that the project was
the first major task undertaken by the newly established KPTC after the
breAkup of EAPTC.
Project Spin-off
7.02     There was no special spin-off from the project except civIl works
amounting to KSh 210 million was carried out by local coatractors.
Least Cost SolutIon
7.03     KPTC adopted least cost solucioas in the design of systems and the
use of components; the solutions were tested during project preparation.
The timing and dimensioning of various elements in the systems were based
on generally accepted engineering practice for selection of techniques and
equipment aftec study of the feasible alternatives.



- 19 -
Rate of Return
1.04     The rate of return for the project (investment peogram 1979-1983)
as executed oyer 1979-1985 was 30% (Amnex 11).  This is based on official
exchange rates, excluding taxes, duties, iaterest and other transfer
payments, and putting all cost and benefit streams at 1979 prices. The
rate of ceturn does not capture all externalities and understates the
overall economic benefits of the pcoject. An estimate of some of consumer
surplus is incorporated by assuming that (a) preseat subscribers in the
future will be willing to pay for the service the same price as they pay
today, in real terms, and (b) new subscribers will also be willing to pay
the same real amount as existing subscribers. At appraisal, the same
estimation was made.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
Overall anLd Specific Performance
8.01     The Bank has played a constructive role in the development of the
telecommunications system in Kenya through participation in the project.
KPTC has been assisted by the project in establishing a modern
telecommunications network with loag distance and subscriber dialing
facilities as well as a basis to handle an expandIng local services in
Nairobi and some of the larger towns. The Bank has also been a major
source of independent technical and economic advice during project
preparation and implementation.
8.02     The Baik has identified needs £.s lzstitut-nnoal bjullding t
develop management capabilities of KPTC and assisted KPTC in taking
appropriate actions. Some examples are:
(i)  employment of a financial advisor to improve KPTC's accounting
system (para 3.14); and
('i) assignment of responsibility for the capable planning and
overseeing of project execution to the Deputy Managing Director
(para 6.01).
8.03     The Bank might not have paid enough attention to the improvement
of quality of telephone services, overstaffiag, and outstanding arrears
during this project. Within the second and third projects, performance
indicators will cover quality of services and maintenance, such as faults
clearing rates, subscriber faults per telephone per annum and average call
completion races, numbec of staff per line, and accounts receivables (days
of bIlling).

SUPerviS ion
|.04     The Bank's suterv±sion was generally adequate, ehoughethe scope of
financial analysis was sometimes limited to a certain excent mataly due to
KPTC's delays in preparatioa of financial statemencs.
Working Pelationships
8.05     The relationships between the Government, KPTC and the Bank were
good.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01     Followiag wece the problems eacountered i: this project:
(a)  one year delay in physical completion;
(b)  delays in coanection of new subscribers;
Cc)  unsuited financial management and accounting system; and
(d)  overstaffing.
The delay in physical completion was caused by scart up delays at
the procurement stage. No further delay in implementation of the major
physical compoaents occurred once the contracts were finalized. Delays in
the coanection of new subscr:besrs by KPTC's installation staff were mainly
due to import restrictioas and lack of foreign exchange, which prevented
KPTC from procuring timely miscellaneous network and subscriber plant
materials. Measures for improvement in these respect including allocation
of sufficient fuads are included under the Bank financed third project.
Despite sigaificant progress on the financial management side, more
improvemeat is required, especially on the finance aspects of the
management informatioa system (iacluding accrual accounting) and on the
questioa of arrears; this is being followed up through the ongoing second
and third projects. It has, moreover, been agreed between che Bank and
KPTC that the overstaffing problem will be resolved gradually during the
implemencation of the third project.
9.02     The lesson to be learned is that a more comprehensive lIst of
performance iadicator targecs covering project implementation progress,
quality of service, operatioaal efficiency, and outstanding arrears should
have been discussed and determined at the time of negotiation to monitor
the project thoroughly.



- 21 -
9.03     Overall, the project helped KPTC to develop its experience to a
pignificant extent and to be well equipped to deal with further expansion
of telecommunications services. Bask's involvement Ln the following second
and third projects is esseatial for the consolidation of KPTC-as an
institution and for development of the sector as a whole.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KENYA
KENYA POST AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (KPTC)
RETURN ON INVESTMENT
1.       Analysis is performed on the capital and recurrent cost streams of
the KPTC's 1979-83 investmenc program and on the benefits to be derived, as
expected at appraisal and as actually realized. The close relationship
between project and non-profit parts makes any attempted separation very
arbitrary as regards to incremental costs and benefits.
2.       All cost and benefit streams have been expressed in 1979 prices.
Actual streams have been deflated using inflation rates actually recorded
in Kenya to 1984.
3.       Actual capital cost streams are based on the program as actually
Implemented 1979-83 and as estimated to be implemented and completed 1984-
1985.
4.       Actual operating cost streams are calculated; firstly, by
multiplying new subscribers by the average cost per connected subscriber.
Connections were projected over the period 1977-83 at appraisal but
actually have occurred, or are expected to occur, over the period 1979-85.
Secondly, the additional operating cost of new investments that came Into
service to the benefit of existing subscribers have been added.
5.       Actual benefits are calculated as the product of two streams, with
(a) the revenues derived from additional subscribers measured by the number
of such subscribers multiplied by the average revenue per subscriber and
(b) the additional revenue earned from existing subscribers which could not
have been obtained in the absence of the program.
6.       To recapitulate, the following streams summarize the analys's
performed at the time of appraisal.

Rate of return of the streams is 50%

streams expressed in 1979 prices.
REVISED COST-BENEFIT STREAMS

1979          100.4            59.4              74.2            - 85.6

1982          271.0           189.3             395.5            - 64.8
1983          286.1           270.2             498.9             -57.4

1985           95.1           265.7             615.0             254.2

The rate of these streams is 30%.  The rate of return does not capture all
externalities and urderseates the overall economic benefits of the
project. An estimate of some of consumer surplus is incorporated by
.assuming that (a) present subscribers in the future will be willing to pay
for the service the same price as they pay today, in real terms, and (b)
new subscribers w'll also be willing to pay the same real amount as
existing subscribers. At appraisal, the same estimation was made.
