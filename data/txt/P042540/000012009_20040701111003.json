Lessons learned are organized\n            into five distinct categories: (a) key aspects of project\n            design reinforce the importance of monitoring and\n            evaluation, of clear and focused project objectives, and, of\n            strong government ownership; (b) the implementation of\n            policy in a decentralized setting, gave each program unit at\n            the central, provincial, and district levels, experience of\n            their new role under decentralization, namely, in designing\n            and implementing iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) control\n            programs, and, through the grant system, participating\n            governments gained considerable knowledge, and experience in\n            project proposal preparation, implementation, and monitoring\n            and evaluation, which through the establishment of a\n            Technical Review Team, district authorities are expected to\n            review their own proposals; (c) the design of effective\n            social enforcement, developed as an alternative to increase\n            compliance with iodized salt regulations, in the absence of\n            an effective legal environment, was conducive to successful\n            social enforcement strategies, disseminated and implemented\n            across provinces; (d) innovations in the productive capacity\n            of iodized salt, through salt production from Demplots have\n            been exhibited in certain districts, and also increased the\n            daily income of the salt farmers, a success reflected in the\n            observation that some districts are considering to replicate\n            Demplots with their own local budget. However, replication\n            to other locations need attention, and support from local\n            governments. Focusing on centers of salt production, it is\n            suggested the critical point of enforcement is during salt\n            harvest season, when small producers dramatically increase\n            the stocks of un-iodized salt in the country; and, (e) the\n            determination of appropriate IDD indicators, shows that the\n            Total Goiter Rate (TGR) assessed through palpation as an\n            indicator of the current iodine status of the community is\n            low due to cross-assessor variation, and should no longer be\n            recommended. The International Commission for Control of IDD\n            (ICCIDD) now recommends the use of urinary iodine excretion\n            (UIE), as well as the proportion of households consuming\n            iodized salt, as indicators to assess progress towards\n            elimination of IDD."}, "docdt": "2004-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
