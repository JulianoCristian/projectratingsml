3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The project objectives were to: (a) provide GOB with continuing and flexible funding for the preparation of
investment projects in general and more specifically for projects related to the IDA lending program; (b)
strengthen key GOB agencies responsible for project implementation; and (c) contribute to the attainment
of a sound investment program through financing of training and undertaking other related TA activities.



3.2 Revised Objective:
3.3 Original Components:
The project was expected to provide funding for some 30-35 subprojects classified under project
components related to each of the project objectives. Identification of the subprojects was as follows: (a)
thirteen subprojects totaling US$4.9 million were transferred from the Fifth Technical Assistance (TA-V)
Project; (b) four new institutional development subprojects totaling US$5.3 million were identified under
TA-VI; (c) thirteen subproject proposals totaling US$14.9 million were under consideration; and (d) other
subprojects were to be identified during project preparation.
3.4 Revised Components:
After cancellation and identification of subprojects during implementation theTA-VI resulted in 30
subprojects totaling US$25.88 million. These subprojects may be classified into project components as
follows: (a) Preparation of Investment Projects. Feasibility studies, preparation of investment projects and
technical assistance required prior to project implementation (US$6.85m)(para. 4.2(i)); (b) Strengthening
the Government's Project Administration Capacitv. Enhancement of the Goverrnent's Technical
Assistance Cell at the Economic Relations Division (ERD) in the areas of coordination and monitoring of
implementation (US$0.08m); (c) Development of the Local Consulting Profession. Development of
policies, drafting standards, providing training and establishing a computerized data base of consultants at
ERD (US$0.01 m)(para. 4.2(iii)); (d) Improvement of Government Audit of Extemally Funded Projects.
Institutional Strengthening, development of audit manuals, development of computerized systems and
training (US$0.23m)(para. 4.2(iv)); (e) Institutional Strenthening of the Public Service Reform
Commission. Examination reforms, training, research work on changing job requirements and
administration strengthening (US$0.81m)(para. 4.2(v)); (f) Strengthening Key Government Institutions
Supporting the Public Investrnent Program. Consulting services and studies for the Ministry of
Communications and other ministries (US$15.1 lm)(para. 4.2(vi)-(vii)); and (g) Safety Net. Jute Sector
Retraining for Workers in Affected Mills (US$.79m) (para. 4.2(i)).
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Overall project design was satisfactory since the project objectives and components responded to the
Government's priorities of upgrading technical and professional capabilities of the Government and Public
entities and supporting preparation of the public investment program. However, there were a number of
deficiencies conceming implementation aspects. A large number of carryover subprojects (13 out of 33)
from the TA-V project to the TA-VI project suffered overall quality at entry. The selection process of
subprojects at appraisal lacked development of adequate selection criteria (para 7.4(ii)). As a result, a
number of subprojects identified at entry (16 out of 30) were dropped and the project was restructured
during the mid-term review (MTR-July-August 1996). Funds released as a result of this restructuring were
used for new subprojects.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The project development objectives were met to a large extent. Overall, its performance was satisfactory
because: (a) the first objective was met, as the project provided substantial support for preparation of nine
subprojects (30% of the total subprojects) with an investment program by IDA amounting to about
US$800 million, the most important being Jamuna Bridge, Second Road Rehabilitation, Municipal
Services Feasibility Study, Dhaka Urban Transport Project and the Port Master Plan Study; (b) the second
objective - strengthening key GOB agencies involved in project implementation was partially met. The
project supported 17 subprojects of which 9 were fully satisfactory, mainly the Directorate of Audit, Public
- 2 -



Service Commission, the Academy for Planning and Development, Procurement Training, two on
Education and two on Telecommunications. Two other subprojects -- Urban Development - Dhaka City
Corporation (DCC) - and Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) Flood Component showed
satisfactory results but were designed to provide temporary support and not to build sustainable
institutional capacity.  There were 5 subprojects that showed less than satisfactory performance:
Strengthening the ERD Technical Assistance Cell, Creation of a Database for Monitoring TAPP,
Improving Chittagong Water Management, the Municipal Finance Project, and Strengthening the
Privatization Board; and (c) the third objective was met through the implementation of training prograrns
and seminars e.g. Building Training Capacity for the Academy of Planning to train staff of GOB and its
agencies, Procurement Training under IMED, Training and Retraining (safety net) of Jute Workers and
various study tours to expose GOB's and agencies staff on outside practices. In spite of mixed results
concerning the second objective, the overall achievements surpassed the drawbacks in performance of some
subprojects.
4.2 COutputs by components:
(i) Peparation of Investment Proiects. This component yielded highly satisfactory results reflected in the
following outputs: (a) Feasibility Study and Technical Design Work for preparing the Jamuna Bridge
Project (project approved); (b) Feasibility Study for the Second Road and Rehabilitation Project (project
approved); (c) Feasibility Study for Establishing a Biotechnology Institute (study was satisfactorily
completed but the establishment of the institute was not supported under IDA); (d) Feasibility Study for the
Establishment of an Oceanographic Institute (study was satisfactorily completed but the establishment of
the institute was not supported under IDA); (e) Development of an Investment Program for the preparation
of the Municipal Services Project (project approved); (f) Development of a Production and Marketing
System for Horticulture Exports by private producers (export program successfully launched); (g)
Development and Implementation of a Jute Sector Training Program for workers in private and public jute
mills (improved operations and maintenance) (h) Retraining of Retrenched Workers from Jute Mills (71
percent of trained workers successfully employed); (i) Port System Master Plan (port reform not yet
implemented); and (j) Update of the Dhaka Integrated Transport Study and feasibility and engineering
studies followed by detailed engineering designs for the Dhaka Urban Transport Project phases 1 and 2
(projects approved).
(ii) Strengthening the Government's Project Administration Capacity. Outputs under this component were
mixed: (a) one important aim of this component was to improve ERD's capacity in processing
international aid projects. Although ERD TA Cell's capacity was enhanced through deputation of staff
fromL other government departments, staff were not retained after the completion of the project; (b) a
subcomponent to develop procurement skill in government agencies was implemented successfully although
with delays. This subcomponent created capacity in the Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation
Division (IMED) to organize procurement training for the public sector. IMED has created linkages to
outside training sources resulting in the training of 788 staff, 20 percent higher than target; (c) a
subcomponent to improve training methods and new training courses at the Academy for Planning and
Development (APD), covering project management, procurement, gender issues and environment achieved
satisfactory results; and (d) a data base for monitoring the Technical Assistance Project Proforma (TAPP)
of the Government was partially implemented.
(iii) Development of the Local Consulting Profession. This component was not implemented in the manner
anticipated under the project. However, the efforts of the ERD TA Cell to help organize consultants'
workshops by the Engineers' Association and the implementation of the conclusions and reconimendations
were considered adequate to support the development of this profession. The creation of a roster of local
consultants was initiated under TA-V, but it was not found worth pursuing, as the list required frequent
- 3 -



updating which could be done better by the private sector, rather than at ERD's TA Cell. At the time of
closing of this Project, the Government expressed its interest in exploring other options to help the
development of the local consulting industry.
(iv) Improvement of Government Audit of Externally Funded Projects. The Technical Assistance to the
Directorate of Audit financed under this component comprised development of physical facilities, training
of staff and hiring of consultants to prepare Audit Manuals. As a result, the preparation time of the
Government audit reports has been reduced, quality of audit reports has significantly improved and about
50 percent audit reports are now prepared based on the Audit Manuals. However, further improvements
are still required.
(v) Institutional Strengthening of the Public Service Commission. This component consisted of one
subproject under which physical facilities were developed through the purchase of an optical mark reader,
computers, software and printing equipment to assist speedy recruitment of civil servants. As a result, the
recruitment time for civil servants has been reduced from 36 months to around 18 months and the quality of
recruitment has significantly improved. The following reports were prepared to aid the recruitment
process: Non-cadre Recruitment, Non-cadre Examination Systems and Curriculum, and Senior Scale
Promotion Examinations and Interview Handbook.
(vi) Strengthening Key Government Institutions Supporting the Public Investment Program. The following
subproject yielded satisfactory results:  (a)  Bangladesh Telephone and Telegraph Board (BTTB)
Conmmercial Accounting. Accounting manuals, systems design and training had a positive impact in the
preparation of a full commercial accounting system in BTTB; (b) Post Primary Education produced
recommendations to revise curriculum, improve textbooks, recruit and train 7,000 female teachers, promote
girls education through stipends and provide work oriented training; (c) Institutional Development of
Primary and Mass Education Division (PMED) through training programs and the establishment of
computerized systems improved staff skills in project formulation, analysis, monitoring and management of
primary education; (d) Consultant Services for Establishing a Telecommunications Regulatory Board
(TRB) resulted in satisfactory reports for the establishment of the Telecom Regulatory Commission (TRC)
and a Telecommunications Sector Reform Project. However, the Government has not yet decided on their
implementation; (e) Urban Development DCC under which consultants were financed to supervise the
construction of DCC pumping station and the construction of the Sheikh Mujib Road Culvert (component
not intended to build permanent institutional capacity); and (f) LGED Flood Component under which
design and construction supervision services allowed quick restoration of snapped road links in rural areas
(component not intended to build permanent institutional capacity).
(vii) The following subprojects were not satisfactory:  (a) Chittagong WASA to improve Water
Management showed unsatisfactory results; (b) Assistance to the Government Privatization Board was
unsuccessful since the Govenmment postponed its privatization program (including the jute industry) and the
consultants showed a less than satisfactory performance; and (c) Municipal Finance Project to assist the
computerization of billing, taxation, and city payroll systems for Dhaka and Chittagong produced
unsatisfactory recommendations which were improved upon by additional work not covered under the
project.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
As the TA-VI supported subprojects which aided project preparation, institutional development, and
training, it did not directly generate income, and hence it is not feasible to calculate the economic/financial
rates of return. However, the project's economic and financial impact is high since it has: (a) supported
the development of investment projects which have a high economic development impact (para. 4.2(i)); (b)
- 4 -



created institutional capacity for processing and monitoring projects (para. 4.2(ii)); and (c) developed
permanent and/or temporary capacity in govermment institutions related to the public investment program
increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of public investments (para. 4.2(vi)).
4.4 Financial rate of return:
As above.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
(i) The overall institutional development impact is satisfactory. The following is the project's performance
concerning institutional strengthening: (a) it had mixed results in strengthening institutional capacity to
administer intemationally funded projects (para. 4.2(ii)); (b) it improved substantially the Government's
audit capacity of intemationally funded projects (para. 4.2(iv)); (c) it strengthened the capacity of the
Public Service Commission increasing the efficiency and quality of recruitment (para. 4.2(v)); and (d) it
strengthened specific sectors within the Ministries for project preparation, implementation and monitoring,
i.e. Commercial Accounting at BTTB, Post Primary Education and Primary and Mass Education at the
Ministry of Education, and Urban Development (para. 4.2(vi)). It should be noted, however, that due to the
nature of the project, the interventions focussed on specific areas and were therefore, not destined to
achieve integral development for an institution as a whole.
(ii) The recognition of institution building is evident from the Government's commitment to continue
improvement of a number of departments/agencies to enhance their delivery efficiency. For example, the
further improvement in capacity of the National Board of Revenue is being implemented through the
Export Diversification Project to enhance its tax collection and administration capacity. The institution
building of the Telecom Regulatory Board will help establishing a full-fledged Telecommunications
Regulatory Commission (TRC) and the Telecommunications Act has already been approved by the
Cabinet. The Directorate of Audit's institutional capacity will be further enhanced to provide an effective
government monitoring and audit through the Country Financial Accountability Assessment study. The
development of a Government sponsored Hortex Foundation to promote exports of horticulture products in
collaboration with NGOs has been successful, based on which IDA financed a follow-on project - the
Agriculture Service Innovation and Reform Project (ASIRP) - to continue such efforts. Moreover, the
Govermment is interested in preparing a Public Sector Management Project, instead of a follow-up Seventh
Technical Assistance Project in order to place strong emphasis on institutional development and the
strengthening of public sector management.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 F-actors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
(a) Since many of the subproject task managers were the task managers for the beneficiary investment
projects and thus supervised the subprojects in the context of their main projects, the TA-VI lacked a
coordinated supervision schedule for its subprojects; and (b) a number of subprojects requiring specialized
expertise had been developed without assigning a specific task manager which fell by default on the TA-VI
task manager.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Government approval of the Tecnical Assistance Project Proposal (TAPP) is lengthy and cumbersome,
affecting subprojects' approval and implementation. Furthermore, there are no clear guidelines for TAPP
preparation concerning the hiring of consultants and their compensation package. This affected
subprojects' approval and implementation and the preparation of the corresponding investment projects.
- 5 -



5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
(a) The rationale and mechanism for project selection were not well established (para. 7.4(ii)); (b) some
institutions supported under the institutional development subproject were not adequately staffed, nor was
there clear commitment to do so (e.g. the ERD TA Cell); and (c) implementation and monitoring
arrangements for the project were weak. The ERD TA Cell had limited capacity (only three professional
staff) to select and implement subprojects spanning over 12 ministries and 18 government
departments/agencies. It also lacked a full-time Project Director (PD) and PD's turnovers were frequent.
The PD's substantive involvement was in regular project processing work of the ERD World Bank Desk,
leaving hirn little time to invest in TA-VI project implementation.
5.4 Costs and financing:
The estimated cost of the project was US$35.0 million out of which IDA's contribution was US$ 25.0
million (SDR 18.3 million), GOB's contribution was US$5.0 million and UNDP's contribution was
US$5.0 million. As against total IDA allocation of US$25.0 million, an amount of US$ 25.52 million was
disbursed [variations due to exchange rate differentials]. Out of this, USS15.73 million was disbursed for
consultancy (62.08%); US$3.04 million for equipment (12.00%); US$2.37 million for training (9.35%);
and US$4.20 million for other support services (16.57%) (US$0.17 million remained undisbursed in the
Special Account) (See Annex 2).
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Overall, sustainability of the project is likely because: (a) the studies leading to project preparation (para.
4.2(i)) have led to sustainable investment projects (highly sustainable); (b) under the component to
strengthen government project administration capacity (para. 4.2(ii)) procurement training at IMED and
government institutions and training courses at the APD have been built into their procedures, although
other subcomponents were less than satisfactory (partially sustainable); (c) the improvement in public audit
systems under the Directorate of Audit (para. 4.2(iv)) will be further enhanced through a Country Financial
Accountability Assessment Study (highly sustainable); (d) although recruitment processes under the Public
Service Commission (PSC) (para. 4.2(v)) have been substantially improved, sustainability of this
component will depend on the future PSC's policies for recruitment (likely sustainable); and (e) the effects
of capacity enhancement of government institutions (para. 4.2(vi)) once achieved are difficult to reverse
since the changes are incorporated into the regular operations of such institutions. However it should be
noted that some of these subcomponents were designed to provide temporary enhancement capacity only,
i.e. Urban Development DCC and LGED Flood Component (para. 4.2(vi)) and some subcomponents (para.
4.2(vii)) were unsatisfactory (partially sustainable).
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
(i) Lending. IDA's objective to assist institutional capacity building of the government and its agencies
was consistent with GOB policy. However, identification of project components was less than satisfactory.
Thirteen subprojects identified for inclusion in TA-VI were later dropped. This weakness in design resulted
in delays in project implementation.
(ii) IDA's assessment of the ERD TA Cell's capacity to implement the project was unrealistic. Failure to
-6 -



ensure ERD TA Cell's capacity to physically supervise and monitor subprojects significantly contributed to
delays in implementation. Moreover, IDA's inability to ensure a full time Project Director for the ERD TA
Cell had a serious impact on implementation.
(iii) The objective of co-financing of the project with UNDP did not yield the desired results. Co-financing
was finally confined to the institutional building of the Directorate of Audit. Very little was achieved to
widen the co-financing effort to other subprojects as UNDP focussed mainly on its own programs.
Moreover, during project implementation, UNDP's financing strategy changed to finance projects dealing
with poverty alleviation and social development. As a result, a number of projects earmarked for
co-financing were later abandoned.
7.2 Supervision:
(i) Although Bank's initial supervision of the project was weak, it significantly improved during the later
part of project implementation. As a result, the project was completed successfully. Supervision
deficiencies of the project mainly arose in the following areas: (a) IDA did not have a concrete plan and
resources assigned for supervision and monitoring of multiple subprojects; (b) IDA relied heavily on the
ERD TA Cell for supervision, with occasional monitoring by the visiting mission members from
headquarters; (c) no explicit mechanism was established to coordinate supervision of the TA-VI and that of
the subprojects, which was necessary because some subprojects were supervised in the context of the main
project they supported and other subprojects were left unsupervised; and (d) there were frequent changes in
Task Managers and Division's responsible for the Project during 1994 and 1995 which affected project
implementation.
(ii) IDA's supervision performance improved as a result of transfer of responsibility to the Resident
Mission in mid-1995. This proved to be the most effective division of responsibilities since location of the
task management in the field allowed close coordination with the implementing agency, the ERD TA Cell,
on overall programming, procurement and disbursements. Meanwhile task management for most
subprojects remained with the task managers for the main projects, benefiting from their specific expertise
and project focus. Ownership of supervision was enhanced at that time by incorporating ERD TA Cell
staff as members of the supervision mission.
(iii) A mid-term review (MTR) of the project was conducted in mid-1996, which implemented a
restructuring of the portfolio. As a result: (a) some subprojects were closed due to their low performance
or lack of interest by the beneficiary institution, while others were redimensioned according to their revised
funding requirements; (b) a full time Project Director for the TA Cell at ERD was later appointed and staff
capacity was somewhat strengthened; (c) subprojects lacking an explicit task manager were assigned to
one; and (d) supervision of subprojects, which before took place only if necessary within the context of the
main project, was made mandatory by the Chief of the Mission. These measures improved project
implementation significantly.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Although initial preparation of the project suffered from design problems, the project objectives were
appropriate, and as a result of the project's restructuring after the mid-term review, implementation of the
project became satisfactory. Therefore, overall Bank performance is considered satisfactory.

7.4 Preparation:
(i) ERD provided active support during the preparation of the project. It organized a series of meetings with
the government departments and agencies to identify potential subjects and initiate their preparation. It
- 7 -



assisted with donor coordination including obtaining UNDP's agreement to co-finance the project. As a
result, the project was prepared in time. However, the Government failed to identify subprojects with
coherent objectives and sound implementation capacity. Partly for this reason, 13 subprojects identified at
preparation were later dropped resulting in delays in project implementation.
(ii) The assessment during project preparation of the institutional capacity of the ERD TA Cell and
agencies to implement subprojects was weak. Technical assistance requirements to enhance capacity and
staff skills were not properly identified. This contributed to a chronic weakness in capacity in ERD TA
Cell. At agency level, the identification of subprojects lacked rigor and proper selection criteria. The
assessment of processing requirements, subproject preparation time including preparation of TAPP, and
institutional capacity requirements to implement subprojects was weak. These deficiencies continued until
the end of 1995, when the Government and IDA agreed to select subprojects under agencies that had sound
implementation capacity.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
(i) The Government's commitment towards the institutional development of its departments and agencies
was high during the implementation of the project. It was reflected by its measures taken to: (a) improve
the auditing methods of the public entities using donors' funds; (b) implement a system to improve and
monitor the Revenue Administration; (c) restructure the process for recruitment of civil servants; and (d)
create training and human resource development capacity in the public institutions. Moreover, the
Government took timely actions to implement the Mid-term Review Mission's recommendations to improve
project implementation (para 7.2(iii)).
(ii) Despite the Government's high commitment to the Project, some public sector management issues, both
of a generic and project specific nature, affected project implementation. These were: (a) the Government'
s initial hesitation in using credit funds for technical assistance after grant funds could not be obtained; (b)
procedural shortcomings in TAPP processing and delays in TAPP approval; (c) insufficient institutional
capacity to handle consultants' contracts; (d) frequent transfer of Project Directors and in some cases their
being assigned multiple responsibilities; and (e) inadequate selection of staff for intemational training
programs.
(iii) The processing of technical assistance requests is complex and requires an approved Technical
Assistance Project Proforma (TAPP) by the Government (equivalent to the Bank's appraisal documents).
To simplify the process, the Government prepared Technical Assistance Processing Guidelines in 1992 and
revised them in July, 1997 to incorporate IDA's comments. Although the Guidelines improved subproject
processing in terms of providing guidance to the line ministries and agencies, the TAPP processing
continued to be a long drawn process, delaying technical assistance processing and implementation.
Another problem has been the highly specific content of the TAPP which, once approved, is difficult to
revise without going through a new full approval process.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
(i) Overall ERD TA Cell's implementation performance was satisfactory. In the initial three years of
project implementation, the TA Cell lacked sufficient professional staff to undertake effective supervision
and monitoring, and execute timely disbursement of funds. However, implementation performance
improved significantly since early 1996 after the Government implemented actions agreed during the
Mid-term Review to strengthen the TA Cell. It appointed a Deputy Director, MIS staff and, towards the
end of the Project, a full-time Project Director, resulting in improvements in subprojects' supervision. At
he time of Project closing, ERD was contemplating further improvements by establishing a Wing with
- 8 -



professional staff that would constitute a focal point for implementing donor funded technical assistance.
(ii) The agencies which implemented subprojects largely performed satisfactorily (see Annex 9). However,
some weak areas were identified concerning their management of projects: (a) most agencies were
unfamiliar with project processing (e.g. processing the TAPP) and with the World Bank procurement
guidelines for hiring consultants and procuring equipment; (b) most implementing agencies failed to draw
an implementation plan.  Sometimes consultants were hired in advance, before the implementation
arrangements were in place and physical facilities were in hand leading to inefficient use of consultant's
time. These problems were associated with a number of projects such as TRB TA, Directorate of Audit
TA, and HORTEX Foundation TA; and (c) implementing agencies suffered from high staff turnovers
including frequent transfer of Project Directors who did not have time to acquire sufficient expertise to
implement the subprojects efficiently.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower's performance is satisfactory. As indicated above, the Government participated actively
during project preparation and implementation (para 7.5(i)). It took adequate measures to implement the
recommendations arising from the Mid-term Review (para. 7.6(i)). As shown under Achievement of
Objectives and Output (section 4) it used adequately the technical assistance funds for preparation of
investment projects and for strengthening project preparation and implementation capacity of ministries and
agencies. It also improved management capacity in some government departments on areas such as
revenue collection, civil servants' recruitment, TA implementation, and human resource development.
8. Lessons Learned
The main lessons for technical assistance projects that have emerged in the implementation of the TA-VI
are the following:
1. l'o ensure effectiveness in implementation, the implementing agency's (ies') capacity should be
confirmed before agreeing to technical assistance. If training is needed to enhance the implementing
agency's (ies') capacity it should be focussed and results oriented.
2. To obtain tangible results, free standing technical assistance components (as opposed to those
supporting project preparation) should aim at agreed upon overall objectives within the context of the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).
3. To ensure quality at entry, the soundness of the proposed technical assistance components should be
assessed before including them as part of a project.
4. To achieve timely implementation, approval of technical assistance projects should require that: the
Project Director be appointed, implementation arrangements be in place, and main procurement
activities (e.g. draft TOR and LOI) be completed.
5. To allow for necessary adjustments in the technical assistance components during project
implementation, Government documents for approval of technical assistance (i.e. TAPP in case of
Bangladesh) should possess in-built flexibility and executing agencies should be able to modify their
contents without altering their objectives.
6. To ensure adequate monitoring of projects, systems for audit compliance of subprojects should be in
place or built into the project.
-9-



7. To ensure effective project supervision when subprojects are under different task managers, a
coordination mechanism should be firmly agreed before project and subprojects approval.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
9.1 Project Formulation
Given the need to upgrade technical professional and administrative capabilities of Government and Public
Sector Agencies in Bangladesh, Technical Assistance (TA) is an important component of the external aid
received by Bangladesh. Over one-half of TA has been investment related, i.e. used to support and ensure
timely preparation and implementation of the public investment program. Five freestanding IDA TA
Credits (1978-1992) have been an important source of technical assistance projects. However, the need to
strengthen the developmental capabilities of key ministries and agencies has been keenly felt as the load of
work has increased in recent years and the Government is trying to upgrade national capabilities. IDA's
TA-VI Project was prepared during an IDA preparation mission in June 1991, and pre-appraisal missions
in October 1991 and in February 1992, The project was negotiated between GOB and IDA in May 1992,
and the credit became effective in August 1992.
9.2 Project Objectives and Description
(i) The objectives of the project were to: (a) strengthen the Government's capacity to prepare investment
projects; (b) strengthen the Government's institutional capacity of key ministries and agencies; and (c)
provide an assured and flexible source of financing for technical assistance and training to achieve the
above objectives. IDA agreed to finance the TA project as already identified through new subprojects for
project preparation, help implementation of investment project, studies for institutional strengthening and
other TA activities related to IDA's program in Bangladesh.
(ii) The amount of the credit (18.30 million SDR) consisted of thirty subprojects: (i) thirteen subprojects
carried over from the Fifth Technical Assistance Project (CR. 1440-BD) (with an estimated cost of US$4.9
million); (ii) four fully prepared new institutional development projects (with an estimated cost of US$ 5.3
million); (iii) thirteen subprojects already identified for possible funding under the project (with an
estimated cost of US$14.9 million); and (iv) projects yet to be identified and proposed for financing during
project implementation.
9.3 Project Performance and Government's Perspective
(i) Based on the main objectives mentioned above, a total of 33 subprojects were approved. Of these, three
subprojects were cancelled. Of the remaining 30 subprojects, 17 subprojects (57%) were approved to
develop institutional capacity of GOB ministries and/or its agencies; 9 subprojects (30%) supported
feasibility studies for preparing investment and infrastructure projects; three subprojects (10%) financed
construction supervision; and one subproject (3%) helped develop a "safety net program" for retrenched
jute workers.
(ii) Disbursement performance of the project is generally satisfactory. The project implementation has
significantly improved since the Midterm Review in July-August, 1996. The ERD TA Cell also assumed
additional responsibility for utilization of project funds and intra-subproject adjustment of allocation of
funds depending on their needs and priorities. Out of the total credit amount of SDR 18.30 million, an
amount of SDR 17.97 million (approximately) has been disbursed and the balance amount of SDR 0.33
- 10 -



million (approximately) cancelled. This shows that about 98% of the credit was disbursed and the
remaining 2% of the credit cancelled due mainly to slow execution and disbursement of the TA for
Government Privatization Project (July 10 1992- June 30, 1999). The credit was extended for one year up
to June 30, 1999 to facilitate full disbursement and completion of the 8 subproject on-going activities.
(iii) IDA approved imprest fund of US$ 1.30 million to operate the Dollar Special Account (DOSA) for the
TA-VI Credit. The amount was insufficient and the World Bank's replenishment procedure was very
lengthy. During the months of June, July and August of FY 97-98 and 98-99 'DOSA' suffered for
shortage of funds. So it is necessary to increase the imprest fund to facilitate speedy disbursement of the
Technical Assistance fund.
(iv) Flow of information about replenishment between IDA and GOB was slow which also impeded
implementation of the subprojects. Quick flow of information about disbursement and replenishment from
IDA to GOB would be very useful for implementation of future Technical Assistance projects.
(v) In view of the experience stated above, the necessity for streamlining Technical Assistance project
processing procedures was urgently felt by the Government and accordingly simplified Technical
Assistance guidelines were prepared in May, 1992 and revised in July 1997 in consultation with the donors.
The new guidelines are being followed now and it is expected that in view of the revised and simplified
Technical Assistance guidelines the overall efficiency in processing, approval and implementation of the
Technical Assistance subprojects under the proposed Public Sector Management Project (PSMP/TA-VII)
will be greatly improved.

10. Additional Information
Covenant Compliance
Covenant compliance is satisfactory (see Annex 13) All the covenants were met on time, except
the following that were met with delays: (a) covenant 3.06(a) requiring the Government to establish a
revised auditing system, satisfactory to IDA, for externally financed projects was complied with in late
1995, instead of the agreed date of June 30, 1994; (b) covenant 3.06(b) requiring the Government to
prepare and implement a program to promote the local consulting industry no later than June 30,1994 was
complied with in March 1996; and (c) covenant 3.07 requiring the Government to prepare a "Manual for
Preparation and Implementation of Technical Assistance Projects" not later than June 30, 1994 was
complied with on May 15, 1996.
