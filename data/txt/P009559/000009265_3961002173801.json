Secondly,\n            the project will provide support to GOB in strengthening key\n            agencies responsible for implementation of investment\n            projects. Thirdly, the project would contribute to the\n            attainment of a sound investment program through financing\n            of training and the undertaking of related technical\n            assistance activities identified by GOB. The project will\n            finance technical assistance for (a) project preparation,\n            (b) implementation support for IDA-financed investment\n            projects, (c) institutional strengthening, (d) studies, and\n            (e) other technical assistance activities related to\n            IDA's program in Bangladesh. As was the case with\n            previous IDA financed technical assistance projects in\n            Bangladesh, approximately one half of the technical\n            assistance subprojects will be for project preparation, one\n            third for institutional development, and the rest for other\n            types of technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1992-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
