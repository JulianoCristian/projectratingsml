project rating is\n            satisfactory, sustainability is likely, and the\n            institutional development impact is substantial. Lessons\n            drawn from the project spell out that, prior to any\n            technical assistance agreement, the implementing\n            agency's capacity should be confirmed, to be able to\n            provide for required training, if any. Free standing\n            technical assistance components (not those supporting\n            project preparation), should focus on the agreed overall\n            objectives, within the context of the Country Assistance\n            Strategy. Furthermore, the soundness of proposed technical\n            assistance components, should be assessed prior to project\n            inclusion, thus ensuring quality at entry, and, project\n            design should incorporate flexibility, allowing for the\n            necessary adjustments in technical assistance components, or\n            for modifications by executing agencies, on its contents,\n            without altering objectives. Project coordination,\n            particularly with subprojects under different task managers,\n            should be firmly agreed prior to project, and subprojects approval."}, "docdt": "2000-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
