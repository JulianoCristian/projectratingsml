"The Second Power Project is the\n            Government's first major rural electrification effort\n            and would smooth the transition from the existing system of\n            isolated generation to the interconnected system. It would\n            bring the benefits of adequate and reliable electricity\n            service to about 17,000 new customers and upgrade the\n            quality of service for another 5,200 existing customers. The\n            major project components include: (a) expansion and\n            connection of the distribution networks in 17 priority\n            villages to nearby existing generating facilities with\n            underutilized capacities; (b) installing relatively small\n            generating units and constructing distribution networks in\n            the towns of Zabid, Hazm Al Jawf and Marib; (c) establishing\n            and reinforcing the distribution networks in the\n            farmers' markets in the main cities of Sanaa, Hodeida\n            and Taiz; (d) construction of a subtransmission line and\n            distribution network in Bani Hushaysh and Mabar whose future\n            connection to the national grid would be economic; (e)\n            technical assistance and training; and (f) consultant\n            services for energy and electricity pricing studies."}, "docdt": "1981-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
