Rural\n            schools across the country were dilapidated, textbooks were\n            rare, and teachers were underpaid and demotivated. Rural\n            Education Project improved performance management systems\n            for teachers and principals where teachers received\n            financial incentives based on performance. Nearly 1.3\n            million copies of textbooks were purchased and reprinted,\n            which had greatly increased the country\u2019s textbook stock.\n            Schools bought new materials and refurbished laboratories\n            and classrooms. Teachers focused on raising their\n            professionalism, applying modern teaching methods, and\n            establishing better interactions with students."}, "docdt": "2011-08-01T02:59:01Z"}
