                         final set of the outputs being delivered are the new textbooks in support of the planned introduction of the new curriculum and the simulation study of efficiency gains from the Per
                         Capita Funding pilot. The project is expected to be fully disbursed against the original amount of SDR 10 million, equivalent to $15 million.

                         While the implementation results are subject to further evaluation and validation, key project indicators appear to have met the targets revised at the mid-term pointing to a generally
                         satisfactory outcome of the project. The results to date reflect the overall achievement against the project development objectives in improving leaning and learning conditions in
                         schools of targeted oblasts and the success in piloting a number of innovative policy interventions that aimed to inform sector policy and create conditions for possible scaling up
                         sector wide. The initial analysis of the PISA 2009 results which is not a direct project indicator, shows the trend of improvement over the 2006 results at the system level and at the
                         same time points to significant achievement gaps to close.

                         To ensure the validity of the results, further analysis of the results of the National Sample based Assessment (NSBA) is being carried out. NSBA replaced an earlier survey to
                         measure student learning improvement. To better assess the impact of the piloted interventions, an evaluation has been planned for the pilots of per student financing and teacher
                         incentive scheme to distill lessons learned and to inform future policy though project impact evaluation was not part of the original project design.
