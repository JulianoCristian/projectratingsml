Yemen Southern Regional Agricultural\n            Development Project. The main objectives of the project\n            were: (a) to increase agricultural productivity and incomes\n            of farmers on 120,000 hectares, including those of the low\n            rainfall areas of the region by means of improved\n            agricultural services; improved utilization of land and\n            water resources; and special assistance to women farmers;\n            and (b) to improve the health and nutrition standards of the\n            rural families through improved extension services to rural\n            women. Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned from the project were as follows: (a) the\n            timely availability of adequate recurrent local operational\n            budget is vital for the long-term sustainability of the\n            project; (b) effective management of complex projects\n            requires an efficient regional coordination mechanism; (c)\n            there is a need to set up and implement a pragmatic\n            mechanism to forge effective and close links between\n            extension and research activities under the concerned\n            projects; (d) the development and adoption of M and E\n            systems should build on existing practices and take into\n            account the national capacity and training needs to enable\n            local operation and management of the systems; and (e) the\n            benefits of close and coordinated working relationship with\n            other cofinanciers of the project."}, "docdt": "1996-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
