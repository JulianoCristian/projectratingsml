Southern Regional\n            Agricultural Development Project are to increase\n            agricultural productivity and incomes of farmers of the\n            Southern Region by providing improved agricultural services\n            including operation and maintenance of agricultural\n            infrastructure, improved utilization of land and water\n            resources, special assistance to women farmers; and improved\n            services for rural women to raise the health and nutrition\n            standards of the rural families. The project consists of\n            construction of facilities, and the provision of vehicles\n            and equipment, the establishment and strengthening of\n            regional support services in agricultural extension, rural\n            development for women and veterinary services.  The project\n            further entails operation and maintenance; development of a\n            tree nursery; provision  of fertilizer; and construction of\n            subbranches for the Cooperative and Agricultural Credit Bank\n            (CACB).  In addition, the project aims to establish\n            demonstration farms to train farmers in irrigation and\n            agricultural practices; rehabilitate irrigation schemes (350\n            ha); undertake a water resources study on the Wadi Bana\n            area; and provide technical assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1987-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
