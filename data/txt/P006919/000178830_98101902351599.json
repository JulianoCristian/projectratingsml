rehabilitation and improvement of Costa\n            Rica's highway network. The program components\n            supported by the loan are: (a) the rehabilitation of some\n            420 km of primary and secondary roads; (b) technical\n            assistance for improving the Ministry of Public Works and\n            Transportation's organizational arrangements and\n            procedures for highway rehabilitation and reconstruction;\n            (c) purchase of maintenance equipment; and (d) technical\n            assistance and training services to implement the\n            Government's highway maintenance program. In addition,\n            the project will strengthen road administration through a\n            clearer division of responsibilities between the Ministry\n            and local authorities. The project will first benefit\n            vehicle operators and the transport industry, and later\n            producers and consumers. Because of the ambitious size of\n            the project, its major risk, special measures have been\n            designed to afford adequate flexibility."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
