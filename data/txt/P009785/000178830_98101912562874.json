of foodgrain and treecrop\n            cultivation. This project will provide a reliable water\n            supply for hillside garden and paddy lands covering some\n            37,600 ha together with a range of agricultural support\n            services that will complement the availability of a reliable\n            water supply. The project components will comprise the\n            completion of the Kallada dam and the left and right main\n            canals; construction of the branches, distributaries, and\n            associated service roads and buildings; construction of the\n            piped minor conveyance systems from the 10-ha outlets to the\n            farmers' fields; the provision of vehicles and\n            equipment; and the establishment of infrastructural support\n            services and provision of planting material to assist\n            farmers within the command area."}, "docdt": "1982-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
