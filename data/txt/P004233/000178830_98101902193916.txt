REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVFE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA FOR A
POPULATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Malaysia for the equivalent of US$5.0 million to help finance a
project for Malaysia's national family planning program. The loan would
have a term of 25 years, including 10 years of grace, with interest at 7¼
percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report dated March 20, 1972 (EAP-31a) was circulated
to the Executive Directors on March 23, 1972. Its major conclusions were
discussed in my report on Loan 810-MA (Second Education Project, Report No.
P-105, dated March 16, 1972). No major changes in the economr have taken
place since that time. For ease of reference the economic section of that
report is included in Annex I which also includes Basic Data for Malaysia.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
3.        The Bank has made 19 loans to Malaysia for projects in education, agricul-
ture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply, telecommunications, ports,
railways, and urban transport. Although in a few cases disbursements were
slow the execution of these projects has generally been satisfactory. As of
November 30, 1972 the loans to Mslaysia held by the Bank amounted to US$305h.
million. In addition, the Bank made a loan in 1965 to the Public Utilities
Board, Singapore (Loan 405-MA), guaranteed by Malaysia, to finance the Johore
River project. The amount due to the Bank is US$6.8 million. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of November
30, 1972 and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
4.        As noted in Annex I, the Malaysian economy has grown at a real rate
of about 6 percent per annum over the past decade, despite the continued
fall in the price of its principal export, rubber. This has been made possible
by favorable natural resources, a high level of education, and a strong and
dynamic private sector, supported by sound fiscal and monetary policies, and
by generally adequate and properly maintained public services.
5.        In recent years, the uneven distribution of the benefits of growth
between the different ethnic groups and the different regions of the country,
as well as the rising level of unemployment, have become matters of increasing
concern to the Government. To alleviate these problems the Government proposes
to increase public and private investment and is seeking ways of dealing more
directly with income disparities. A Bank economic mission which visited
Malaysia in November/December 1972 paid particular attention to these problems
and we expect to help the Government devise policies and identify projects
that would be consistent with the socio-economic goals of Malaysia.
6.        One of the major problems in carrying out the current Five-Year
Plan, besides the formulation of measures to bring about greater income
equality, is the lack of capacity in the public sector to prepare and implement
a sufficiently large investment program. The Bank has helped the Government to



prepare projects either in the course of its lending operation or by acting
as Executing Agency for UNDP-financed studies. Thus, the Bank has helped
prepare the population project through reconnaissance, pre-appraisal and
appraisal missions. In the course of its lending operations, the Bank has
also helped strengthen public agencies responsible for carrying out irr,ortant
parts of Malaysia's investment program. Our ability to assist should be
further enhanced through our resident staff in Bangkok, one of whose primary
functions will be to identify and to prepare projects, initially in the
agricultural and transport sectors of both Thailand and Malaysia.
7.        Malaysia will continue to need such assistance for some time if the
country is to progress towards its economic targets and to make the best use
of its external and domestic resources. We will continue this policy which
will be reflected in the loans which I hope to bring before you in the next
year or so. These loans would be for projects involving land settlement, which
besides the clearing and planting of land for oil palm and rubber, would include
a study of Malaysia's agricultural credit, and for projects involving water
supply, road and railway transport, electric power and education.
8.        In the past the Bank has provided about b0 percent of total project
aid to Malaysia; bilateral aid, mainly from the United Kingdom, and loans frorm
the Asian Development Bank provided the rest. Japan is increasing its aid
substantially and market loans may become more irrportant. Bank lending in
the next few years is expected to increase substantially in line with the
increase in Malaysia's total external borrowing. Despite a commendable -..;vings
effort, Malaysia's need for external capital exceeds the foreign cos.; c-nponent
of projects suitable for financing from abroad. Also, the foreign content of
projects in such sectors as education and agriculture is typically small. For
these reasons, the Bank will continue to cover a portion of local costs in
appropriate cases.
9.        The proposed loan, as well as the projected Bank, ADB and bilateral
lending, is well within Malaysia's debt carrying capacity. Debt service
obligations are expected to remain below 5 percent of export earnings during
the 1970's.
10.       IFC is not considering any new investment projects in Malaysia at
present.
PART III - POPULATION PROBLEMS IN MALAYSIA
ll.       Malaysia is a country of about 11 million people. Although the
results of the 1970 census are not yet final, the population of West Malaysia
to which the project is confined was estimated at 9.3 million. The population
has recently (1970) been growing at 2.5 percent annually, the birth rate
being 32 and the death rate 7 per thousand. In 1957 the rate of population
growth exceeded 3%, the birth rate was 4|6 and the death rate 12.4 per thousand.
The decline in the birth rate since 1957 is due to a decline in fertility and
is not the result simply of a change in the age structure of the population.
However, more recently the country has been facing considerable difficulties
in further reducing fertility because of insufficient health personnel trained
in family planning and because of inadequate facilities to extend family
planning beyond urban to rural areas. The task of reducing the birth rate
will be even more difficult over the next several years owing to the larger



-3-
number of persons entering the reproductive ages as a result of the post-war
baby boom. The on-going Family Planning Program would therefore probably
only result in keeping the population growth rate constant until 1975, i.e.
at the level of 2.5%.
12.       The economic and social implications of such high population growth
rates are serious. Although well endowed with natural resources and current]y
in a favorable financial position, Malaysia suffers from unemployment and
underemployment. High rates of population growth add rapidly to the labor
force, increase social expenditures and prevent living standards from rising
more rapidly. In addition, the relatively high fertility among the poorer
sections of the society has made it difficult to reduce the present inequalities
in economic opportunities.
13.       The Government adopted family planning as a national policy in 196h.
Until then family planning was extended through voluntary organizations which
worked at the state level. In 1966, the National Family Planning Board (NFPB)
was established under the Prime Minister's Department to implement a national
program. The NFPB is an autonomous statutory corporation. While the NFPB
was quite successful in establishing its activities in the urban areas, in-
sufficient numbers of health personnel trained in family planning prevented
the extension of services to the rural areas, where over 70% of West Malaysia's
population lives. Other difficulties were caused by inadequate facilities,
insufficient numbers of administrative personnel, inadequate involvement of
and coordination with other agencies, particularly the Ministry of Health, and
limited information, education and communications programs. The number of new
acceptors that the NFPB was able to recruit reached a high of 75,000 in 1968
and declined steadily thereafter.
14.       To give the program new impetus in the rural areas, the Government
has recently decided to integrate family planning with the maternal and child
health services of the Ministry of Health (MOH). Integration, in this case,
means extension of services to rural areas by utilizing the health personnel
and facilities under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health. The
Director of NFPB, however, would still be responsible for planning, directing
and coordinating family planning services in the country. Coordination committees
consisting of representatives of the NFPB and the MDH have been formed at the
federal and state levels.
15.       While the results of family planning have so far not been too
encouraging - the subject is politically sensitive and Government support has
remained low-key - there appears to be an increased awareness of its benefits
among the population. Surveys carried out in 1966-67, before the program
started, and in 1970 show increasing knowledge, awareness and practice of
family planning. The target for the 1971/75 Second Wblaysia Plan period is
to recruit 600,000 new acceptors, 420,000 of whom to be recruited from rural
areas. However, the MOH and the NFPB estimate that with existing facilities
they could only reach about one-half of the target in rural areas and 80 percent
in urban areas. If that were the case, the 2.5 percent rate of growth of popula-
tion would continue until 1975.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
History
16.       The Project, for which Malaysia has requested financing from the
Bank and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), was
prepared by the Government and the NFPB with assistance from Bank reconnaissance
(June 1971) and pre-appraisal (November 1971) missions. The project was appraised
by the Bank in February/March 1972 and by the UNFPA in June 1972. Negotiations
for a Bank loan and subsequently for an UNFPA grant were held in November 1972
with a Mblaysian delegation led by Encik Sulaiman Abdulloh, Deputy Director-General,
Economic Planning Unit.
Description
17.       The main objective of the proposed project, to be implemented during
1973-78, is to help remove present constraints and to extend family planning
activities in the rural areas by expanding existing facilities, improving the
effectiveness of NFPB and of the maternal and child health services (MCH) of
the MOH and thus strengthen the overall family planning program.   In particular
the purpose of the project would be to (i) strengthen administration of the
program; (ii) extend family planning services to rural areas; (iii) expedite
in-service training of medical and paramedical personnel in family planning:
(iv) introduce population education in schools; (v) improve family planning.
nutrition and health education programs for the rural population; (vi) ;-r-den
research and evaluation through the setting-up of two new population research
centers, one within the NFPB for program evaluation and one at the University
of Malaya for dealing with national demographic questions, and (vii) carry
out a program to determine whether, by providing additional services, acceptance
of family planning can be improved.
18.       The project would provide building facilities for health and family
planning services and for training as well as special equipment, supplies and
vehicles. It would also provide advisory services for administration and
management, for evaluation, research and communications and for the introduc-
tion of population education as well as training of teachers, paramedical
staff and midwives. In addition it would provide for a review of the family
planning program by consultants mid-way through the implementation of the
project.
19.       In addition, a number of institutional reforms would be carried out.
In particular membership of the Central and State Coordination Committees
would be broadened to assure effective involvement of different Einistries;
posts for a MCH/family planning officer in each state would be created; a.
plan of action for family planning in the period 1973-75 and a comprehensive
five-year plan for the period 1976-80 would be prepared.
20.       A Loan and Project Summary has been included in Annex III.   The
Appraisal Report No.PP-12a dated December 21, 1972 is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors..



Implementation
21.       The NFPB would be primarily responsible for implementing the project.
It would cooperate   closely with the Ministry of Health regarding the use of
rural health centers for family planning, with the IMnistry of Education for
the introduction of population education in schools, and with the University of
Malaya regarding evaluation and research. A Project Irrplementation Committee
charged with the overall responsibility for ensuring execution of the project
would be established. The various agencies concerned with the project would
be represented on the Committee as well as the Economic Planning Unit and the
Treasury. The Deputy Director of NFPB, when appointed, would act as the
Executive Secretary of the Committee. The establishment of the Committee would
be a condition of effectiveness of the Loan Agreement. A Project Construction
Unit which would be set up in the Ministry of Health and which would be assisted
by architect consultants, would be responsible for carrying out the construction
part of the project.
Cost and Financing of Project
22.       The total cost of the proposed project, excluding interest and other
charges on the proposed Bank loan, and net of duties and taxes, is estimated
at US$11.l  million of which US$6.3 million would be for foreign expenditures.
The United Nations FQnd for Population Activities (UNFPA) has agreed to make
available a grant of US$4.3 million which would finance the full cost of
advisory services, contraceptive supplies, vehicles, medical instruments and
training stipends. The proposed Bank loan of US$5.0 million would cover the
foreign exchange costs of building construction, certain other vehicles,
computing and audio-visual equipment, research advisors and a management
system study. US$1.1 million interest and other charges on the loan during
implementation of the project i.e. up to February 1978,would also be financed
under the loan. Government would finance the local cost - US$5.2 million - of
the Bank-assisted part of the project. The conclusion of arrangements ensuring
UNFPA financial assistance would be a condition of effectiveness of the Loan
Agreement.
Procurement and Disbursements
23.       Contracts for furniture, equipment and vehicles financed out of the
proceeds of the Bank loan would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.
Contracts for civil works would be subject to local bidding and in accordance
with Malaysian procedures for public works contracts foreign contractors would
be allowed to bid. However, civil works consist mainly of the construction of
small buildings spread over a 3-year period in eleven states, with unit costs
varying from US$3,000 to US$10,000 and such contracts are therefore unlikely
tc attract foreign contractors.



24.       Local manufacturers are expected to participate in the bidding for
equipment, vehicles and furniture. A margin of preference of 15 percent or
the applicable customs duty, whichever is the lower, would be applied in the
comparison of foreign and local bids for the supply of these items. Disburse-
ments would be made against 30 percent, representing the foreign expenditure
component, of the total co0t of civil works and professional services, against
the foreign exchange cost of imported equ:ipment, furniture and vehicles a-nd
against the ex-factory cost of these items if awarded to local manufacturers.
Socio-Economic Analysis
25.       The proJect would help Malaysia decrease fertility and thus slow
birth and population growth rates.   Other things being equal, the reduction
of these rates would accelerate per capita income growth, result in increased
savings and in the long run reduce unemployment. By extending family planning
services to the poorer rural sections of the society, the project would help
reduce present inequalities in economic opportunities. Through its health
components, including nutrition education, the project would improve the
mental and physical capabilities of children and reduce maternal and child
mortality and morbidity. It is estimated that the project would help to
reduce the birth rate to 21 per thousand and the population growth rate to
1.5 percent by 1985. Without the project these rates would be more like 26 ar-' 2. 2/
and 2.0% respectively. It is estimated that average per capita income in 19E5
would be about 5% higher than without the project.
PAiRT V - LEGAL INSTRUMNTS AND AUTHORITY
26.       The draft Loan Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank, the draft
Project Agreement between the NFPB and the Bank, the report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately. The draft agreements conform to the
pattern normally used by the Bank for population projects.
27.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMNDATION
28.       1 recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

THE EOJNOMY
Extract from Report and Recommendation of the President
to the Executive Directors on a Proposed Loan to
Malaysia for a Second Education Project, dated
March 16, 1972, Report No. P-105h, pp. 2-h
"8.        During the last decade, in spite of adverse political event6 - such as
the separation of Singapore from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965, the confronta-
tion with Indonesia until 1966, the communal riots in 1969 and the subsequent
suspension of parliamentary goverrment - and a deterioration of the terms of trade,
mainly as a result of the steady fall in the prics of ruibber, the Yalaysian economny
continued on a strong and steady course with real GI1P growing at about 6.2 percent
per annum. Dramatic productivity improvement in natural rubber production through
massive replanting in the early sixties was followed by increased exports of timber
and palm oil, bringing down the share of rubber in total export earnings from 48
percent in 1961 to 33 percent in 1971 while maintaining an annual 5.2 percent
growth rate of export earnings throughout the decade. The price of tin, the
second largest export earner, has remained strong.
9.        Malaysia's economic growth has been oriented towards exports of primary
commodities. Manufacturing had a relatively late start, because the payments
position was strong and it was therefore possible to have an open economy.
Moderate encouragement of import subatitution in a context of liberal investment
policies caused industry to grow at about 11 percent a year during the decsde,
nearly twice the rate of GNP, but it still reached only 13 percent of dest
Malaysia's GDP by 1970.
10.       Political calm has continued for nearly three years since the dis-
turbances of May 1969. However, the debate continues on the disparity between
the economic position of Malays and non-Malays. The tacit compact of the past,
which has prevailed since independence from Great Britain in 1957, and which gave
political dominance to the Malays and economic dominance to the Chinese, is
increasingly being questioned as the basis of national unity. The search for
economic and social policies desi.gned to reduce the economic differences between
the two rates is the principal theme of the Second Malaysia Plan for 1971-75 (5MP).
The SMP centers on the New Economic Policy which aims at eradicating poverty and
restructuring society, so that the present identification of race with particular
forms of economic activity will eventually be eliminated, although it does not set
out the specific measures to be taken. The SMP does not place redistribution of
wealth and income above economic growth; instead it sees continued rapid economic
expansion as being necessary to support these changes.
11.       During the Second Malaysia Plan period GNP is expected to grow at 6.8
percent a year. The leading growth sectors are agriculture and manufacturing, with
expected annual growth rates of 8.3 percent and 12.5 percent respectively, while
the service sectors are expected to expand at a slower rate than GDP. The export
growth target of 4.6 percent a year assumes a 6 percent annual increase in rubber
earnings, 5 percent in timber, a decline in tin, and rapid growth in other exports.
The Plan proposes a considerable increase in public development expenditures and
assumes continued strong private sector expansion.



ANNEX I

12.       The effects which the New Economic Policy wilL have on the private
sector cannot be forecast unti-l specific proposals have been worked out.   In
the past the Government's policies have encouraged free enterprise, and after
the reestablishment of confidence following the 1969 disturbances the Government
took new measures to stimulate private investment.   Private investment in 1970
increased spectacularly from 8.3 percent to 11.7 percent of GNP, and some
further expansion took place in 1971.
13.       The public investment target during the Plan period implies a 5.7
percent annual increase from the 1970 level, which is less than the projected
growth of GNP but would constitute a considerable improvement on the performance
of the First Malaysia Plan (1966-7(). To offset the contin ued decline of
private investment in agricultural estates, the largest portion, 26 percent, of
public development expenditure in the SMP is earmarked for agricultural and
rural development, followed by 22 percent for transport and communications and
15 percent for social services including education; the allocation for education
alone amounts to 7.4 percent.
14.       if the public investment targets are to be achieved the Government
will have to make a determined effort to expand its capacity to prepare and
implement investment projects; manpower shortages in government departments
and agencies ware a major reason why the targets of the First Plan were not
fully achieved. The steps taken thus far by the Government have not signifi-
cantly improved the situation and hwave been partially offsct by the creation
of new agencies. However, the staffing situation should improve gradually
given the new .3tress within the educational system on technical training.
15.       The MP aims at an annual increase in employment of 3.2 percent, equal
to the increase of the labor force, compared to an anns).l rate of 2.6 percent
achieved during 1966-70.   Unemployment which in 1970 vwas officially estimated
to be 7.3 percent of the labor force would thus renain virtually unchanged.    It
is concentrated in West Malaysia, and is particularly highi aio.ig new entrants
to the labor force: as much as 20 percent of the population in the 15-2L age
group is unemployed and a growing number of them have completed general secondary
education.  However, many of the unenployed ccme from rural areas and their
education makes it difficult for them to be absorbed in the fast growing urban
industries. Alongside the labor surplus Malaysia thus faces a serious shortage
of skills partly caused by the inappropriateness of the educational system.
16.       Mbney is not now a serious obstacle to maintaining a satisfactory rate
of real growth. However, public savings are low and this could become a problem
if the GovernmeTnt succeeded in improving its capacity to carry out projects.
The Government has, therefore, introduced additional taxeE3, the Most important
of which is the 5 percent general sales tax introduced in the 1972 budget.
17.       Export earnings will grow at about 4.2 percent a year in the 1971-75
period compared with a 5.6 percent rate achieved in the preceding, 5 years.   Tiiis
is mainly because the secular decline in the price of rubber is likely to con-
tinue, after a temporary recovery from present low levels, and also because the
past rapid expansion of timber exports is likely to slow down. Cont`inucd growth
is expected in the export of palm oil and perhaps petroleum.    If the Government
succeeds in raising the investment 'Level significantly, imports wiLl Drobably
grow at about 5.h percent a year, causing the present stlrplus on goods and
services account to turn into a small defic't in the mid-seventies.

18.       After taking transfers and unrecorded itmens into account and assuming
the inflow of private foreign capital will grow in line irith private investnent,
external capital requirements during the SK? period in tVie form of gross official
borrowing are projected at about US$100 million a yc Ir comrpared with little over
half that amount in 1966-70. These requirements wrould b'a covered by both pro-
ject and market loans.  In the past, the Bank has provided a0 percent of total
project loans to Malaysia. Bilateral aid, mainly from tIe UJnited Kingdom and
other Commonwealth countries, accounted for another 45 percent and AUB for the
remaining 15 percent. Over the next five years, Japan is expectecl to be the
largest bilaterl3 donor; a second credit line of Yen 36 billion, more than
double the amouit of the first credit line, was signed in early 1972. ADB is
expected to continue expanding its lending. Bank lending is planned to increase
in line with total borrowing.
19.       The projected levels of capital inflow are well within Malaysia's
debt-carrying capacity. Debt service obligations are at present less than
3 percent of exports and will probably remain below 5 percent duiring the
seventies.  External reserves in mid-1971 were almost US$1 billion equivalent,
more than twice the total official debt outstanding and equivalent to 8 months'
imports."

C.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTIONI/
In No. 434   Muda Irrigation Project;  US$450. Million Loan of
November 17, 1965; Closing Date: June 30, 1973
The project includes the construction of facilities to irrigate
about 260,000 acres of land for double cropping with paddy in the States of
Kedah and Perlis. Physical works are now complete except for some minor
items and corrections. Targets for off-season cropping have been reached
during the first two years of operation and 170,000 acres are expected to
be double cropped this year. However initial delays in land acquisition
and execution of works required extensions of the original Closing Date of
June 30, 1970.
Ln No. 500   Kemubu Irrigation Project; Us$10.0 Million Loan of
June 15, 1967; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The project includes the construction of facilities to irrigate
47,000 acres of land for double cropping with paddy in the State of Kelantan.
Project costs are expected to be about one-third above original estimates.
This is due to additional works and design revisions. At the time of
appraisal the economic return was estimated at 13%, but the project is still
justified economically inspite of higher project costs. Physical works are
almost completed except for quarternary canals and 43,000 acres can now be
supplied with irrigation water. However, land preparation is about one year
behind schedule. The original Closing Date was June 30, 1972.
In No. 533   Jengka Triangle Project; US$14.0 Million Loan of
April 17, 1966;  Closing Date:   December 31, 1975
In No. 672   Second Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project;   US$13.0 Million
Loan of May 20, 1970; Closing Date: May 31, 1977
The projects consist of the clearing of forest, the planting of
41,000 acres of oil palms and 18,000 acres of rubber and the settlement of
6,000 families in the Jengka Triangle (State of Pahang). Initial delays in
the land clearance and planting work due to lack of contractors' capacity have
been substantially overcome and implementation is now proceeding satisfactorily.
Ln No. 673   Jengka Forest Project;  US$8.5 Million Loan of
May 20, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
Implementation of the project, consisting of a highly complex
integrated forestry products industry established in the Jengka Triangle, has
suffered because of management and technical problems, which can both be traced
to the lack of previous experience of this kind in Malaysia. However, corrective
steps are being taken and performance is improving.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them._-
