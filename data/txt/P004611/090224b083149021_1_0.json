The local\n            concessionaires, the Manila Water Company Inc. (MWCI) and\n            Maynilad Water Services Inc. (MWSI) were needed to upgrade\n            their piped water supply and sanitation coverage due to\n            expanding franchise areas. To address the challenge, the\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)\n            set out to promote greater private sector participation to\n            improve the sector. IBRD\u2019s involvement in water concessions\n            was based on the rationale that the private sector can play\n            an important role in delivering services. MWCI and IBRD\n            implemented Manila Second Sewerage Project to improve the\n            quality of wastewater and septage management service in\n            Manila and expand MWCI\u2019s sewerage and septage management\n            program. The Manila Third Sewerage Project enhanced septage\n            management, piloted a combined sewer-drainage system\n            approach and promoted advocacy campaigns on the negative\n            environmental impacts of wastewater. Through capital\n            infusion, debt restructuring and infrastructure\n            rehabilitation, both concessionaires managed to accelerate\n            and enhance supply across their franchise areas. MWCI posted\n            a dramatic increase in 24-hour water supply, to 99 percent\n            in 2009 from 26 percent in 1997. MWCI\u2019s investment program\n            reduced the risk of sicknesses from exposure to sewage\n            contamination, which is estimated to have reduced mortality\n            by 20 percent. IBRD has supported two utilities in expanding\n            affordable and efficient water and sewerage services to\n            benefit some 107,000 poor households."}, "docdt": "2010-03-25T09:46:04Z"}
