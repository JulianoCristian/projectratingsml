Lessons learned from the\n            IBRD-financed projects with Manila Water Co. Inc (MWCI) are\n            distilled into the following: community sanitation projects\n            can be successful in low-income communities, provided that\n            regular and timely public information campaigns are\n            carefully conducted and the benefits well-explained; land\n            for sewerage facilities was difficult or costly to secure.\n            Problems associated with land acquisition primarily caused\n            project delays.
