The\n            project's main objectives were to improve operations\n            and maintenance at the port, increase its capacity to handle\n            cargo flow, and help preserve the environment. The project\n            was completed satisfactorily by March 31, 1995. Despite the\n            one-year delay, project implementation was satisfactory\n            because all objectives were achieved. At completion, the\n            project appeared sustainable. The findings and lessons\n            include the following: (a) Xiamen Port Bureau (XPB) capably\n            implemented the construction and procurement of equipment,\n            carried out studies and developed its organization; (b) The\n            flexible project designs included in the project for\n            converting the wharves were essential; they allowed\n            authorities to respond rapidly to changing demand; (c) When\n            Borrowers are unfamiliar with Bank procedures, delays--as\n            occurred with procurement under this project -- are\n            unavoidable. For this reason, the Bank's project\n            workshops are helpful; (d) Performance indicators with\n            regard to port operations, maintenance and environmental\n            quality were clearly stated in the Staff Appraisal Report\n            (SAR) and proved quite useful; (e) Project design was\n            relatively straightforward, which averted the problems with\n            coordination among various agencies; and (f) Courses offered\n            outside the country for managers should be tailored\n            specifically for the staff being sent."}, "docdt": "1995-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
