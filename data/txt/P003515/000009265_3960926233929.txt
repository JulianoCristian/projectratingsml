MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FQR RECONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA FOR A XIAME PORT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
China, for US$36.0 million equivalent, is submitted for approval. The loan
would be for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard variable
interest rate.
2.        Background.  The transport system in China has been severely taxed
by the pace of recent economic development, and capacity constraints are
evident in all modes. China needs to substantially expand its port and
waterway facilities to relieve the growing hindrance to external trade and
domestic transport caused by inadequate berth capacity and container handling
capability.  China's Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90) recognizes these
needs. Substantial investments are envisioned: these include technological
improvements such as container handling facilities and intermodal transport
centers. To facilitate these improvements, major institutional changes are
being carried out in the sector, including an extension of the policy of
separating the functions of Government from those of operating enterprises,
tariff reform and delegating greater authority to local managements. The Bank
fully subscribes to the Government's objectives for developing the transport
sector and is supporting its initiatives with both financial and technical
assistance. Four port projects (Loans 2207-CUA, 2689-CHA, 2877-CHA/Cr 1845-
CHA, and 2907-CHA/Cr 1875-CHA) are assisting in improvements at the ports of
Tianjin, Shanghai, Huangpu and Dalian.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Much of the Bank's previous
involvement in the port sector has been motivated by an urgent need to expand
China's port capacity so that it would not impede the continued expansion of
the economy. The regions served by the project port are no exception and
their future economic growth could be constrained by the limited throughput
capacity of the port. This project will provide much needed additional port
capacity. However,, as a result of the Bank's involvement in the project, far
greater emphasis will be placed on improving the utilization of existing
facilities and maintenance procedures so that future port investments can be
kept to a minimum. Improvement plans were prepared and targets were set to be
achieved within the proposed project. In addition, updating the master plans
of the port will help to rationalize future investments.
4.        Project objectives. The proposed project will focus on:
(i) improving the operating efficiency and the level of maintenance at the
port of Xiamen; (ii) expanding and modernizing physical facilities at Xiamen
port; (iv) training of operational andmsnagerial personnel; and
(v) improvement of the environmental impact of port operations and expansion.



5.        prOiect j tsiription. The proposed project consists of the
following: (a) updating the port's master plan; (b) execution of action plans
to improve operations and maintenances (c) training of operational and
managerial personnel; and (d) construction of one coal, one container and two
multipurpose berths. The project will be implemented by XPB.
6.        In addition, a companion project,(the Ningbo and Shanghai Ports
Project) includes a port costing and management information system (PCMIS)
study which will be carried out by the Ministry of Communications (MOC), the
culmination-of the Bank's dialague with the Government of China on the need to
introduce cost-based tariffs in the country's ports, in order, among other
things, to encourage the use of more efficient cargohandling techniques and
facilities, which will promote the growth of both domestic and international
trade.  The Government plans to introduce the resulting PCMIS initially in
Xiamen, in Ningbo and Shanghai (which are the subject of a separate Bank
loan), and in Dalian (which is currently assisted by the Bank through Loan
2907-A and Credit 1875-iCA).
7.        The total cost of the project is estimated at $90.3 million, with a
foreign exchange component of $57.0 million. The financing plan is shown in
Schedule A and the procurement method and disbursements in Schedule B.
B.        Agreed Actions.  The Government will onlend the proceeds of the Bank
loan to XPB through the Xiamen Municipal Government (XKG). The on-lending'
terms from GOC to XMG and from XMG to XPB will be the same: for 20 years
including 5 years of grace at an interest rate of 5X p.a. These terms are
satisfactory to the Bank. Assurances. were obtained from XPB to: (a) submit
to the Bank its audited financial statements not later than 6 months after the
end of each financial year; (b) carry out the updating of the port master plan
on the basis of terms of reference agreed with the Bank; and (c) conduct its
financial affairs so as to cover all its costs of operation from operating
revenue and to meet from internally generated funds all its financial obliga-
tions. Understandings were reached with XPB that it will: (a) carry out the
training in accordance with the program agreed with the Bank; (b) carry out an
environmental monitoring scNeme according to terms of reference agreed with
the Bank; and (c) implement the agreed action plan to improve port operations,
maintenance and the environment and reach the specified productivity
targets. Approval of the loan agreement by China's State Council and
execution of subsidiary loan agreements between the Government and XMG, and
between XKG and XPB, are conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
9.        Justification and Risks.  In 1987 the average waiting time for ships
arriving at Xiamen port was obout 4 days. Projected increases in traffic
would cause additional substantial congestion in the future. Economic
benefits of the proposed project derive from: (i) ship time savings; (ii)
cargo handling cost savings; (iii) cargo time savings. On this basis, the
economic rate of return on the project at Xiamen is 31X. The only risks
foreseen for the projects are of delays in construction attributable to
domestic procedures for civil works international competitive bidding. While
delays will not seriously affect the ERR, XPB will make adequate engineering
preparation to minimize the possibility of any delay.



-3-
10.       Recoumen4ation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and reconuend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

/b As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and the
SDR. In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater
than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
Note: The status of the projects listed in Part A is described in a separate report on all
Bank/IDA financial projects in execution, which is updated twice yearly and circulated t
the Executive Directors on April 30 and October 31.
