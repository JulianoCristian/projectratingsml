ARTICLE I
General Conditions; Definitions
Section 1.01. The parties to this Agreement accept all
the provisions of the General Conditions Applicable to Loan and
Guarantee Agreements of the Bank dated October 27, 1980, with
the same force and effect as if they were fully set forth herein,
subject, however, to the modifications thereof set forth in
Schedule 3 to each of the Loan Agreements described in the Pream-
ble to this Agreement (said General Conditions Applicable to Loan
and Guarantee Agreements, as so modified, being hereinafter called
the General Conditions), provided, however, that:
(a) the term "Borrower" shall be read to refer to PBS, SBS,
IBT or KBP, as the case may be;
(b) the term "Loan Agreement" shall be read to refer to
either the Loan Agreement referred to in the Preamble to the
Guarantee Agreement and concluded with PBS, or the Loan Agreement
referred to in the Preamble to the Guarantee Agreement and con-
cluded with SBS, or the Loan Agreement referred to in the Preamble
to the Guarantee Agreement and concluded with IBT, or the Loan
Agreement referred to in the Preamble to the Guarantee Agreement
and concluded with KBP, as the case may be;
(c) the term "Loan" shall be read to refer to the Loan

the Loan Account to which the amount of any given Loan is

ARTICLE II
Guarantee
Section 2.01. Without limitation or restriction upon any
of its other obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, the


﻿-3-
Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor
and not as surety merely, the due and punctual payment of the
principal of, and interest and other charges on, each Loan, and
the premium, if any, on the prepayment of each of the Loans, all
as set forth in the Loan Agreement concerned.
ARTICLE III
Other Covenants
Section 3.01. (a) It is the policy of the Bank, in making
loans to, or with the guarantee of, its members not to seek, in
normal circumstances, specific security from the member concerned
but to ensure that no other external debt shall have priority
over its loans in the allocation, realization or distribution of
foreign exchange held under the control or for the benefit of such
member. To that end, if any lien shall be created on any public
assets (as hereinafter defined), as security for any external
debt, which will or might result in a priority for the benefit of
the creditor of such external debt in the allocation, realization
or distribution of foreign exchange, such lien shall, unless the
Bank shall otherwise agree, ipso facto, and at no cost to the
Bank, equally and ratably secure the principal of, and interest
and other charges on, each Loan, and the Guarantor, in creating
or permitting the creation of such lien, shall make express
provision to that effect; provided, however, that, if for any
constitutional or other legal reason such provision cannot be made
with respect to any lien created on assets of any of its political
or administrative subdivisions, the Guarantor shall promptly and
at no cost to the Bank secure the principal of, and interest and
other charges on, each Loan by an equivalent lien on other public
assets satisfactory to the Bank.
(b) The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i)
any lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof,
solely as security for payment of the purchase price of such
property; and (ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course of
banking transactions and securing a debt maturing not more
than one year after its date.
(c) As used in this Section, the term "public assets"
means assets of the Guarantor, of any political or administrative
subdivision thereof and of any entity owned or controlled by,
or operating for the account or benefit of, the Guarantor or any
such subdivision, including gold and other foreign exchange


﻿4-
assets held by any institution performing the functions of a
central bank or exchange stabilization fund, or similar functions,
for the Guarantor.
Section 3.02. The Guarantor covenants that it will not take,
or cause or permit to be taken, any action which would prevent or
interfere with the performance by PBS, SBS, IBT or KBP of their
respective obligations contained in each Loan Agreement and
that, within the limits of its constitutional powers, it will take
or cause to be taken all reasonable action necessary or appro-
priate to enable each of PBS, SBS, IBT and KBP to perform such
obligations.
