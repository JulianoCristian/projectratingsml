Modernization Project\n            will provide funds to about 70 agroprocessing enterprises to\n            modernize their facilities and to incorporate improved\n            management, marketing and technology into their operations.\n            Modern, up to date equipment for packaging, canning,\n            bottling, chilling, freezing and cold storage of food and\n            food products will be the major areas for plant improvement.\n            The project will moreover finance computer software and\n            consultant services for those firms which want to install\n            inventory control systems, cost accounting, (including\n            anagement information systems), and other operations\n            requiring automation. It will also support the upgrading of\n            support services also in terms of : (a) export trade\n            promotion and marketing; (b) training in management and\n            marketing; (c) grading and quality control of raw materials\n            and final products; and (d) research and development.\n            Lastly, the project will seek to restructure the glass and\n            can container industries to improve the position of the\n            agroprocessing enterprise in export markets. The project\n            subsectors are poultry, processed fruits and vegetables,\n            wine and fruit juices and wood products."}, "docdt": "1988-04-11T00:00:00Z"}
