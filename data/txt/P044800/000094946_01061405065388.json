Project,\n            which aims to establish a sound forest management system.\n            Mitigation measures focus on reforming laws, although\n            environmental impacts are also discussed. Reforms will\n            improve forest legislation by adding enforcement provisions,\n            removing contradictions in overlapping laws, amending the\n            tax and customs code, creating incentives for law\n            enforcement agencies to implement sanctions for illegal\n            actions, and issuing laws and regulations concerning\n            environmental impact assessments and environmental permits.\n            Direct action to protect forests include: incorporating the\n            notions of multiple uses and prevailing functions in the\n            Forest Code to avoid erosion and protect the soil and nearby\n            water bodies, while allowing tourist and cultural uses of\n            the forest; monitoring illegal cutting operations and\n            imposing penalties; minimizing adverse impacts from road\n            construction by using equipment and construction methods\n            adapted to particular conditions; and stopping skidding\n            operations during harvesting to avoid soil compaction and\n            waterlogging. The construction of roads in remote areas will\n            increase the pressure on hunted species. Biodiversity would\n            be severely affected by forestry activities if they induce\n            deforestation, but this eventuality is unlikely to take\n            place in the Laboratory Zone."}, "docdt": "2001-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
