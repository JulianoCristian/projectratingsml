Project for Georgia were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was high,\n            Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: community involvement in forestry management\n            involves complex social, institutional, and regulatory\n            issues, which must be identified and incorporated in project\n            design during preparation. Sustainable forest sector reforms\n            require bottom-up support, which must be fostered at the\n            initial stages. Strong central leadership offers great\n            opportunities for reform, but these can only be sustained in\n            the longer term with strong local buy-in. Projects spanning\n            a period of significant change in policy direction, as well\n            as political volatility, require enhanced\n            engagement/supervision. This should include bringing in\n            outside experts, mobilizing senior Bank management, and\n            flexibly shifting the focus of the project while retaining\n            overall goals (which indeed the Bank did). Unfortunately\n            even when this is done, the gap between the Borrower and the\n            Bank may simply be too big and the best approach is to\n            recognize this as quickly as possible and close the project.\n            Yet even in such disengagement situations, the Bank has a\n            responsibility to continue to provide its professional views."}, "docdt": "2009-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
