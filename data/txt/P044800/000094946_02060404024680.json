There are three main\n            project components. The first improves forest sector\n            governnance through national regulatory, financial, and\n            institutional reforms. The second component improves forest\n            planning and management in the Central Caucasus pilot area.\n            The third component supports forest protection and\n            reforestation in selected priority areas."}, "docdt": "2002-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
