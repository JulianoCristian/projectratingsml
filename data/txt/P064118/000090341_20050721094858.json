Lessons learned: difficult\n            policy and institutional reforms, of the scope of WATSAL,\n            require four conditions to be fulfilled. WATSAL provided\n            balance-of-payments support against a negative list of\n            expenditures instead of providing import support based on a\n            positive list of eligible, sector-related imports as is more\n            common for sector adjustment operations. Piloting of\n            controversial or complex aspects of a reform program, prior\n            to or during the loan period creates confidence and\n            generates political support. From the perspective of Loan\n            Performance, enactment of a law should be avoided, if\n            possible, as common sense suggests. In the WATSAL case, the\n            drafting of the law and the regulations was undertaken by an\n            inter-agency and multi-disciplinary Task Force having NGO\n            representation. For a major reform program, funding is\n            needed for Task Force expenses. A multi-tranche sector\n            reform takes time and requires higher than average Bank\n            funding for supervision, and for communication and translations."}, "docdt": "2005-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
