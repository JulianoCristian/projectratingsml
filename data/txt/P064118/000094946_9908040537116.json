regarding water management, and it proposes mitigation\n            options. The lack of transparency and accountability will be\n            offset by encouraging nongovernmental organizations to act\n            as permanent advisory members to the national apex body that\n            will be established to address the overall weakness in\n            implementing environmental regulations. The participation of\n            stakeholders will also be increased through strengthening\n            provincial and river basin water resources management\n            agencies, committees, and units. To address water pollution,\n            particularly urban pollution from household waste and\n            agricultural chemicals, long-term programs of institutional\n            and infrastructure development and training and promotion\n            programs (e.g., integrated pest management and frequent\n            media campaigns) will be installed. To allay concerns about\n            the capacity of water users' associations to handle\n            irrigation reform and the transfer of secondary canals, and\n            about the varying patterns of community leadership between\n            the regions, a recommendation was made to phase in these\n            responsibilities while continuously reviewing and revising\n            the transfer procedure."}, "docdt": "1999-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
