PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "This is the Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) of the Municipal and Housing Development\n            Project (PGDU) of Senegal. The project achieved its\n            objectives in the institutional and financial aspects, and\n            the physical objectives were largely met. Therefore, the\n            project's outcome can be rated satisfactory. The Bank\n            performance was considered satisfactory; and the performance\n            of the borrower was mixed. The major objectives of the\n            project were to: (i) develop the organizational, technical,\n            and financial capacities of the local governments of the\n            Greater Dakar area; and (ii) expand the efficiency of the\n            housing sector by removing financial and institutional\n            constraints to the Housing Bank of Senegal (BHS), and\n            improving the operation of the urban land market through\n            annual supply of a significant number of serviced and titled\n            plots. The major lessons learned from this project are as\n            follows: for a project to be manageable, it is crucial to\n            keep it as simple as possible. This project was highly\n            complicated and therefore difficult to implement and\n            supervise. Components such as the fiscal cadastre are too\n            complex and costly. Both costs and complexities are often\n            driven by suppliers eager to sell their high tech products."}, "docdt": "1997-11-25T00:00:00Z"}
