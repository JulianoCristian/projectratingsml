INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE MORTGAGE BANK OF FINLAND OY WITH THE GUARANTEE
OF THE REPUBLIC OF FINLAND
FOR A WATER POLLUTION CONTROL PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Mortgage Bank of Finland Oy, with the guarantee of the Republic
of Finland, for the equivalent of US$20 million to help finance a water pollu-
tion control project. The loan would have a term of 15 years, including
two years of grace, with interest at 8 1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Finland" (EMA-31a) dated January 22, 1971 was distributed to the Executive
Directors in January 1971 (R71-21). A memorandum updating that report,
entitled "Current Economic Developments in Finland" (EMA-44a) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on January 17, 1972 (R72-22). Country data are
presented in Annex I.
3.        Since the early 1960's, Finland's rate of economic growth has
averaged about 5 percent per year, with per capita GNP increasing at about
4.5 percent annually during the period 1964-73. These high long-term growth
rates, however, conceal large year-to-7ear fluctuations reflecting interna-
tional demand and prices of wood, pulp, and paper products. Although the
structure of Finnish industry has been increasingly diversified, economic
development is still heavily dependent on the wood-processing industry, which
accounted for about 53 percent of total commodity exports in 1971-3, compared
to about 80 percent in the early 1950's.
4.        Finland's pulp and paper industry is the second largest in Europe,
ranking after Sweden, and has a share of about 5-6 percent of world pulp
exports and 15-16 percent of world paper and paperboard exports. Although
raw material and energy costs are generally higher than those of competitors ',
Finnish wood processing industries as a whole are able to maintain a compe-
titive position in the world market. Their main advantages are good infra-
structure, a high level of technology, short transport distances to main
markets and Government support in trade agreements with customer countries.
Over half of the Finnish exports of wood products and pulp and paper are
absorbed by the European Communities (EC) and this share is expected to in-
crease to two-thirds within the next few years. In view of an estimated
supply deficit of 10 million tons of paper and paperboard in the EC as of
1980, the outlook of the wood-processing industries is favorable.
5.        The 1971 slowdown in economic activity in Finland was followed by
two years of recovery when GDP grew an average 6.5 percent per year in real



terms. In 1974, however, GDP growth was estimated to be only 5.3 percent, as
oxport growth decelerated from 14.5 percent in 1972 to half that rate in 1973
aad an estimated 6 percent in 1974.   The declining growth in output waa not
raztchld Lby an equal reduction in aggregate demand, so that imports grew by
about 14 percenc in 1973 and are estimated to have grown by 9 percent in 1974.
The skiarp acceleration in import growth and the reduced rates of GDP growth
reflected an acute shortage of skilled labor and production capacity.
6.        The trend in the labor market since 1971 has been for sharply falling
rates fr unemploymeiat, rising wages and a reversal of worker outmigration.
The unemployment rate fell from a peak of 2.7 percent in the third quarter of
1971 to 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 1973 and continued to fall during
the first half of 1974 to the lowest point in 10 years. Regional differences
in unemployment, however, have persisted, with the northern region having an
above-average unemployment rate. The decline in the overall unemployment
rate occurred despite the fact of a net immigration, mostly from Sweden, of
5,800 workers in 1973 reversing the former trend of emigration. Tlis fol-
lowed from a divergence in business cycle conditions in the two countries but
may also liave been due to wage increases in Finland. In 1973, average wages
rose 15 percent compared to, 11.4 percent in 1972; they are estimated to have
risen by 18 percent in 1974.
7.        As a combined result of supply shortages, rising labor costs and
i;ncreased import prices, the rate of inflation increased sharply in 1973 and
has accelerated further in 1974. Compared to 7-8 percent price increases in
1971, consumer prices rose by 10.7 percent in 1973, wholesale prices by 13.8
percent, and the GDP deflator by 13.6 percent. Because of rapid consumer
price increases in 1974, estimated at 17 percent for the year, the Government
instituited extensive price controls. Also, as part of the incomes settlement
o£ March 9.. 1974, prices of 97 percent of the items included in the Consumer
Price Index were frozen during March-August 1974; but effective September 1,
1974, the coverage has been reduced to 67 percent. The extensive use of
price controls reflects the priority given to curbing the rate of inflation
in Finland, which in the second half of 1974 was running 3 percentage points
above the OECD average of 14 percent.
8.        With strong demand and shortages of capacity, the balance of pay-
ments has come under pressure.   Although the terms of trade improved somewhat
in 1973, due to favorable export prices, a decline of about 7 percent is
estimated for 1974. The current account deficit was $414 million in 1973. It
is estimated that the deficit reached $1150 million in 1974 largely as a
result of is'ing oil prices. The deficit in 1973 was equivalent to 2.2 per-
cent of GDP at market prices, compared to 0.9 percent in 1972 and, with the
sharp increase in fuel prices, is expected to be about 5 percent of GDP in
1974. As long-term capital inflows have declined sharply in the face of rising
interest rates, the overall balance of payments position moved from a surplus
of $231 million in 1972 to a deficit of $148 million in 1973, and about $70
million in the first half of 1974. The deterioration was largely attributable
to increased oil payments which more than offset the increase in convertible
foreign exchange earnings recorded in the first half of 1974. Finland imports
abouc two-thirds of its oil requirements from USSR and the rest from the Middle
East.



-3-
9.        The longer-run prospects for development depend to a significant
extent on the relationship with the European Communities (EC) and other trade
partners. Finland negotiated a free trade agreement with the EC which became
operational in the beginning of 1974. The agreement provides for progressive
mutual abolition of customs duties on industrial products over 11 years, with
most of the reduction to occur within four and one-half years. The customs
reductions on most industrial products are 40 percent as of January 1, 1974,
20 percent each year thereafter, ending with 20 percent on July 1, 1977. In
the case of certain sensitive products (e.g. paper and paperboard), the tariff
dismantlement will take place over an 11 year period. Because of Finland's
development requirements, certain labor-intensive sectors will be protected
until 1985 (the products involved cover about one-third of Finland's imports
from the original EC countries subject to custom duties). Finland is also
negotiating free trade agreements with the socialist countries and has
recently signed an agreement with their Council for Mutual Economic Assistance
which provides a framework for cooperation in various fields. In terms of
actual trade, the EC agreement is much more important since the EC buy about
half of Finland's exports compared to 15 percent taken by the Socialist coun-
tries. Finland, as a neutral nation, has historically had a special relation-
ship with the USSR and trade with the Soviet Union accounts for 10-11 percent
of total Finnish trade. A sixth long-term trade agreement between Finland
and the USSR, for the years 1976-1980, was concluded in September, 1974.
10.       Gross official reserves declined by about $114 million or 18 per-
cent in 1973. The ratio of gross official reserves to imports fell to 14
percent at the end of 1973, compared with 21 percent at the end of 1972. The
net inflow of long-term capital of $116 million in 1973 was only 30 percent
of the average in the two preceding years, due primarily to the deterioration
in the world capital market. During the first three quarters in 1974, the
net inflow of long-term capital amounted only to $78 million. The greatest
part of the medium- and long-term borrowing took the form of financial credits
and suppliers credits. Bond issues, which have increased steadily since 1966
and contributed to the improvement of the repayment structure of Finland's
foreign debt, were particularly hard hit by the difficult situation on the
financial markets, resulting in a decrease in bond issues in both 1973 and
1974. The amount of loans from foreign governments and international organiza-
tions continued to diminish in 1973. Amortizations, on the other hand, rose
considerably, and even slightly exceeded the amount of new credits. Direct
investment in Finland was roughly equal to investment abroad by Finnish enter-
prises, and the amounts involved were below the average of recent years. As
in the past, growing imports and tight money policies necessitated a sub-
stantial inflow of short-term capital in 1973. Nevertheless, for 1973 as a
whole, net capital inflow amounted to $120 million, which was considerably
less than the average for 1968-72. As a result of the strong import growth,
the short-term import debt rose substantially during the first three quarters
of 1974. Moreover, short-term export credits declined markedly also in the
first months of 1974. Thus in the first half of 1974 net short-term capital
inflow amounted to $375 million against $112 million in the same period of
1973.



- 4 -
11.       In 1972, 18 long-term loans amounting to $153 million had been
raised by Finnish borrowers on the Eurobond market, but in 1973 and 1974 the
number of loans declined to three for each year, for a total amount of about
$40 million and $32 million respectively; this was a result of the tight
market conditions. There have recently been indications that Finland may be
able to raise some long-term capital in oil producing countries. Nevertheless,
Finland has chronically been a capital short country and all indications are
that it will remain so in the near future.
12.       Finland's total external debt (including undisbursed) was about
US$2,120 million on December 31, 1973. External public debt was US$1,469
million, and the debt outstanding to the Bank US$104 million oni the same date.
Debt seivice ratio on total debt was 10.9 percent in 1973; and on public debt
about 5.2 percent in 1973 as compared with 4.5 percent in 1972 and about 3
percent in 1971. These figures and the present debt structure indicate that,
while there are limitations to Finland's reliance on suppliers' and financial
credits, its overall borrowing capacity remains substantial, and the country
is creditworthy for Bank lending.
13.       Finland's principal economic objectives reflect the desire to
promote continued and stable growth with an emphasis on equitable income dis-
tribution based on high employment rates and balanced regional development.
While inflation and the balance of payments burden have imposed strains on the
economv, the Government has attacked these problems using a combination of
instruments including wage and price controls, the adoption of a floating
exchange rate and, as evidenced by Finland's increased trade linkage to the
EC, a more open posture in the foreign trade sector. This last factor should
also serve to improve Finland's status in world money markets. As recent
trends have shown, Finland's economic growth is diversifying the economy and
contributing to a more mature structure. As a consequence, with the country's
per capita GNP now in excess of US$2,810 (the 1972 estimate) it is appropriate
for policy to give more attention to the qualitative factors associated with
development, not least of all affecting the environment and the preservation
of natural resources.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       The Bank has made seventeen loans to Finland, totalling $296.5 mil-
lion. Disbursements under all projects have been completed except for the
two latest loans: the 1970 loan to the Industrial Fund of Finland (708-FI)
under which disbursements are expected to be completed by July, 1975, and
the 1972 Forestry loan (871-FI) to be d4-sbursed by June 30, 1976. Bank
lending has been concentrated on the development and diversification of the
Finish industry (13 loans totalling $215.3 million between 1949 and 1970);
the proposed loan would be the first loan made by the Bank exclusively for
controlling industrial water pollution. Performance under all previous loans
has been satisfactory.



t5.       IFC extended loans to four Finnish enterprises, totalling $3.15
million. The loans have all been fully repaid. IFC has no equity holdings
in Finland, and currently has no projects under consideration. Annex II con-
tains a summary statepAent of Bank loans and IFC investments as of February 28,
a975 and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
16.       Although Bank lending has contributed only a small portion (less
than 5 percent on average per year since the Bank's first loan to Finland) to
the gross inflow of medium- and long-term capital to Finland, association
with the Bank has enabled Finland to borrow more at reasonable terms on the
international capital market than it could otherwise have done. In recent
years, Finland has been able to make increasing use of the international
capital market to meet its need for long-term external capital, except for
the last two years when the market situation was unfavorable. Although still
particularly vulnerable to market fluctuations because of its geographical
position, it is expected that Finland will in the future be able to obtain
the capital in world markets which it requires for development projects.
Hence, no further Bank lending to Finland is envisaged beyond the loan now
proposed.
PART III - INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION OF WATER RESOURCES
17.       Finland has approximately 60,000 lakes which take up about 10 per-
cent of the country's total area. The average depth of the lakes is only
seven meters. The economic life of Finland is greatly dependent upon and
influenced by the water system. About 85 percent of all goods in foreign
trade move on the Baltic, and 20 percent of domestic goods traffic is on
lakes, rivers and canals. As a result of high consumption by wood-processing
industries, the use of water in Finland exceeds that of any other country in
Europe, on a per capita basis. Although the total quantity of water used in
these industries is declining due to changes in technology and pollution
control measures, other industries such as in the chemical and metal sectors
are constantly increasing their water consumption. Municipalities draw about
70 percent of their water from surface resources and 30 percent from ground
water. Water resources are regarded as property in Finland, and private
ownership of water is established by law. Although "usus publicus" is also
recognized, the use of water bodies for disposal of waste is legitimate,
subject to legal restrictions which have been progressively strengthened.
Water pollution caused by the dispersed run-off from land sources such as
farming, livestock and forestry, is insignificant compared to pollution by
industry.
18.       Finland's lakes are especially susceptible to pollution because
they are shallow and have a rich organic load (humus) which can lower the
water quality even without the effect of man-made pollution.    Unlike rivers,
the water in Finland's lakes has a relatively low capacity to process waste
materials. The ice which covers the lakes for an average 160-200 days a year
prevents aeration, and at the end of the summer thermal stratification occurs.
Seacoast areas are seriously polluted by industry and shipping.



19.       It is estimated that nearly a quarter of the total lake area aud
most of the rivers are significantly polluted; river outlets on the coast
are among the worst polluted areas. About half of the total population live
near either severely or mildly polluted water, and about a fourth of the
population lives in areas where the municipal water supply is taken fzom
surfact sources whose quality is marginal. The trend of continued urbaniza-
tion _l; irustrialization indicates that pollution will accelerate uniess
effective counter-measures are taken as soon as possible.
20.       Axong all the polluters of Finland's water resource&, it la 4 n-
dustry, particularly wood-processing, which is contributing the biggest load
of pollutants. Effluents discharged by Finland's wood-processing industries
are significantly higher than the average for all 16 OECD countries. The
Bank proiect as described in Part IV of this report would exclusively deal
with industrial water pollution as part of a ten-year National Program for
Water Pollution Control. (paras. 23 - 27)
21.       Finland's effort to control water pollution started in 1902 when
the Water Act was passed, which has been in effect with subsequent amendments
for about sixty years. In 1962, a new Water Act was passed to control water
pollution caused by post-war industrial development. The first specific
investments by industry to control pollution were made in the 1950's, in sul-
fite pulp mills. A general estimate indicates that in the two years between
1971 and 1973 industry investments for anti-pollution measures were about twice
as high as in the four-year period 1966-70. The wood-processing industries
accounted for two-thirds of the totals, with the pulp and paper mills located
on lakes contributing the largest share of investment. To provide filnancial
incentives for investment in pollution control, the Government established
several specific programs of assistance. Since 1960, loans from an export
levy fund have been made available for this purpose with a maximum term of
ten years, including two year's grace, at an interest rate of 5-6 pereent. In
1968, the tax laws were modified to permit full (100%) straightline deprecia-
tion on pollution control equipment at 25 percent per year, compared to 30
percent per year permitted on a declining balance basis for ordinary capital
equipment (resulting in total depreciation of 76 percent over four years).
Furthermore, the Government will also guarantee, for a small fee, commercial
loans to industries for pollution control investments with a maximum term of
20 years.
22.       Because of the huge demand for funds for pollution control invest-
ment (over Fmk 1,000 million from 1969 to 1973), the inherent limitations
of the above programs, and the chronic capital shortage of the financial
community which is not disposed to make loans for non-productive investments,
the Give:inment realized that a major funding effort wculd be required if the
long-te:r; goals for reducing water pollution by industry were to be attained.
Therefore, the GovernmIent is undertaking a national program (1974-1983) which
will channel investment capital to industry from the public sextor.



- 7 -
The National Program for Water Pollution Control
23.       In July 1974, the Government published the National Program for
Water Pollution Control which covers the period between 1974 and 1983. On a
nationwide basis, the targets set in the program are a reduction in Bioche-
mical Oxygen Demand - BOD - (common unit of measurement for a wide assortment
of organic materials which, as they decompose, use up dissolved oxygen con-
tained in water) by 52 percent and phosphorus by 40 percent, from 1972 levels,
while the discharge of toxic and accumulative substance is to be stopped
entirely; suspended solids from wood processing will be reduced by 80 percent
and other industrial waste waters should be treated to the same level as
domestic sewage. The "polluter pays" principle is the basic guideline of the
program, with some exceptions in which the public sector bears the cost. These
exceptions include the need to ensure an industry's competitiveness, to main-
tain the financial solvency of a particular firm, to keep up employment and
to develop a specific region.
24.       Total pollution control costs of industry for the 1974-1983 period
are difficult to estimate because of the many unknown variables, such as
future technological developments in this new field. The latest estimates
show that total costs for industrial pollution control under the national
program would be Fmk 1800 million or $504 million (about 20 percent in foreign
exchange), of which the woodworking industry's share is estimated at 65 per-
cent or Fmk 1170 million ($323 million).
25.       The national program will be financed from the following sources:
Fmk (million)      Z
693          38.5  Mortgage Bank of Finland Oy
(MBF)
693          38.5  Postipankki-Post Office
Bank-(POB) and Government
414          23.0  Polluting Industries
1800         100.0    self-financing
26.       The program will be carried out through loans made jointly by MBF,
POB, and Government for water pollution control investments undertaken by
industry. MBF is a subsidiary of the central bank and specializes in long-
term loans to industry (para. 28). POB is a fully Government-owned institu-
tion and is entrusted to handle the bulk of the Treasury's dealings with the
public. POB operates as a normal commercial bank and is also responsible for
financing public sector projects through the administration of Government
budgetary appropriations. The main planning and executing agency of the
program is the National Board of Waters (NBW) whose main functions are to
promote and supervise the use, care and research of water resources. NBW was
established in 1970 under the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and has
over 1,300 employees.



- 8 -
27.       Industrial water use in Finland is based on the licensitq systre.
Each wacer license is specifically tailored to the requirements of the ap-
plicarnt, the characteristics of the recipient water body and the nature of
the effluent discharged. One of the main functions of NI-W is to examine
license applications and supervise recipients of licenses. Issuance and re-
view of licenses based on NBW's reports are the responsibility of tfhe three
district Water Courts established under the Water Act of 1962. For criminal
suits and damages there is a Water Court of Appeals and, for changing. the
terms of permits, a Supreme Administrative Court. In many cases, applications
for water pollution control loans originate because water-users are bound to
make investments under the conditions put in the license or need to obtain
a new license in order to continue their operations. It should be noted that,
under the present system, granting a water use license is not based on a least
cost analysis of the entire watershed where the industrial licensee is located.
Rather, as mentioned above, the Water Courts take into account that each
license applicant has its own particular effluents, control technolcgy, econ-
omic circumstances and recipient water body conditions. However, as In the
case of the possible subsidies available under POB loans (see para. 34 below),
it is not considered that the licensing system will currently present a
departure from the least cost solution to any significant extent, because
marginal costs of pollution control are so low at present; but it Lasy present
a problem in the future when the marginal cost goes up considerably. It
should also be noted that the system has already been established and is
operative, and that it would take years of cumbersome legislative process to
amend or abolish the system in order to satisfy the least cost requirement
on a national scale.
PART IV -- THE PROJECT
The Project History
28.       Bank assistance in pollution control was first discussed with the
Government in 1970 and the project was reviewed by Bank missions in May of
1972, and April and September of 1973. A mission visited Finland in November
1973 to review and develop a methodology for the economic evaluation of the
project. Following detailed discussions with a Finnish delegation in June
1974, the project was appraised in October/November. Negotiations were held
in Washington from March 14 to 21, 1975. The Finnish delegation was led by
Mr. Heikki Valvanne, Managing Director of Mortgage Bank of Finland Cy, and
included representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the National Board of
Waters, and MBF.
The Borrower
29.       The Borrower for the proposed loan would be the Mortgage Bank of
Finland Oy (MBF), which is a public joint stock company set up in 1956 with
the central bank and POB as the main shareholders. Its primary function
is to relend the proceeds of long-term loans, initially obtained from the



- 9 -
IBRD, to Finnish industry. MBF has borrowed $102 million from the Bank, of
which $62 million were for wood-processing industries and $40 million for the
power sector.  MBF's performance under its past loans from the Bank has been
fully satisfactory. The quality of its portfolio is good, and its current
and projected financial position is sound. MBF is well-managed and credit-
worthy for another Bank loan, of $20 million. It is a small highly competent
organization which has accumulated significant experience in dealings with
the larger industrial firms in Finland. MBF is well-qualified to appraise
and supervise pollution control investments by industries in cooperation
with NBW. MBF would submit sub-projects, to be financed out of the Bank loan
proceeds, to the Bank for review and authorization. Although there is no
statutory limit in lending amounts, the maximum subloan would be 20 percent
of MBF's equity i.e. about $4 million at present. HBF loans would be secured
by valid mortgages, chattel mortgages or bank and state guarantees.
Project Description
30.       The project has been formulated on the basis of a widespread demand
in Finland to reduce industrial water pollution even at the expense of some
economic growth. The Bank's involvement would contribute to full implementa-
tion of the national program, which just started at the end of 1974, by pro-
viding part of the needed foreign exchange, institution building and further
refinement of the program through research. The project would consist of
Bank assistance in (i) financing sub-loans made by MBF for pollution control
investments undertaken by industry during 1975-77, and (ii) designing research
and studies in order to make the national program more effective. Any invest-
ments financed by a subloan made by MBF out of the proceeds of the Bank loan
would be exclusively for pollution control. About two-thirds of the number
of projects to be financed by the proceeds of the Bank loan are expected to
be in the pulp and paper industry, the single largest polluter of the country.
The most immediate requirement in the research component of the project would
be to establish the most efficient means for monitoring and for collecting
data on water quality. A medium-term objective would be to develop cost
benefit and systems analysis which could be used to develop alternative
approaches to pollution control before 1980, when marginal costs are expected
to start to rise sharply. The research component would also include the
NBW's participation in developing an aquatic eco-system model of the Baltic
Sea useful in measuring the effect of Finland's national program on the Baltic.
A large international research effort on the Baltic is underway as a result
of the Helsinki Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the
Baltic Sea Area. This convention was signed on March 22, 1974, by the govern-
ments of the seven countries bordering the Baltic Sea (USSR, Finland, Sweden,
Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, German Democratic Republic, and Poland)
and is the first comprehensive agreement in the world for the conservation
of a marine environment.   Annex III contains a loan and project summary; the
Appraisal Report (No. 648a-FI dated April 15, 1975) is being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors.

Project Execution
31.       The project would cover two and one-half years of the national
program, from about July 1, 1975 to December 31, 1977 during which period
about 50 water pollution control sub-projects will be undertaken by indus-
try. Each application for a pollution control loan would be appraised by
a group within NBW for its economic and technical aspects. NBW's appraisal
and subsequent recommendation would be assessed by the Commission for Water
Pollution Control Loans which carries the overall responsibility for financ-
ing the national program and which is composed of high-level representatives
of the ministries concerned plus MBF, POB and the NBW. The financial aspects
of the application would be independently appraised by MBF and POB and would
include an evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower. The two banks
will apply their own lending criteria in addition to the general criteria set
forth by the Government for pollution control loans. To be eligible, the
applicant must have been in operation as of September 1, 1973; plants estab-
lished since that date are eligible only under exceptional circumstances.
MBF subloans out of the proceeds of the Bank loan would be for sub-projects
having a zero or negative financial rate of return in order to ensure that
Bank funds are used only for pollution control investments which cause no
productivity increase whatsoever. The reason for this limitation is that
Bank lending to industry in Finland for productive purposes ceased in 1970.
(Apart from the Bank loan, other financing by Government for pollution
control investments under the national program is available for investments
with a financial rate of return of up to 10 percent). Supervision of borrowers
is done jointly by NBW, MBF and POB. NBW would continue to provide technical
and operational support to MBF in appraisal and supervision activities. The
research component of the project would be carried out by NBW with assistance
from consultants according to guidelines provided by the Bank and accepted by
the Government.
Project Costs and Financing
32.       The aggregate capital cost of pollution control investments during
1975-77 is estimated at Fmk 560 million ($157 million) with a foreign ex-
change component of about Fmk 112 million ($31 million). A Bank loan of $20
million would thus meet about 65 percent of foreign exchange requirements over
the 1975-77 period. The rest of the foreign exchange required would come from
MBF which would raise necessary funds in the international market and from the
central bank. The Bank loan would be made to MBF, with the guarantee of the
Government, for a term of 15 years, including two years grace, at an interest
rate of 8-1/2 percent.
33.       The total cost of the research component of the project has been
roughly estimated at Fmk 3.9 million ($1.1 million) of which approximately
62 percent ($675,000) would be in foreign exchange. The Government and other
Finnish institutions will bear the costs and make available the facilities
and manpower needed to carry out the research component.



Relending Terms
34.       Generally, each MBF sub-loan would be half in foreign exchange
(using inter alia the proceeds of the Bank loan), half in local currency, and
would bear a rate about 1/4 of 1 percent below the standard term loan rate
to industry (the reason for this differentiation is that MBF's borrowers must
carry the foreign exchange risk). Using this formula, MBF's composite lending
rate would currently be 9 1/2 percent, i.e. 9 percent on foreign exchange and
10 percent on local currency. In the case of POB loans (which would not be
financed from Bank loan proceeds), there will be an interest subsidy available
on a case-by-case basis, currently amounting to 2 1/4 - 3 1/4 percent, which
is only about 1 1/4 percent of total investment cost, because the maximum
participation of POB in a pollution control investment loan cannot exceed
38.5 percent of the total cost. This interest subsidy would be graduated
according to the unprofitability of the investment and is too small to affect
investment decisions significantly. The Government considers the subsidy
desirable in order to ensure the fullest cooperation of industry and makes a
practice of such assistance when investments have a social purposes. The
maximum term of MBF and POB loans would be 15 years including a maximum grace
period of five years.
Procurement and Disbursements
35.       Funds from the Bank loan would be allocated to cover 20 percent of
the total cost of sub-projects which MBF finances, since the average foreign
exchange component is estimated at 20 percent. International competitive
bidding would not be suitable because the Bank loan would be disbursed to a
number of sub-borrowers for a large variety of items, often of a proprietary
nature, over a period of four years and one-half. Commitment, disbursement,
and amortization of the Bank loan proceeds would follow arrangements used in
loans to development finance companies. Industrial sub-borrowers would pur-
chase equipment in accordance with their normal procedures, and MBF would
check to see that satisfactory procurement practices have been followed. The
disbursement schedule is shown in Annex III. Amortization of the Bank loan
would be scheduled to conform substantially with repayments by the sub-
borrowers.
Rates of Return
3b.       The project is designed to bring no financial benefits to the pol-
luting industries themselves, since only those pollution control investments
with n zero or negative financial rate of return are eligible for funds out
of the Bank loan. The economic rate of return of the project cannot be cal-
cuilated, because external benefits have not been quantified. There are two
reasons for this: the present state of the art is such that measurement of
external benefits is uniquely difficult in an environmental project with a
social impact, and the Finnish public demands action now rather than sometime
later after benefit studies based on the research undertaken under this proj-
ect will have been completed.

Project Justification
37.       The most important benefit justifying the project would be the
considerable improvement in the environment, namely, a 50 percent reduction
of industrial wastes discharged as of 1980. Through its financial and tech-
nical support, the Bank would assist in the implementation of the national
program and in the strengthening of related institutional capabilities. Bank
collaboration in the research component of the project should result in
refinements in the design of the national program and in the conceptual ap-
proach to pollution control in the long run. The Bank would have an opportu-
nity to broaden its knowledge of costs and benefits of pollution control in
industry and gain experience in the research needed for modeling acquatic
eco-systems and applying systems analysis to pollution control. This expe-
rience should be useful to the Bank in its future work.
38.       Proceeds from the Bank loan would go only to those pollution con-
trol investments which follow the least cost approach. The technical and
economic appraisal made by NBW, and financial appraisal by MBF, the independ-
ence of MBF in its credit decisions, and Bank review of sub-projects - all
ensure that least cost methods will be employed in each individual industrial
investment financed by sub-loans from the Bank loan proceeds.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Mortgage Bank of
Finland Oy, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Finland and
the Bank and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the draft resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
40.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART IV - RECOMMENDATION
41.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 871 - Forestry Project: US$20 million Loan of December 28, 1972;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1976.
The Forestry Project, part of the Government's Forestry Improvement
Program, provides loans, grants and technical assistance to forest owners
(individuals and companies) for forest improvement. Investments (expected
to be made by some 60,000 farmers and 26 companies) are in seeding and plant-
ing, seedling stand improvement, drainage, fertilization and road construc-
tion. The total project cost is US$120 million. The demand for credits and
grants has been slightly below appraisal estimates. The project personnel
are dedicated and the performance so far is good. No major problems are
expected in the near future.
Loan No. 708 - Industrialization Fund of Finland Project: US$20 million
Loan of October 15, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
IFF continues to be well managed and operate effectively. The
growth of IFF's level of operationg which was already high in 1973 accelerat-
ed even further during 1974. In view of the difficult international money
market situation, IFF has stepped up its efforts to borrow abroad on commercial
terms.

Arrangements:           International competitive bidding would not be
suitable, because the Bank loan would be disbursed
to a number of sub-borrower for a large variety of
items, often proprietary in nature, purchased from
many suppliers over a four and one-half year period.
The Borrower would check to see that sound procure-
ment practices are followed by sub-borrowers.
