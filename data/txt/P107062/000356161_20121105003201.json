for the Second Phase of the\n            Second and Third Program for Communes Facing Extreme\n            Hardship in Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas (Program\n            135) Project for

      active engagement with both national and sub-national\n            leadership and levels of government is essential to build\n            consensus and gain backing for the intended

Promoting policy reforms for poverty reduction\n            requires a multiple and coordinated engagement with the\n            Government. Successful gender mainstreaming requires strong\n            awareness raising and endorsement at all levels from policy\n            makers to implementing agencies and local authorities.\n            Program design should be flexible enough to allow for\n            adjustments in poverty targeting over time. Policy\n            interventions promoting innovative approaches to improving\n            livelihoods are likely to be more successful if they\n            directly address the core business and quality of\n            agricultural sector services.
