                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank has extended the Project's closing date for 21 additional months, from December 31, 2010 to September 30, 2012. This would allow completing committed activities and
                         achieving PDOs. The Ministry of Education (MoE) has provided official information on education indicators for 2008, therefore Project's PDO indicators baseline values have been
                         updated. There is still delay in the provision of official information for later years. Indicator's current values have been updated based on preliminary data provided by the MoE for
                         2009.
