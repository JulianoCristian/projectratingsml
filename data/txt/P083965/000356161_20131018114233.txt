F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to support the Municipality of La Paz
education strategy by: (i) increasing access to secondary education for adolescents and
young people and improving their retention in the education system; (ii) improving
quality and relevance of primary and secondary education; and (iii) strengthening the
decentralized education management capacity of the Municipality of La Paz.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The PDO was not revised during the life of the Project.

achievement) secondary education in La Paz from 67.7% in 2005 to 77.1%,” which
                was not adequate to measure the Project’s outcome. Changes in the
                municipal GER could not be fully attributed to the Project because the 7
                new schools represented 2.5 % of the municipal school buildings housing
                secondary schools. The PAD foresaw the creation of 19,600 new spaces
                and an increase in enrollment of 4,560 students at secondary level.
                Increase the promotion rate in secondary education from 86.2% to 90.9%

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      In 1994, amid significant education challenges, Bolivia passed the Primary
Education Reform and Popular Participation Law. Both laws promoted decentralization
in the education system, leaving responsibility for infrastructure and supplies with
municipalities. By 2005, Bolivia had made progress in expanding access to primary
education, reaching high rates of enrollment and completion. These, combined with
population pressure, resulted in higher demand for secondary education nationwide.
Within this context, La Paz faced a series of challenges. Net primary enrollment
increased significantly during the previous decade, reaching 89.2 percent in 2005,
increasing the demand for secondary education. The Municipality met the demand with
overcrowding and an increase in the student/teacher ratio. School buildings housed up to
four schools (pre-primary, primary, secondary, and night schools). In secondary
education, quality was low and drop-out and repetition rates were high.

2.      Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank contributed at the country level,
technically and financially, to the design of the Primary Education Reform implemented
during the 1994-2004 period. It engaged in a dialogue with the Government of Bolivia
through the preparation of technical work on the challenges of basic education for the
2006-2010 period, which identified the transformation of secondary education as a
critical priority. Preparation was undertaken in a context of political changes at the
national and local levels, which brought uncertainties about the changes to come for the
education sector. The Government elected in December 2005 had a strong political
mandate to change the approach to address the social challenges facing the country,
among which was education. It opted to pursue a Bank-financed project at the municipal
level, instead of one at the national level, given the high availability of other donors’
resources at the national level and the interest at the municipal level to prepare an
education project with the Bank’s support.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

3.      The PDO was to support the Municipality of La Paz’s education strategy by: (i)
increasing access to secondary education for adolescents and young people and
improving their retention in the education system; (ii) improving quality and relevance of
primary and secondary education; and (iii) strengthening the decentralized education
management capacity of the Municipality of La Paz. Key impact indicators and targets
were:
    • Increase the gross enrollment in secondary education from 67.7 to 77.1 percent;
    • Increase the promotion rate in secondary from 79.4 to 84.2 percent;
    • Diminish the repetition rate in secondary from 12.4 to 10.7 percent; and
    • Percentage of La-Paz schools with functioning School Management Committees
        with decision-making authority over decentralized resources.




                                            1
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

4.      The PDO was not revised during the life of the Project. The key project indicators
and targets changed to the following, to reflect changes during the 2012 restructuring:
   • Increase in enrollment in secondary education in the seven completely
        reconstructed school buildings financed by the project from 3,416 to 5,383
        students;
   • Increase promotion rate in secondary education from 86.2 to 90.9 percent;
   • Diminish repetition rate in secondary education from 8.3 to 5.7 percent;
   • Establish education management teams that function within school buildings.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

5.      The Project aimed to benefit: (i) Under Component 1: students who would
participate in the Program for At Risk Students and new students who would benefit from
the construction of schools and classrooms; (ii) Under Component 2: teachers, principals
and parent representatives of the school councils (Juntas Escolares) participating in the
civic values activities; students, teachers and principals in the rehabilitated schools and in
the schools with a maintenance program; and students, teachers and school communities
in primary and secondary schools implementing School Improvement Projects (SIPs);
and (iii) Under Component 3: the staff working in the Municipal Office of Human
Development (OMDH), who would benefit from the institutional strengthening activities.

1.5 Original Components

The Project had three components:

6.     Component 1: Access and Permanence (Retention) (US$4.90 million). This
component supported the OMDH’s efforts to expand coverage in secondary education
(grades 1 through 4 at the time) and improve completion in the upper primary (grades 7
and 8 at the time) and early secondary grades (grades 1 and 2). Its two subcomponents
included: (i) Educational infrastructure and equipment: to increase available student
places and improve secondary schools by constructing and equipping buildings and
classrooms in existing school infrastructure; and (ii) Incentive program for students at
risk of education failure: to provide direct pedagogical support to students at risk of
dropping out (those with two or more years of grade distortion) in targeted districts, in
upper primary and early secondary. This support would be provided by pedagogical
experts contracted by the Municipality or by institutions already providing these services

7.     Component 2: Quality of Education (US$3.73 million). This component
supported the Municipality’s efforts to improve the quality of basic education with a
focus on secondary education. Under its two main activities–the rehabilitation of
dilapidated school buildings and strengthening educational communities–it had four
subcomponents: (i) Improvement of educational learning environments, which included
the reconstruction of three dilapidated school buildings and the implementation of an
experimental maintenance program; (ii) Awareness-raising programs on civic values; (iii)


                                              2
Pedagogical Resource Platforms (PRPs); and (iv) Strengthening Educational
Communities through SIPs and direct financial transfers to School Management Teams
(EGEs) to fund the SIPs.

8.      Component 3: Education Management and Institutional Strengthening (US$0.86
million). This component aimed at strengthening management capacity at the municipal
and school levels to facilitate actions to improve access to and completion and quality of
secondary education. It had four subcomponents: (i) Management and monitoring
information system; (ii) Impact evaluation; (iii) Institutional strengthening of the OMDH;
and (iv) Assessment of Student Learning Progress.

1.6 Revised Components

The Project’s components were revised during the 2012 restructuring as follows:

9.      Component 1: Access to Education. (i) the component was renamed indicating its
focus on access; (ii) the Incentive Program for Student at-risk of Education Failure (the
Incentive Program) was modified to reflect the hiring of experienced teachers through the
Project to develop remedial courses and offer them through a partnership with the
Municipal Training Center (CCAM); and (iii) the eligibility criteria of at-risk students
was redefined as those with very poor or failing grades in the first quarter of the school
year (a grade of 39 or less out of 70 points in Math and Language).

10.     Component 2: Quality of Education. (i) the school infrastructure maintenance
program’s scope was refocused on developing a framework to clarify related roles and
responsibilities, within the Municipality’s regular maintenance program, with active
participation of the Juntas Escolares (parents, teachers and students); (ii) the Civic
Values Program was modified to set up a post-graduate program (Diplomado) for
teachers, principals and municipal staff, complemented by workshops, student dialogues,
classroom projects, student awareness days and publications; (iii) the establishment of a
Centro de Alto Rendimiento Educativo (CARE), instead of PRPs, highlighting the focus
on pedagogical support to schools, boosting education quality and improving students’
academic performance; and (iv) allowing the possibility for the OMDH to purchase and
make payments for the SIPs instead of only direct financial transfers to acquire goods.

11.   Component 3: Education Management and Institutional Strengthening.
Subcomponent 3.4 “Assessment of Student Learning” was eliminated as it falls under the
MOE’s responsibility and out of the scope of the Municipality’s education competencies.

1.7 Other significant changes

12.    The Credit Agreement was amended four times. The first restructuring in April
2009 modified the description of Components 1 and 2 to include primary schools as
beneficiaries of the infrastructure activities, reflecting the reality that school buildings are
used by one to four schools at different education levels during different times of the day.
The second restructuring in September 2009 changed the description of the operational
costs category to allow payments to teachers delivering the training to other teachers


                                               3
trained under the Incentive Program. The third restructuring in December 2010 extended
the closing date to September 30, 2012. Besides changing the components and key
performance indicators, the May 2012 restructuring extended the closing date to March
31, 2013; revised the intermediate outcome indicators; reallocated funds among
disbursement categories consistent with the increase in the cost of construction,
equipment and furniture and the reduction of the scope of the Project’s quality
improvement and institutional strengthening activities. Reallocation of Project funds
increased Component 1 (from US$4.90 million to US$6.57 million), and reduced
Components 2 and 3 (from US$3.73 million to US$2.60 million and US$0.86 million to
US$0.77 million, respectively).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

13.     Project preparation was delayed considerably. Preparation benefited from
dialogue and preparation efforts on a national-level secondary education project from
2003-2005. A concept note discussed in 2004 served as the basis for this municipal-level
Project. In 2006, the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Bank decided not to pursue
the national-level project, and focus instead on this smaller municipal level secondary
education Project. The actual Project preparation period was May 2006 to August 2007.

14.     Lack of deep understanding of the La Paz education context. There was a lack of
detailed knowledge of the municipal education sector context and national and municipal
norms. This translated into inadequate or unfeasible strategies to implement the Project
from the very beginning. Such was the case of the design of the Civic Values Program,
the student assessment planned by the municipality and the articulation of the SIPs to be
carried out by the EGEs.

15.    Strong municipal and community commitment to the Project. The municipal level
leadership was committed, engaged and participated actively in the Project’s preparation.
Instead of creating a separate implementation unit, the OMDH was appointed to
implement the Project in order to build municipal capacity. It hired one coordinator and
three specialists to strengthen its implementation capacity. The MOE and Ministry of
Planning and Development (MPD) backed the Municipality’s efforts at the beginning,
intending to replicate the experiences in other municipalities. During Project launch, the
OMDH conducted a workshop to present the Project to stakeholders and solicit feedback.

2.2 Implementation

Factors outside the control of the Government and implementing agency

16.    Increase in costs. The new schools were designed in 2006 during Project
preparation. Construction costs, however, rose significantly between 2007 and 2011
because of a rise in steel and input prices due to an increase in international demand. The
cost of a classroom increased from US$5,392 to US$7,733, computer equipment from



                                            4
US$18.8 to US$36.3, and furniture from US$39.62 to US$81.43, substantially increasing
the cost of the infrastructure activities.

Factors under the Government’s control

17.     Delay in effectiveness. The Project was approved in October 2007 but was not
effective until 14 months later (December 2008), after long delays in approving the
Credit Agreement by the Congress and the subsidiary agreement by the Ministry of
Finance. This delay translated into disbursement lags throughout implementation.

18.     Political context and sector uncertainties. Changes in the political landscape
hindered cooperation between the MOE and the Municipality. The OMDH was unable to
access MOE data (including age information to select participants in the Incentive
Program and information on students’ grades to assess Project outcomes). Looming
uncertainties derived from changes to education laws. Ley Avelino Siñani, passed in
December 2010, was expected to change the curriculum and deepen decentralization
towards municipalities. Instead the Law sought to strengthen institutions within their
existing framework of competencies. Finally, the municipal bureaucratic processes
extended steps for approvals, burdening and lengthening the implementation of activities.

19.     Change in the classification of primary and secondary levels. The PAD referred to
improving quality and relevance of primary and secondary education, as Project activities
concentrated on upper primary (grades 7 and 8) and lower secondary (grades 1 and 2).
Ley Avelino Siñani changed the school structure: six grades at the primary level and six
at the secondary level, instead of the previous eight at primary and four at secondary.
Grades 7 and 8 became grades 1 and 2 of secondary and grades 1 and 2 became grades 3
and 4 of secondary after the Law. The PDO was not changed at restructuring after the
approval of the Law. The inclusion of primary level students as beneficiaries of
infrastructure activities was clarified in the first amendment of the Credit Agreement, to
acknowledge that different level schools shared one school building.

20.     Institutional responsibilities over schools. Multiple institutions were responsible
for schools: the MOE was responsible for the curriculum; the Municipality, for providing
and maintaining infrastructure; and the District Offices for personnel (principals, teachers
and administrative staff). This made effective coordination of some actions at the school
level difficult (such as provision of teachers and performance of administrative staff).

Factors under the implementing agency control

21.     Committed and hard-working implementation team. The OMDH displayed
commitment, resourcefulness and continuity. It showed creativity and determination in
redesigning implementation strategies and reaching out to allies to overcome the design
shortcomings and shift in resources between components. It managed the Project
effectively and closely monitored progress, followed up on implementation, and
contributed to achieving the goals and targets.




                                             5
22.     Construction activities were well supervised and implemented. Schools to be
supported by the Project were selected according to criteria of overcrowding and the
degree of marginality, measured by the percentage of school-age population who were
not enrolled in schools. Lessons learned in each phase were incorporated in the technical
specifications, leading to improvements throughout the Project. For example: hand-
washing areas were moved outside of sanitary blocks; more durable door handles were
used; furniture was improved to endure use by different age groups; and cement wall
coverings were used for easier maintenance.

23.   Successful re-definition of implementation strategies in most sub-components.
The OMDH and the Bank worked together to change strategies and reduce costs when
implementation was at risk due to increases in infrastructure costs. Changes included:

   •   The Incentive Program. Given the lack of institutions providing this service for
       outsourcing, the OMDH opted to hire and train two experts to design the remedial
       support content and to train teachers, who provided the support to students on
       weekends and holidays. Due to lack of access to MOE data, criteria for eligible
       students were changed to consider their grades instead of age/grade distortion.
   •   Civic Values Program. The OMDH opted to establish a formal post-graduate
       degree for teachers based on the Municipality’s previous experience with one day
       workshops, which were ineffective to successfully enhance teachers’ knowledge
       and reach the classrooms. It opted to collaborate with the CCAM, the United
       Nations Population Fund and universities to develop and implement training
       activities, helping to maximize the programs despite their reduced budgets.
   •   CARE. The OMDH chose to adapt a municipal building to house the PRP
       programs and resources, since there were no NGOs already running similar
       centers. The quantity was reduced to one center due to lack of Project resources
       and it was renamed a CARE to better reflect its educational quality orientation.
       The Project acquired materials and equipment for the CARE. It was located in
       San Antonio.
   •   EGEs. As the EGEs were banned by law from managing money to carry out the
       SIPs, changes were made to allow the OMDH to conduct the procurement of
       goods for the schools.
   •   Infrastructure Maintenance. As the Municipality created a maintenance unit and
       program, the Project shifted focus to define roles and responsibilities in this area.

24.     Difficulties in achieving greater management capacity and autonomy at school
level. Several factors complicated the implementation of the SIPs: the cumbersome
resource transfer due to EGEs limitations to receive the resources from the competition
from the Autonomous Municipal Government of La Paz (GAMLP), which had direct
competencies over these groups; the challenge of having several schools of different
levels working together to prepare SIPs; the failure of the supervising firm hired to
support the schools to procure the goods financed by the Project and the reluctance of
teachers and principals to share goods for which they were legally responsible, with
colleagues in other schools using the same buildings.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

25.     M&E design. Project monitoring was overall well designed, with a clear
definition of the OMDH’s monitoring responsibilities and of the system to be used as
well as of the indicators. A weakness in the M&E design was the choice of a broad PDO
(improved quality and relevance of primary and secondary education) and outcome
indicators that proved difficult to monitor since they depended on MOE data. The
indicators proposed in the PAD (gross enrollment rate, repetition and promotion rates in
secondary for the Municipality of La Paz) were too broad to capture the outcome due the
Project’s interventions, because they were municipal level rather than school level
indicators and they did not reflect the extent of the Project’s interventions within the
Municipality. The M&E framework in the PAD could have been made clearer by
including specific indicators to measure quality and relevance of education in upper
primary level for grades 7 and 8 of upper primary (later on grades 1 and 2 of secondary)
since the Project interventions to improve quality referred to these grades.

26.     M&E implementation. Project monitoring was carried out by the OMDH, using
and adapting an existing monitoring system used by a previous project: the Sistema de
Información Integrado de Control y Monitoreo para Administración Financiera y
Seguimiento de Proyectos (SIMAF). Investment information was registered in the
Municipal Investment System (SIM). The intermediate indicators defined in the PAD
were monitored regularly and updated semi-annually to assess implementation progress.
The weakness of PDO was partially solved at restructuring through an indicator to
measure increased enrollment only in the schools that benefitted from Project activities;
however narrower indicators to better measure improvements in quality and relevance of
education and retention were not introduced. Data on promotion rates from seven of the
schools benefited by the Project were available at ICR stage, but were not available for
twelve schools rehabilitated by the Project. Data on repetition rates in the schools built or
rehabilitated by the Project were not available in 2011-2012. Additional indicators have
been added in this ICR to assess achievement of outcome.

27.     The OMDH prepared Evaluation Results Reports for the Incentive Program, the
Civic Values Program and the SIP program. The Incentive Program Report included
learning achievement results from the diagnostic and assessment tests in Mathematics
and Language given to students in upper primary and grades 1 and 2 of secondary (after
2010, grades 1 to 4 of secondary) at the beginning and end of each session. An impact
evaluation of the Incentive Program was not carried out as planned in the PAD, due to
lack of data. The OMDH unofficially used the 2006 PISA tool in 2011 to get a one-time
snap shot of the skills of the participating students. The results showed that students’ skill
levels were significantly below those of other participating countries (see Annex 10). The
OMDH also sought regular feedback from stakeholders in the quality improvement
programs through meetings, visits to schools and surveys, and analyzed their views to
inform activities. The OMDH mapped the Project’s interventions (see Annex 11),
highlighting that: (i) these took place in areas where they were most needed; and (ii) the
Project reached a significant number of schools and beneficiaries through the quality
improvement interventions.

28.      M&E Utilization. The Implementing Agency regularly used progress reports to
assess Project achievements and adjust implementation accordingly. The Bank closely
monitored the Project’s progress, assessing the progress towards the achievement of the
PDOs and leading to the decision to restructure the Project and change the Project’s
targets.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

29.     Environment. Environmental standards were improved during the civil works.
Prior to construction, environmental cards were prepared for each school building
upgraded by the Project. These cards included potential environmental impacts and
mitigation measures for adverse impacts. The Project team worked with the Municipal
Environmental Unit to have the relevant environmental authority endorse the cards. Once
endorsed, an environmental license was issued and the cards were used by the
construction company and the civil works supervisors to guide the construction process.
The Department of Environmental Management Quality and the Human Resource
Department helped implement the cards’ recommendations during construction.

30.    Indigenous Peoples: The entire Project was considered an Indigenous People’s
Development Plan, given the high concentration of indigenous people living in La Paz. A
consultation with stakeholders was carried out in May 2007 and the feedback provided by
stakeholders was incorporated into the Project’s design.

31.     Financial management: Overall financial management had minor shortcomings
related to the cumbersome payment requirements at the municipal level, which required
several steps of approval, delaying payments up to 90 days. This time lapse was lowered
to 60 days in 2012, which extended to the whole municipal payment administration
system. External audits were carried out annually and were clean without observations.

32.     Procurement: The procurement arrangements and action plans were adequate and
in accordance with the procurement capacity assessment included in the PAD. The
OMDH procurement team performed well, despite lacking previous experience working
with the Bank. Initially the team was composed of two experts, who were overstretched
due to the larger number of contracts than envisioned in the PAD that they had to process
to implement the SIPs and the quality improvement programs.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

33.     Bolivia receives grant financing to support its national education priorities and
favors these resources over new credit financing from IDA. While the central government
manages these resources, the Municipality benefits from the activities they finance.
GAMLP’s education budget has increased in the last four years. A JSDF financed project
on early childhood development (ECD) in the La Paz and El Alto municipalities is under
implementation. This project will support the improvement of quality and the range of
ECD services to expand coverage by developing and adapting pre-school infrastructure
and strengthening institutional capacity. The GAMLP is receiving technical assistance
from UNDP to improve the quality of education at primary and secondary levels.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

34.     The relevance of objectives is considered high. The PDOs are in line with the
FY2012-2015 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) (Report No. 65108-BO), which
includes human development and access to basic services as one of four results areas.
The CPS affirms that the Bank will support the country’s efforts to improve the coverage
and quality of education services. The Municipality’s strategic development document
(Plan de Desarrollo Municipal 2007-2011) states as two of its key strategic objectives for
education (i) increasing access in particular to secondary education in a context of
integrated education networks and (ii) improving the quality of education at all levels.
Under the Municipality’s draft 2020-2040 Plan, which includes its strategy for 2013-
2018, education is one of the main pillars within human development (the fourth of six
thematic areas). Expanding access to education, particularly at the secondary and pre-
school levels, continues to be a priority for the Municipality, as well as improving the
quality of services delivered. At the national level, the Government’s Agenda Patriótica
2025 includes as one of its main pillars comprehensive human development through
education, health and sports.

35.     The relevance of design is considered substantial since the restructured Project’s
relevance is high and the original Project’s relevance was modest. While the original
design had shortcomings, the choice of components was adequate to achieve the PDO
and the 2012 restructuring improved design relevance significantly. Shortcomings of the
original design included: (i) the content of some sub-components was not well defined in
the PAD, for example the classrooms to be built and the content and reach of the civic
values workshops; and (ii) the implementation strategies proposed in the PAD were not
adequate for the country and municipal realities, for example the lack of firms or
universities providing pedagogical training for the Incentive Program, the lack of EGE
autonomy to receive and manage funds, an inadequate allocation model (per capita) for
the SIPs, and the unfeasible proposal to use service agreements with NGOs to run the
PRPs. The strategy changes adopted during the 2012 restructuring substantially improved
the relevance of design and implementation, with no shortcomings.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

36.     To assess Project achievements, the ICR analyses five dimensions of the PDO: (i)
Increase access to secondary education for adolescents and young people; (ii) Improve
retention in secondary education; (iii) Improve quality of primary and secondary
education; (iv) Improve relevance of primary and secondary education; and (v)
Strengthen decentralized education management capacity of the Municipality of La Paz.
The assessment of achievement of outcomes draws on the PDO indicators in the PAD
only as relevant to the assessment, PDO indicators after restructuring, and supplementary
indicators prepared at the ICR stage, which capture outcomes more directly attributable
to the Project’s activities. The table below shows the progress towards the achievement of
the PDO before restructuring and at completion.

37.    Overall a total of 274 schools (pre-primary, primary, secondary and adult
education), representing 60 percent of all public schools in the municipality, benefitted
from one or more of the Project-supported activities. The Project benefitted around
209,600 students at these levels (representing 47 percent of enrolled students).
i - Increase access to secondary education for adolescents and young people.

38.    The increase in access to secondary education in La Paz was substantial.
Secondary enrollment increased from 3,416 students to 6,311 students in the seven new
and reconstructed school buildings financed by the Project. A total of 15,840 additional
school places were created in 19 school buildings (versus a pre-restructuring target of
19,600 new school places and a post-restructuring target of 15,840) for new students and
students in overcrowded schools. The 19 schools represent 7.4% of municipal school
buildings and 10% of total secondary schools. The Project contributed to increased access
through the construction and equipping of schools and classrooms in areas with
overcrowded schools and unmet demand:
    • Four new school buildings were built (87 classrooms adding 6,960 new places
       based on 40 students per classroom in two secondary shifts as calculated in the
       PAD);
    • Three school buildings reconstructed (58 classrooms were renovated: 16 of which
       were new and 38 replaced for a total of 1,280 new (16 new classrooms of 40
       students in two secondary shifts) and 3,040 places replaced.
    • The new schools housed within these seven buildings were fully functioning with
       teaching and administrative staff provided by the MOE by Project completion.
    • Additionally, 95 new classrooms were built and equipped in twelve existing
       school buildings, creating 7,600 new places. Finished just before Project
       completion, their enrollment numbers, which will be available during the next
       school year (which starts in February 2014), will also contribute to the
       achievement of increased access to secondary education.

39.    New school places were created in the districts within each macro-district with
high percentages of school age population not enrolled in schools: District 7 (81.7%) in
Max Paredes, Districts 12 (83.2%) and 15 (84.5%) in Periferica, Districts 4 (72.3%) and
5 (90.2%) in Cotahuma and District 20 (87.5%) in Mallasa. Construction activities
concentrated on districts in marginal urban and peri-urban areas with overcrowded
classroom, which had experienced significant increases in secondary education
enrollment. Interviews with students, teachers and school council members carried out
during the ICR mission indicated that the new school places increased enrollment due to
the proximity to beneficiaries’ homes, thus reducing travel and allowing low income
families to save on transportation and avoid security concerns.

ii - Improve retention of secondary education students in the education system.

40.    The improvement in retention was substantial. Improvement is reflected in the
increased promotion rate in secondary education in La Paz, which improved significantly
from 86.2% in 2008, to 89.9% by Project completion, slightly below the 2012 target of
90.9 percent. Promotion rates had a larger percentage increase in the three schools whose


                                             11
buildings were reconstructed (from 82.3% in 2010 to 89.6% in 2012) than the increase in
the municipality as a whole. Retention remained high at 99.3% in the four new schools
built by the Project (the 2009 baseline was 99%). The Project contributed to improved
retention in secondary schools through the Incentive Program, which provided
pedagogical support and though the improvement of school environments (classrooms,
computer and science labs, recreational areas).

41.     Under the Incentive Program, a total of 156 teachers were trained to teach
pedagogical support courses. 10,131 students in grades 1 to 4 in secondary (surpassing
the target of 5,130 students) received support in Math and Language during the 2009-
2011 school years. The students had low grades at acceptance into the program, attended
schools in the most densely populated macro-districts: Max Paredes, Periférica, Centro
and Cotahuma, and represented around 15 percent of the total students enrolled in
secondary (grades 1 to 6). 1 Yearly surveys by the Program implementation team revealed
that parents supported their children’s participation in the course, and expressed support
for them to improve their learning and stay in school. In addition, the students surveyed
expressed higher motivation to continue their studies when they saw how their skills
improved with pedagogical support. Coordination of the support courses with the regular
school calendar facilitated the monitoring of the students’ learning improvements.

42.     The quality of the seven new and reconstructed school buildings fostered
retention as students felt encouraged to attend and stay in school, as evidenced by high
promotions rates in the schools built by the Project and larger increase in promotion rates
in the schools reconstructed by the Project compared to all schools in La Paz. The
buildings were of high quality, furnished and equipped with computer and audiovisual
equipment. During the ICR mission, interviews with teachers, students and
representatives of the Juntas Escolares confirmed increased motivation in students to
attend and stay in schools, as a result of the access to better school facilities and modern
learning resources.

iii Improve the quality of primary and secondary education

43.     The improvement in the quality of education was modest. The quality of basic
education improved measured by the repetition rate for secondary education, which
dropped from 8.3 percent in 2008 to 6.7 percent in 2012, just short of the target set at the
2012 restructuring of 5.7 percent. The repetition rate in primary schools decreased from
4.2 percent in 2007 to 3.6 in 2010, the latest year of data available. There is not data on
repetition rates in the schools built or rehabilitated by the Project. Quality was improved
through the enhancement of school buildings, the provision of furniture, equipment
(science and computer labs) and learning materials, the training of teachers under the
Incentive Program and the establishment of the CARE.

 The ICR team used estimates of the number of students in secondary education in La Paz provided by the
MEN, so the percentage of students who participated in the Incentive Program is an estimate.



                                                  12
44.    The results evaluation for the Incentive Program revealed the improved learning
achievement of its participants (who were in grades 1 to 4 of secondary). Students sat for
a diagnostic test, which informed teacher preparation of the support content, and an end-
of-course test to measure improvement in skills by the completion of the support courses.
The ICR team’s comparison of the pre- and post- test results showed marked
improvement in Math and Language skills for all three years for all four grades of
secondary in Math and Language (see annex 10). For instance, comparative results for
Mathematics in 2011 showed an increase in the percentage of students reaching a level of
good: from 1.07% to 6.93% for grade 1; from 2.14% to 3.42% in grade 2; from 0.15% to
3.78% in grade 3 and from 0.38% to 3.06% in grade 4. The percentage of students
reaching satisfactory level increased as well: from 4.89% to 8.10% in grade 1; from
4.97% to 7.83% in grade 2; from 3.82% to 9.72% in grade 3; and from 2.52% to 6.03% in
grade 4.

45.    The Civic Values Program changed the way secondary education teachers worked
with secondary students grades 1 to 6 (previously 7 and 8 in upper primary and 1 to 4 in
secondary) and with their school communities, as documented in the results evaluation
and in the interviews during the ICR mission. Teachers taught high quality and relevant
content on civic values using participatory methodologies that resulted in school fairs and
classroom projects, creating a demonstration effect that spilled throughout the schools to
primary levels and school communities.

46.     Students, teachers, and parents interviewed during the ICR mission confirmed that
the rehabilitation of schools and upgrades to school spaces (including sanitary blocks,
teachers’ rooms, patios for recreational activities, science labs, libraries and computer
rooms), benefited primary and secondary level teachers and students through higher
quality spaces to teach the curriculum and motivating students to learn in these upgraded
environments.

47.    The establishment of the CARE in San Antonio contributed to improving
educational quality by complementing the resources available at primary and secondary
schools (grades 1 to 6 for both levels) with computers, libraries and learning resources, as
well as pedagogical and technical support to teachers and students. 7,871 beneficiaries
from 50 primary and secondary schools from several districts in the municipality, utilized
the center regularly between 2009 and 2011 (representing 11.5 percent of all schools in
La Paz). In 2012, a total of 3,105 beneficiaries used the center, including teachers,
primary and secondary level students and community members, of whom the CARE’s
logs indicate around 1,725 were primary and secondary teachers. With Project support,
the CARE staff prepared Mathematics and language curricular adaptations according to
the Ley Avelino Siñani, became a support for teachers, and trained them in these updates
especially in management and curriculum planning.

iv - Improve the relevance of primary and secondary education

48.    The improvement of the relevance of primary and secondary education was
modest. A relevant civic values curriculum adapted to the Municipality’s reality was
developed and teachers were trained on its content. Subjects included gender equity,


                                            13
multiculturalism, health and sexuality, emotional intelligence and proper school
maintenance. A total of 1,564 classroom projects and school activities, 96 students’
dialogues, and 200 school fairs and parents’ dialogues were developed and implemented
as a result of the training.

49.     The Civic Values Program helped improve relevance via a post–graduate degree
with well-defined content and training for teachers at secondary level on subjects relevant
to the secondary education curriculum. Its formal diploma acted as a high motivator.
Once trained, teachers trained their colleagues and the training ultimately reached the
classroom through classroom projects, dialogues among and with students, and school
fairs by the teachers, in collaboration with parents. During these activities, students
presented the knowledge acquired through means such as art, dance, and music. In the
first two rounds, 96 secondary schools participated in the student dialogues and school
fairs and more than 5,600 parents in the parents’ workshops. Around 57,000 secondary
students participated in and benefited from this program. Ten monitors were hired to
monitor implementation of these activities during 2012. A total of 61 secondary schools,
over 24,500 secondary students, 2,068 Juntas Escolares and 191 teachers and principals
in secondary schools trained and 167 trained by the trained teachers, benefited in 2012.

50.     Upgrades of the school buildings improved the relevance of education. Science
and computer labs, multipurpose rooms, libraries and recreational spaces were built in 19
schools (comprised of the four new schools, three reconstructed schools and twelve
existing schools where new classrooms were built).

v– Strengthen the decentralized education management capacity of the Municipality of La
Paz

51.     Strengthening of decentralized management capacity was substantial. Knowledge
developed on the establishment of the Incentive and the Civic Values Programs remains
within the municipality, deposited with the CCAM and the OMDH to be readily
accessible for future use to train teachers and support students. There has been a clear
definition of the roles and responsibilities of principals, students, teachers and parents
regarding maintenance of school buildings, with an emphasis on preventive maintenance
practices. More efficient administrative procedures at municipal level were in place, such
as a reduction of the time elapsed for payments (from 90 to 60 days) and improved
procurement practices being used at municipal level. By Project closing, a total of 92
SIPs were designed and implemented by 113 EGEs, covering 183 primary, secondary and
night schools, representing 40 percent of schools in La Paz. Follow up visits to all 183
schools by the OMDH verified that they had and were using the goods acquired through
the SIPs. An archiving system for all of the goods acquired through the SIPs was
achieved by Project closing.

52.     The Project improved the OMDH’s institutional capacity by working and training
its staff in lieu of establishing a separate Project unit. It supported its strengthening
through the provision of furniture, computers and technical assistance to the Directorate
for Education, which helped it develop capacity to manage and evaluate Project activities,
monitor implementation and maintain the Project’s archives. The OMDH prepared three


                                            14
Evaluation Results Reports that relied on the Project’s Monitoring system financed with
Credit proceeds. The Project also supported the strengthening of the Municipality’s
information system (SIMAF), through the provision of technical assistance and
equipment. It also strengthened the Infrastructure and Equipment Unit (UIE) by financing
civil works supervisors who contributed to upgrading the practices for supervision of
civil works for the Project by adopting higher standards and internal coordination
practices, which later became adopted for other municipal civil works. The Project
enhanced the OMDH legal and procurement teams by strengthening their human
resources to manage the substantial number of contracts the Project generated (for the
teachers hired under the Incentives Program and the paperwork related to the Civic
Values Program); and the Maintenance Unit through the development of a regulation that
defined the roles and responsibilities regarding school maintenance in La Paz.

53.     The Project supported strengthening of the management capacity of individual
schools and their communities through the creation of EGEs and financing the SIPs they
prepared. Under each EGE’s umbrella, directors, teachers, parents and students of the
schools using the same building collaborated on the maintenance and care of the school
premises, which enabled the schools as a group to compete for funds to implement their
SIPs. The EGEs prepared SIPs for the group, with the support of a manual elaborated
under the Project. Beneficiaries included: around 80,000 students, 4,800 teachers and
principals, and 429 parents who participated in SIP preparation and implementation. The
process enabled school communities to identify issues relevant to them, concerning
infrastructure, learning materials, and goods.

54.    Goods were transferred to the new management teams when changes had taken
place. The OMDH conducted trainings on safeguarding goods and equipment and
prepared communiqués to inform stakeholders about activities accomplished under the
SIPs. The schools prepared and signed documents cataloguing the goods and the
responsible persons and affirming their commitment to share the materials among the
schools sharing a school building.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Modest

55.     The cost-benefit analysis was updated at the time of restructuring in April 2012
and its main findings are used for this ICR. The updated cost benefit analysis shows an
internal rate of return of 4.5 percent (while the PAD foresaw 5.9 percent). See Annex 3.

56.    On one hand, construction and input costs increased substantially and the time to
complete the construction, which represents the bulk of the Project’s cost, was longer
than expected. The number of new classrooms in existing schools was lower than planned
(95 versus 150). The construction incorporated other spaces into new schools (sanitary
blocks, administrative spaces, recreational areas) key to the quality of the school life.
Construction was of high quality as it incorporated lessons throughout the Project
implementation. On the other hand, quality improvement and relevance activities were
implemented at a lower cost than foreseen in the PAD while reaching a significantly
higher than expected number of beneficiaries in the case of the Incentive Program


                                           15
(10,131 versus 5,130 students in the PAD) and the Program on Awareness and Civic
Values (1,564 teachers and principals trained, 5,600 parents, 2068 School Councils and
81,500 students participating versus 1,165 teachers and school principals and 792
representatives of School Councils), contributing to substantial efficiency in their
implementation.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

57.     The overall Project outcome is considered moderately satisfactory, given that its
relevance of objectives pre- and post- restructuring is high; its relevance of design and
implementation pre- and post- restructuring is substantial; and its efficacy in increasing
access to secondary is substantial, in improving retention in secondary is substantial, in
improving the quality of primary and secondary education is modest, in improving the
relevance of primary and secondary education is modest and in strengthening
decentralized education management of the Municipality of La Paz is substantial.
Efficiency is rated as modest. The rating reflects the limited extent of the outcomes
achieved by the Project in the overall education context of the Municipality of La Paz.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

58.     By providing additional school spaces in districts with high marginality and
overcrowded schools, the Project contributed to improving the living conditions of
students and their families and positively impacted communities. With schooling options
close to home, students did not have to spend time and run risks by travelling across La
Paz to distant schools. In many instances, siblings went to school together, adding
security and safety to low income families’ daily lives.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

59.      The Project contributed to strengthening capacity at the school, community and
municipal levels. At the school and community levels, the Project strengthened
management capacity through the preparation of SIPs and the management of the
resources acquired and by providing training support (section 3.2.v). At the municipal
level, the Project built capacity through the alliances formed to implement activities.

60.     Through implementing the Project the OMDH acquired skills and know how on
project management, reporting, and instilling a culture of accountability (described in
section 3.2.v). It improved some administrative practices, such as approval and payment
practices for contracts, as well as internal coordination and the duration of the civil works
supervision process. Qualified staff brought on board also strengthened its human
resources and the quality of the tasks performed improved.




                                              16
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

61.     The Project benefited a larger number and breadth of beneficiaries than foreseen
in the PAD. Students in pre-primary and primary (grades 1-6) and night schools benefited
because the school buildings improved were used by multiple schools. Furthermore, the
revised implementation strategies for the Project’s activities involved entire school
communities: students, parents, teachers, principals and Juntas Escolares. Parents in the
wide-sense of school community participated, particularly in the Civic Values Program.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

62.      Feedback was collected from students and parents regarding the Incentive
Program and the Civic Values Program. In the former, the results indicated that students
had participated on their own initiative, aware of their poor school performance,
supported by their parents, and that their skills improved after the remedial support. In the
latter, students stated they had worked with their teachers in a participatory manner
(workshops, dialogues, projects) on how to prevent and deal with and face relevant issues
and they overwhelmingly perceived a benefit to the program. See Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

63.       It is expected that achievements will be sustained including: access and retention,
as the infrastructure built and improved by the Project will be maintained; quality, due to
facility improvements, resource availability, and the classroom application of the teacher
trainings; and the improved OMDH management capacity. There is a moderate risk to
retention, quality and relevance achievements, since the Incentive Program and Civic
Values Programs will not continue as such. School level management capacity could also
weaken if training and school projects do not continue to strengthen EGEs. Factors
contributing to sustainability include:
    • The GAMLP is promoting a culture of respect and community responsibility to
         care for school facilities, furniture and learning materials. Its Maintenance
         Department is in charge of repairing schools, and preventive maintenance is
         mainstreamed into the Municipality’s regular work. Lessons were incorporated by
         the Municipality for future infrastructure activities, which are its responsibility.
    • The CARE is fully functioning and resourced. Four staff, financed initially by the
         Project, are now financed by the GAMLP and the center is open to the
         community. Two additional CAREs in Cotahuma and Periférica are fully
         financed by the municipality, with the objective of one CARE in each macro-
         district.
    • In line with the SIPs, the municipality is launching competitions (“concursos”) in
         the framework of the “my school, my second home” program, which will reward
         schools who are properly maintaining their infrastructure.
    • The EGEs are continuing in most of the schools and their members are newly
         elected. The EGEs are being transformed into “grupos productivos” and continue
         to manage the goods acquired through the SIPs.


                                             17
   •   The Municipality is continuing to use the diplomado methodology to train
       primary teachers and is supported by the alliances made during the program.
       Changes in pedagogy have been incorporated in schools and the civic-values
       content was integrated into ongoing municipal programs (Operación Cole).
   •   Teachers trained on the Incentive Program are using the skills in the planning of
       their regular classes, contributing to student retention. The remedial courses are
       not continued due to lack of OMDH resources, but the CCAM has the experience
       and materials to potentially launch the program in the future.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

64.     The Bank worked closely with the GAMLP to prepare this Project, overcoming
the lack of previous experience on education projects with municipalities in the country.
The Bank, with support from the national government, engaged with the GAMLP to
translate earlier dialogue and background work on a national project into the present
Project. However, quality of preparation is rated moderately unsatisfactory due to
significant shortcomings in design of the original Project’s quality related programs
consistent with the country and municipal context, which were later addressed during
supervision.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

65.     Project supervision was adequate, frequent and based on good dialogue with the
Borrower. It benefited from the presence of the team in the field office. The Bank carried
out a minimum of two full supervision missions per year and provided regular technical
assistance in financial management, procurement and safeguards. Aide memoirs and ISRs
provided good descriptions of the Project’s progress. The Bank worked closely with the
GAMLP to overcome the implementation challenges and provided flexibility to reshape
the implementation strategies. This included four Project restructurings. The Bank’s
supervision had some moderate shortcomings: (i) the 2012 restructuring was late in the
Project execution timeframe and took too long to be approved (April 25, 2012), after the
mid-term review agreement in May 2011 to restructure; and (ii) at restructuring the Bank
should have provided additional indicators to assess the achievement of outcomes that
could be significantly attributed to the Project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

66.    The overall performance of the Bank is considered as moderately satisfactory,
since the overall outcome is rated moderately satisfactory. There were shortcomings
during preparation and supervision.



                                            18
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67.     The MPD and the MOE supported the GAMLP for the Project’s financing and
implementation. The MPD approved the subsidiary agreement to enable the Municipality
to assume the credit, though with delays. The MOE provided, in a mostly timely manner,
teachers for the schools once the classrooms were operational. School councils worked
with the MOE’s departmental offices to address some unmet needs for technical hours for
specific subjects. Moderate shortcomings included: (i) difficulties providing student data
to the Municipality, described above; (ii) delays working with the Municipality to find a
legal solution to enable implementation of SIPs. Cooperation of school personnel, who
were under the legal jurisdiction of the MOE, was sought to convince EGEs to accept the
resources to implement the SIPs; and (iii) delay in approving the 2012 restructuring.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

68.     The GAMLP collaborated closely with the Bank. It showed ownership and
contributed to Project preparation and design. The excellent Project team benefitted from
the continuity and dedication of its staff. The team worked creatively to overcome
implementation challenges by adapting strategies and seeking alliances. Its re-design of
strategies helped achieve the quality and relevance related PDOs despite reduced funds,
reaching a larger than foreseen number of beneficiaries. The team was small but efficient,
and implemented activities on time despite the significantly greater than expected
administrative burdens it faced to implement the EGEs and the SIPs.

69.    Fiduciary performance was satisfactory. Financial management was adequate,
procurement was without problems, and there was compliance with covenants. The
GAMLP documented Project achievements through results reports; inventory of goods
acquired; and dossiers of materials to replicate the programs. As recognized in the audits,
there was a minor shortcoming in monitoring some goods acquired through the SIPs, due
mainly to the logistics of sharing goods among multiple schools. The implementation
team documented the presence of the goods in the schools, addressing this concern.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

70.     Overall, the Borrower’s performance is rated as moderately satisfactory given the
moderately satisfactory performance of the Government and the satisfactory performance
of the implementing agency.

6. Lessons Learned

71.    Realistic PDOs and indicators are crucial to the quality of project preparation.
Overly ambitious PDOs do not do justice to a project’s achievements. In this case, while
the Project successfully met its targets, even surpassing them while using fewer resources


                                            19
than initially forecast, the indicators from the project design did not reflect this and the
PDOs seemed partially achieved, due to the overly broad PDOs and PAD indicators.

72.     Understanding local legal context and jurisdictional issues can facilitate project
design and avoid implementation problems. The Project’s implementation strategies were
not adequate for La Paz and required change from the very beginning. The design would
have benefited from the views and knowledge of local counterparts and staff in Bolivia to
better identify the most appropriate strategies to the country’s context.

73.     Project restructuring is an opportunity to address shortcomings in design. The
Bank missed an opportunity to address the overly ambitious PDOs and inadequate
indicators at restructuring. In particular it could have better defined the municipal level
quality objective around infrastructure to permit accurate assessment of the
achievements.

74.     Involving communities at the design stage enhances beneficiary satisfaction.
During the Project, some communities expressed dissatisfaction with the new buildings’
location or design. Early consultation would make implementation easier, as carrying out
consultations and consensus building after construction had started was more arduous.

75.    Building strategic alliances with key actors is essential to a program’s success.
Collaboration with other institutions was critical in the definition, implementation and
continuity of the Project activities. For example, the Civic Values Program benefited
from know-how, infrastructure and staff from collaborators, allowing for a greater impact
than envisaged in the PAD and implementation on a larger scale with reduced resources.

76.     Upgrades in school infrastructure can improve neighborhood quality of life.
While new classrooms improved the quality of the teaching and learning space, new
sanitary blocks, libraries, computer rooms, upgraded recreational spaces and
administrative areas also transformed schools and fortified neighborhoods, improving the
quality of life in traditionally underserved districts, as expressed by beneficiaries.

77.    Phased construction enables the improvement of techniques. Three phases of
construction allowed for incorporation of lessons learned in each phase.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1 – Access to Education.

Subcomponent 1.1 – Educational Infrastructure and Equipment.
1.      The Project supported the expansion of coverage in primary and secondary levels.
It financed the following activities: (i) the construction and equipment of four new school
buildings, with a total of 87 classrooms; and (ii) the new construction and equipment of
95 new classrooms in 12 existing schools.

2.     In general, the 4 new school buildings included: classrooms, labs, computer
rooms, library, auditorium, administrative and teachers spaces, sanitary facilities for
students and teachers, recreational spaces, storage areas for food and materials, areas for
the school caretakers and psycho-pedagogic support areas. The equipment provided
under the Project consisted of: school furniture for all classrooms, computer and
audiovisual equipment. All of these goods were given to the school communities and
were functional by project completion.

3.      This component was implemented in three phases, which allowed taking into
account the lessons learned during the previous phase. Designs were changed to improve
the durability of the construction. For instance, the door knobs were changed to introduce
more durable fixtures; the toilets’ flushing systems were changed as well to increase it
durability; the sinks in the lavatories were placed outside of the sanitary blocks, for
general view which fostered more careful use by students. The materials used for the
school walls were changed as well to cement, which was cheaper and easier to maintain
than brick. Regarding furniture, the techniques improved as well, tables were made to
endure the use by different age groups.

4.     The quality of the buildings was high, based on the use of adequate materials and
good design that blended with the existing structures. There were constructive
discussions with the communities to place the schools in places within the neighborhoods
that were to the school community satisfaction.

Subcomponent 1.2 Incentive Program for Students at Risk of Education Failure.
5.    The Project provided the following:
   • Financing to hire two experts in Math and Language. These experts carried out
      the curricular adaptations in the areas of Math and language for years 7 and 8 of
      primary and then 1 and 2 of secondary and the evaluation strategies; designed the
      remedial courses (cursos de nivelación) and trained Math and Language teachers
      to provide the courses after school.
   • Direct pedagogical support to a total of 10,131 students at risk of dropping out of
      school in grades 1-4 in secondary.
   • Training to 156 teachers to acquire the skills to provide this type of pedagogical
      support: namely, curriculum adaptation and evaluation techniques.
   • Elaboration of training materials in collaboration with the CCAM to train
      teachers, using the CCAM methodology. These included: tests to assess the


                                            22
         students’ situation at the beginning and end of the course; content, tools for
         didactic planning, and other teaching tools;
     •   Planning strategies elaborated by the trained teachers and evaluated by the
         training coordinators and the PROTES coordinators.
     •   Elaboration of materials to disseminate the content of the program in the schools
         and communities;
     •   Materials compiling and summarizing the results of the training and of the
         courses.
     •   Use of the PISA test content to assess the achievement of the critical skills by the
         students.
     •   Completion of a physical and digital archive of the program.

6.     The courses took place in six locations, one of them being the CARE in San
Antonio. The locations were chosen based on the proximity to the students’ schools. The
courses total teaching time reached over 50 hours.

Component 2 – Improve the quality of education

Subcomponent 2.1 - Improvement of Educational Learning Environments
7.      This subcomponent succeeded in improving the targeted school buildings to
improve the quality of primary and secondary education. The quality and broad nature of
the civil works, which went well beyond the improvement of classroom infrastructure,
had an impact on the quality of the schools as a whole. The new constructions blended
well with the previously existing buildings and they were well appreciated by the
communities where they represented iconic institutions, truly supporting the development
of the neighborhoods.

8.       This subcomponent financed the following:

     •   The refurbishing of three school buildings (Arguedas in the macro-district of
         Cotahuma; Sarmiento and Villaroel in the macro-district of Centro). The civil
         works were completed by February 2010. A total of 58 classrooms were
         renovated (of which 16 were new classrooms and 38 were replacements of
         existing ones).
     •   The refurbishing meant – besides the classrooms – the construction of the
         following infrastructure: labs, computer rooms, multi-use rooms, auditorium,
         administrative spaces for the principal and secretary, sanitary blocks for students
         and teachers, covered recreational areas, storage spaces, lunch spaces to provide
         school breakfast provided by the Municipality, and living area for the school
         guard.
     •   Provision of equipment for the refurbished areas: school furniture, IT equipment
         and learning materials (modern blackboards, etc) which were provided to the
         school community and were functional by Project closing.
     •   A study on education infrastructure maintenance to clarify the roles and
         responsibilities of the different education actors and to raise awareness over the
         importance of caring for school infrastructure.

Subcomponent 2.2 - Awareness-raising programs on Civic Values (Civic Values
Program)
10.     This sub-component succeeded in designing and implementing a post-graduate
program on civic values which reached the principals and teachers who received the
official title, as well as the colleagues they trained, the students who were part of the
practices, the school councils and the parents who participated as well. The main outputs
were the following:

     •   Design of a curriculum for a post-graduate program for principals and teachers.
         The program was designed in collaboration with the Ombudsman and the Escuela
         de Gestion Publica Plurinacional (EGPP) and the Universidad Salesiana
         Boliviana at no cost for the Project or the Municipality. Further support was
         received from the Departmental Directorate and the District Offices (which
         depend on the MOE), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the
         municipal training center (CCAM) and the Women Development Center (Centro
         de Desarrollo de la Mujer – CIDEM). The second round of the program was
         developed in collaboration with the Universidad Catolica Bolivariana San Pablo,
         which housed the program and offered its teachers to impart the classes. These
         institutions elaborated the content of the modules and taught them. The modules
         were on human rights, intercultural relations, gender and equity, sexuality, civic
         culture, curriculum management. Three departments of the Municipality
         participated and complemented the work of the teaching institutions: the gender
         and Equity Department (Unidad de Genero y Equidad), the Intercultural
         Department (Delegación de Interculturalidad), and the Department of Civic
         Culture (Dirección de Cultura Ciudadana). The second session of the program
         was led by the Municipality and the different departments related to the content of
         the program (Delegacion de Juventudes, Direccion de PROTES, Direccion de
         Cultura Ciudadana, Dirección de Genero, etc). The cooperating institutions
         complemented the work of the municipality. These were the Universidad Catolica
         Boliviana, the office of the Ombudsman and the Ministry of Health.

         The content of the curriculum was developed after extensive consultation with the
         different departments in the municipality and the collaborating institutions to
         prioritize the problems experienced by students, and adopt an optic of prevention
         and human rights.



                                             24
          The modules were the following:

        2010 Session                                 2011 Session
  1.   Curriculum Management                   1.   Development education
  2.   Human rights and values                 2.   Basic emotional training
  3.   Civic education                         3.   Curriculum management
  4.   Intercultural education                 4.   Human rights and values
  5.   Sexual education                        5.   Civic education
  6.   Education for gender equity             6.   Education for intercultural relations
                                               7.   Comprehensive sexual education
                                               8.   Education for gender equity
                                               9.   Education for civic security

          The program used the following teaching and learning instances:

 Classes by experts, working in the municipality;
 Presentations with questions and answers, imparted by professors from the
  cooperating universities;
 Testimonials: led by experts from the municipalities, these were sessions between
  teachers and relevant personalities who shared experiences and real situations with
  the teachers;
 Training sessions of peer teachers: teachers in the program had to train their
  colleagues in their schools as part of the program. This meant the teachers in training
  had to organize and train their fellow teachers and develop and implement classroom
  projects, in each of the modules. This process was led and accompanied by the
  CCAM;
 Workshops with parents, dialogues with students, classroom projects and student
  fairs: these were final activities in each of the schools where the trainees taught. They
  changed the pedagogy used in the classroom.

Subcomponents 2.3 - Pedagogical Resource Platforms
11.     The Project supported the establishment of a Centre for Excellent Educational
Performance (CARE) in the macro-district of San Antonio, in an infrastructure owned by
the municipality. By Project completion, the CARE was fully functional, staffed with
four people and had benefitted around 11,000 stakeholders, including teachers, students
and members of the community. The CARE was equipped with furniture (tables, chairs),
computers, digital blackboards, books and other relevant teaching and learning materials
for science and humanities (maps, skeletons, etc.). The CARE was used for providing
training to teachers participating in the Civic Values Program and for providing the
pedagogical support to students participating in the Incentive Program. It provided
support and training to teachers on the changes brought by the new education law in
2010. The CARE team managed to produce educational materials to support the national
curriculum for math, adding tools to help teachers.

Subcomponent 2.4 - Strengthening of Educational Communities
12.   The Project achieved the following:
    • Establishment of 113 school management teams (Equipos de Gestión Educativa –
      EGEs);
    • Financing of 92 SIPs.

Component 3 – Education Management and Institutional Strengthening.

Subcomponent 3.1 - Management and Monitoring Information System.
13.    This subcomponent aimed at and succeeded in strengthening the education
information system of the Municipality and in particular of the Human Resource
Development Office (OMDH in Spanish). The Project financed the following activities:

The adaptation of the SIMAF: the Project financed establishing an information system to
monitor the Project’s implementation. The SIMAF was an existing management and
monitoring system being used by the municipality under a previous project (Proyecto
Barrios de Verdad). The SIMAF was adapted to track the financial progress of the
Project, produce reports and monitor implementation and outcome indicators and to link
to the Municipal Planning and Control System and to the Education Information System
of the Ministry of Education. Under this subcomponent, the Project financed the hiring of
the Project implementation team to manage, monitor and evaluate the performance and


                                           26
implementation of the project. The project financed the salaries and expenses
(coordinator, procurement specialist, financial management specialist, civil works
specialists and coordinators for the programs under the quality and access components)
and the equipping and expenses of the implementation team. This sub component
financed the annual audit reports.

Subcomponent 3.2 Impact Evaluation.
14.     An impact evaluation of the program for students at risk was not carried out, due
to the difficulties in accessing the MOE’s database on the students’ academic
achievement and socio-economic condition. The cost to carry out extensive field work to
get information and generate data on the students benefitted by the program would have
been much higher than budgeted. Instead, activity reports were prepared for each of the
main programs supported by the project, with a good quality description of the
achievements and beneficiaries reached by each of them.

Subcomponent 3.3 Institutional strengthening of the OMDH
15.     The Project financed the equipping of the OMDH, purchasing furniture and
computers. The Project financed staff to strengthen the legal department of the OMDH by
hiring a lawyer to manage the approval of contracts, generated under the Project. The
Project financed the hiring of four civil works supervisors to provide support to the civil
works and equipment unit within the OMDH of the municipality, responsible for design
and supervision of civil works. In 2010, these supervisors became personnel of the
department supervising works (DSO – Dirección de Supervisión de Obras), financed by
the Project while the Project was being implemented. The OMDH elaborated the Results
Reports for the main Project activities and a report on the fixed assets acquired through
the Project.

Subcomponent 3.4 - Assessment of Student Learning Progress
16.     Originally included in the PAD, this activity was removed at the time of
restructuring because it was out of the scope of activities of the municipality, since the
MOE is responsible for the teachers and students assessments. In 2011 the Project carried
out a PISA evaluation of a sample of students of third year of secondary who participated
in the Incentive Program. This evaluation - unofficial, as Bolivia does not participate in
international evaluations – was applied in 8 locations where the remedial courses were
taught to a group of 323 students (who represented 10.6 % of the students participating in
the program that year). It used the PISA instrument for 2006 to assess the performance of
these students in Math and Language. The main findings were helpful to compare the
skills of students in secondary education, who participated in the Incentive Program,
compared to their peers in other countries. These indicated that: (i) in Language, there
were significant weaknesses in reading comprehension, showing the lack of reading
habits among Bolivian youth; and (ii) in Math, students lacked knowledge of specific
parts of the curriculum and students at risk lacked the general knowledge to help them
resolve the challenges of their daily lives.                                              .

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The cost benefit analysis was updated at the time of restructuring, to take into account the
revised Project indicators. Given the period of time elapsed since this update, it was
considered relevant for the ICR.

According to a student flow model, up until the end of the Project execution, additional
infrastructure would make possible the enrollment of 360 extra students and quality
improvements would avoid 652 failures and 510 dropouts (Table 1).

Table 1: Impact of the Project on Selected Secondary Education Indicators
                                               2010     2011        2012             2013     2014
 Additional number of students enrolled           215       257         269             311      360
 Cumulative number of dropouts avoided           -128      -228        -287            -439     -510
 Cumulative number of repetitions avoided        -203      -301        -418            -534     -652

Following the methodology of the original analysis, the benefits were estimated using
age-earning and age working probability profile estimated from the household survey.
This allowed for estimating the impact of higher education on the probability of working
and on future earnings. According to the estimations, more education - in particular,
higher education – leads to higher earnings but has a minor impact on the probability of
working.

Applying this information, calculating the        Table 6: Project Private Return
private rate of return was straightforward
– it results from the Project-linked              Internal rate of return 40 years              11.9
benefits minus the private costs in terms          (Percentage)
of foregone wages while studying. Table 6         Internal rate of return 45 years              12.4
                                                   (Percentage)
shows that the private internal rate of           Internal rate of return 50 years              12.7
return is over 10 percent and the net 2007         (Percentage)
value of the income stream is positive at
different discount rates.                         Net Value 2007 at 4% (Millions Bs.)           87
                                                  Net Value 2007 at 6% (Millions Bs.)           39
                                                  Net Value 2007 at 8% (Millions Bs.)           17

With the private income difference established, the Project’s cost-benefit analysis
includes the direct costs of the Project - US$10 million IDA financing over 2008-2012 —
as well as the recurrent costs triggered. The main recurrent cost at the secondary level is
linked to the new teachers and administrative personnel that will be hired. New teachers
and administrators begin at the lowest category (Quinta) and they progress up through the
pay scale following the existing rules. The payment of three bonuses (Fusión, al
Cumplimiento y Económico) is also included. The costs associated with maintenance,
water and electricity are also taken into account as well as the administrative costs the
Project triggers related to student incentives and student progress assessments. To
estimate the cost of higher education, it is assumed that 47 percent of secondary
graduates enter public universities, and that 60 percent of them finish their degrees within



                                                28
seven years. Given that data on marginal higher education costs are unavailable, it is
assumed that the average costs add approximately Bs 3,700 per student per year.

Direct costs and foregone income are the most important costs in the short run, while
secondary and tertiary recurrent costs become more important in the medium term, as do
revenues (see Table 7). With this information, calculations show that the break-even
point occurs after 2028 and the internal rate of returns attains 4.5 percent.

Subject: Submission of comments on the ICR Project’s closeout

Dear Ms. Alvarez:

      Through this communication, I hereby submit comments provided by the
Municipality of La Paz on the ICR Project closure.

       I would like to take this opportunity to express our intention to continue
maintaining a close business relationship in benefit of the population of La Paz.

       Sincerely,


                             Erlinda G. Quispe Tancara
                                       Chief

Having support for student education in schools within the Municipality of La Paz is
considered highly useful for the achievement of its implementation objectives, in
particular to “promote policies and programs to expand education support services,
through fostering the creative application of pedagogical and educational processes in
the Municipality.”

The experience gained through the Transformation of Secondary Education Project
allowed the GAMLP to acquire new knowledge in:

    •   Budget Management. Up-to-date data related to the cost of infrastructure
        materials is very important for overall investment calculations, taking into
        account management time estimates for financial implementation. In the area of
        matching financial management and planned results, the Municipality benefitted
        from the application of implementation tools which facilitate bidding,
        contracting, development and completion of infrastructure works. The demand
        for internal communication among units within the GAMLP increased as
        implementation progressed until all actors involved in the implementation
        process were fully knowledgeable.

    •   Education Infrastructure Management. Classroom construction within an
        educational building must take into consideration analyses of various factors such
        as geographic topology of the Municipality, weather, student demands,
        administrative staff demands, construction trends, construction material
        requirements, and identification of prospective firms that comply with required
        technical specifications in order to deliver high quality infrastructure.

        Infrastructure maintenance is a factor that cannot be neglected; this requires a
        well thought-out inspection plan and schedule of review meetings in order to
        acknowledge demands from school councils and principals. The need to develop
        plans to incorporate students and administrative staff into maintenance activities
        was also identified to ensure that preventive measures in lieu of repair measures
        are utilized.

        Incorporation of phases in infrastructure construction. Work supervisors
        implemented construction activities in phases, which allowed for improvements
        in monitoring activities and identification of possible shortfalls so that corrective
        actions could be taken within established schedules.

    •   Equipment. This is closely linked to infrastructure as it complements
        construction activities and adds to student resources in their school activities.

        The quality of furniture improved, and, as a consequence, its durability, which
        reduced the remodeling frequency and/or the need for replacement.

        Schools are committed to keeping and taking care of the furniture.




                                            36
   •   Management of student statistical data in schools. Although education curricular
       actions do not fall within the GAMLP’s competencies, it was necessary to have
       demographic data and current information on the status of educational
       infrastructure in order to make decisions related to expansion, maintenance,
       equipping, and school support materials to school units. This need resulted in the
       development of documents which contain updated data, which are elaborated by
       public servants of the GAMLP including “Evaluation in the Municipality of La
       Paz -- First Census of Public School Buildings and School Buildings under
       Agreements.”

   •   Political Context. To be able to have access to information and understand the
       political context in which education takes place in the Municipality of La Paz is
       of great relevance for prompt decision making actions and for avoiding negative
       effects to project implementation.

   •   Ongoing Project evaluation. Monthly evaluation meetings are necessary to
       analyze outcomes and obstacles, as well as to receive suggestions to improve
       Project progress. Counterparts must be aware of current realities and have access
       to adequate communication channels.

   •   Dissemination of information to the community with respect to plans and
       activities. Although school construction actions are visible to the community, it
       is necessary to include strategic communication activities regarding ongoing and
       future projects so that the school community population is aware of and takes
       ownership of the works, thus ensuring successful implementation and continuity.

   •   Creation of strategic alliances. Close relationships with other institutions
       supporting education are a necessity to share successful experiences and lessons
       learned in order to capture actions and measures that will improve
       implementation.

   •   Having an integrated vision. This refers to activities that are not related to
       infrastructure but to social impact projects, such as CAREs – Centers for High
       Educational Performance —which help students to strengthen their school
       learning process; the Diplomado program on Civic Values for teachers and
       GAMLP staff members; promotion of contests and award ceremonies to school
       units which have implemented improved school infrastructure and equipment
       maintenance programs; and promotion of student retention in the education
       system.

Additional comments:

   (a) PDO indicators. Indicators 2 and 3 related to increased graduation rates and
       decreased repetition rates, respectively, agreed upon during restructuring, were
       projected based on official MoE data available as of 2010. However, towards the
       end of 2012, the MoE adjusted and refined its system data for 2009, 2010 and


                                          37
       2011, reporting lower indicators than those initially provided for the restructuring
       phase. This caused graduation and repetition rates as of 2012 to be lower than
       projected.    Therefore, this was an outcome beyond the control of the
       implementing agency, which hindered meeting the established targets, which
       would have been met had the MoE maintained the original data.

4. Development Outcome Risk Evaluation:

       The Civic Values Program is currently being replicated by the Municipality,
       which has adjusted its design to place stronger emphasis on school infrastructure
       maintenance and care.

As stated in the report, the Project was a first experience for the World Bank and the
Municipality, dealing with a sector which has dispersed responsibilities among various
institutions. Nevertheless, the Project has managed to meet its objectives, despite its
setbacks. This was made possible by the openness of the World Bank team, which
supported and accompanied the adjustment of the Project strategy, allowing its
implementation through amendments up to the restructuring of the Project.

It is highlighted that from Project approval in October 2007 to the effective date in 2008,
due to reasons beyond the implementing agency’s control, the level of disbursements
approved by the PAD was not met. This has resulted in the Project receiving an average
rating of moderately satisfactory performance, which does not reflect the additional effort
of the Municipality’s and the World Bank’s teams in adjusting the strategy described in
the ICR report and which represent major achievements for the Project.



Borrower’s contribution to the ICR:

The Autonomous Municipal Government of La Paz (in Spanish, GAMLP) has been
developing a number of actions and strategies aimed to support the improvement of the
quality of life of its citizens. Particularly in the field of education, GAMLP is working to
improve the quality of education through providing maintenance to and building
educational infrastructure, providing equipment and school furniture, and by supporting
educational processes. This effort is carried out on the basis of the needs of the
educational community and the demands of the school representatives, which contribute
in the management of education.

In this framework, GAMLP implemented the Secondary Education Transformation
project in the Municipality of La Paz (PROTES) between December 5, 2008 and March
31, 2013 by means of Credit Agreement No. 4365-BO with the World Bank (WB). The
agreement was signed on February 11, 2008 with a two-year extension for completion.

The aim of the project was to increase coverage and expand education access for
adolescents and youth in the education system. Also, the project aimed to improve the


                                            38
quality of education and ensure the permanence of students in the formal education
system. To achieve this goal, the project worked to strengthen capacities at the
decentralized education management level to give response, in an adequate and relevant
manner, to the needs and expectations of students, as well as to address the socio-
economic challenges in the Municipality; this initiative was developed in a framework of
respect for human rights; social, cultural and linguistic diversity; and human
development.

The implementation of the project was under the responsibility of the Directorate of
Education, dependent on the GAMLP Human Development Office (OMDH).
Additionally, for the Project’s implementation, the executing agency coordinated and
interacted with the MPD, Ministry of Economy and Finance, Ministry of Education,
Departmental Directorate of Education and the Education District Directorates in La Paz
(I, II, and III).

The Project was designed under the framework that human development is a key element
to sustain social and economic progress in all countries. In line with the Millennium
Development Goals and in accordance with national policies, the human development
municipal model focuses on the resolution of social problems that have been present in
Bolivia for a long time. In particular, it seeks a transformation of the overall national and
local educational system to make it a democratic sphere for economic and social change,
and cultural development.

Project components

The project was developed through three components:

1. Access. This component focuses on improving access to education and on improving
students’ promotion and completion rates in primary school’s upper levels and secondary
school. It also focuses on promoting access of new students to the educational system and
to promoting permanence of all students in school until they complete high school. The
access and permanence component includes the following subcomponents:
    • Infrastructure
    • Program for students at risk
2. Quality. This component aims to improve the quality of public education (primary and
secondary) for all students in the system. The second component includes the following
subcomponents:

   •   Improvement of educational facilities
   •   Awareness program on civic values
   •   High performance education center
   •   Strengthening of education communities
3. Management and institutional strengthening. This component seeks to strengthen the
capacity for educational management of GAMLP and OMDH. The subcomponents are:
   • Information and monitoring system


                                             39
   •   OMDH institutional strengthening
   •   Results evaluation
It should be noted that at the initial stage of project implementation (2008 and 2009), an
increase in cost of construction materials and labor negatively affected the infrastructure-
related components. Therefore, it was necessary to reduce the scale of some other
activities in the project and to adjust the scope of several subcomponents. In Component
1, the focus of the program for students at risk of educational failure was adjusted by
replacing the outsourcing of remedial classes with direct provision of such classes. In
Component 2, the scope of the infrastructure maintenance program and the program for
the strengthening of educational communities was reduced. The intervention strategy of
the High Performance Education Center was changed, through direct management of a
pilot center. The Civic Values Awareness Program was executed directly through
strategic alliances. In Component 3, the Student Assessment Program was removed since
this activity is the sole responsibility of the Ministry of Education.

Project Results

Component 1.

   •   Infrastructure.
One of the main responsibilities of GAMLP, within the framework of its attributions,
consists in equipping, financing, and guaranteeing the supply of basic utilities,
infrastructure, furnishing, and equipment of the schools; this was successfully
accomplished according to the goals set by the project, since all planned activities were
executed and delivered to the community. Therefore, this component responded to a
major need in the municipality caused by overcrowding or unmet demands (population
not served by the education system in each macro district and municipal district).

To face this responsibility, the project built and equipped four new schools (with 87
classrooms). Classrooms were expanded in 12 existing schools (97 classrooms).
As a result of an effort to comply with environmental regulations and handicapped
accessibility standards, the new facilities improved in aspects such as (noise, waste
disposal, handicapped accessibility, etc.). Therefore, some of the proposed improvements
were observed in the facilities, including among others prompt reaction in the case of
accidents, use of protective equipment, quick disposal of waste, and compliance with
safety standards for electrical connections.

Likewise, it is worth mentioning the significance of community involvement and
participation in the project as well as the support provided by the parents during the
stages of management, implementation, and delivery of the new facilities (classrooms)
and equipment. Another commitment made by the stakeholders was to take care of the
infrastructure and keep it in very good condition.

   •   Program for students at risk



                                            40
The implementation of the Incentive Program, surpassed the original goal as a result of
positive involvement by both the direct and indirect beneficiaries, despite obstacles found
in trying to gain access to students' specific information which was requested from the
Ministry of Education but was not made available. However, this hindrance was partially
overcome by adjusting the implementation strategy. Even with these difficulties in the
implementation stage itself, the subcomponent’s incidence and the commitment shown
by GAMLP to serve these students were directly related to the improvement of education
quality. This subcomponent reinforces the learning experience of students who are at risk
of dropping out of school or repeating a grade. Another positive outcome was that not
only the target population was served but also other social stakeholders as a result of the
students' interest and commitment and their parents' support.

It is also necessary to mention that during the implementation of the Incentive Program,
teachers were trained in innovative teaching methodologies in mathematics and language,
which are currently being applied.

The implementation of this project has allowed GAMLP to more directly support
students who were at risk of dropping out, a problem not yet addressed by the Ministry of
Education. This initiative can be replicated across the country. For this purpose, teaching
materials were exclusively designed for remedial courses in difficult subjects by using
innovative methodologies.

Component 2.

   •   Improvement of educational facilities
Three school facilities were refurbished (Arguedas 100%, Sarmiento 100% and Villarroel
100%), including equipment, school furniture and computer equipment. Likewise, 58
classrooms were rehabilitated.
During this process, new construction features were developed, which allow the
reduction of maintenance costs. These features are currently being evaluated by the
GAMLP for their later expanded use, for example: restrooms with flush valves,
installation of drinking fountains outside of the restrooms, use of concrete blocks, smaller
window frames, and others.

   •   Civic values awareness program
The training program on citizen values and attitudes was developed by the Post Graduate
Diploma Program on Citizen Values and Attitudes. The structure of the academic
program facilitated the development of a cascade-type training methodology and
involved post graduate students, staff in charge of replication, principals, students, and
parents, thereby expanding the number of beneficiaries. This component called for the
participation of the entire school community in issues related to education; it received
support from several institutions through strategic alliances with GAMLP and was able to
reach schools with contents relevant to the students. Those contents were not only related
to academic studies but also dealt with comprehensive topics. The total number of
beneficiaries surpassed the original goal.


                                            41
   •   High performance education center
The creation of the High Performance Education Center specifically started a process for
updating knowledge and practices of teachers while promoting changes in teaching and
learning processes. These new processes have an impact on school performance and
provide a first point of reference about the new Education Law. The positive results
obtained are creating opportunities for additional high performance centers in other
macro districts to reproduce, diversify, and in particular improve this new approach.
Internal capabilities within the municipal structure were strengthened to adequately
manage the High Performance Educational Center. The operation of the center involved a
period of time to introduce this new methodology into the daily activities of schools.
After the introduction phase, the center generated a culture that promotes good use of
available teaching resources.

   •   Strengthening of educational communities
The subcomponent for strengthening the education-related communities established 113
Educational Management Teams that operate in 180 schools. To achieve this goal, 92
School Improvement Plans were prepared, submitted, and evaluated. These improvement
plans gave priority to issues related to pedagogy, curriculum, social and educational
aspects, resources, equipment, materials, and infrastructure.

This experience can be credited for making possible the interaction of representatives
from different schools, school schedule shifts, and educational communities to conduct a
joint planning process. It also sought to improve the teaching and learning processes for
the benefit of students with the participation of parents, who identified and/or prioritized
actions, equipment and/or supplies needed. This subcomponent aimed to improve the
quality of education in different schools that operate using the same facilities at different
hours and encouraged an attitude of sharing.

This experience revealed the importance of creating a culture of cooperative work within
and among the educational communities and sought to include it in the institutional
education plan for each school. The plans should include positive actions to encourage
maintenance and preservation of educational facilities, such as installing garbage cans in
classrooms and playgrounds. This is an approach that can be replicated nationwide.

In sum, these new experiences for the Autonomous Municipal Government of La Paz
showed that it is necessary to further develop a culture for civic values that emphasizes
responsibility and co-responsibility. There is awareness that the results are not immediate
and that these positive measures aiming at effectively improving the quality of education
will achieve full success in time. As the theory indicates, this is a long term investment.

3. Management and Institutional Strengthening

   •   Information and Monitoring System



                                             42
The staff who participated in the project gained knowledge that will be applied in other
initiatives. Likewise, the resulting documentation, regulations, procedures, instructions,
and other materials, will be used in other similar initiatives. The staff also acquired
capacities to handle several management and monitoring systems and subsystems (SIM,
SIGMA, and SIMAF) and acquired knowledge on standards, internal coordination and
other key management aspects.

    •   OMDH Institutional Strengthening
OMDH technical staff benefited from new knowledge on project management undertaken
in coordination with international cooperation agencies. The element of institutional
strengthening has been demonstrated by the adoption of new coordination, financial
management, and procurement practices. These achievements represent unique strengths
and have placed GAMLP in an advantageous position among Bolivian institutions
providing public services.

Indicators
The analysis of indicators should take into account that the baseline was adjusted during
the restructuring stage of the project. Some substantial changes were introduced,
especially with regards to internal efficiency indicators: promotion, failure, and dropout
rates. It should also be noted that there was a change in information systems at the
Ministry of Education, a factor that had an effect on the outcomes obtained by the
Municipality. However, the outcomes have been favorable in the past four years.

It is important to reiterate that while it is not possible to directly link the indicators to the
project’s actions, it is possible to affirm that these activities were aimed at avoiding
dropout, increasing both permanence and promotion, as well as reducing student
repetition. The Project also gave the children and youth better conditions for study and
incentive programs for students at risk of school failure. In addition, the project drew
participation from parents in school activities and created the High Performance
Educational Center. Along with these efforts, teachers received new tools to improve
their work not only in the classroom but also in the task of building and strengthening
values and attitudes indispensable to improve the quality of education.

Conclusion
The evidence of the obtained outcomes shows that the project has not only diversified
and generated a number of benefits, but also that many of those benefits have been taken
by the direct and indirect beneficiaries as their own. In addition, this achievement
includes a social component, since it attracted social confidence within the educational
communities during the implementation of activities and subsequent ownership by the
beneficiaries. This means that the results presented by the project components and
subcomponents met the goals and also generated external results. Although some of these
results have no immediate application, they will be the basis for future interventions.
While it is not possible to estimate accurately the social, economic, and environmental
impact at this stage, it is clear that this initiative will have a future impact on society and
especially on the quality of education.



                                               43
Regarding social achievements, it is very important to note that the practice of active
communication, information, and support from the educational communities was
strengthened. This was an interactive relation between the implementation agency and the
community with an element of social oversight expressed in early warning activities,
roundtable discussions, and conflict resolution efforts. The project gained support from
the educational communities at several stages, expressed through tangible actions such as
community-based participation for cleanup campaigns, transport of furniture, etc.

Finally, the involvement of external stakeholders close to the educational communities
and institutions outside the GAMLP should be emphasized. The project served to
establish baselines for future interventions to improve the quality of education in the
Municipality of La Paz and in the rest of the country.

Annex 10 – Incentive Program for Students At-Risk of Education Failure: Results
from the assessment tests

As part of monitoring effort and in order to assess learning achievements, students
participating in the program took a test before and after the pedagogical support classes.
The test was applied to students participating in the first, second and third phases during
the 2010 and 2011 school years. The initial test identified: (i) the students’ knowledge of
the official curricula and their level of developed skills; and (ii) learning difficulties
regarding Mathematics and language. The test contributed to define the content and
focus of the pedagogical support, with an effort to give students the tools to resolve real
life problems. The test was composed of open questions and multiple-choice for language
and in the case of mathematics, ten questions were applied. The following areas were
identified to improve in Language: reading comprehension and writing of texts. Sample
of students were selected to analyze the results of the support.

Results of the 2010 tests

Some of the key results are the following:
    Results for reading comprehension markedly improved for students in the four
      levels (7th and 8th year of primary and 1st and 2nd year of secondary) participating
      in the course. An average of 72 percent of students in 1st year of secondary and 70
      percent of students in 2nd year of secondary in the participating districts provided
      correct answers (while the average at the beginning of the course was 41 percent
      and 47 percent respectively). Similar improvements were achieved by students in
      7th and 8th year of primary who reached averages of 73 and 69 percent of correct
      answers versus averages of 46 percent in the diagnostic test.
    Teachers succeeded in pulling students out of their academic at-risk situation,
      improving their academic self-esteem and building up students’ learning capacity
      and skills.
    Results for writing skills showed improvements in skills, with improvements in
      the quality of the students’ answers, showing improvements in their quality of
      communication.
    In the case of Mathematics, 50 percent of 7th and 8th grade and 60 percent of
      students of 1st and 2nd grade achieved a satisfactory level (9 of 10 questions were
      correct) by the end of the course versus average results between 28-40 percent in
      the diagnostic test. The skills improved were related to comprehension of
      mathematical information, communication and resolution of mathematical
      problems.
    Results from the application of PISA in 2010: this test was applied to a sample of
      45 percent of students for math and 35 percent of students for language in the 2nd
      grade of secondary. The application of the test intended to measure the degree of
      preparedness and skill of 2nd grade of secondary students after the pedagogical
      support course. The results pointed to the need of increasing daily reading in the
      education overall. The results brought significant weaknesses in reading
      comprehension. Regarding Math, the results obtained were well below the OECD

Results of the 2011 courses measured by the tests
There were three rounds of courses taught during the 2011 school years. Students were
tested at the beginning and completion of the course. The table below shows the changes
by grade in the percentage of students who obtained a good, satisfactory or unsatisfactory
result. The results show marked improvements in the percentage of students who
performed better, obtaining good or satisfactory results, while the percentage of students
obtaining unsatisfactory results diminished. This pattern was the same for other two
rounds in 2011 for Mathematics and language.

Annex 11 – Maps of the Project Interventions in the Municipality

The assessment of needs was based on: (i) evidence of overcrowding in schools; (ii)
unequal distribution of students among districts (with some districts showing a high
concentration of students versus others); (iii) degree of marginality (or the percentage of
population in school age who is not enrolled in school); and (iv) evidence of growth of
the population of school-age children in semi-urban and marginal areas). The following
maps were prepared by the OMDH to show where the Project’s interventions took place.
