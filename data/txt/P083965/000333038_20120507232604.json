Transformation Project for Bolivia\n            is to support La Paz's education strategy by: (i)\n            increasing access to secondary education for adolescents and\n            young people and improving their permanence in the education\n            system; (ii) improving quality and relevance of primary and\n            secondary education; and (iii) strengthening the\n            decentralized education management capacity. The changes and\n            rationale are as follows: 1) a revision of the scope and\n            description of some project sub-components to respond to\n            project, municipal and country realities, including the new\n            education law, Avelino Sinani - Elizardo Perez , which was\n            passed in December 2010; 2) a reallocation of funds among\n            categories consistent with the increase in cost of\n            construction, furniture and equipment and a consequent\n            reduction in the cost and scope of project activities\n            relating to the quality of education and institutional\n            strengthening; 3) a revision of the results matrix to\n            reflect the adjustments in project activities. New\n            indicators have been introduced to monitor the number of\n            direct project beneficiaries; and 4) a six-month extension\n            of the closing date so that the remaining planned classrooms\n            can be completed."}, "docdt": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
