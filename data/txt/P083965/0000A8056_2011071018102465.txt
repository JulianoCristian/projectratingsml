                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A Project Restructuring is being prepared to: a) revise Project costs and funds allocation in line with increased infrastructure costs, b) integrate in a more comprehensive way the
                         components that finance infrastructure and equipment, as well as c) re-arrange the quality related activities within the specific component in order to better reflect and measure their
                         objectives and achievements; and adapt them to country realities. The Project's indicators will also be revised in line with these changes.
