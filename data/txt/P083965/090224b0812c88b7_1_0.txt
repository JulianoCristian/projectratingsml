Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
The Project Restructuring is near completion and is expected to include: a) revision of Project costs and funds allocation in line with increased infrastructure costs; b) review of the
scope and description of some sub-components to respond to available resourcesand new realities, including the passing of the new Education Law (Avelino Sifiani-Elizardo P6rez -
No.070); c) review of the Results Matrix to reflect the adjustments in Project's sub-components; and d) a six-month extension of the Project Closing Date.
