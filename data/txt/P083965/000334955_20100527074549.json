Transformation Project for Bolivia is to support the\n            Municipal Government's education strategy, by: (i)\n            increasing access to secondary education for adolescents and\n            young people and improving their permanence in the education\n            system; (ii) improving quality and relevance of primary and\n            secondary education; and (iii) strengthening the\n            decentralized education management capacity of the\n            Municipality of La Paz. The project consists of three\n            components. Component one: access and permanence. This\n            component supports the efforts of the OMDH to promote\n            expanded coverage in secondary education (grades 9 through\n            12) and completion in the upper primary (grades 7 and 8) and\n            early secondary grades by: (i) increasing the number of\n            available secondary schooling places by 19,600, representing\n            41 percent of current enrollment; and (ii) increasing\n            secondary completion rates of approximately 5,130 students\n            at risk of educational failure, defined as having two or\n            more years of age/grade distortion. Component two: quality\n            of education. This component supports efforts by the\n            Municipality to improve the quality of basic education with\n            a focus on secondary education. The quality component\n            concentrates primarily on two activities: the rehabilitation\n            of educational infrastructure and the development of a\n            program that strengthens educational communities. This\n            component also establishes partnerships to create pedagogic\n            resource platforms. Component three: education management\n            and institutional strengthening. This component aims to\n            strengthen management capacity at the municipal and school\n            levels to facilitate actions to improve access to and\n            completion and quality of secondary education."}, "docdt": "2007-09-07T00:00:00Z"}
