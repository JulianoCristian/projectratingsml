                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A Project Restructuring was completed on April 25, 2012 and includes: (a) a revision of the scope and description of some Project sub-components to respond to Project, municipal
                         and country realities, including the new Education Law, Avelino Siñani – Elizardo Perez (No.070), which was passed in December 2010; (b) a reallocation of funds among categories
                         consistent with the increase in cost of construction, furniture and equipment and a consequent reduction in the cost and scope of Project activities relating to the quality of education
                         and institutional strengthening; (c) a revision of the Results Matrix to reflect the adjustments in Project activities. New indicators have been introduced to monitor the number of direct
                         Project beneficiaries; and (d) a six-month extension of the closing date so that the remaining (74) planned classrooms can be completed under the Project.
