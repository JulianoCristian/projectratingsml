Transformation Project for Bolivia were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n

The project's implementation strategies were\n            not adequate for La Paz and required change from the very\n            beginning. The design will have benefited from the views and\n            knowledge of local counterparts and staff in Bolivia to\n            better identify the most appropriate strategies to the\n            country's context. Project restructuring is an\n            opportunity to address shortcomings in design. Building\n            strategic alliances with key actors is essential to a\n            program's success. Upgrades in school infrastructure\n            can improve neighborhood quality of life. Phased\n            construction enables the improvement of techniques.
