                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Seven school buildings were completed under the Project and are fully functional, benefiting more than 6,300 students in 2013. In addition, 86 classrooms in 11 existing schools were
                         completed and equipped, and 11 in one school are in the final stage of construction. The Project has also supported the development of a Municipal regulation for the maintenance of
                         school infrastructure. The Program for at Risk Students, a tutoring program focused on improving language and math skills, was successfully implemented from 2009 to 2011,
                         benefiting approximately 10,000 students.

                         The Civic Values Awareness Program was implemented in 2010 and 2011, benefiting almost 300 teachers, principals and municipal staff, who have trained approximately 880 other
                         teachers and school board members. Around 20,000 students benefited from this awareness program through classroom projects, dialogue and awareness days on topics such as
                         sexuality, human rights, gender issues, citizenship and cultural issues. The Center for High Performance (CHP) is functioning adequately, benefiting the school community around its

                         area of influence. The Municipality will implement three CHPs in the short term as part of its sector policy. The Program to Strengthen the School Management Committees, aimed at
                         supporting the preparation and implementation of School Improvement Plans, has financed the execution of 92 plans in nearly 180 schools.

                         The Human Development Office's information management and monitoring system is in place. The system has allowed an adequate monitoring and supervision of Project activities.
                         In addition, some activities supported by the Project to enhance its execution have benefited the entire Municipality, for instance a workshop aimed at streamlining procedures to pay
