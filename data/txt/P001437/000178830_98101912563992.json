an agricultural produce\n            marketing corporation and in the operations of agricultural\n            cooperatives; construction of feeder roads, farm access\n            tracks, farmer

Up to 8,000 farm\n            families are expected to benefit directly from this project,\n            bringing the total number of families who would benefit from\n            both phases to about 16,000; such families would earn\n            significantly higher incomes. Improvement in agricultural\n            services, roads and wells introduced under both phases would\n            benefit more than 60 percent of the rural families in the region."}, "docdt": "1982-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
