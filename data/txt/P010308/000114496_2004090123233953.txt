Mr. Paul Isenman,
Director, Country Department 111,

U. S. A.
Dear Mr. Isenman,
         Credit 1909 CE -  Second Smallholder
         Rubber Rehabilitation Project
      I write with reference to the above Development Credit Agreement
entered into between the Government of Sri Lanka and the International
Development Association.
      The World Bank Supervision Mission in February 1992, suggested to
readjust the Replanting and New Planting targets from the original 35,500
ha and 3200 ha to 30,000 ha, and 8700 ha respectively.
      The distribution of planting over the last few years reflets a notable
reduction in the rate of Replanting and an upward trend in New Planting
activities, which is due to a number of factors, one of which is the
continued decline in rubber prices.
      Where new Planting activities are concerned it is evidenced that the
land for the purpose is found not from forest reserves but largely from
extents under other crops.
     We have agreed to the suggestion made by the Supervision Mission to
amend Replanting and New Planting targets over the Project period to 30,000
ha and 8,700 ha respectively.  I would therefore be grateful if you could
approve the necessary amendments to the corresponding figures in Paragraphs
1, and 2 of Part A encaptioned, 'Field Development' in schedule 2 of the
Development Credit Agreement.
                                        Yours sincerely,
                                       (R. Paskaralingam)
                                           Secretary
                                       Ministry of Finance
