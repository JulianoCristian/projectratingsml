Valparaiso; (b) increase efficiency\n            in port activities; (c) strengthen the institutional set-up\n            of the infrastructure sector; and (d) ensure the provision\n            of other high priority port-related investments.  The\n            project includes two components. Part A includes (a)\n            reconstruction of earthquake-damaged container and general\n            cargo berths at San Antonio and Valparaiso, and remodelling\n            and expanding related backup areas; (b) construction of a\n            new berth at the highly congested port of San Vicente; (c)\n            rehabilitation of the Baron berth at Valparaiso; (d)\n            technical assistance for institutional, engineering and\n            other project-related studies; and (e) training.  Part B\n            components comprise construction of fishing jetties, port\n            access facilities, and construction of inland terminals.\n            The project brings no adverse environmental impact and will\n            have aseismic design to prevent earthquake damage."}, "docdt": "1991-11-21T00:00:00Z"}
