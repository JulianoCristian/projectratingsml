economic recovery by increasing economic efficiency,\n            productivity and output while reducing financial losses in\n            the public enterprise sector. Project components will enable\n            the Government to: (i) pursue a defined program of\n            divestiture and liquidation of industrial public\n            enterprises; (ii) generate a short term supply response from\n            the manufacturing sector through well targeted management\n            and technology service assistance to retained industrial\n            parastatals; (iii) prepare a comprehensive program for\n            rationalization for the rest of the parastatals and; (iv)\n            define a longer term policy, legislative and administrative\n            framework for the sound management of the public enterprise\n            sector, and to assist the Government to define it's\n            role vis-a-vis the private sector. The project will also\n            provide assistance to the Statutory Corporations Division\n            (SCD), Ministry of Finance, to enable it to monitor\n            parastatal financial performance and budgetary implications\n            and to coordinate the implementation of the project."}, "docdt": "1988-10-14T00:00:00Z"}
