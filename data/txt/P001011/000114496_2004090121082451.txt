proceeds of the Credit in order to introduce a new category of
expenditures and modify the percentage of financing for the category
relating to equipment and vehicles.
      Having reviewed and accepted your request we are pleased to
inform you that the Association hereby agrees to amend the
Development Credit Agreement as follows:
1.    Section 1.02 of the Development Credit Agreement:
      Add new paragraph (f) to read as follows:
      "(f) "PMU" means the Project Management Unit in the Borrower's

      2.2   Increase the percentage of expenditures in Category (2)
to read "100%".

entirety, as set forth in the Annex to this letter.
