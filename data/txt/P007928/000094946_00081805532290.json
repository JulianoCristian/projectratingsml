The public/private Board of trust\n            fund can be an important platform for discussion and\n            planning among the various actors, especially in cases where\n            there are few forums where such discussions can take place.\n            Moreover, the Board should be large enough to allow for a\n            variety of expertise, perspectives, constituents, and to\n            cushion the impact of any one member not being available to\n            participate at a given time. Issues of conflicts of interest\n            must be analyzed in great detail, and procedures should be\n            in place to manage potential problems. It has been very\n            difficult to attract permanent endowment funds.\n            Non-permanent funding such as debt-for-nature swaps and\n            \"sinking funds\" have been easier to obtain. If the\n            option is available, GEF Trust Funds that are meant to\n            provide long-term permanent financing should be invested in\n            larger, more developed markets, in order to minimize\n            investment risk. The capacity of the implementing agency to\n            choose and monitor the investment managers and the risk in\n            their portfolios is critical to the long-term sustainability\n            and performance of the Trust Fund. Moreover, arrangements\n            should be in place to guarantee strong and consistent\n            supervision of the performance of the investment managers.\n            Portfolio manager investment contracts need to include clear\n            guidelines for investment risk, asset quality and portfolio diversity."}, "docdt": "2000-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
