term and predictable source of funding for the protection of\n            Peru's biodiversity through the establishment of a\n            trust fund, the income of which would be used for financing\n            the management of priority protected areas; b) improve the\n            National Institute of Natural Resources (INRENA)'s\n            capacity to protect and manage Peru's protected areas;\n            c) provide the country with a reliable institutional\n            mechanism to channel debt donations for sustainable\n            development and conservation through bilateral and\n            commercial debt-for nature swap agreements; and d) test the\n            viability of trust funds as mechanisms for providing long\n            term and sustainable funding for biodiversity conservation.\n            The components of this project consist of: the endowment of\n            the Trust Fund for the Conservation of Peru's Protected\n            Areas (FONANPE); management of selected protected areas; and\n            the project coordinating unit. The activities eligible for\n            funding from the grant include: a) financing the recurrent\n            costs of protected area management (staff salaries and\n            operating expenses); b) drafting, revising and implementing\n            management plans; c) establishing and managing buffer zones;\n            d) training professionals in park and wildlife management;\n            e) instituting environmental education and public awareness\n            programs for communities associated with protected areas; f)\n            institutional support for the strengthening of the field\n            work of IRENA's Directorate General for National\n            Protected Areas and Wildlife; g) administrative expenses of\n            Pro Fondo Nacional para Areas Naturales Protegidas por el\n            Estado (PROFNANPE) created as a not-for profit entity of\n            public interest but under private law to administer the\n            assets of FONANPE."}, "docdt": "1995-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
