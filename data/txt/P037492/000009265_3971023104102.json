Upon implementation, the project ran into\n            difficulties that led to completion delays, overrun of costs\n            and content changes. The start of the project was delayed\n            two years, which resulted in a twenty-three percent increase\n            in the initial cost. Some setbacks and difficulties\n            encountered during the project were due to lack of\n            preparation. The project was part of a long-term plan to\n            expand Spain's port capacity.  Despite setbacks, the\n            main goals of the project were achieved."}, "docdt": "1984-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
