temperature\n            geothermal water as a renewable indigenous energy resource\n            in district heating systems; 2) to reduce the emission of\n            greenhouse gases (GHG) and SO2 by replacing gas and heavy\n            oil; and 3) to promote sustainable management and the\n            development of environmentally sound and non-polluting\n            geothermal resources both in a national and regional\n            perspective. The project will be developed as an\n            environmental/energy management project in the city of\n            Klaipeda. It consists of two complementary components: 1) a\n            technical assistance and training component for: (a) design\n            of the geothermal loop including all necessary equipment for\n            extracting the heat from the geothermal water and\n            transferring it to the district heating system; (b)\n            preparation of detailed drilling, testing and completion\n            programs; (c) management support for project implementation,\n            including support in preparing tender documents, and\n            construction supervision; and (d) training of Lithuanian\n            staff and management in the operation of a similar\n            geothermal plant in Thisted, Denmark to optimize the\n            transfer of technology; and 2) an investment component for:\n            (a) establishment of two production wells and one injection\n            well; (b) above ground facilities including building and\n            necessary equipment such as absorption heat pumps, heat\n            exchanger, and auxiliary equipment for control and\n            regulation of the plant and the heat transfer to the\n            district heating system; and (c) piping between production\n            wells and geothermal plant, and between the geothermal plant\n            to the injection well, and piping between the geothermal\n            plant and the district heating network."}, "docdt": "1996-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
