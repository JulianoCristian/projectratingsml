Given the nature of\n            the project - a geothermal operation - several new lessons\n            suggest the following. Major positive lessons learned from\n            the project demonstrated: a) the many possibilities for\n            using low temperature-based geothermal energy in Lithuania;\n            b) the high potential for the development, and construction\n            of geothermal energy plants in other locations in Lithuania;\n            c) existing opportunities for using geothermal energy for\n            other purposes, for example health care, medicine, tourism,\n            relaxation etc.; d) that the cost price of heat energy\n            produced in a geothermal plant is lower than traditionally\n            produced heat; and, e) that heat produced in a geothermal\n            plant can substitute for the use of large amounts of fossil\n            fuels, and contribute to reduced greenhouse gas emissions,\n            thereby having a clear and positive effect on the global\n            environment. Notwithstanding, major negative lessons convey:\n            1)the inadequate location of the first injection well,\n            suggesting Enterprise Geotherma (EG) should have been more\n            insistent during the decision making process, avoiding the\n            unforeseen additional cost for a second injection well; 2)\n            insufficient analysis of geothermal water: a more prudent\n            analysis would have raised the gypsum problem, and included\n            same in the Project design; 3) control of the water flow and\n            temperature should have been done at time of drilling the\n            wells, instead of at the time of equipment delivery; 4) more\n            intensive supervision and technical assistance by the Danish\n            consultant during Project implementation, could have reduced\n            the time needed for start up, and to solve technical\n            problems. Other lessons suggest over estimated demand\n            forecasts for the overall heat needs of Klaipeda, following\n            the conversion to a market economy, and, in the event of a\n            future geothermal operation, it is highly recommended that\n            the plant be part of the district heating company, in order\n            to optimize benefits (environmental, economic and financial)."}, "docdt": "2003-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
