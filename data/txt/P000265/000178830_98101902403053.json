          will consist of strengthening and reorganizing the extension\n            service according to the training and visit system and\n            provision of inputs and equipment. Modifications will be\n            made and new elements added, to adopt existing extension\n            recommendations to the particular soil and climatic\n            conditions of the project area. New recommendations will be\n            the use of local rock phosphate with or without urea, the\n            introduction of drought-resistant crop varieties, crop\n            association methods and fallowing practices, the integration\n            of animal husbandry and crop cultivation as well as the\n            construction of contour bunds by means of animal traction.\n            The project will include an adaptive research component,\n            which will conduct the necessary trials. Because the project\n            stresses the need for integration of animal husbandry and\n            crop cultivation, it will also contain an animal health\n            component. A strong monitoring and evaluation unit will\n            determine to what extent the techniques will be successful\n            by conducting a base line survey at the start of the project\n            and follow-up of key technical parameters (particularly\n            fertilizer response rates). Special emphasis will be placed\n            on the study of farm budgets for various farming systems."}, "docdt": "1982-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
