The credit was closed on March 31, 1989, six months\n            behind schedule. It was not fully disbursed and a balance of\n            was cancelled. The last disbursement was made on October 27,\n            1989. The main objective of the Pilot Project was to\n            determine (i) if a number of economically viable technical\n            messages existed for the northern part of the CRPA, and if\n            their application would produce good results; and (ii) if it\n            was possible to overcome the socio-cultural and demographic\n            factors hindering the adoption of proven technical\n            innovations applicable to the southern part. To accomplish\n            this, the project was to identify and put into place an\n            agricultural system based on methods capable of preventing,\n            slowing or indeed totally stopping soil degradation. The\n            system as defined was to have been able to be applied in\n            similar agro-ecological regions in the country without major\n            modifications. Lessons learned include: the first lesson to\n            be learned from this pilot project is that extension staff\n            can be made to work far more effectively, provided they are\n            well organized and priority is put on diagnosis of problems\n            and technical competence in their regular training. The\n            staffs in the pilot project were indeed above-average and\n            they were closely supervised. Thus,-extrapolation from the\n            pilot areas will not be simple but the key elements for\n            success are now well known. The second lesson is that there\n            are benefits to be derived from doing applied research with\n            a network of interested volunteer farmers. First of all like\n            most volunteers, the farmers who volunteered to do the\n            testing were keenly interested in their work and performed\n            the test well. Second these farmers were not only able to\n            see for themselves how the proposed technical message worked\n            through the duration of the experiment but also how to adapt\n            the technical content of the test as experience was gained."}, "docdt": "1991-01-15T00:00:00Z"}
