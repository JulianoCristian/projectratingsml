PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Koudougou
Agricultural Pilot Project in Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta), for
which Credit 1293-UV in the amount of SDR 6.3 million (US$7 million) was
approved on September 21, 1982.  The Credit was closed on March 31, 1989,
six months behind schedule.  It w   not fully disbursed, and a balance of
SDR 1.841 million (US$2.4 milliox.) was cancelled.   The last disbursement
was made on October 27, 1989.
The PCR was prepared the Bank's Resident Mission in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso, in liaison with the Agriculture Operations Division, Country
Department V of the Africa Regional Office (Prefa:e, Evaluation Summary,
Parts I and III), and by the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started in the fall of 1989, and is
based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Credit Agreement,
supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower,
internal Bank memoranda, and the project technical documentation.

KOUDOUGOU AGRICULTURAL PILOT PROJECt
(CREDIT 1293-DUR)
EVALUATION SUMNARY
Introduction
1.       The Koudougou Pilot Agricultural Development Project was prepared
after the Bank decided to drop the agricultural project that had been
proposed to support the Koudougou CRPA 1/ activities. The main reason fLr
the Bank's decision was that research results that came to light after
negotiations raised doubts about the yield increase hypotheses, which vere
judged over-optimistic. Subsequent cost-benefit analyses showed an economic
rate of return of 6 to 8% instead of the 24% originally estimated. There was
'also some concern about the adverse effects of migration on the agricultural
base in the southern part of the project area.
Objectives
2.       The main objective of the Pilot Project was to determine (i) if a
number of economically viable technical messages existed for the northern
part of the CRPA, and if their application would produce good results; and
(ii) if it was possible to overcome the sociorcultural and demographic
factors hindering the adoption of proven technical innovations appli-able to
the southern part. To accomplish this, the project was to identify and put
into place an agricultural system based on methoda capable of preventing,
slowing. or indeed totally mtopping moll degradation. The system as defined
vas to have bien able to be applied in similar agro-ecological regions in the
country without major modifications.
Implementation Experience
3.       The Credit Agreement was signed on March 17, 1983 and the Credit was
declared effective on October 6 of the same year, too late to support the
1983/84 cropping season.  Nevertheless the CRPA was able to set up a new
extension system and the accompanying app].ied research program for the crop
season starting April 1, 1984, the first season under the project.
4.       Project implementation was slowed by the zeal with which the
Government sought to improve the management of public funds. People's
Revolutionary TriEunals could and did call upon senior civil servants and
project managers to justify their expenditures. In this fearful atmosphere,
project managers tended to request the approval of their supervisory ministry
before making any decision of a financial nature, whatever Lhe size or
urgency.  This caused long delay-sthat <ere harmful to the programs, as well
as slow disbuxsements.
5.      More-than-usual  difficulties  were  experienced  with  technical
assistance. The monitoring/evaluation component did not really get underway
until lU87, a three-year delay. The expansion of the livestock component to
include intensification activities did not get underway until the last year
./ Former ORDs (Organisme Régional de Développement), abolished 1986, and
replaced by the CRPAs (Centre Régional de Promotion Agro-pastorale) in 1987.



° iv -
of th- project because of the poor quality of preparation reports produced
by su<cessive consultants.
Results
6.       As a pilot operation aimed at testing working hypotheses,  the
project was successful in applied research, extension and monitoring. The
applied research component accomplished the following:   (i) ià' established
two farming systems in the PAPEMs and tested them in rural areas (one in the
northern zone and one in the southern zone); (ii) it determined the
technically and economically optimal doses of fertilizer - mineral and
organie; and (iii) it identified local varieties that performed as well as
the improved varieties proposed by the research stations and that were more
drought and disease-resistant.   All these results were incorporated into
technical messages that were disseminated among producers through the
extension network, which was reorganized with the help of the project.
7.       The monitoring service, once it became operational during the last
two years of the project, conducted some very useful surveys that identified
the technical, material and financial constraints faced by producers.  On
this basis, recommendations were formu.'ated with a view either to modifying
the messages or to determining what co: *itions would guarantee the acceptance
and application of those messages.
8.       In extension, the pilot projact- supported a test of the application
of T and V principles in two pilot areas. The results, in terms of staff's
perception of their increased effectiveness, were so impressive that the test
was expanded to the whole area covered by the Koudougou CRPA.
Sustainabilitv
9.       Since this project was a pilot operation, it was not intended to
continue under its current form. Still, it should be noted that while the
extension system is more effective, it is also more costly; its cost
effectiveness will have to be assessed in the light of several years
experience.    On the positive side, it is to be noted that the farming
systems developed by the project would be sustainable from a natural resource
management point of view.
Findings and Lessons Learned
10.      The first lesson to be learned from this pilot project is that
extension staff can be made to work far more effectively, provided they are
well organized and priority is put on diagnosis of problems and technical
competence in their regular training. The staff in the pilot project vere
indeed above-average and they were7 closely supervised.  Thus,-extrapolation
from the pilot areas will not be simple but the key elements for success are
now well known.



v 
11.      The second lesson is that there are benefits to be derived from
doing applied research with a network of interested volunteer farmers.  First
of all like most volunteers, the farmers who volunteered to do the testing
were keenly interested in their work and performed the test well. Second
these farmers were not only able to see for themselves how the proposed
technical message worked through the duration of the experiment but also how
to adapt the technical content of the test as experience was gained.

KOUDOUGOU AGRICULTURAL PILOT PROJECT
(CEEDIT 1293-EUR)
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1. Proiect Identity
Name:          Koudougou Agricultural Pilot Project
Credit No.:    1293-BUR
Region:        Africa
Country:       Burkina Paso
Sector:        Agriculture
2. Backgroun
2.01      Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in-the world.  The
country covers 274,000 km2 and lies in the transitional area between the
Sahel in the north and the Sudano-Guinean zone in the south.   Average
precipitation ranges from less than 300 am in the north to 1000 mm/1200 mm
in the south.
2.02      Agriculture is the driving force behind economic development in
Burkina Faso, employing between 80% and 90% of the population and providing
about 40% of GDP and exports (1989). The following priorities are set out
in the Government's agricultural strategy:
(a)  the development of rainfed agriculture by promoting improved
methods and integrating crop cultivation and animal husbandry, and
increasing productivity;
(b)  the protection of natural resources; and
(c) the achievement of food security.
The Bank has supported this strategy by granting 17 IDA Credits to finance
various agricultural operations affecting the whole of the country.
3. Project Obiectives and Description
3.01      The Project was designed to help the Government define and set up
an agricultural system capable of preventing, slowing, or even totally
eliminating soil degradation in both the Center/West CRPA (formerly the
Koudougou ORD) and the country as a whole.   The farming systems to be
designed and made available to--farmers were to be tested with reference to
the following two questions:
(a) Is there any economically viable technical package that is likely
to be successful in the densely populated northern part of the CRPA
(60 inhabitants per square kmL), where rainfall is low (from 600
mm to 800 mm)?
(b) Can the social and demographic factors hindering acceptar.ce of
promising packages in the south of the region be overcome?



-2-
3.02      To answer these two questions, the following actions had to be
taken under the Project:
(a)  testing of a set of impro ed agricultural  techn.- aes in one
northern and one southern region, in order to determine: (i) their
acceptability to farmers; (ii) their cost-benefit ratio; and (iii)
their technical effectiveness;
(b)  testing of the p,--sibility of reviving cotton production in the
south;
(c)  setting up a support system consisting of the following programs:
-    adaptive research for improving and matching the new technical
packages to local conditions;
-    an  animal  health  program  intended  to  facilitate  the
integration of animal husbandry and crop cultivation;
-    a program of support for input supply (inputs and tilling
equipment).
3.03      The project was to emphasize increased output and agricultural
income by providing extension services, agricultural equipment and inputs in
the two pilot areas. The Project included the following:
<a)  reorganizing extension services in the two pilot areas, training
extension agents along "treining and visit" principles, and
providing them with vehicles;
<b)  supplying agricultural equipment both on credit and for cash
payment;
(c)  assisting village groups with credit management, agricultural input
distribution, and other activities they wished to undertake;
(d)  implementing an adaptive research program to develop appropriate
technical packages;
(e)  supporting animal health services throughout the CRPA;
(f)  strengthening the monitoring and evaluation service.



- 3-
4. Project Design and Organization
4.01      The project's design has changed somewhat since 1973, when the
southern part of the CRPA was incorporated into the FLrst Bougouriba Project
(Credit 496-UV). Because this region was excluded from the second Bougouriba
(Cr. 1097 - BUR) project area at appraisal for administrative reasons, the
Government requested that a project be prepared covering the whole of the
Center/West CRPA. This new Project was identified in October 1977, and, on
the basis of the preparation report submitted to the Bank in March 1979, a
mission visited Burkina in June 1979 to appraise the Project, which was
negotiated in November 1980.
4.02      Research results which became available after negotiations in the
course of some sector work, raised doubts about the assumptions on which the
Project had been based. The new data indicated that these assumptions were
overoptimistie, for the following reasons: (i) soil quality in the north of
the CRPA was poor; (ii) there was no certainty that farmers in the south
would be willing to accept the extension agents' recommendations. Subsequent
project benefit calculations based on alternative yield assumptions showed
an expected economic rate of return of only 6% to 8%. Further, it was felt
that a reassessment of the initial approach had become ne_.essary because
evidence oF the adverse effects of migration on the agricultural base in the
south of the CRPA was found, as migrants were employing depletive practices
resulting in erosion.  Consequently, IDA and the Government agreed on the
idea of a pilot project to ascertain: (i) the existence of an economically
viable technical package for the north; (ii) the acceptability of the
existing package to farmers in the south of the region, and the possibility
of reviving cotton production in this area.
4.03      Because of the great disparities between the north and south of the
CRPA, from both the human and agro-ecological standpoints, the decision was
made to test the working hypotheses in two areas (each of which is
representative of the zone in which it is situated), In order to produce
replicable results.  Tests and trials were also planned both in the PAPEMs
("Support, Pre-extension and Multi-area Experimentation Sites"), and in a
network of test villages, where they were performed by test farmers who had
volunteered and been selected for their high technical standards.
4.04      Prolect costs and financin .  Total project costs were estimated
at US$ 10.8 million of which US$ 6.7 million was foreign exchange. The six
cate-ories to be financed were 1) the extension service, 2) inputs and
equi-?.ment, 3) adaptive research, 4) animal health, 5) monitoring and
ev"£uation, and 6) management and administration. The IDA Credit covered US$
7.0 million, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands contributed a grant in the
amount of US$ 2.9 million. Government, beneficiaries and domestic commercial
banks were to contribute US$ 0.3 million each. The Government financed civil
servants' salaries; the beneficiaries' financed the downpayments for draft
animals and the purchase of seasonal inputs; and domestic banks were to
finance fertilizer purchases.



5. Project linplemnentation
5.01      Implementation of the pilot project was entrusted to the CenterWest
CRPA. In general, project implementation may be considered satisfactory, as
regards both physical implementation and technical results. The Project made
it possible to establish and render operational the two PAPEMs (Kolbila in
the north and Kassou in the south) starting with the first cropping season
(1984/85) follcwing credit effectiveness. The field tests also began to be
implemented during this first season. The construction of offices and houses
for expatriates was somewhat delayed by cumbersome bidding proceduros, but
this had no effect on implementation, since alternative accommodations were
found.    The  justification  for  this  corstruction  should  therefare  be
questioned.
5.02      The monitoring and evaluation component encountered the greatest
start-up problems.   Data was gathered for the basic study on the initial
situation at project start-up without any proper arrangements having been
made for processing the data.   Thus, a considerable amount of data was
collected during the first three cropping seasons (from 1984 to 1986) from
which no usable information could be derived. It should be noted here that
the expatriate technical assistance had a negative impact in some ways, as
the excessive information requirements created some dissension within the
project team. Although iDA supervision missions at the time recommended that
the full-time experts be replaced by short-term but regular support missions,
this suggestion was not adopted. It was only in 1987, after the teparture
of the first specialist in monitoring and evaluation, that the design of the
study was reviewed and the data for the 1986 season corrected and completed
so that socioeconomic monitoring could proceed in the two Project areas.
5.03      Although originally designed to deal only with animal health
issues, the animal husbandry component was later expanded to include
livestock production and the organization of producers. This necessitated
a series of preparation missions and lengthy discussions of the component's
objectives and final content. Nevertheless, these discussions did not have
any seriously harmful effects on implementation of the animal health
component itself, since financing t,as available from the outset for the
purchase and distribution of veterinary supplies. Only the installation of
infrastructure   (i  .  offices,   staff  housing,   and  other  technical
infrastructure) was delayed, with construction not beginning until 1989,
i.e., at the end of the period of Bank-supported implementation.
5.04      Credit was to be provided to village groups for oxen, animal
traction equipment and stable construction. Funds for medium-term credit to
be financed under the IDA credit were managed by the CNCA (Caisse Nationale
de Crédit Agricole).  Initially, access to credit was hampered by slow credit
approvals with the result that the extension service was constrained: there
was   little   follow-up   on  recommendations   for   intensification   and
mechanization. The Bank agreed to finance the opening up of a regional bureau
of CNCA to facilitate the decentralization of its operations.   By 1986,
however, 20 farmers associations involving 200 farmers were operative,
borrowing CFAF 24 million. The scheme was encouraging for (i) farmers who



- 5 -
operation continued without any major problems, and recovery was good (90Z-96Z).
5.05        Two very important clauses of the Credit Agreement, which were
supposed to have had a great impact on the results of the project, were not
complied with:
(a)   Clause 3.06 (c) which obligates Government to include in the sales
prices of inputs a margin sufficient to ensure the recovery of the
entire cost of supply and distribution;
(b)   Clause 3.06 (d) which stipulates that Government must prepare and
furnish IDA with a statement of its policy regarding cost recovery
principles to be implemented for seeds and for livestock inputs
other than veterinary drugs, shall exchange views with IDA
concerning such policy not later than June 30, 1984 and shall apply
this policy starting the fourth year of the Project.
Looking back on these clauses, one possible explanation for why they were not
complied with is that this "pilot" project, limited to a small portion of the
territory of one CRPA, was an inappropriate tool for managing such a dialogue.
Indeed a project whose aim is to research technological messages capable of
increasing production yields in a given zone, is poorly suited to eliminating
existing pricing distortions for agricultural inputs for the entire country.
(Clause 3.06 (c) was eventually largely covered under the Fertilizer Project (Cr.
1550-BUR) and Clause 3.06 (d) will be addressed under the upcoming Agricultural
Sector Loan, currently under preparation.
6. Project Results
6.01        The two main achievements of the Project were:  (i) the establishment
of a complete and efficient system of research and development; and (ii) the
preparation and implementation of an extension monitoring program. The pilot
project was one of the few agricultural development operations in which research
and monitoring were closely integrated into the extension system.  Adaptive
research successfully established an integrated system that includes the
following:
(a)   tests and varietal trials in the PAPEMs, with assistance from the
national research system;
(b)   a network of test farmers working in the real environment;
(c)   the formulation of recommendations based on results obtained and
specifying: (a) the 'technically optimal amounts" to be used, which
usually confirms the recommendations of research at national level;
(b) the "economically optimal amounts' with wnich producers can
obtain significant and encouraging increases in output without
incurring excessive financial risks;



-6
(d)   the identification, improvement and distribution of efficient local
varieties, some of which vere previously known only within very
limited areas;
(e)   the preparation and testing (in both PAPEMs and on farms) of a
cropping system capable of ensuring output, maintaining soil
fertility, integrating crop cultivation and animal husbandry, and
generating income.
Research Results
6.02        Both varietal and fertilizer trials were conducted on crops such as
sorghum, groundnuts and maize and on fodder crops. The results are as follows
for 1986/87s
(a)   Sorghum.  The varietal test found that local varieties worked better
than the new "improved" varieties, despite heavy rainfal and late
planting.   The fertilizer trial, done in Yako, found that good
sorghum yields were obtained with NPK applications. A cost-benefit
ratio of 2:1 was found for every 100kg of NPK and 50 kg of urea per
hectare. This test vas not performed in the southern part because
the farmers did not vant to test the sorghum variety E 35-1
proposed.
(b)   Groundnuts.  The variety 59-426 always gave the best results, but
suffered a bit because the density per hectare vas too high.
Research continued on the optimum density per hectare, but the
results are not known at present. Groundnut production in Yako was
satisfactory even vithout any fertilizer at all, however the best
result was achieved vith an application of 25 kg of NPK per hectare.
(c)   Maize.  For the crop season 1986/87, the best results vere obtained
from variety TZESRW, replacing the variety EV 8330, which gave the
best results the year before. Both are far superior to the variety
Janne Flint - the variety previously recommended. Both TZESRW and
EV 8330 are highly resistent to striga, and it vas nov recommended
that the extension system substitute these two for Janne Flint. It
vas found that in Kassou, the maize responded vell to urea even when
used alone, and also to NPK in increasing doses.   The optimum
application  was established at 50kg NPK et 100 kg of urea per
hectare.
(d)   Cowpeas.  In the northern area, the variety TVK 32-36 gave the best
results, but is more susceptible to the changing climatic conditions
than the local variety. Trials on cowpeas without any fertilizers
were successful in the southern part, the variety RN1 enjoying the
most success.
(e)   Fodder crops.  Under the conditions at Kassou, the Dolichos lablab
variety no. 1 did not fair well at all (cause unknown), but the
phaséolus variety did very vell. As for the vegetative dolichos,



- 7 -
they  performed  well,  but  only  under  conditions  whicn  are
uncharacteristic of the region. The forage gramineas did not fair
very wall, perhaps because of poor seeds.
6.03        Other trial results.  The water management trials failed in Kassou
in 1986/87. The failure, however, taught a valuable lessons farmers and agents
were able to see that the package to be tested was not adapted to heavy rainfall,
which was the case in 1986187, and which occurs approximately every three to four
years.  Tilling trials found that tied-ridges used one month after sowing is the
best technique when the topography is just right; however its replicability is
very limited. In fact, an IDA mission in Decem.ber 1987 recommended that stone-
bunding be used instead. The results obtained were incorporated into technical
messages for use in extension.  These messages were disseminated in the two
project areas and throughout the CRPA, taking into accouat ecological conditions.
Extension Results
6.04        The Project Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (USEP) prepared and
executed an extension monitoring program which served the following purposes in
the project area:
(a)   identifying constraints encountered by producers on their farms, and
informing the adaptive research system so that it could make
appropriate recommendations;
(b)   identifying the reasons for which some innovations are not readily
accepted or applied by producers, and recommending adaptations.
Some of the constraints encountered by farmers includet climatic vagaries
especially in the northern part, technical packages which were not always
designed to adapt to these climatic vagaries, lack of time to till soil
especially in the north, lack of fertilizers, inadequate transportation, late
delivery of seeds and poor seed quality, poor quality of equipment, lack of
understanding of equipment, draft animals being too young to do the work
required, and lack of access to credit.
6.05        Since the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit's main concern for this
project was more to keep records on farmer participation in extension
demonstrations than to record production results registered by farmers who
adopted the extension agents' recommendations, production statistics are sketchy.
However, the wealth of information on farmer participation reveals two
interesting points: (a) in Yako in the northern part, farmer participation in
the demonstrations was slightly higher than in Kassou in the south, reaching
about 3,000 farmers and attracting vomen from non-project area villages; and (b)
the rate of participation among women was higher than the rate among men in Yako,
and in Kassou, participation by women was only slightly below that of men.
6.06        One of the project's objectiveu was to revive cotton production in
the southern zone. The campaign results were as follows:

Campaign     Area      Output     Yields
(ha)      (tons)      (kg/ha)
1984/85      150          80          530
1985/86      300         177          590
1986/87      490         7n0         1430
1987/88      750        1230         1640
This compares very favorably with the 100 tons targeted in the project's Issues
Paper of November 1981.
6.07        In contrast to many operations, the good intention of integrating
research, monitoring and extension was successfully applied in the Pilot Project.
This enabled the technical packages disseminated by the extension system to be
modified periodically and thus adapted to local circumstances.
6.08        Obviously,  there is still room for improvement  in the system.
Improving monitoring would entail reducing the amount of data gathered. Such
data should be limited to information essential to the identification of major
constraints hindering the improvement of production systems, and to that
information which can be rapidly analyzed and immediately provided to
decisionmakers. Adaptive research could be made substantially more efficient by
increasing on-farm tests, which would also reduce costs.
6.09        As a result of the mid-term review of the Project at the end of 1987,
and given the positive results already obtained, the Bank and the Government
agreed to extend project activities, and particularly the extension component,
to the whole of the CRPA's territory. Because this expansion was carried out
from the 1988/89 cropping season onwards, it was not possible to evaluate its
effects at the time data was being collected for this report. Nevertheless, it
should be noted that this expansion of project activities paved the way for the
Agricultural Services Project (Credit 1979-BUR).
7. Bank Performance
7.01        Supervision was regular, at an average rate of two missions per year.
The missions contributed substantially to the conduct of field operations,
especially as regards the establishment of the extension se,stem, adaptive
research, monitoring and evaluation, animal husbandry, and the adaptation of
farming implements. Although the Bank missions had a positive impact on results
in the first three categories, the same is not true of the animal husbandry and
farm implement components. Their impact was very limited on accelerating the
start-up of animal husbandry activities, because of difficulties encountered by
the cofinancier in finding a consultant who could make a satisfactory proposal.
It was only after three preparation missions had visited the project area that
an actionable proposal was produced.
7.02        The adaptation of farm implements was not possible because of the
Government's reluctance to hire an expatriate consultant identified by the Bank
to propose, build and test equipment prototypes better adapted to conditions than
those being produced and marketed locally.



7.03        Contrary to Section 3.06 of the Credit Agreement,  there was no
monitoring of Government's policy regarding cost recovery for the distribution
of agricultural inputs, including veterinary supplies. This failing was due to
the fact that:   (i) the problem of fertilizers was being addressed under a
special Credit (1550-BUR); (ii) in Burkina, veterinary supplies have always been
sold, nevei supplied free. Nevertheless, the need to pass along all start-up and
management costs in the sale prices of products has yet to be addressed.
8. Performance of Borrower and Consultants
8.01        The Government's obligations basically entailed the provision of
qualified personnel for project implementation.   In all cases, supervisory,
management and field personnel assigned to the Project were of good quality.
Staff changes during the Project (which had three different directors) had no
adverse impact on implementation. Project management was nevertheless hampered
by the fears raised by the People's Revolutionary Tribunals, and in 1986, by the
change in the legal status of the ORDs to
CRPAs although less than in other ORDs.
8.02        The performance of the expatriate consultants hired by the Government
or on its behalf was uneven.   Nevertheless, their assistance was overall a
decisive factor in providing guidance for local supervisory staff, particularly
as regards adaptive research and the monitoring of extension. They fulfilled
their role of training local supervisory staff in unfamiliar tasks and, by the
end of the Project, this fruitful cooperation had produced a team capable of
operating a dynamic extension system.
9. Project Documentation and Data
9.01        Because this was a research-and-development Pilot Project for testing
technical hypotheses, no financial or economic rates of return were calculated;
indeed, because the Project was executed in an experimental context, the
conditions of its implementation obviously differ from those prevailing in the
CRPA or the country as a whole. The field agents assigned to the two project
areas were selected for their above-average technical expertise, thus biasing the
results. Although the physical and financial resources concentrated on the pilot
areas to obtain the present results were not enormous, they could not be made
universally available in any attempt to replicate those results.
9.02        Consequently, for the results to be effectively applied throughout
the CRPA and the country, the two important biases (which were intentionally
introduced for experimental purposes) must be reduced to the extent possible.
To this end:
(a)   The adaptive research component must be reviewed with a view to
reducing operating costs in the PAPEMs. These must be confined to
trials requiring a controlled environment andior that would entail
financial risk if performed by farmers.   Other tasks should be
contracted out to farmers who are at - advanced level of expertise
and are willing to perform tests on i.teir farms. This new network



- 10 -
of testers should be carefully organized to cover the whole of the
CRPA, thus optimizing the demonstration effect:
(b)   The monitoring system must be modified so as to concentrate efforts
on analyzing the probable major obstacles to full farm development.
It is only by scaling down the volume of data gathered, processed
and analyzed that solutions can be proposed for the most crucial
problems, while using the same number of monitoring agents over the
entire CRPA area as were used in the two pilot areas; and
(c)   The field extension agents operating over the whole of the CRPA must
be provided with retraining to upgrade their expertise.

PART Il: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Comments on the Project Completion Report of the
Koudougou Agricultural Pilot Project (PPDAK)
The Project Completion Report of the Koudougou Agricultural Pilot
Project prepared by the Bank does not call for any particular comments on
behalf of the CenterWest CRPA, except to say that by virtue of its being a
npilotm project, the CenterWest CRPA did make a special effort to do a good
job carrying out the project.
Its management by an institution not having any other means of
working for the rest of the CRPA created conflicts between the Project Zone
and the areas outside the Project Zone. This situation vas somewhat brought
under control during the last year of the Project by extending the Project
Zone to the rest of the CenterWest CRPA. Unfortunately, the duration of this
extension vas too short (one season) to properly evaluate the effects.
We agree vith the World Bank on the lessons learned (pages iii-
iv) and on the recommendations for follow-up projecte (p.9). Nevertheless,
the CRPA thinks that a component *support to the CRPA' should have been
included in the Project, that would have eased the difficulties experienced
between the Project and the rest of the CRPA.
Concerning paragraph 7.02 on page 8, vithout knowing exactly
which conditions in particular motivated the necessity to *propose, build and
test equipment prototypes better adapted to conditions than those being
produced and marketed locally ve do not think that the fact this clause vas
not carried out caused any undue problems in equipping farmers in the Project
Zone.
In Annex 2, page 11, the CRPA thinks that the reasons given by
the World Bank for the «uncertainties about projected yield increases' are,
first of all, contrary to the results obtained by the Project and, that
secondly, the immlnent entry into effectiveness of the Agricultural Support
Services Project concommitant to the Project's extension period, overshadowed
the necessity of finalizing the Koudougou Project's extension in favor of the
implementation of the Agricultural Support Services Project which vas going
to cover all the CRPAs.
The rushed end of the Koudougou Pilot Project generated some
recurrent costs which vere difficult for the CRPA to bear and which could not
unfortunately be alleviated by the long entry into effectiveness of the
Agricultural Support Services Project whose principles objectives do not
necessarily constitute a logical follow-up of the Koudougou Project.

6. Project Results
A. Direct Benefits
Since the Project was a pilot operation, no quantitative benefits were
established at appraisal. The qualitative benefits expected were:
1. Establishment of a complete and efficient system of research and
development which (a) conducted tests and formulated recommendations on
appropriate technical packages; (b) identified, improved and distributed
local varieties; (c) prepared and tested a cropping system capable of
ensuring output, maintaining soil fertility and generating incomes.
2. Preparation and implementation of an extension monitoring program to
identify constraints faced by producers and reasons to explain why certain
innovations were not accepted or applied by producers.
3. Despite the fact that no formal indicators were established and no ERR was
calculated for this project, the overall qualitative assessment of the
Project is that it did have a positive impact on (i) cereal and cotton
production; and (ii) soil conservation and fertility improvements.
These benefits were obtained, as indicated in Section 6 of Part I.
B. Economic Rate of Return
As this was a pilot operation, no ex-ante economic rate of return was
calculated. It was hoped that the pilot operation would develop into a full-
scale agricultural development project with an ERR similar to those of other
area development projects, i.e., about 20%, such as Bougouriba II (Cr 1097
Bur), Hauts Bassins (Cr 1284 Bur) and Volta Noire (Cr 1285 Bur) that were
implemented with IDA (and other) financing in the mid-1980s.   The pilot
project did provide a good basis for further investment in the agriculture
of the project area (and beyond), as was indicated by the expansion of the
extension component from the two test areas to the whole area covered by the
Koudougou CRPA during the life of the pilot project. Moreover, the results
of the pilot project contributed to the design of the nationwide Agricultural
Research (Cr 1896 Bur) and Agricultural Services (Cr-1979 Bur) projects.
There will, however, be no further area development project of the kind
initially anticipated as the follow up to the pilot project.
