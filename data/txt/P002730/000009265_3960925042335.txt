REFACE
1.    This is the Project Comp          Report (PCR) for the Dar-es-Salaam Port
Engineering Project, for which C.-   S-24-TA in the amount of US $2.5 million
was approved on December 27, 197J and declared effective on August 13, 1980.
There were two extensions of the Closing Date (from September 30, 1981 to
June 30, 1982 to June 30, 1983). The Credit was fully disbursed and the date of
the last disbursement was October 24, 1983.
2.    This PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of the
Southern Africa Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). On
August 26, 1991, the Bank sent the Borrower Parts I and III with the request to
prepare Part II by November 26, 1991, but no reply was received.
3.    Preparation of this PCR was based, inter alia on the President's Report,
the Development Credit and Project Agreements; supervision and progress reports;
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

DAR-ES-SALAAM PORT ENGINEERING PROJECT
(CREDIT S-24-TA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Proiect Obiectives
1.    The Dar-es-Salaam Port Engineering Project was deemed a necessary prior
action for the rehabilitation and modernization of Tanzania's principal sea port,
the Port of Dar-es-Salaaml/ by financing preliminary and final engineering
designs for the civil works to be carried out.  The expected improvement in
efficiency of the port would relieve congestion and increase throughput as well
as introduce modern techniques for grain and container handling.The project was
the first Bank project designed to provide assistance to a Tanzanian nationil
corporation, the Tanzania Har-ours Authority (THA), which replaced one of five
former East African Community (EAC) statutory institutions.
2.    Major components of the project as originally envisaged, included the
preparation of a feasibility study on the location of a bulk grain silo; the
preparation of designs and cost estimates for an import storage warehouse, a
container facility, a tug berth, improvements to the entrance channel and
replacement of the petroleum jetty as well as the provision of technical
assistance to THA in the evaluation of bids for civil works.
3.    In May 1981, it became necessary to revise the scope of the project to take
into account the occurrence of a number of events within the region and the
existing state of the port.
4.    Funds for the project were on-lent under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement from
the Government to THA, who with assistance from consultants, executed the
project.
I/Financed under the Port Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1536-TA, 1984,
US $27.0 million) and the Second Port Modernization Project (Credit 2095-TA,
1990, US $37.0 million) which are ongoing.

ImPlementation Experience
5.    Throughout project implementation, a number of delays on the part of the
Borrower and the executing agency, THA, caused work to fall behind schedule. The
date of credit effectiveness was postponed twice (from February 27, 1980 to
June 27, 1980 and finally to August 13, 1980) because of the delay in submission
of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and THA. In the initial
stages of implementation, THA fell behind in the processing of consultants'
claims and withdrawal applications.  Also, THA took a while to comment on a
number of consultant drawings and designs thereby holding up the work program.
6.    During the course of iwplementation, the decision was taken to invite a
proposal from the consultants providing assistance with design preparation, for
the 34pervision of civil works on the subsequent project.
7.    In mid-1981, as a iesult of a combination of factors, it became necessary
to revise the scope of the project.  These factors included: a reduced need for
berths; a slow-down in the economies of Tanzania and Zambia; Zambia's use of
alternative routes to ocean ports through Zimbabwe; and a reduction in Zambian
grain imports. The original long term plan for rehabilitation of the port was
divided into two phases
8.    As a result of the revision in scope, construction of the 30,000 grain silo
and the commissioning of the new oil jetty were postponed to the next phase.
Designs and cost estimates were prepared for improvements to the entrance channel
and reinstatement of the existing petroleum jetty which were considered to be of
more pressing need.
9.    THA did not fully comply with the covenants of the Development Credit
Agreement covering the review of tariffs and the submission of audited financial
accounts. The former was carried out after a delay of 6 months and the latter
complied with only for the period between 1978-79.
10.   The Closing Date of the project was extended from September 30, 1981 to
February 28, 1982 and finally to June 30, 1983 to cover completion of designs
under the revised project. However, the last disbursement was made on October
24, 1983 and the Bank officially closed the account on that date.
Results
11.   The objectives of the project were achieved within estimated costs. The
project was completed in August 1983 instead of February 1981 as originally
expected. This was due to the combination of delays on the part of the Borrower
and THA in the initial stages of implementation and those experienced an1 a result
of implementing the revised project.



- iv -
12.   Engineering designs for the entrance channel  (reduced in depth),  for
conversion of berths to containers, paving and other shore works for container
handling and the repair of the existing oil jetty were completed. Designs for
cs-, jents not included in the revised project (including the new oil jetty and
a    JOO ton grain silo) but completed before revisions took place were retained
for '4ture use. The preparation of tender documents and bid evaluation for the
revised scope of work were a.so completed.
Sustainabilitr
13.   Not applicable.
Findings and Lessons Learned
14.   The main  lessons  from the  implementation of the Dar-es-Salaam Port
Engineering Project are:
the importance of flexibility in project design to incorporate
revisions in scope that will allow the maximum benefits to be
achieved under the project and for those benefits to be sustained;
and
-     the importance of the continuity of staff  (Bank,  Borrower and
consultants) employed on a pro4ect, to its smooth implementation.

Sub-Sector               Ports
2.    Background
2.1         Dar-es-Salaam is Tanzania's principal sea port, located in a natural
harbour on the East African seaboard of the Indian Ocean    In addition to
handling the bulk of Tanzania's traffic, this port has traditionally handled
transit traffic for eastern Zaire and the landlocked countries of Burundi and
Rwanda. In the 1970s, it became a major port for Zambia's seaborne imports and
exports, particularly since the opening of TAZARA - the Chinese-financed, joint
Tanzania and Zambia-owned railway - in 1976.
2.2         The  history  of  coordination  of  investments  within  Tanzania's
transport sector has been mixed due in large part to a lack of planning
capability.   A major cause of the problems was the dissolution of the East
African Community in 1977. During its existence, air transport, ports, and a
portion of the rail system operated under cooperative statutory institutions of
the Community, with planning and coordin---ion at the Community level.  These
transport elements now operate under new agencies established by the Tanzania
Government and have experienced significant problems maintaining management and
operational systems at desired levels.



- 2 -
2.3         Government programs in the port sub-sector have sought to ensure that
Tanzania as well as the landlocked neighboring countries have an efficient outlet
to the sea The Bank having recognized the importance of the Port of Dar-es-
Salaai in the country's transport system and its vital role as a regional port,
has supported this strategy.
2.4         When the organizational issues were tesolved after the collapse of
the EAC by forming a national port authority, the Tanzania Harbours Authority
(TEA), the Governnent approached the Bank for assistance to undertake the more
urgent investments in the ports sub-sector. Since then, a major focus of the
Bank's involvement has been to ensure as best possible that THA's requirements
for technical assistance and the development of Tanzanian personnel are met.
Also, the Bank has sought to ensure that the Port of Dar-es-Salaam continues to
follow global technical trends and improves its efficiency in import operations
in order to keep up with the growth of shipping, container traffic and bulk grain
shipments.
2.5         Prior to the Dar-es-Salaam Port Engineering Project, four specific
investments were made to assist the predecessor entities - the East African
Railways  & Harbours Administration  (EAR&H)  and the East African Harbours
Corporation (EAHC) in port development: the Railways & Harbours Administration
Development Project 'Loan 110-EA, 1955, US $24.0 million), the Second East
African Railways & Harbours Administration Development Project (Loan 428-EA,
1965, US $38.0 million), the Harbours Corporation Project (Loan 638-EA, 1969, US
$35.0 million) and the Third Harbours Project (Loan 865-EA, 1972, US $ 26.0
million).l/
2.6         In April 1979, the Bank concluded that all the investment proposals
for the proposed project (resulting from the UNDP-fir.anced study of the Port of
Dar-es-Salaam completed in 1974) appeared economically, financially and
technically viable but was unable to finalize project cost projections.   The
principal uncertainty involved dredging, which was to constitute a major portion
of project costs. To achieve a sufficient degree of accuracy in the preparation
of cost estimates with a view to securing adequate financing of the proposed
project, appraisal (of the proposed project) was postponed until detailed designs
could be completed and bids for the dredging contract received.
2.7         A two-phased approach to financing the rehabilitation of the Port of
Dar-es-Salaam was proposed.   The first phase would involve provision of an
engineering credit to cover detailed engineering design and preparation of tender
documents for the anticipated port investment including a feasibility study of
the location of a bulk grain silo. The civil works for which detailed designs
and preparation of tender documents were proposed included: straightening and
deepening of the entrance channel; a container facility; a petroleum jetty; a tug
berth; a grain silo with ship unloader, conveyor system and elevator; and an
import storage warehouse. This required topographic and hydrographic surveys;
l/The project for which this one served as necessary preparation (Port
Rehabilitation Project, Credit 1536-TA, US $27.0 million) was completed in
1991 and one additional project (Second Port Modernization Project, Credit
2095-TA US $37.0 million) is ongoing.

sub-surface exploration (drilling); civil, electrical and mechanical engineering;
*rchitectural  services;  drafting;  and  support  services  for  the  effort
(transportation, accommodation, subsistence, printing, communication, overhead,
etc.).
2.8         The  second  phase  was  to  cover  the  financing  of  the  Port
Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1536-TA, 1984) and consisted of some of the items
fos which design work was carried out as well as technical assistance, equipment
and training components.
2.9         While other alternatives -.  inancing the engineering credit were
considered, they were rejected because _ospective funds were inadequate to meet
the cost of engineering services and would have unduly delayed their completion.
It was proposed that the engineering credit would be refinanced under the
subsequent Port Reh` _.'iation Project (Credit 1536-TA, 1984, US $27.0 million).
However, this proposal was not implemented.
2.10        The estimated total cost of the engineering services was US $3.0
million net of taxes and duties 1/ including a 22Z margin for contingencies.
The foreign exchange component amounted to 8SL of the total costs or US $2.5
million. The engineering credit financed the entire foreign exchange component
and TEA financed local costs amounting to US $0.5 million.
2.11        The engineering credit was onlent by the Government to TEA under a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA.
3.    Project Oblectives and Description
3.1         The main ebjective of the Dar-es-Salaam Port Engineering Project was
to assist THA in the first phase of the proposed expansion of the Port of Dar-es-
Salaam. This involved the preparation of engineering designs, tender documents
and bid evaluation for various works required for the improvement and
modernization of the port.
3.2         The project as originally envisaged consisted of four parts:
the preparation of a feasibility study on the location of a bulk
grain silo;
-     the preparation of preliminary and final engineering designs, cost
estimates and tender documents for:
(i) a bulk grain silo, with a ship unloader, conveyor system
and elevator; and
(ii) an import storage warehouse;
l/The project was exempt from identifiable taxes and duties.



- 4 -
the preparation of final engineering designs, coat estimates and
tender documents for:
(i)   deepening and straightening of the entrance channel;
(ii)   a container facility;
(iii)   the replacement of the petroleum jetty;
(iv)   a tug berth; and
-     the provision of assistan&ce to TEA in the evaluation of civil works
tenders.
3.3         In May 1981, the Government in agreement with the Bank revised the
scope of the proposed project, thereby necessitating revisions to the work
carried out under the Engineering Credit. The revised work program comprised
preparation of detailed designs, tender documents and bid evaluation covering:
-     the deepening and straightening of the entrance channel;
-     berth conversion to handle projected volumes of container cargo;
-     the construction of back-up facilities for container handling; and
-     repairs to the existing oil jetty.
3.4         THA's tariff structure was considered sound at the time of the
preparation of the Engineering Credit and earnings were sufficient to cover the
cost of its operations including current debt service obligations.   It was
anticipated that with the implementation of the proposed project, a substantial
local currency portion would have to be met over about a 4-year period and it
could only be done if the rate of internal generation of cash was ircreased
through increased efficiency and higher tariffs.  To achieve this TEA was to
review its tariff levels to determine appropriate changes to be made to ensure
coverage of the economic cost of its operations including the financing of the
local currency costs of its future investments.
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.1         The reduction in scope of the project was appropriate given the
events that took place in the initial stages of implementation (See para. 8).
Revisions were made in order to deal with clear and pressing needs of the port
such as reducing the dredging depth of the entrance channel (from 10 m to 9 m)
to best suit the traffic patterns of the port, reinstating the petroleum jetty
given its dangerous state and providing some form of container facilities to
handle growing volumes of containerized traffic. Inclusion of the construction
of the 30,000 ton silo was reconsidered in favor of concentrating on reducing
grain losses due to spoiling and spillage and cutting down on berth time for
grain vessels.



-5-
5.    Proiect 7m.lementation
5.1         The Development Credit Agreement was signed on February 27, 1980 but
er.ny became effective on August 13, 1980 because of the delay in Government
compliance with the conditions of effectiveness (submission of the Subsidiary
Loan Agreement with TEA and the legal opinion).
5.2         In the early stages of implementation despite the relatively smooth
progress, coordination problems surrounding the commissioning of the new oil
jetty caused some concern to the Bank. The commissioning required all necessary
pipe work liiks to the TIPER oil refinery and the existing network to be
completed and ready before  the new jetty.   A delay  in the decision  on
responsibility for design work, site work and financing (which included a
sizeable amount of foreign exchange) caused the commissioning to be put back.
In November 1980, THA was asked by the Bank to take firm action to ensure that
the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TDPC) took the necessary steps
to arrange for the new links to be installed.l/
5.3         By mid-1980, the consultants had prepared a number of reports and
drawings for the ensuing project2/ and waited for comments from THA before
proceeding with the next sections of the work program. Later that year, it was
agreed by the Bank and THA that continuing with the services of the same firm of
consultants for the supervision of the civil works of the proposed project would
best serve the project.   A decision was made to invite a proposal from the
consultants to allow them to be appointed before works were to begin.
5.4         The Bank felt that further consideration was needed on the method of
the grain-discharging system in the port. The conveyor system was deemed neither
the most economical nor the most advantageous method in view of the volumes of
grain expected to be handled per year. The consultants were asked to investigate
alternative methods.   It was felt that the process of discharging grain could
be enhanced at a fraction of the cost of building the new silo within the
original project scope.   Hence, this component was dropped from the revised
project.
5.5         THA requested that it be given approval to carry out part of the
electrical works under the ensuing project using its own staff and equipment.
This was agreed to as the advantages - THA's previous experience in this area and
the continuity of use of equipment and layout easing future maintenance efforts -
made this suggestion sound.
5.6         THA did not fully comply with covenants of the Development Credit
Agreement concerning the review and implementation of tariffs and the submission
of audited financial accounts. The review of tariffs was undertaken in August
1980 but management decision on implementation of new tariffs was delayed
1/Under the revised project, commissioning of the new oil jetty was postponed
in favor of repairing the existing one.

awaiting approval of the Ministry of Communications and Transportation (MCT).
This resulted in revisions taking effect from January 1, 1981, six months later
than anticipated. In January 1981, audited financial accounts were submitted to
the Bank only for the 1978-79 period.   The remaining accounts were never
submitted to the Auditor Generals for audit.
5.7         By early 1981, a number of important events had occurred which were
deemed significant enough to affect the approach to be taken in the development
of the Port of Dar-es-Salaam. These were:
-     a substantial increase in the percentage of containerized cargo
which implied a reduced need for berths and an urgent need for
container handling facilities;
-     a slow-down in the economies of both Tanzania and Zambia with a
consequent reduction in both imports and exports;
-     Zambia's use of alternative routes to ocean ports through Zimbabwe;
and
-     a substantial reduction in grain imports to Zambia.
5.8         It became necessary to reduce the scope of the proposed project from
that envisaged at the time of the presentation of the Engineering Credit to the
Board. THA and The Bank agreed upon the revised project scope in May 1981.
5.9         The revised project involved major improvements to the entrance
channel, the conversion of some existing berths to container operations, paving
and other shore works for container handling, repair of the existing oil jetty
(considered  dangerous),  and  technical  assistance  and  training  to  THA.
Construction of the new tug berths was omitted from the project and construction
of both the 30,000 ton grain silo as well as the new oil jetty were postponed.
5.10        However, in view of the advanced state of the work carried out by the
consultants on the detailed engineering for the original scope, THA and the Bank
agreed that the consultants complete the drawings and specifications for the
project items postponed, on the assumption that there would be a need for them
at a later date. A revision of the consultants' terms of reference was carried
out in order to enable them to complete the detailed engineering for the revised
project.
5.11        The completion of tender documents and tender evaluation were not
carried out before the end of 1981, and it became necessary to postpone the
Closing Date of the Project from September 30, 1981 to June 30, 1983. Delays in
the processing of consultants claims and withdrawal applications during the early
stages of implementation also contributed to the postponement.

6.    Prolect Results
6.1          The Dar-es-Salaam Port Engineering Project achieved its aim of
laying the foundation for the much-needed expansion and improvement of Tanzania's
leading port. Thus, it contributed towards achieving the ultimate goal of the
Port of Dar-es-Salaam providing appropriate and adequate facilities for the
growing volumes of general cargo, dry bulk and liquid bulk traffic.
6.2         The same consultants who carried out the UNDP-financed study of EAC
ports for the Bank in the 1970s, were used in implementation of the Engineering
Credit and proposals were sought that would allow them to supervise the civil
works to be carried out under the second phase of the development of the Port of
Dar-es-Salaam. It was evident that the consultants understood their role clearly
and the project benefitted from the use of them continuously throughout the
course of implementation.
7.    Prolect Sustainability
Not applicable.
8.    Bank Performance
8.1         Supervision was carried out regularly and professionally and led to
the discovery of the need for a revision in the scope of the project as new
factors emerged. Revisions undertaken may have reduced the potential for cost
and time overruns in the subsequent projects.
8.2         The following lessons may be learned from the implementation of the
Dar-es-Salaam Port Engineering Project:
-     the importance of flexibility in project design to incorporate
revisions in scope that will allow the maximum benefits to be
achieved under the project and for those benefits to be sustained;
and
-     the importance of the continuity of staff  (Bank,  Borrower and
Consultants) employed on the project to its smooth implementation.



-8-
9.    Borrower Performance
9.1         Borrower performance under the project was mixed.   At project
preparation, the Borrower clearly identified the priorities for investment in the
development of the Port of Dar-es-Salaam. However, at the outset the delay in
compliance with the conditions for effectiveness necessitated the postponement
of the effectiveness date twicel/.
9.2         The Borrower was  also responsible  for numerous  delays  in the
processing of consultants' claims and withdrawal applications under the Credit
as well as in coumenting on consultants' designs and reports.
9.3         After a six month delay, the Borrower complied with the covenant of
the Development Credit Agreement concerning the review and implementation of
tariffs. However, the covenant concerning the submission of audited accounts was
only partially complied with - only the accounts for FY79 were audited by the
Tanzania Audit Corporation and submitted to the Bank in January 1981.   The
accounts for subsequent years were not submitted for audit.
10.   Project Relationship
10.1        The satisfactory working relationship between the Bank and the
Borrower began during the development of the plan for the rehabilitation and
modernization of the Port of Dar-es-Salaam.   This  facilitated the timely
identification of the need for revisions in the scope of the project and the
development of a better sequenced approach to the work to be carried out.
10.2        Delays  in  processing  claims  in  the  early  stages  of  project
implementation led to a somewhat strained relationship between consultants and
the Borrower. However, the situation improved as implementation progressed.
11.   Consulting Services
11.1        The project benefitted enormously  from the recruitment  of the
consultants who had undertaken the study for the master plan for the development
of the Port of Dar-es-Salaam in the 1970s.
11.2        The studies prepared under this project (though not all used) were
very useful in the preparation and appraisal of the subsequent Port
Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1536-TA, 1984).
l/The date of effectiveness, originally day 27, 1980 was postponed to
June 27, 1980 and finally to August 13, 1980.

12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.1        The Development Credit and Project Agreement for the project, r,s
originally envisaged, were straightforward and incorporated the main priorities
of the Borrower up until revision of the scope of the project became necessary.
Amendments were made to the Agreement (December 15, 1981 and July 7, 1982) to
allow for the extensio; of the Closing Date of the project.
12.2        Reports of the studies carried out including detailed designs and
drawings,  cost estimates and progress and supervision reports were all very
useful in preparing for the next phase of the development of the Port of Dar-es-
Salaam.
