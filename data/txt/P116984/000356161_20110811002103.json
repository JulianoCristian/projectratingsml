of were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: credits processed in response to crisis have to be\n            processed quickly, and must help shape government's\n            immediate response yet not lose sight of medium term\n            objectives. Having a bank presence on the ground and most of\n            the team on the ground with a previously established\n            dialogue helped lay the basis for the design and relatively\n            fast processing of this operation. Donors help improve the\n            design of the operation and speed up its processing and\n            leverage additional resources. Bank's assistance in\n            sharing of lessons from emergency response from other\n            countries was also useful."}, "docdt": "2011-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
