            PROPOSED FIFTH PROGRAMMATIC DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT
                             REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN

                                         1.       INTRODUCTION

1.     The Fifth Programmatic Development Policy Grant (PDPG5) in the amount of US$10 million
is the second in a programmatic series of three operations for the Republic of Tajikistan. The PDPG
4-6 series is central to the World Bank’s engagement in Tajikistan, as envisaged in the FY10-13 Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) discussed by the Board in May 2010. It supports the government’s two-
pronged strategy to mitigate the impact of the global crisis and to pave the way for post-crisis recovery
and sustained growth and poverty reduction. PDPG 4-6 build on the PDPG1-3 series completed in 2009.
Under PDPG1-3, the government pursued a program of reforms aimed at increasing the competitiveness
of the private sector, at strengthening public sector management, and at improving the delivery of
services. Despite setbacks and delays, the earlier reform program resulted in improvements in a number
of areas. Details of the reform program and its outcomes are presented in the Implementation Completion
Report for the previous series.1

2.    Tajikistan was affected adversely by the global economic crisis. Growth decelerated to 3.9
percent in 2009 from more than 8 percent per annum during 2000-08. The government budget
experienced substantial revenue shortfall, resulting in pressures on public spending in education, health,
and social protection. The government responded to these unfavorable developments by facilitating
external adjustment through exchange rate flexibility, by increasing public spending under its anti-crisis
action plan to protect critical expenditures, and by continuing reforms.

3.    The PDPG 4-6 series seeks to protect social spending and increase its efficiency, improve the
climate for private sector development, and strengthen government effectiveness. To protect basic
services, the program seeks to maintain public expenditures on health, education and social protection and
increase their efficiency and targeting. To improve private sector environment, it seeks to streamline
business regulations, strengthen the financial sector, increase access to air transport and promote private
investment, especially in agriculture. To enhance government effectiveness, the program seeks to promote
transparency and efficiency in the management of utilities and of public expenditures.

4.    PDPG4 focused mainly on protecting earlier gains in social spending and improving the
climate for private investment, in the face of ongoing global crisis. For social spending, 2010 budget
allocations for health, education and social protection were kept at no less than 2009 share of budget
allocations for the respective sectors. For the private investment climate, the coverage of permits were
reduced, amendments to commercial banking law and central bank law were submitted to Parliament, the
aviation sector policy liberalizing the air transport market was adopted, the old cotton debt overhang on
farmers was removed and an initial round of land-use certificates were issued to farmers.

5.    The proposed PDPG5 supports actions in all three areas aimed at improving basic social
services, private sector climate, and government effectiveness. To protect basic services, government
has continued improving targeting and efficiency of social spending, specifically it has adopted a health
sector master plan, issued resolutions for implementation of per capita financing in general education, and
introduced pilot schemes for better targeting of social assistance in two rayons. To improve the
environment for private sector, the government has submitted a law codifying reduction in coverage of

permits and procedures to restrict introduction of new permits, to continue issuing land-use certificates to
farmers, and to take further actions to strengthen the financial sector. To enhance government
effectiveness, Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgas have made progress in implementation of their financial
management improvement plans and in encouraging more efficient use of power.

                                    2.       COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                           A.      BACKGROUND

6.     Tajikistan is a small landlocked country vulnerable to natural disasters and external
economic conditions. Located in the heart of Central Asia, the country is blessed with abundant water
resources, contributing to its specialization in cotton production. Tajikistan also has hydropower
potential—inexpensive electricity has led to its other specialization: processing of aluminum. Only 7
percent of its total land area is arable; high mountain ranges make communication between different parts
of the country difficult, especially in winter. Tajikistan is susceptible to natural disasters and is regularly
affected by floods, landslides, earthquakes, and droughts. These factors combine to make Tajikistan one
of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable economies. Its gross national income (GNI) per capita was
estimated at US$700 in 2009. Limited employment opportunities at home have led 40 percent of working
age population to seek better jobs in Russia. Shortly after its independence in 1991, the country descended
into a civil war that lasted until mid-1997, which brought widespread physical damage and loss of life.

7.     Strong economic growth during the past decade reflected post conflict ‘catch-up’ and rising
domestic demand fuelled by remittances and other inflows. The economy grew at an average of 8.6
percent per year during 2000-2008. Total investment, dominated by public investment, has hovered
around 20 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) with private investment stagnating at only around 5
percent of GDP. Strong growth was made possible by five favorable factors: the peace agreement that
permitted businesses and households to return to normal economic activity; a stabilization dividend from
the Government’s success in stabilizing the economy; the growing global and regional economy that led
to rising aluminum and cotton export receipts and remittances; rising inflows of donor assistance,
including from the international financial institutions; and reforms that permitted existing businesses and
households to take advantage of emerging opportunities.

8.    The Government’s reforms, though gradual, covered areas relevant for the country to benefit
from a growing world economy. In the early years, Tajikistan opened up trade, established a central
bank and a commercial banking system, negotiated visa-free access for Tajik workers to go to Russia and
removed taxes on remittance inflows. Private businesses and households were given a bigger role than
before as a large number of small and medium-size enterprises were privatized, including cotton
ginneries, and land reform provided more land for private farms and households. In recent years, reforms
have sought to improve further the private investment climate, increase access to air transportation,
rationalize cotton sector operations, remove restrictions on exports and strengthen governance in selected
areas like the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT), large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and public
expenditure management.

                              B.         RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

9.    Tajikistan was adversely impacted by the global economic crisis. Due to a decline in
remittances and a fall in exports of cotton and aluminum, economic growth fell to 3.9 percent in 2009.
Remittances fell from US$2.3 billion in 2008 (nearly 47 percent of GDP) to US$1.6 billion in 2009, while
total export receipts dropped by almost 13 percent due to lower international prices of cotton and
aluminum. Tajikistan’s financial sector was also adversely affected by falling exports, remittances and

                                                      2
GDP growth, with non-performing loans in the banking sector rising to record levels. The disruption of
cargo deliveries due to Uzbekistan border closures and large amounts of directed lending to the cotton
sector added to financial sector difficulties. Thus credit flows to private sector fell and have not yet
recovered.

10. The Government pursued a two-pronged strategy in response to the growth slowdown by
increasing public spending and facilitating external adjustment. To protect critical social spending
(education, health, and social protection), it increased public spending under its anti-crisis action plan and
expanded employment opportunities through social programs such as a cash-for-work scheme and
measures to facilitate entrepreneurship. Greater exchange rate flexibility and depreciation of the somoni
served as an effective shock absorber during the crisis, contributing to Tajikistan’s improved
competitiveness compared to other countries in the region, and facilitated current account adjustment.2
The somoni depreciated on average by about 20 percent in 2009 relative to the US dollar, helping the
current account balance change from a deficit of 7.6 percent and 5.9 percent of GDP in 2008 and 2009
respectively to a surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2010 (Table 1). Higher international prices of
aluminum and cotton in 2010 were also important contributory factors in facilitating external adjustment.

11. While affected by the global economic downturn, Tajikistan’s economic growth of 3.9 percent in
2009 was better than that of almost all other countries in the region, and exceeded expectations at the start
of 2009. The government maintained a slightly expansionary fiscal stance in 2009. To assist the
Government of Tajikistan during the global economic crisis, development partners provided increased
external assistance in 2009, which helped the government maintain expenditures on health, education, and
social assistance. During implementation of the anti-crisis plan the fiscal deficit [excluding the Public

12. The economy recovered in 2010, growing by 6.5 percent, reflecting higher growth in hydroelectric
power production, construction (up 11.5 percent compared to the previous year) and in manufacturing (up
9.7 percent). The agriculture sector performed well too, expanding by 6.8 percent. Remittances rebounded
in 2010 (up nearly 26 percent), though their level remained below the peak recorded in 2008 (Table 1).
However, recent increases in international wheat and fuel prices have pushed up the inflation rate to 9.8
percent in 2010.

13. Strong growth in recent years has contributed to good progress on poverty reduction.
According to estimates derived from the Tajikistan Living Standards Survey (TLSS) series, the poverty
headcount rate in Tajikistan has declined steadily from 72 percent in 2003 to 47 percent in 2009, while
extreme poverty fell from 42 to 17 percent over the same period. Poverty incidence in Tajikistan is
highest in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO) and Khatlon regions (respectively 62 and
54 percent in 2009), and lowest in Dushanbe (34 percent); nonetheless all regions achieved gains in
poverty reduction during the period under review. Similarly, while poverty incidence in urban areas
continues to be lower than in rural areas (respectively 42 and 49 percent in 2009), both regions have
benefited from high economic growth in recent years.

14. Several key non-income dimensions of living conditions have also improved. Tajikistan is
approaching universal enrollment in primary and lower secondary education. Enrollment for 14 year-olds
increased from 88 percent in 2007 to 95 percent in 2009. According to data from a recent household
survey, Tajikistan has one of the highest rates of life satisfaction in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA)
region.3 Over 75 percent of respondents say that the economic situation improved since 2006 and 64
percent say that the political climate also got better. Almost 70 percent of households say they live better
today than in 2006 and almost 60 percent are satisfied with their financial situation. There is widespread
optimism for future generations across all age and income groups, despite the fact that Tajikistan remains
among the poorest countries in the region.

15. Notwithstanding these impressive achievements, significant challenges remain. Poverty in
Tajikistan remains widespread and linked to specific characteristics, such as high fertility and poor labor
market conditions and high dependence on remittances. The poor continue to be disadvantaged in terms
of access to good-quality education services and health care, and receive little, if any, help from the weak
social protection system. Health outcomes remain the weakest among countries in the region, in particular
for infant mortality, under-five mortality, and maternal mortality. Child nutrition, especially stunting of
children (i.e. low height-for-age) is of high concern, averaging 28.9 percent of children aged 6-59 months.

16. Tajikistan’s performance in 2011 is expected to remain buoyant as part of the continuing
recovery from the slump in 2009 in line with global and regional recovery. As exports and
remittances rise from their depressed levels, growth in 2011 is estimated to reach 5.8 percent (Table 3).
This is being driven by growth in construction and services sectors supported by large increases in export
receipts and remittances.

17. Over the medium term real GDP is projected to grow at around 5 percent a year. This is
significantly less than the pre-crisis rates of 8 percent a year averaged during 2000-08 because the
potential for post-conflict ‘catch-up’ is smaller and the external environment is less favorable. Cotton and
aluminum are unlikely to be as important as in the past. Initially, most of the projected growth is
expected to come from construction, trade and other services but with time, exports of non-cotton
agriculture, power, and even mining (see Box 1) are expected to contribute increasingly to growth.

18. However, future growth will depend more on increasing efficiency and private investment.
Concerted efforts will have to be made to reduce cost and raise profitability of private investments and
exports, especially in agriculture and agro-processing. Earlier reforms in agriculture have created an
improved environment on which to build further. The Government is committed to making it less costly
for investors to start a business and pay taxes as well as to increase access to reliable power, in order to

                                                          5
address the major constraints cited by investors. Efforts are also underway to make investment in
agriculture, especially for exports, more profitable by enhancing access to markets, empowering farmers
by removing the debt overhang and strengthening their rights to land, targeting irrigation investment and
improving farmers’ access to inputs. Remittances are expected to grow more slowly from their high base,
but they could be a bigger contributor to growth if more go into private investment than before. In
addition, private investment in hydro-power projects is also a possibility if appropriate conditions can be
created. Construction of the Roghun hydropower project to address Tajikistan’s energy deficit is a
government strategic priority, for which it allocated 650 million somoni (USD 148 million) in the 2010
budget.

                                      Box 1: Mining Sector Potential in Tajikistan
 Tajikistan has good mining sector potential that remains largely untapped. It has one of the world’s largest silver
 deposits, mostly concentrated at the Konimansur mine complex in the northern Soghd region. Various estimates put the
 size of the deposits at around 50,000 tons, while media reports indicate that total investments required to develop them
 may be in the order of USD 2 billion. Potential for other minerals, such as gold, zinc, lead, and precious stones, is also
 strong. Despite the country’s mineral wealth, there are few foreign companies active in the sector as the Government did
 not actively focus on attracting foreign investment. However, in the last two years, the Tajik authorities have shown a
 strong interest to promote investment in the mining sector and to undertake reforms. One of these reforms was
 Resolution 400 (passed on August 15, 2008) that mandated the competitive bidding of all licenses in the mining sector,
 including exploration and exploitation.
 The World Bank Group has begun working with the Tajik authorities in different ways in the mining sector. The
 International Finance Corporation (IFC) has worked with Tajik authorities over the past two years on bidding out the
 Bolshoi Konimansur silver deposit; this process is expected to be completed by June 2011. If successful, Tajikistan
 stands to attract a reputable large-scale mining company, which will favorably affect its fiscal revenues and overall
 economy. A preliminary review of the mining sector’s institutional, regulatory, and legal framework was recently carried
 out through support from an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant. The government has expressed initial interest
 to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in the next two years, and staff from the World Bank’s Oil, Gas
 & Mining Policy Group has been supporting these efforts.


19. Maintaining macroeconomic stability will be also critical for raising private investment, given
the country’s high debt and its vulnerability to external shocks. The Government aims to keep its
debt/GDP ratio at less than 40 percent and for this reason has planned to reduce its public investment
program over the medium term. This will require continued vigilance by the central bank and the finance
ministry to address problems facing the country. The room for additional public spending on
infrastructure and social sectors is limited and thus public investment needs to be contained and
prioritized for growth; in particular, public expenditure management will have to be strengthened to make
spending more efficient. Large SOEs and banks require greater transparency and financial discipline, and
the government must make more strenuous tax efforts, overhauling the tax regime.

20. The government aims to gradually eliminate the fiscal deficit (excluding PIP) by 2014. The
overall fiscal deficit (including PIP) is expected to shrink from an estimated 5.4 percent of GDP in 2011
to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2014 (Table 3). With overall revenues and grants expected to remain stable at
around 22 percent of GDP and current expenditures maintained at around 15-16 percent of GDP, most of
the reduction in the fiscal deficit is planned through reduced capital spending. Total capital spending
peaked during the 2007-2009 period, when the government undertook several large projects through
concessional financing from China to improve road infrastructure and electricity transmission. Now that
several of these projects have been completed, capital spending is projected to drop to around 9 percent of
GDP in 2014, which though will still be higher than the levels of around 5-8 percent per annum prevailing
over the period 2003-2006.



                                                            6
21. The external account is expected to revert to a deficit in 2011 and later years in light of the
reversal of the one-off factors that curbed imports in 2010 (intermittent blockage of rail transit through
Uzbekistan end) the full year impact of Russian export duties on fuel imposed in May 2010, and the rise
in food and fuel prices that increase import cost. The recent growth in non-cotton agricultural exports
suggests that there is considerable room to tap the potential for future growth in agriculture and in agro-
processing, provided there are appropriate reforms to help stimulate higher private investment, and more
competitive cross-border movement of goods to regional markets. Enhanced regional cooperation and
priority public investments in roads and energy will be important for that purpose. Creation of capacity to
export summer surplus electricity, which was lost in 2010 due to withdrawal of Uzbekistan from the
Central Asia Unified Electricity Grid, will also be important for future export growth.

22. The government is taking remedial action to reduce financial sector vulnerability. Non-
performing loans (NPLs) in the banking sector in Tajikistan have increased steadily since 2008, peaking
at 28 percent of gross loans in March 2010, before declining to around 19 percent in September, and
further to 17 percent in December.4 However, stress tests indicate that the financial system remains
vulnerable to future shocks, highlighting the need for authorities to tighten supervision and enforce
prudential standards, require banks to submit action plans to reverse growth in NPLs and return to
compliance, and to abstain from directing banks to lend to any particular sectors. With support from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, NBT has moved to tighten prudential requirements
in 2010, and has required problem banks to submit action plans to reverse growth in NPLs and return to
compliance with prudential standards (e.g. through new capital injections and tightening of lending
standards). These action plans have recently been received from the problem banks and are under review
by NBT. The government has recently submitted to Parliament a bankruptcy law for credit institutions
prepared with technical assistance from the World Bank, as well as a draft NBT law consistent with IMF
advice aimed at strengthening its ability to address problem banks.

23.      Tajikistan’s risk of debt distress remains high. According to the joint IMF-World Bank 2011
Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA),5 debt to GDP ratio stands at 35 percent as of end-2010. External debt
is largely concessional, held in broadly equal parts between multilateral and bilateral creditors, with the
share of China at 38 percent; domestic debt represents only 2 percent of GDP. Under the baseline
scenario, external debt burden indicators remain below their respective thresholds except the debt-to-
exports ratio which is significantly above the threshold, but none of the debt-flow indicators breach their
thresholds. The debt service-to-exports ratio (5 percent in 2011) and debt service-to-revenue ratio (5
percent in 2011) remain well within their respective thresholds of 15 and 25 percent under the baseline as
well as under nearly all the bound tests and various alternative scenarios considered (including a high
investment-low growth scenario). Sensitivity tests show that the following thresholds are violated (i)
under most extreme shock scenario: four out of five indicators, with debt service-to-revenue being the
only exception; (ii) under high investment-low growth scenario: debt-to-exports ratio violates threshold
by a bigger margin and debt service-to-exports ratio in one outer year.

24.     However, the risk of debt distress can be managed if the Government follows appropriate
policies. Preliminary DSA results underscore the need for (i) the planned fiscal consolidation; (ii)
cautious contracting of new debt; and (iii) careful cost-benefit assessment of large-scale investment
projects to make sure that external resources are used productively. Furthermore, sound macroeconomic

4
  Several external and internal factors have contributed to the deterioration, including the lagged impact of the 2009 global crisis,
the negative effects on profitability of the disruptions to rail traffic through Uzbekistan, lax lending standards, regulatory
forbearance, and directed lending to the agriculture sector.
5
  The DSA (see Annex 3) was prepared jointly by World Bank and IMF staff, in consultation with Asian Development Bank
(ADB) staff. It updates the last DSA of May 2010 presented in the IMF Staff Report for the First and Second Review under the
Extended Credit Facility (EBS/10/95, 05/24/2010). The fiscal year for Tajikistan is January 1–December 31.

                                                                 7
policies and acceleration of structural reforms would be needed to strengthen Tajikistan’s growth
potential and safeguard external stability. The program of reforms supported by the proposed operation
can thus contribute to the management of the risk to debt sustainability.

25.      The Tajik authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to the importance of maintaining
macroeconomic stability as a precondition for sustained high growth and poverty reduction, and to take
appropriate measures to strengthen Tajikistan’s financial sector with a view to reinvigorating private
sector credit growth. The implementation of the IMF program remains broadly satisfactory. The fourth
review of the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) is expected to be approved by the IMF Board on May 11,
2011. The government’s 2010 fiscal deficit was well under the ECF target of 1.0 percent; in addition, the
government has reaffirmed its commitment to maintain a sound medium term fiscal framework,
notwithstanding pressures for social and infrastructure spending, and to gradually eliminate the fiscal
deficit by 2014. The government has identified debt management as an area for priority reform, and
requested the World Bank’s help in using the Debt Management Performance Assessment Tool (DeMPA)
to conduct a comprehensive assessment of Tajikistan’s debt management policy, functions, objectives,
legal and institutional arrangements, and strategies for debt management.

26. Tajikistan’s macroeconomic policy framework is adequate for purposes of the proposed
operation. While the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks and some key risks noted above, on
the whole the Tajik authorities have maintained a sound macroeconomic framework. Among the main
risks to fiscal sustainability warranting close monitoring include the quasi-fiscal risks from the financial
sector and further increases in international food and fuel prices.

                3.      GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY
                                   PROCESSES

27. In February 2010 the government formally approved its Third Poverty Reduction Strategy
(PRS 3) for 2010–2012. Building on the first and second PRS, PRS 3 operationalizes the country’s long-
term development vision outlined in the 2006-2015 National Development Strategy. Its overarching
objectives are to promote sustainable strong economic growth and improve the population’s living
standards, especially of vulnerable groups, through three main strategic areas:

28. The functional block aims at (i) improving overall institutional conditions to stimulate economic
growth, and (ii) enhancing the quality and scope of provision of social services, and encompasses the
following main pillars:
         Establish an effective public administration system through introduction of professional civil
          service; enhance capacity to implement development policies; improve the public financial
          management (PFM) system to enable transparent and effective use of public resources; link
          policy decision making to the budget process, and strengthen the public procurement function.
         Improve the investment climate by lowering barriers to and reducing the costs of operating
          business through reforms to reduce the regulatory burden, introduce one-stop shop for business
          registration, reduce the number of inspections, simplify the process of bankruptcy, strengthen
          property rights, establish free economic zones, and refine tax administration.
         Develop more effective regional cooperation to stimulate trade, reduce exposure to external
          shocks by diversifying export base and formulate a sound labor migration policy to reduce high
          exposure of remittances to fluctuations in the Russian economy.
29. The government has taken a number of important steps to strengthen public sector performance.
Following adoption of the Public Sector Reform Strategy in 2006, it has taken several measures to (i)

                                                     8
reform the public administration system to reduce fragmentation and clarify mandates, (ii) introduce
competitive recruitment and link pay to job descriptions to modernize the wage and career progression
systems, and (iii) modernize the PFM system. In 2010, PDPG4 supported the introduction in five pilot
ministries and agencies of a civil service salary grid linking compensation to levels of responsibility,
experience, and complexity of work. With the support of the Public Sector Reform Project, the
government has undertaken preparatory work to introduce the salary grid throughout the civil service,
including by approving a revised job classification and developing the salary grid that ensures a uniform
pay structure based on a single job classification system applicable across civil service organizations,
while ensuring that the wage bill remains fiscally sustainable.

30. The production block calls for improving food security situation by developing the agriculture
sector, addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, and resolving the chronic energy deficit in winter period
along with building capacity to export summer electricity surpluses:

         Secure access to land-use rights for small farmers; ensure universal adherence to the freedom-
          to-farm declaration, promote equal access to land both by men and women; enhance
          agricultural research and training, and strengthen access to financial services.
         Harness the country’s significant hydropower potential; prioritize the construction of the
          Roghun Hydropower Project (RHP), but also build small hydroelectric power plants; invest in
          coal-based energy to resolve persistent winter energy deficit.
         Invest in largely worn-out railroad and road infrastructure; roads upgrades include routes
          connecting Dushanbe to the Kyrgyz and Afghan border and markets in Iran and Pakistan.

31. The social block of the PRS 3 emphasizes the government’s commitment to continue improving
social service delivery:

         The recently approved health sector strategy (2010-2020) aims to improve quality, equity,
          efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the health system through, inter alia, an increase in public
          funding, in particular to primary health care (PHC).
         The National Strategy for Education Development for 2006-2015 guides the Government’s
          efforts in reforming the sector, targeted at improving the quality of high school education,
          increasing school attendance rates and addressing gender inequalities, including switching to
          per capita financing countrywide by 2010.
         Social protection reforms include work to strengthen social insurance and pension systems,
          improve coverage and quality of social assistance services, develop better labor market
          regulations and enhance management capacity; consolidate multiple social assistance programs
          and introduce better targeting mechanism to improve pro-poor focus.
32. The health financing strategy aims to improve equity, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the health
system through inter alia an increase in public funding to the health sector and in particular primary
health care, an introduction of per capita financing for primary health care (PHC), the introduction of the
Basic-Benefits-Package (BBP) at hospital level and purchasing function by means of pooling of public
resources at regional level, thereby moving away from input- to output-based financing and better-
matching needs and resource allocation. The BBP provides free services for vulnerable population groups
and provides a legal framework for developing the copayment policy for selected health services in
hospitals. At the same time, the BBP is designed to reinforce the role of the PHC given that the majority
of PHC services remain free to the population. The implementation of BBP in hospitals will support
efforts to formalize informal payments and to gradually move hospitals away from budget finance to a
combination of budgetary funds and fee revenues from patients.

                                                    9
33. PRS 3 has been developed through a participatory process. Sector working groups, comprising
government officials, civil society organizations, private sector representatives, academia, and
development partners all contributed to its development. A coordinating group was established to oversee
the process of drafting and regional consultation. The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade has
commissioned the Association of Scientific and Technical Intelligentsia of Tajikistan to conduct the
public monitoring of the execution of the PRS. As part of this effort, pilot families living across the
country will be surveyed by a program monitoring support group that includes 19 civil society support
organizations. Among the topics covered in the planned survey is peoples’ access to medical services,
education, and other such public services, with a view to developing recommendations for the
government on improvement of implementation of the national development programs.

34. A Development Forum was organized by the Government in Dushanbe in December 2010 to
review recent economic developments and, in particular, to discuss Tajikistan’s reform priorities for the
next two years of its third PRS for 2010-12 (Box 2).

                                        Box 2: 2010 National Development Forum
 The Development Forum was held in Dushanbe on 3-4 December 2010 with the support of development partner
 members of the Donor Coordination Council. It was chaired by Prime Minister Akil Akilov and attended by over 200
 participants including senior Government officials and representatives of 20 countries and 19 development partner
 organizations. During the intensive discussions at the Forum on reviewing progress and challenges regarding Tajikistan’s
 strategic goals and national priorities, the following next steps and decisions were reached:
 Business environment: The following key measures were identified: continue implementation of ongoing reforms (e.g.
 simplify construction permits, implement the “One-stop Shop”, enact the new law on permits codifying the reduced list
 and regulating the process for introducing new ones); reform tax administration to improve administration and
 compliance; strengthen the role of a single agency to provide comprehensive information on the business environment to
 potential investors; assess comparative advantage for potential investment in sectors such as mining and tourism.
 Agriculture: The government reaffirmed its commitment to complete the “Action Plan on Reforming the Agricultural
 Sector” (Resolution 406); continue implementing ongoing reforms - e.g. “freedom to farm,” issuance of land use
 certificates, farmland restructuring; develop an action plan for trade, tax, and rural finance regulatory reforms to increase
 farmers’ access to inputs, financing, advisory services, and markets; reform existing support services services—input
 supply, marketing/processing, training/veterinary services—to the needs of new smallholder-based agriculture.
 Financial sector: Participants agreed on the importance of defining a comprehensive financial sector development
 strategy, including a properly sequenced roadmap, aimed at strengthening the banking system, enhancing the regulatory
 role of the central bank, and expanding the banking system’s capital base; modernize the collateral regime to facilitate
 the use of movable assets as collateral, thereby improving SMEs’ access to credit.
 Energy: Participants agreed to continue the dialogue on both short- and long-term priorities and to work together
 towards: completing reforms in Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgas; adjusting electricity tariffs to ensure full-cost recovery;
 energy conservation and loss reduction; a review of overall energy strategy to reflect short- and medium-term priorities,
 including alternatives to very large projects; and, revision of the legal framework for the construction of small
 hydropower plants.
 Social Sectors: There was consensus that the education, health, and social protection sectors were underfunded and that
 existing state budget allocations should be maintained (and, if possible, increased). The preparation and implementation
 of a Health Strategy action plan for 2010-13 was identified as a priority.

        4.      WORLD BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

                   A.      LINKAGES TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

35. The PDPG4-6 programmatic series of operations are central to the World Bank’s recently
approved FY10-FY13 Country Partnership Strategy. The two main objectives of the CPS are to (i)
mitigate the negative impact of the crisis on poverty and vulnerability, and (ii) pave the way for post-
crisis recovery and sustained growth. PDPG 4–6 support these objectives. These operations serve as the
World Bank’s primary vehicle for engaging in policy dialogue with the government and for discussions
with other development partners on how best to align support for the Government’s program (Section 3)
as well as ongoing efforts to improve governance (Box 3).

                   B.      COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

36. The World Bank, the IMF, and other development partners are collaborating closely to help
the government implement its PRS 3. The World Bank and the Fund are coordinating their policy
dialogue and support programs. As outlined in the 2010 Joint Management Action Plan for World Bank-
Fund Collaboration, the World Bank takes the lead in private sector development, enterprise reforms,
agriculture sector issues, and regulatory reforms. The Fund leads in the formulation and execution of
fiscal and monetary policies, tax policy, external trade policies, and issues involving economic and
financial statistics. The World Bank and the Fund share responsibility for public sector management,
budget planning and execution, and financial sector reform. The Joint Country Partnership Strategy
signed in November 2009 by the Government of Tajikistan and 12 development partners, including the
World Bank, provides a shared framework for improving aid coordination and increasing aid
effectiveness in Tajikistan.

37. Many development partners are providing technical assistance, policy advice, and financial
support for the reform program supported by PDPG 4–6. For example, the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) is assisting with some key financial sector reforms and with
streamlining of business regulations. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European
Commission (EC) are supporting the implementation of agriculture sector reforms, including
establishment of privately-led agriculture finance schemes. The World Bank, the EC, the UK Department
for International Development (DFID), and USAID are working closely to support the government’s
public sector reform and public financial management. The World Bank, EC, World Health Organization
(WHO), USAID, and United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) are all supporting reforms in the health
and education sectors. In addition, the EC is also collaborating with the World Bank to help the
government improve the targeting and administration of the country’s social protection system. The Swiss
State Secretariat for Economic Affairs is considering technical assistance for external audit.

                  C.      RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER WORLD BANK OPERATIONS

38. The PDPG 4-6 series support policy reforms that are critical to the success of World Bank-
financed investment and technical assistance operations. The reforms supported by PDPG 4-6
complement the World Bank’s ongoing and planned investment projects in public administration, public
financial management, agriculture, energy, education, and health.

                                      D.      LESSONS LEARNED

39. The design of the proposed operation reflects several lessons from the implementation of
PDPG 1–3 and other operations in Tajikistan. Experience with past such operations has shown that

                                                  11
   PDPG implementation was most successful in areas that benefited from strong government ownership,
   complementary technical assistance, consensus among development partners on the way forward, and
   long-term engagement on the part of the World Bank Group.

                         Box 3: Governance in Tajikistan: Challenges and Efforts to Improve Outcomes
Tajikistan’s governance situation remains weak. The 2009 World Governance Indicators rank Tajikistan in the bottom 15 percent of
countries on voice and accountability, rule of law, and control of corruption, significantly below ECA and low-income-country averages.
It also scores poorly in other major surveys of governance, including Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, the
Global Economic Forum’s Global Competitive Index, and EBRD’s transition indicators dataset. Recent household surveys show
corruption to be a problem: for instance, 39 percent of 2010 LITS respondents in Tajikistan report that unofficial payments are
usually/always needed when using the public health system.
Notwithstanding these challenges, Tajikistan has made progress in improving its governance, even if gradually. As a poor post-
conflict country (it was in UN’s post-conflict status until 2005) the pace and focus of governance-related reforms have been influenced
by concerns about continued peace and stability, weak country capacity, and the requirements for sustaining growth and poverty
reduction. The Government’s reforms to improve governance and reduce corruption over the last decade have sought to enhance
transparency, accountability, and efficiency of the public sector and of private property rights. In the public sector these areas relate to
budgetary management, NBT and key SOEs; in private property rights they relate to land-use rights for farmers and business regulations
and investor rights. The Government is committed to continuing its efforts to improve the situation and its development partners plan to
support those efforts with financial and technical assistance.
Public Sector: On budgetary management there have been improvements in transparency and accountability but a good deal remains to
be done. The Bank has and continues to support this area of reform. The Government developed a (PFM) system from scratch over more
than a decade. In doing that, it adopted the IMF Government Finance Statistics classification, implemented a treasury single account
system at republican levels, automated large parts of the system, enacted a modern Procurement law, improved budget preparation
including a medium term plan with sector involvement and more recently strengthened internal controls including the setting up of
internal audit units in line ministries. Since 2009 Tajikistan has published detailed annual reports with both budget execution data as well
as the proposed budget, and since 2010 has started publishing budget execution reports on a quarterly basis. The budget reports contain
information by both economic and functional breakdowns.
On the central bank (NBT), the Government has taken actions during the last four years to enhance transparency and accountability of its
governance in response to the revelations in 2007 that the central bank misreported net international reserves to the IMF. In 2008, the
special external audit of NBT was completed and its recommendations implemented, including a plan for recapitalization. Since then, the
NBT remains committed to hiring reputed international auditors to conduct annual audits using international accounting standards; these
audits were done in 2009 and 2010 and published. The Government also enacted amendments to the NBT and Commercial Banking laws
that includes the following: to appoint the NBT chairperson and his/her deputies for fixed terms that do not coincide with the electoral
cycle, including explicitly outlining the reasons for their dismissal in the law; to require official identification and disclosure of beneficial
owners of companies registered with the Agency for Securities in the ministry of finance and other authorized entities, including financial
institutions; to clarify the provisions covering conflicts of interest for the NBT management and staff, and require them to disclose their
personal holdings in financial institutions and excuse themselves from official decisions affecting those institutions. Overall, the NBT is
being run with greater transparency and accountability than before, which is important for good macroeconomic management.
On SOEs, the Government sought to increase transparency and accountability by publishing external audits of large enterprises, as well as
to improve efficiency and financial performance through enterprise restructuring. External audits of TALCO, Barki Tajik, and
Tajiktransgas were conducted by international auditors for years 2008 and 2009 and published; Government is committed to doing this
annually and has initiated the process for 2010. A supervision unit has also been established in the Ministry of Finance for regular
monitoring of the financial operations of the 10 largest SOEs, including their contingent liabilities. Tajik Airlines and Barki Tajik have
undergone restructuring. The external audit of TALCO management has also been initiated.
Private Property Rights: On land use rights, the Government has taken steps to strengthen these rights by allocating a large share of
arable land to private farms and families and more recently by issuing land-use certificates to farmers with such allocated land (more than
40,000 issued so far) to empower farmers to choose crops without interference from local authorities.
On private investors’ rights, the country has made progress in easing licensing regulations, reducing/limiting arbitrary inspections of
businesses, and removing a large number of sectors/sub-sectors from the requirement of permits thereby reducing restrictions on
investors. The establishment of a one-stop shop for business registrations as well as the enactment of a revised Joint Stock Companies
Law granting minority shareholders access to all corporate documents and eliminating minimum capital requirements for non-financial
private companies has contributed to a better investment climate.
Tajikistan still has a significant unfinished reform agenda. Although the private investment climate has improved, more must be
done to enhance the stability and predictability of property rights by continuous monitoring of enforcement of reforms and limiting
arbitrary interventions in businesses and farms for non-business-related reasons. Increased financial viability and transparency of the
large SOEs is needed to ensure that government revenue finances infrastructure and social services instead of SOE losses. Similarly,
public expenditure must be managed more efficiently and transparently so that government revenue can be used to support growth and
reduce poverty. The PDPG series supports these reforms and other such efforts to improve governance.


                                                                      12
         Given the importance of government ownership of the reform program, PDPG 4–6 was
          designed in close collaboration with the relevant ministries and with the support of the
          Executive Office of the President.
         The Government has mobilized substantial technical assistance, expert advice, and training to
          support its reform agenda. Such technical assistance was found critical for successful
          implementation of various parts of the earlier programmatic series.
         Given the importance of enhanced policy coordination within government, the PDPG missions
          brings together decision makers across different ministries and agencies to discuss the rationale
          for reform, progress in implementation, and its expected benefits.
         In areas where there has been limited buy-in from the authorities, World Bank’s Analytical and
          Advisory Activities (AAA) have helped to explain, demonstrate, and provide evidence on the
          benefits of reform.

                                   E.       ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

40. The World Bank has been undertaking economic and sector work in most areas covered by
the PDPG 4–6 series. In addition to the work outlined in the table below, the World Bank’s AAA have
also included several round-tables with the government, civil society and private sector representatives,
and other development partners on the broad spectrum of policy issues covered by the World Bank’s
program of economic and sector work (Table 4).

                                  A.       DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION

41. PDPG4-6 follows the completion in 2009 of the first programmatic PDPG1-3 series. PDPG1-3
began as Tajikistan was coming out of its UN-designated post-conflict status and thus the end-of series
outcome targets were relatively modest. The government adopted a program of reforms aimed at
improving private investment climate and at strengthening public sector management. On the first, actions
were taken to reduce licensing restrictions and frequency of inspections of businesses by Government
agencies. On the latter, it supported the enactment and implementation of a new Procurement law,
adopted steps including audits to strengthen internal financial control, and introduced medium term
expenditure framework for budgetary planning. In addition, the aviation sector was restructured which
involved the separation of policy making from technical regulation function as well as the
restructuring/splitting of Tajik Airlines into an airline, two airport management companies and other
entities for greater transparency and accountability of performance; there was also a gradual expansion of
access of foreign airlines to Dushanbe. Actions were also taken to improve delivery of health and
education services. Despite setbacks and delays, the reform program resulted in improvements in a
number of areas (Table 5), with further details of actions and outcomes provided in the Implementation
Completion and Results Report for the previous series.6

42. PDPG5 is the second in the programmatic series of three operations (PDPG 4-6). The main
rationale of the PDPG4-6 series, coming as it did during the global economic crisis, was to strike an
appropriate balance between the actions to mitigate the impact of the global crisis and actions to support
post-crisis recovery and sustained growth, with emphasis on the latter rising with time. This rationale and
approach remains valid. As a result, greater attention was paid under PDPG4 to protect social spending

and gains from earlier reforms, while PDPG5 pays more attention to supporting recovery and growth
through actions to raise private investment and to increase transparency, accountability, and efficiency of
public resource use. PDPG5 supports actions in respect of investment climate, financial sector, and
agriculture aimed at enhancing transparency and predictability of private property rights for investors. In
addition, it supports actions to strengthen public financial management and financial performance of
energy sector SOEs. Though implementation of these actions has been uneven (e.g. over-performance on
agriculture and under-performance in energy SOE and PFM), the end-of-series outcome targets remain
unchanged, and interim results so far (Table 6) suggest that they are achievable.

                              Table 6: PDPG4-6 Series: Some Interim Results
 Improved efficiency of public expenditures on health and education
 According to data from the 2010 EBRD-World Bank Life in Transition Surveys (LITS), 61 percent, 57 percent,
 and 51 percent of Tajik citizens were satisfied with the quality and efficiency of public service delivery in
 primary / secondary education, public health system and vocational/tertiary education respectively. Compared to
 2006, the data show a 20 percentage point increase for the public health system, and 6 percentage point increase
 for vocational/tertiary education (assessment of over-time changes in satisfaction with primary/secondary
 education cannot be carried out as data are not available for 2006).
 Streamlining business regulations
 The World Bank’s 2011 Doing Business reports that Tajikistan is among the top 10 reforming countries for two
 years in a row, with country’s overall ranking rising but remaining low at139 among 183 economies.
 Reforming agricultural institutions
 Good progress with the land agenda and accelerated issuance of land-use certificates: 40,332 land use
 certificates had been issued as of March 25, 2011, far exceeding the PDPG5 target of 30,000 certificates by
 March 31, 2011.
 Results from the 2009 cotton farm survey covering 15 districts of Khatlon oblast indicate that farm managers or
 farm members (i.e. family, household, cooperative members, etc.) are the key decision makers in terms of
 determining the cotton area in 66 percent of surveyed farms, confirming farmers increasing freedom to farm.
 Strengthening government effectiveness
 According to data from the 2010 EBRD-World Bank Life in Transition Survey (LITS), the following share of
 survey respondents in Tajikistan rated the overall performance of the national government as good/very good:
 local government: 61 percent; regional government: 64 percent; national government: 75 percent.
 Promoting transparent public financial management
 Since 2009 the Ministry of Finance website publishes a comprehensive budget execution/performance report
 annually, and since 2010 publishes quarterly reports as well. Information provided includes revenue and
 expenditure analysis, analysis by sector, as well as by sub-national administrative entities (oblasts and rayons).
 Enhancing transparency of energy state-owned enterprises
 Implementation of Financial Management Improvement Plan (FMIP) by Barki Tajik (including migration to
 International Financial Reporting Standards [IFRS]) has proceeded, even if slower than envisaged earlier.
 Tajiktransgas has made more progress in this respect.


43. Prior actions for PDPG5 support ongoing government efforts to improve basic social services,
private sector environment, and government effectiveness. They are presented in Table 7 below. To
protect basic services, the government is continuing to work on improving targeting and efficiency of
social spending, and specifically has adopted a health sector master plan, amended respective legal and
normative documents to accommodate national implementation of per capita financing in general
education, and introduced a pilot scheme for improved targeting of social assistance in two rayons. To
improve environment for private sector, the government has submitted a law to parliament codifying
reduction in permit coverage and procedures to restrict introduction of new permits, has continued issuing

                                                         15
land-use certificates to farmers to promote greater farmer control over land-use, and taken further actions
to strengthen the financial sector. To enhance government effectiveness, the government has strengthened
public financial management by submitting to parliament a new external audit law, while Tajiktransgas
and Barki Tajik have taken some steps to implement financial management improvement plans, though
progress in case of the latter has been slower than envisaged earlier.

44. There have been changes in several PDPG5 prior actions. Seven of the original eleven prior
actions supported by PDPG5 have been implemented as envisaged earlier under PDPG4 and one has been
dropped. Two prior actions envisaged earlier under PDPG 4 have been reformulated as they have been
implemented only in part due to delays, and will be completed under PDPG-6, while one has been moved
to PDPG6. The reasons for these changes are shown in Table 8.

45. The proposed PDPG6 also envisages actions in all three areas to improve basic social services,
private sector environment, and government effectiveness. The government expects to extend to at
least two new districts the per-capita formula to allocate PHC resources, continue implementing ongoing
reforms in the education sector to promote more equitable financial resource planning and allocation
across rayons, and continue the social assistance reform pilot. To improve the environment for private
sector development, the government expects to submit to parliament a new law on public-private
partnerships and amendments to the custom code to simplify trade procedures, continue issuing land-use
certificates to farmers and improve access to water and other essential inputs, and to take further actions
to strengthen the financial sector. To strengthen government effectiveness, the government plans to

introduce a new salary grid and submit a new law on public administration to Parliament, implement an
action plan aimed at making fully functional an external audit body, publish IFRS-compliant audit reports
for Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgas, improve collection of billed energy, and complete an audit of
TALCO’s energy use to identify options for increasing efficiency.

                                          B.      POLICY AREAS

Policy Area 1: Protecting Delivery of Basic Services within a Sustainable Fiscal Framework

(i) Protecting the gains in access and improving efficiency of public spending on health
46. To help mitigate the adverse impact of the crisis, PDPG4 supported the maintenance of the
2010 health budget at no less than the 2009 level. Public spending on health (excl. PIP) rose from 5.1
percent of the budget in 2005 to 6.9 percent in 2008, but then fell to 6.1 percent in 2009. Under PDPG4,
the government committed to maintain the budget share allocated to health services in 2010 at no less
than 2009 levels. According to latest available data, actual expenditures on health during 2010 constituted
7.1 percent of total expenditures from budget sources (i.e. excluding the PIP and extra-budgetary funds).

47. PDPG5 has supported the adoption by the government of the health sector master plan
consistent with the new health sector strategy. The World Bank is providing technical assistance to the
government in designing and implementing structural health financing and service delivery reforms.
Through the Community and Basic Health Project, the World Bank has partnered with several
development partners in this endeavor, such as the (WHO) and other United Nations agencies, and
bilateral partners including USAID and the EC. To help achieve the sector objectives laid out in the health
sector strategy and PRS 3, the government has developed a health sector master plan that will guide more
efficient planning of the health service delivery system. The draft master plan was discussed with a wide
range of stakeholders, including at regional level, and the final version was adopted by the Government
on April 1, 2011.

48. PDPG6 will focus on implementation of a health financing reform that is a critical step of the
new health sector strategy. In particular, it will support as a prior action the utilization by at least 2 new
districts of a per-capita formula in allocating 100 percent of primary health care resources.

49. Expected results: Utilization of primary health centers in pilot rayons maintained at no less than
2008 levels. Please see Annex 2 for details.

(ii) Protecting the gains in access and improving efficiency of public spending on education
50. PDPG4 protected the 2010 budget allocation for education. The government is implementing
the National Strategy for Education Development 2006–18 and its strategic action plan, which focuses on
ensuring equal access to education, addressing gender issues, improving the quality of education, and
increasing literacy. Key strategy pillars include resource mobilization and introduction of progressive
financing methods. Education accounted for 18.8 percent of the central government budget in 2007, 18.0
percent in 2008, and 17.8 percent in 2009. With support from PDPG4, the education share of the central
government budget in 2010 was set at 17.9 percent. According to latest available data, actual expenditure
on education in 2010 constituted 19.8 percent of total expenditures from budget sources (i.e. excluding
the PIP and extra-budgetary funds).

51. PDPG5 has supported submission to Parliament of amendments to legal documents to
accommodate national implementation of per capita financing in general education. This has aligned
the legal basis for per capita financing to other major laws governing education financing and budgeting.
The Ministry of Education hired consultants under the Fast Track Initiative grant to perform this task—

                                                     18
i.e. to consult with key stakeholders and review existing legal basis to identify the changes needed. A new
draft law on public finances was submitted by the government to Parliament on March 3, 2011.
52. Recent survey data show improvements in recent years in satisfaction with public service delivery
in the health and education sectors (Box 4). Partners supporting education sector reforms in Tajikistan
include the UNICEF, German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), EC, Open Society Institute
(OSI), World Food Program (WFP), Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) and USAID.
53. PDPG6 will support as benchmarks measures agreed by the government at the 2010
Development Forum, including to (i) review, and revise as needed, the current schedule and related
arrangements for planned transition to 10/12 years of general education to allow more time for adequate
high quality preparation and implementation, (ii) maintain increased state budget allocations for education
(17.8 percent of total expenditures from budget sources), and (iii) continue to fully implement per capita
financing and adopt a more equitable approach to financial resource planning and allocation across
rayons.

                Box 4: Improved Satisfaction with Public Service Delivery in Health and Education
Citizens’ satisfaction with education and health service delivery in Tajikistan lags prevailing levels in other poor
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. According to the 2010 EBRD-World Bank (LITS 2) 62 percent of
respondents were satisfied with the quality and efficiency of primary/secondary services received during the past 12
months, compared to 82 percent in Georgia and 80 percent in Moldova. Similarly, only 57 percent and 51 percent of
users were satisfied with the quality and efficiency of public service delivery in the public health system and
vocational/tertiary education systems respectively. On a more heartening note, the data show that current rates of
satisfaction with service delivery are considerably higher than prevailing levels in 2006; the data show a 20 percentage
point increase for the public health system between 2006 and 2010, and 6 percentage point increase for vocational/tertiary
education (Table 9).

54.   Expected results: More efficient resource use. Please see Annex 2 for details.

(iii) Maintaining an adequate social protection system
55. PDPG4 protected social protection spending in 2010. The Government of Tajikistan operates a
relatively large contribution-based pension system and supplements this with non-contributory social
pensions for poor households. However, the consolidated budget for social assistance is one of the lowest
in the ECA region—about 0.2 percent of GDP in 2009. To help protect the population from the adverse

                                                           19
impacts of the crisis, PDPG4 set the total expenditures on social protection at 20 percent of the 2010
budget (i.e. no less than in 2009).

56. PDPG5 has supported the issuance of a government resolution to introduce improved
targeting of social assistance in at least two rayons. The pilot envisions employing an explicit
mechanism for poverty-targeting, likely based on proxy-means testing (PMT) methodology—i.e. deriving
a “proxy estimate” of need to determine eligibility for social assistance. In addition, the two main social
assistance programs will be consolidated to facilitate and lower the cost of administration. PDPG6 will
support continued implementation of this pilot in 2011. Once the pilot has been completed, an evaluation
will be carried out to assess the targeting effectiveness of the pilot PMT-based program in the two rayons.
It is expected that the results of the pilot will help in the design and eventual approval by the government
of an action plan to scale-up an improved social assistance program nationwide using refined targeting
mechanisms to channel scarce resources to needy households.7 To support the overarching objective of
improving targeting, priority complementary areas of reform include more efficient administration of
social services, rationalization of benefit schemes, and further refinement of the pension system to ensure
that it provides a secure income in old age. To help improve the government capacity to plan, monitor,
and manage social assistance benefits for the poor, the World Bank is working with the government to
help prepare a Social Safety Net Strengthening Project, which will build a national registry of social
assistance and invest in training, equipment, and related items (Box 5).

                           Box 5: Proposed Tajikistan Social Safety Net Strengthening Project
    The Government of Tajikistan addresses poverty, in part, through two main social assistance programs. The largest
    program is for electricity and gas compensation, the second largest is for needy families whose children attend
    school; there is also a small program for resettled people, and some further tiny programs. However, the social
    assistance programs exert almost no downward influence on poverty rates; in large part this is because (i)
    consolidated government budget for social assistance is very low, and (ii) not well targeted to the poor.
    The lack of accurate and accessible information on recipients of social assistance weakens budgeting, management,
    and financial controls. There is no national electronic registry (or even a basic consolidated listing) of beneficiaries,
    but only paper files in district offices. As a result, the Ministry of Finance cannot analyze how funds disbursed from
    the Treasury flow to beneficiaries, since there is no central and accurate registry to audit. These weaknesses in
    oversight and controls undermine the credibility of the social assistance system.
    In January 2011, the Government launched a pilot of a consolidated social assistance benefit, which (i) consolidates
    the two largest social assistance programs into a single benefit, and (ii) tests the scoring formula (proxy-means test)
    for targeting the benefit to the poorest 20 percent of households, and (iii) develops and tests a database for recording
    applications for social assistance and for computing eligibility using the scoring formula.
    The main development objective of the proposed social safety net strengthening project is to establish a national
    electronic registry of social assistance (NERSP) that contains accurate information on social assistance applicants and
    beneficiaries which can be used to manage social assistance programs, to budget for social assistance, and to monitor
    and oversee payments of social assistance. In particular, a NERSP would help the government to avoid double
    payments, to monitor changes in the status of beneficiary households, to make better-informed decisions, and to plan
    for the future. The proposed project would help the Ministry of Finance to track payments of social assistance and to
    conduct audits. Finally, the presence of a credible registry would encourage both the government and development
    partners to channel aid to poor households through the system, in times of crisis and otherwise.


    57. Expected results: Improved social assistance targeting. Please see Annex 2 for details.




7
 Note: The design and envisaged scaling-up of the improved social assistance program nationwide will extend well beyond the
envisaged time-frame of the PDPG4-6 programmatic series.

                                                               20
Policy Area 2: Improving the Environment for Private Sector Development

(i) Reducing the burden of regulations on business
58. Despite recent progress in reducing the burden of doing business, Tajikistan remains a relatively
unattractive country for investment with significant under-exploited economic diversification potential:
the 2011 Doing Business report ranks it 139 among 183 economies on the overall Ease of Doing Business
index. In Tajikistan, as in many other countries, there is a strong connection between corruption and the
excessive and highly complex regulations imposed on businesses. According to the 2009 Business
Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey, major constraints to business growth cited by firms
include tax rates (55 percent), corruption (41 percent), and electricity supply (39 percent of respondents).

                                     Box 6: Promoting Increased Private Investment

    Key recommendations from the World Bank’s 2010 Country Economic Memorandum include:
       Continue to simplify regulations and processes for starting and operating businesses.
       Make special efforts to attract foreign and regional investors with technology and market linkages in agriculture
        and agro-processed goods, by increasing transparency, and limiting arbitrariness in the application of regulations.
       Reduce complexity and non-transparency of tax administration; reduce the number of taxes and payments, clarify
        tax regulations; develop a tax manual showing clearly obligations and rights of tax administrators and payers.
       Strengthen banking sector by implementing recently adopted strategy and action plan to increase soundness of
        banks and improve financial services.
       Consider the option of establishing a special export/industrial zone area in Dushanbe and Khujand where
        businesses would have streamlined processes for investment and operation, reliable power supply etc.
       Increase efforts at regional cooperation by working closely with neighboring country governments for various
        purposes, including the goal of improving trade and transport connections to regional markets.
       Upgrade and rehabilitate a few key legs of the north-south corridor that would reduce transportation cost of
        moving goods to regional markets, and ensure better connections of the cities with their hinterlands.
       Continue to foster competition in air transport to expand access; strengthen aviation sector operations.
       Issue land use certificates to confirm family farms’ land-use rights, announce/implement elimination of old
        cotton debt of farmers, enhance timely access to working capital, irrigation, and inputs; expand availability of
        storage facilities with access to electricity.


59.     The PDPG series has provided a multi-year framework for policy dialogue to support
reforms to improve the business environment (Box 6). PDPG1-3 supported reforms to streamline the
licensing and inspection system, increase the transparency of the privatization process, and promote
market competition. PDPG5 has supported as a prior action the submission to parliament of a new permits
law to codify the reduction in coverage of sectors by permits in line with the recommendations of the
Government Commission for Permits Review, and to regulate the procedures for introducing new
permits. This commission was set up by the government to implement and monitor a guillotine process to
review and eliminate permits. The primary success of the permits reform has been to reduce the number
of permits from 609 to approximately 85.8 PDPG5 has also supported the establishment of one-stop-shops
to enable entrepreneurs to receive information, forms, and other services needed to start a business,
including consolidated registration with the Tax Authority, Statistical Committee, and with the Social
Insurance and Pension Agency. The World Bank Group is also supporting a number of initiatives to

 According to a Standard Cost Model analysis recently carried out by IFC, this will result in an estimated annual savings by the
private sector of around USD18 million. For more details, please see The Impact of Reforming the Permits System to the Private
Sector in Tajikistan, (mimeo), International Finance Corporation, Washington DC.

                                                              21
strengthen the business enabling environment in Tajikistan.9 These reforms have helped place Tajikistan
among the top 10 countries in improving the environment for doing business for the past two years.

60.      PDPG6 will support as a prior action (i) the passage of a new PPP law and (ii) amendments
to the customs code to simplify trade procedures. Public Private Partnerships (PPP) are a viable option
for Tajikistan to attract more investment for key sectors such as energy, infrastructure, transport, and
potentially health. However, there is no regulatory framework for PPPs, and as a result each potential
investment must be negotiated individually case-by-case basis.10 The government has expressed an
interest in developing a new PPP law, and in receiving technical assistance from IFC and EBRD to craft
the new law in line with the best practice. PDPG5 will also support the submission of amendments to the
Customs Code to simplify trade procedures. These amendments, which have already been drafted and
circulated within government for comments, aim to simplify trade by reducing the number of required
documents for trade, including a certificate of origin, certificate of conformity with mandatory standards,
and the document confirming tax identification number.

61. Expected results: Total cost (direct and indirect) of acquiring permits, time and cost of registering
property, starting a business, dealing with construction permits and trading will decline, and the rights of
minority shareholders will be better protected. Please see Annex 2 for details.

(ii) Reforming agricultural institutions
62.      Agricultural reform is critical to enhancing Tajikistan’s productive capacity and reducing
poverty in rural areas. In the past, resources in agriculture have been misallocated with widespread
restrictions on the “freedom to farm” (i.e. to choose what crops to grow), with regulations forcing farms
to maintain production of cotton for exports at levels far above what was economically viable, and
conversely neglect the non-cotton sector. Farmers were also saddled with high debt arising from past
mistakes.11 The main objectives of PDPG4-6 are to improve property rights (allowing farmers greater
freedom to farm)12 and improve access of farmers to farm inputs to help raise agricultural productivity.

63.    Through PDPG 4 support, the government undertook several measures to reduce farmers’
debt and improve the agricultural financial system. In 2009, the government took several key steps to
9
  The IFC’s Business Enabling Environment (BEE) project seeks to reduce administrative barriers in inspections and permits and
lower tax compliance costs by simplifying tax administration. Through its Agri-finance and Regulatory Reform program, IFC is
helping the government strengthen the regulatory framework for private investment, improve access to finance for
agribusinesses, and support leasing development. The Bank, through its Private Sector Development (PSD) Dialogue and Doing
Business Reform Program has also been working with other development partners (notably DFID) to help the government
simplify the business regulatory environment. With World Bank support, the State Investment Committee recently presented an
action plan for reforms to the Investment Council, which is expected to be endorsed in the form of a Presidential Decree.
Through support from the ongoing PSD Dialogue, a number of reforms have already been completed, including the elimination
of a number of procedures for registration of businesses, improvements to the rights of minority shareholders in cases of self-
dealing, improvements to the bankruptcy law and procedures involved in construction, and reduction of corporate income tax
rates for businesses.
10
   There is limited experience with PPPs in Tajikistan. In the energy sector, Pamir Energy, with Aga Khan Development Network
and IFC financing, is operating a 28MW Small Hydropower Project (SHPP) concession in GBAO region. In the mining sector,
the government has contracted IFC’s PPP Infrastructure Advisory team as an advisor for the Bolshoi Konimansur concession to
ensure it adheres to best international practice for social, environmental, and fiscal sustainability.
11
   World cotton prices fell in 2005, leading to a collapse in seasonal financing for agriculture, loan defaults from bankrupted
farmers, and precipitated the so-called “cotton debt crisis”.
12
   Securing famers’ rights to land is essential to improve incentives to invest in agriculture, which in the medium term will help to
raise productivity, while lowering its risk through diversification. Agricultural growth in Tajikistan has been hampered because
past land reform initiatives in the 1990s and early 2000s remained shallow and lacked substance. Although a number of state and
collective farms were split to smaller units, they were often reorganized as cooperative farms whose operations did not deviate
much from those of the previous organizational arrangements, and peasants lacked the incentive to develop land on which they
did not feel they had real property rights.

                                                                22
overhaul the agricultural policy framework. Local governments were advised to stop interfering in farms’
operations and several working groups were established to design further steps towards less controlled
agriculture. A working group for cotton debt resolution was established in August 2009, which defined
and subsequently implemented specific procedures for write-off to cotton related debts. PDPG4 supported
completion of the issuance of 6,390 debt write-off certificates to farmers as part of the cotton debt
resolution.

64. To promote farmland restructuring, PDPG 4-6 support as prior actions the accelerated
issuance of land use certificates to family farms to empower farmers. The cumulative target for land
use certificates issued in accordance with agreed standards is 10,000 for PDPG4, 30,000 for PDPG5, and
65,000 for PDPG6.13 There has been good progress with the land agenda: as of March 25, 2011, a total of
40,332 land use certificates had been issued. The government is also taking steps to reduce the time and
cost of preparation of land use certificates, and to strengthen the security of the tenure rights provided by
them.14 PDPG5 has also supported the strengthening of criteria for site selection for on-farm irrigation
investments, including confirmation that at least 70 percent of each irrigation command area proposed to
benefit from investment comprises farms held by individuals or families who have their own land use
certificates and perceive they can take production and marketing decisions free of intervention.15

65. PDPG6 will also support deepening of reforms in agricultural institutions. A high-level
Working Group on Agricultural Reform of Government and Development Partner experts has been
created to help design a comprehensive agriculture reform strategy, and comprises six main sub-working
groups: (i) water and irrigation, (ii) land reform, (iii) new mechanisms for agricultural financing, (iv) rural
social development, (v) local government reform, and (vi) cotton debt write-off. PDPG6 will support
measures to improve the enabling environment for agriculture based on an action plan for reform
developed by these various sub-working groups.16 In particular, it will also support as a prior action,
implementation of an improved irrigation investment framework and action plan to reform policies for
better farmer access to inputs.

66. Expected results: Greater independence for farmers in making production and marketing
decisions. Please see Annex 2 for details.




13
    The government is issuing land use certificates to family farms in accordance with standards and targets agreed under the
Bank-financed Land Registration and Cadastral System for Sustainable Agriculture Project (LRCSP).
14
    These include decentralization of certificate issuance and use of a more simplified format. An important requirement for
certificates is that unique numbers be assigned for the land parcels on the certificates. This helps ensure that a specific parcel is
not on more than one certificate and thereby helps prevent conflict and fraud. The Government has agreed to begin assigning
unique parcel numbers for all new family farm certificates and also to assign unique numbers to the parcels on for most family
farm certificates issued since 2007. Only those certificates with land parcels that are unique and have unique parcel numbers
assigned accordingly will be counted toward the agreed PDPG6 target.
15
   These criteria are important foundations for successful irrigation investments: they provide farmers with incentives to invest in
long term land improvement and encourage diversification, and have already been adopted by LRCSP (with grants covering
irrigation rehabilitation of 7,790 ha for 34 water user associations benefitting 14,514 family farms) and other projects.
16
    Some of the priorities identified to-date include: (i) further implementation of resolution 111 (ii) further issuance of land
certificates, support to the reorganization of larger farms, improving farmland restructuring through several measures including
simplification of the process, application of performance standards, monitoring, and curtailing of policy disincentives; and
fostering a consistent and clear legal framework for immovable property through amendment of the Land Code, the Mortgage
Law and the law on Dehkan Farms, and issuance of implementing regulations for land and real estate registration; (iii)
compulsory use of bank transfers for payment for cotton to farmers, development of the agro-leasing market and of an alternative
financing mechanism; (iv) establishing effective institutional arrangements (e.g. River Basin Authority) for improved water
management (v) identification of alternative employment opportunities and training needs for those in rural communities that are
not able to benefit from ongoing reforms; (vi) a functional review of local government and public awareness campaigns.

                                                                23
(iii) Strengthening the financial sector
67. The government is implementing high-priority recommendations of the Financial Sector
Assessment Program supported by the World Bank and IMF to address weaknesses in the legal and
regulatory framework and in NBT. Specific measures include adoption of new legislation and governance
improvements in NBT. The authorities also prepared, with assistance from a grant from the Financial
Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative (FIRST) Trust Fund, a medium-term (2010–2015) Banking
Sector Strategy and Action Plan, issued as government Resolution No. 261 on May 28, 2010, to
implement other key recommendations. The action plan represents a comprehensive, prioritized,
sequenced approach to develop a stronger, more stable financial sector that can operate more efficiently
and broaden and deepen financial services. It starts with building the legal foundations that are a
prerequisite for stability and growth. While some legal and regulatory work will continue throughout,
emphasis in subsequent years of the action plan is on institutional strengthening, capacity building,
product and service development, and financial infrastructure development.

68. PDPG4 supported the implementation of key first-year legal and regulatory actions, including
submission to parliament for approval of a revised banking law and of amendments to NBT law. It also
assisted the issuance by the NBT of revised versions of key regulations and instructions in line with the
new or amended laws. These legal and regulatory changes, among other things (i) strengthened prudential
norms (e.g. with respect to insider lending and large exposure limits); (ii) strengthened NBT’s authority to
require stronger credit appraisal standards, risk management, and governance in commercial banks; (iii)
restored NBT’s authority to grant and revoke bank licenses; (iv) strengthened NBT’s independence and
improved NBT governance; and (v) enabled NBT to conduct consolidated supervision.

69. PDPG5 and PDPG6 continue to support reforms laid out in the government’s financial sector
development strategy and action plan. In particular, PDPG5 has supported as prior actions the
submission by government to Parliament of (i) a revised deposit insurance law and (ii) the Law “On Anti-
Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism”. These actions have been developed in
consultation and coordination with the IMF, which has included in its program complementary actions to
(i) submit a revised legal framework for bank insolvency to parliament (such legal work being partially
supported by the World Bank’s FIRST TA), and (ii) requiring banks to submit action plans to NBT
explaining how they will restore their financial health. PDPG6 will include implementation of key
elements of the third year of the financial sector action plan, including: (i) preparation of an improved
prompt remedial action framework for banks and its implementation for a minimum of 4 months; (ii)
preparation of a contingency planning framework and its implementation for a minimum of 4 months;
(iii) strengthening consumer protection regulation and supervision of banks, and (iv) strengthening the
legal and institutional environment for secured transactions. Additional actions to support financial sector
stability may be considered as needed.

70. Expected results: Stability of, access to, depth of, and efficiency of the financial system are
expected to improve. Please see Annex 2 for details.

(iv) Modernizing aviation services
71. Through PDPG4 support, the government approved the national aviation policy in March 2010,
which (i) explicitly allows progressively increased access to international airlines in terms of routes and
frequency capacity; (ii) removes any restrictions on air cargo in terms of aircraft types, size, frequency,
uplift or discharge (as long as technically feasible); (iii) ensures equal treatment at the airports for all
carriers in terms of pricing, fueling, and other services; and (iv) improves air safety through adequate
funding and strengthened licensing certification, monitoring compliance and inspection. No further prior
actions are envisaged under the PDPG series in the aviation sector. The team will continue to monitor
ongoing implementation on the new aviation policy by the government, and conduct an assessment of the

                                                    24
extent to which PDPG-supported reforms have helped expand access to cheaper, safer, and more frequent
aviation services.

72. Expected results: Tajikistan is better connected to regional and international markets (increases in
the number of flights and passengers). Please see Annex 2 for details.

Policy Area 3: Strengthening Government Effectiveness

(i) Strengthening capacity of government institutions
73. PDPG5 supports introduction of a performance appraisal system in the civil service. The
Government prepared a regulation on performance appraisal system (a prior action for PDPG5) in
consultation with line ministries, which was also reviewed by the Executive Office of the President, and a
new decree was issued in February 2011. In parallel, the Civil Service Department has also drafted an
action plan to implement the new performance appraisal system in the civil service in 2011, which inter
alia will involve extensive training as well as various informational and awareness-raising events. PDPG5
has also supported as a benchmark the development of a law on public administration reform (the second
draft of this law has been reviewed through an inter-ministerial coordination process, and comments
submitted to the Executive Office of the President), and approval of reorganization plans of 7 ministries
developed through ongoing vertical functional reviews in these ministries.

74. PDPG6 will continue supporting implementation of ongoing public sector reforms. In
particular, following-up on reforms introduced under the PDPG4 and PDPG5 operations, the proposed
PDPG6 will support as prior actions (i) introduction of the new salary grid in all central government
entities and (ii) enactment of a law on public administration. In addition, PDPG6 will support
implementation of various short-term measures under the action plans to restructure seven line
ministries.17 Partners in public service reforms include the EC, which is focusing on capacity-building
through training.

75. Expected results: Improvements in attractiveness of the civil service as an employer and in the
overall regulatory environment. Please see Annex 2 for details.

(ii) Promoting transparent public financial management
76. With support from the PDPG1-3 series, the government promulgated a new procurement law,
issued implementing regulations, adopted standard bidding documents, and established procurement
departments in six key government entities. It also adopted in March 2007 a public internal financial
control strategy and started to implement a decentralized internal audit approach and methodology. In
November 2007 the parliament approved amendments to the law on public finances, which cover the key
budget organizations, managerial accountability, and the internal control and audit function. In addition,
the government agreed on a model for an independent external audit body, and initiated work on the
drafting of legislation to establish it.

77. PDPG 5–6 support measures to further strengthen public financial management. The
government has embarked on further reforms with support of the World Bank-financed Public Financial

17
   The Government has developed the grid through close cooperation among core Government institutions, including the
Executive Office of the President, the Civil Service Department, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Labor and Social
Protection. Once fully implemented, the new pay system is expected to ease payroll administration, support predictability in wage
bill management, and lead to greater transparency in setting pay levels, particularly as it supports the principle of ‘equal pay for
equal work’ based on the job classification system and eliminates all previous bonuses and salary increments, including for
length of service. The public sector wage bill in Tajikistan amounted to 4.7 percent in 2009 and is projected to drop to 4 percent
of GDP in 2010, which is the second-lowest in the ECA region.

                                                                25
Management Project. Partners with the World Bank in strengthening public financial management include
the IMF, EC, DFID, and USAID. PDPG5 has supported as a prior action the finalization of the external
audit law and its submission by government to parliament. The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic
Affairs has helped provide funding for the preparation of the external audit law. The World Bank will
continue providing advisory support to the government, especially towards development of a legal and
institutional structure for the external audit function, outreach, and capacity building. PDPG6 will support
the implementation by the government of an action plan to make the independent external audit body
fully functional.

78.   Expected results: Improved transparency of budget execution. Please see Annex 2 for details.

(iii) Enhancing transparency of state-owned enterprises
79. The government has implemented some measures to improve financial viability and efficiency
of energy services and strengthen governance of the largest state-owned energy sector enterprises.
With World Bank support, the government has continued implementing agreed measures, such as
improvement of billing and collection systems and steady adjustments of tariffs. Installation of electricity
and gas meters by Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgas has enabled migration from the old practice of
normative-consumption-based billing to one based on actual meter readings, which has increased billed
electricity consumption by around 50 percent in the last two years. Losses in the gas sector are down
about 5 percent in the last three years, and collections have also improved. The electricity tariff, which
was amongst the lowest in the region, is progressively catching-up with semi-annual revisions (although
the latest increase announced in January 2011 has been deferred). The gas tariff has been linked to the
purchase/import price of natural gas. Measures to lower demand by introducing energy efficiency for
lighting of the buildings, have also been initiated through a Presidential decree and winter electricity
services have been maintained at reasonable levels with the World Bank and other Donors’ support over
last few winters. These ongoing steps have helped bring some improvement in the financial performance
of both utilities and better services to consumers, although their sustainability remains to be seen, given
reportedly falling collections of Barki Tajik from power bills.

80. PDPG5 has continued tracking measures to improve financial viability and governance of
Tajikistan’s energy utilities, in particular the government’s efforts to improve financial viability and
efficiency of services of Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgas (Box 7). The financial management improvement
program (including migration to IFRS) would continue to be further implemented in line with the
agreement specified in the Energy Loss Reduction Project. As noted earlier, while IFRS has been
introduced in Tajiktransgas and at Barki Tajik’s headquarters and a few regional offices starting 2011,
this process has not been completed. PDPG5 has supported as a prior action the adoption of an action plan
by government to ensure timely FMIP completion, including the commitment to prepare by July 2011 the
draft 2010 accounts for Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgas in accordance with IFRS.
81. PDPG6 will support the publishing of audited financial reports prepared in compliance with
IFRS, improved collection of billed energy, and completion of an audit of TALCO’s energy use to
identify options for increasing efficiency.
82. Expected results: (1) Financial viability of Barki-Tajik and Tajiktransgas increases; (2) efficiency
of energy sector improves. Please see Annex 2 for details.




                                                    26
                                     Box 7: Strengthening the Electricity Sector in Tajikistan
 Even though nearly all households in Tajikistan have access to grid-based electricity, supply is unreliable due to poor functioning
 of the transmission and distribution system, weak financial management and performance of the main state-owned power utility,
 Barki Tajik, and power shortages in winter. Tajikistan has huge potential to develop additional hydropower projects and export
 power surpluses in summer to South Asia, Russia, and Central Asia, provided the government creates appropriate conditions to
 implement such projects. The Bank’s Country Economic Memorandum has made several recommendations in this regard:
      Reorganize Barki Tajik to transform it into a commercially and technically efficient business-oriented company with
       management autonomy, necessary to attract investments for this sector.
      Eliminate the quasi-fiscal deficits in the power sector by reducing losses, increasing tariffs to cost recovery levels and
       enhancing commercial efficiency of Barki Tajik.
      Focus on enhancing domestic energy supplies while developing energy supplies for export.
      Undertake hydropower development in a concerted manner, by expanding small scale hydropower projects for remote
       areas; ensuring that the proposed hydropower projects can service their debt from project revenues; undertaking
       discussions with other countries in the region to ensure that riparian countries are not adversely affected and other
       neighbors permit transmission of power exports over their territory.
      Ensure that revenue from hydropower exports are used to support growth and poverty reduction in the country. Public
       expenditure management must also be strengthened. These efforts ought to be built into the design of the hydro projects,
       as is evident from the experience of other successful hydropower export projects.
      Strengthen public financial management systems and start to develop hydropower revenue management rules to ensure that
       project revenues help to support growth and poverty reduction.



                                6.          OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                       A.        POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

83. The PDPG series is expected to have a positive social and poverty reduction impact. A key
objective of the series is to protect delivery of basic services (health, education, and social protection) and
support implementation of reforms designed to ensure more equitable resource allocation across regions.
Per capita financing reforms being pursued in the health and education sector are expected to have a
strongly positive impact on the poor. At the heart of the health sector master plan are steps to strengthen
primary health care. Key objectives of the introduction in the education sector of per capita financing
mechanism nationwide are to reduce inequality in resource allocation across regions, and reduce the share
of school budgets allocated to wage bill, thereby increasing funds available to improve the quality of
education. The funding formula being used in the education sector includes scaling-up coefficients for
some areas that take into account their special circumstances and needs (e.g. schools in mountainous
regions, where poor people are more likely to live). The social assistance pilot supported by the program
is expected to help the government design and eventually scale-up an improved social assistance program
nationwide using refined targeting mechanisms to channel resources to needy households. In the medium
term, strengthening farmers’ rights to land and improving access to inputs is likely to lead to greater
agricultural profitability, reduced production risk, and lower rural poverty. A stronger financial sector will
benefit the poor by expanding access to affordable financial services. More reliable energy services will
help promote growth—essential for poverty reduction. Finally, there is no expected poverty or social
impact from implementing performance appraisal scheme or from introduction of the law on public
administration (neither includes any provision or envisages lay-off of public sector employees).

84. An important objective of the program is to strengthen national monitoring systems to track
poverty and human development outcomes. With the support of a 2-year trust fund financed by DFID,
the World Bank has substantially increased technical assistance (TA) provided to the government. The
main development objectives of the TA program are to contribute to improved social policies by
increasing in-country capacity to collect policy-relevant data through integrated multi-topic household
surveys, analyze these data, and utilize the analysis in policy formulation. To this end, the program
focuses on (i) facilitating greater interaction and information exchange between data producers and users,

                                                              27
(ii) providing TA to strengthen local analytic capacity both within and outside government and to
improve availability of locally produced analytical outputs of requisite high-quality, and (iii) promoting
peer-assisted learning and experience-sharing from other countries in the region. The target audience
includes local data collection agencies, researchers, government policy makers, and other development
partners in Tajikistan. In view of Tajikistan’s vulnerability to food and fuel price increases, new analytic
work has been carried out to assess the poverty and social impact of the recent food and fuel price
increases (Box 8). The World Bank is also supporting several other poverty-focused analytical works in
Tajikistan.18

                                      Box 8: Impact of Food and Fuel Price Increases
 The recent food and fuel price increases represent a significant source of vulnerability for Tajikistan. In 2010, the
 country had a combined food and energy trade deficit of 16.3 percent of GDP. Wheat provides more than half the
 calories in the average diet. Annual demand for grain is an estimated 1.4 million metric tons, and the deficit between
 domestic production and demand is approx. 400-600,000 metric tons. Flour and grain prices are particularly affected by
 market trends in Kazakhstan, the main supplier of grain/flour. A 30 percent increase in net food and fuel imports would
 raise the trade deficit by 4.9 percentage points of GDP. Simulations based on the most recent household survey data
 indicate that the combined food and energy price shocks have the potential to increase the poverty rate (measured as
 proportion of the population below the international $PPP 2.50/day line) by 8 percentage points.
 Wheat prices in Tajikistan in December were 37 percent higher than in June 2010. In February, following the sharp
 surge in food prices, the Government released some of its food reserves to the market, aiming to curb further rises. In
 order to have a meaningful impact in the medium-term on curbing food insecurity in poor rural communities, the two
 areas of action are: (i) safety nets to protect the vulnerable against shocks, and (ii) support to production response to
 make Tajikistan more resilient to external shocks.
 During the 2008 food crisis, the lack of a well-functioning social safety net presented a major challenge for the
 government. To improve the effectiveness of the safety net system, it has launched a pilot testing of the scoring formula
 (proxy-means test) with help from the World Bank, and consolidated the two largest social assistance programs into a
 single one, targeted to the poorest 20 percent of the population. The World Bank is also assisting the government
 through an emergency food security response project to increase domestic food production and improve the ability of
 poor households to deal with seed shortages. A temporary revolving fund has been set up for fertilizer imports to help
 farmers cope with the collapse of the existing fertilizer supply chain. A community public employment with irrigation
 rehabilitation operation is underway that generates temporary employment and that is helpful to agriculture at the same
 time rehabilitates irrigation and drainage infrastructure in selected areas. The Bank is also providing emergency
 assistance to help the government to meet domestic energy demand, to upgrade its transmission and distribution system
 to reduce losses, and boost energy trade through the Central Asia/South Asia regional energy market.



                                          B.        ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

85. As noted in the PDPG4 program document, country policies supported by the PDPG
program are not expected to have strong impacts on Tajikistan’s environment and natural
resources. The measures contemplated under this operation are primarily geared at enhancing the
efficiency and effectiveness of spending in the social sectors, strengthening government effectiveness,
and helping to pave the way for post-crisis recovery and growth. Positive impacts on the environment are
expected through measures such as farmland restructuring. International experience has shown that

18
   Under the Education Fast Track initiative, the Ministry of Education will conduct a survey on the distance-from-school as a
factor in explaining low enrollment and attendance, especially among poor and girls. Based on the survey results, the Fast Track
Initiative (FTI) grant may support school bus pilot in remote and poor areas. Also, analysis of school enrollment and attendance
in basic education has been carried out using the 2009 TLSS and Education Management Information System (EMIS) data, as
well as of labor market and labor migration outcomes comparing basic education graduates (grade 9) with secondary graduates
(grade 11). As part of the support to the Ministry of Labor and Social protection on the planned consolidation of the two main
social assistance programs (gas and electricity and school compensation programs) and introduction of a new PMT methodology
to identify program beneficiaries, the Bank is helping with the design of the PMT and evaluation of the targeting effectiveness of
the pilot PMT-based program in two rayons.

                                                               28
command-economy approaches to agriculture and/or insecure tenure contributes to land degradation. The
PDPG4-6 operations support farmland restructuring, whereby larger government-directed farms are being
broken down into smaller family farms. The tenure security associated with the issuance of land use rights
to families strengthens the incentive framework for sustainable natural resource management and
empowers the families to have more control over farm management. Other more indirect positive impacts
are expected due to various other measures to accelerate growth and improve living conditions, which
will likely reduce environmental degradation due to more efficient use of natural resources. Finally, the
process of simplification of the permits system supported by this operation included extensive efforts to
help ensure that the objective of reducing the burden of regulation on businesses did not adversely impact
existing standards for public health and safety and the environment.

                     C.       IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION

86. The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for overall implementation of the proposed operation
and for coordinating actions among other concerned ministries, agencies, and departments, with
additional help to be provided by the State Advisor of the President of Tajikistan for Economic Policy.
The Executive Office of the President will be responsible for implementing the public sector reforms. The
agencies and line ministries involved (NBT, agriculture, energy, and transportation, and labor) are
accountable for implementing the reforms under their responsibility. The State Committee for
Investments and State Property Management will be responsible for overseeing policy actions related to
streamlining business regulations. World Bank staff will monitor actions and review progress using the
Program Policy Matrix.

                                       D.      FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

87. Public Financial Management System and Budgetary Resources. The 2007 Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA) highlighted a number of weaknesses in the country’s
(PFM) system, including: (i) poor systems of public accountability and weak mechanisms for public
sector transparency; (ii) weak internal control systems and internal audit function; (iii) weak institutional
capacity to implement some of the budget reforms being undertaken; (iv) fragmented budgets and poor
cash management; and (v) weak capacity within the legislative bodies to provide effective oversight over
the working of the government. As noted in the PDPG4 PD, the IDA-financed PFM Modernization
Project in Tajikistan is addressing many of the weaknesses identified by the 2007 PEFA. The World Bank
and other development partners have also provided advisory support to the government on establishing an
independent external audit function, including through the PDPG series, and a draft law on external audit
has been submitted to Parliament. The EC has supported the establishment of internal audit function that
resulted into adoption of the internal audit law and establishment of internal audit units in key pilot
ministries. Other steps towards strengthening the PFM system include the revision to the organic budget
system and changes made in the budget classification system. A PFM strategy has also been drafted that
aims, among other things, at eventual introduction of a full Treasury Single Account at the Republican
level and implementation of an electronic financial management information system. A Public Sector
Accounting Strategy has been developed together with a proposal for step-by-step introduction of Public
Sector Accounting Standards.

88. Due to weaknesses in the overall PFM structure most World Bank-financed projects in
Tajikistan do not rely on country systems of accounting, reporting, and audit. However, with
reforms being undertaken in the country’s PFM systems, including implementation of the PFM strategy,
as well as planned introduction of international public sector accounting standards and establishment of a
Supreme Audit Institution, the World Bank and other development partners may begin to progressively
rely on some elements of the country’s PFM system.

                                                     29
89. Foreign exchange environment. The IMF’s most recent safeguards assessment that was
completed in June 2010 noted that Tajikistan has taken initial steps to address the risks identified by the
special audit on cotton sector financing. However, considerable safeguard risks at the NBT remain. Both
the accounting and the organizational structure are still fragmented; due to the weak internal audit
function and an absence of any oversight bodies, access to broad and complete information remains
restricted. Consequently, there is a need to further enhance data systems and the transparency of
operational integrity. Restoring the credibility of the central bank and building the required capacity in
key functions, such as internal audit and financial reporting will require more time. The last safeguards
assessment recommended several measures to address these weaknesses, mainly in the areas of financial
accounting and reporting and auditing.

90. The external audit of the NBT’s financial statements for the year ended April 2009 resulted in the
auditor issuing a disclaimer of opinion, similar to the opinion issued on the financial statements for the
year ended April 30, 2008. Audit of the financial statements for 2010 is underway and is expected to be
completed by end-June 2011. However, the audit report is not expected to be significantly different from
the previous two years; and details on progress made in implementing various recommendations,
including results of audits for the latest three years have not been made publicly available on NBT
website. There have been delays in setting up structures to conduct quarterly internal audits at the NBT.
Given the weaknesses in the PFM arrangements in the country, as well as the risks identified in the NBT,
dedicated foreign currency and local currency deposit accounts will be opened at the NBT, in the name of
the Ministry of Finance, to receive funds under the proposed operation.

91. Public Procurement. The latest Country Procurement Assessment Report was prepared in 2003;
more recently, fiduciary capacity assessments/updates were carried out for the health (2008) and
education (2010) sectors, which included procurement assessments at the sector and national levels. The
2007 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment also included some assessment of
public procurement practices. The government has implemented several recommendations made in
various World Bank assessments to improve the public procurement system. For example, the 2006 “Law
on Public Procurement of Goods, Works, and Services” includes formal recognition that the public
procurement agency (PPA) should not be a central procurement/purchase organization; instead its main
role should be as an oversight, advisory, and regulatory body. Preparation and dissemination of standard
bidding documents and implementing regulations to procuring entities at various government levels,
along with training and capacity-building efforts, have facilitated substantial decentralization in the
system. To-date, ten ministries and entities have been certified to conduct public procurement on their
own.19 In May 2010, the Government issued a decree to establish the “Agency on Public Procurement of
Goods, Works and Services”; consequently, the PPA was de facto transferred to the Presidential
Administration from the Ministry of Economy and Trade, and the Director now reports to the President.
The PPA has a head-office in Dushanbe along with five regional offices, and has 38 key personnel.

92. The World Bank’s procurement team has been in close contact with the PPA to discuss ongoing
procurement reforms and identify areas for World Bank assistance. The PPA has also participated in the
World Bank-sponsored Regional Public Procurement Forum.20 Coordination and regulation of the various
procuring entities, training and capacity building, and further decentralization in public procurement
remain priority areas of the new PPA. The PPA is also considering introducing e-Procurement in
19
   These include the Ministries of Agriculture, Economy & Trade, Education, Energy & Industry, Health, Justice, and Labor &
Social Protection; State Committee on Investments; Dushanbe Hukumat; and the National State University.
20
   The Regional Public Procurement Forum, an annual event initiated in 2005, provides a platform for public procurement
officials from Central Asia and neighboring countries to share knowledge and learning, exchange views and experiences, and
discuss policy issues in public procurement reforms. Countries from other regions (such as Korea and Singapore) as well as
relevant international organizations were also invited to share experiences and good practices. The Government of Tajikistan has
actively participated in the Forum including hosting the one in 2008.

                                                              30
Tajikistan, starting with (i) a study of the models and practices in other countries; (ii) assessment of
readiness and capacity in the country, and (iii) development of the related legal framework and
procedures. A benchmarking study based on the OECD/DAC “Methodology for Assessment of National
Procurement System”21 is planned in 2012 in partnership with the government. The study will help
develop a better understanding of existing and forthcoming challenges and identify actions required to
deal with them in a cost-effective manner. The team will also explore the possibility of providing further
TA to the Government through restructuring the on-going PFM Modernization Project or an IDF grant in
the priority areas mentioned above, and help establish a comprehensive public procurement reporting and
information system with indicators to assess the efficiency of the public procurement system and make it
more transparent.

                                       E.        DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

93. Disbursement. The Recipient is the Republic of Tajikistan. The proceeds of the Grant will be
disbursed in one single tranche upon effectiveness of the Financing Agreement. The Recipient will open
and maintain a separate foreign currency deposit account (in US dollars) at the NBT, as part of the official
foreign exchange reserve, and a separate Somoni deposit account for reimbursing expenditure for the
foreign debt servicing that has been incurred in the current year. At the request of the Ministry of Finance,
the Association will deposit the proceeds of the IDA Grant into the foreign currency deposit account.
Disbursement of the Grant will be in line with the Association’s procedures for development policy
lending. The government will utilize the proceeds of the Grant in foreign currency for either foreign debt
servicing or for crediting the local currency equivalent into the Somoni deposit account for financing
budget expenses. If the Grant proceeds are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing
Agreement, the Association will require the Recipient to refund the amount directly to IDA, in which case
IDA will cancel an equivalent amount of the Grant.

94. Reporting and auditing arrangements. Through the Ministry of Finance, the Republic of
Tajikistan will provide confirmation of the amounts withdrawn and/or transferred from the deposit
accounts, including bank account numbers, date and names of beneficiaries, and ensure that the proceeds
of the Grant are not used for ineligible expenditures defined in the IDA “negative list” as agreed during
negotiations and specified in the Financing Agreement. The final statement on the utilization of the
proceeds of the foreign currency, showing the total amount deposited into the deposit accounts and the
transactions from these accounts to the ultimate beneficiaries’ accounts will be independently audited in
accordance with terms of reference agreed with IDA and by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The
audits of the deposit accounts are to be conducted once at the end of the fiscal year following utilization
of the final balance in the deposit accounts. The audit reports will be submitted to the association not later
than four months after the end of the fiscal year.

                                        F.        RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

95. Successful implementation of the reform program faces four main risks: general
macroeconomic risks, risks related to poor governance and corruption, program specific risks, and
other structural risks.


21
   The OECD/DAC methodology is based on four pillars: (i) the legislative and regulatory framework; (ii) the institutional
framework and management capacity; (iii) purchasing operations and market practices; and, (iv) the integrity and transparency of
the public procurement system. Each pillar includes several baseline indicators (BLIs) and sub-indicators that describe formal
and functional features of the system. A score of 0 to 3 is assigned to each sub-indicator, with 0 indicating failure to meet the
standard, 1 indicating the need for substantial work, 2 indicating less-than-full achievement with need for improvement, and 3
indicating full achievement of the standard.

                                                              31
 General macroeconomic risks. First, overall macroeconomic management may deteriorate
  due to a slower than projected regional and global recovery which could undermine projected
  improvements in growth as well as in fiscal and current account balance. Second, the asset
  quality of the banking sector which has relatively high non-performing loans may face greater
  difficulties if growth slows or if more borrowers face hardships. As noted earlier, the
  government is taking remedial action to reduce financial sector vulnerability with support from
  the IMF and the World Bank. Third, political or economic instability in neighboring countries
  poses a significant risk to Tajikistan’s economic health; recent border closures disrupted trade
  and had an adverse impact, and there remains uncertainty about how this is likely to play out in
  the coming months. There are also risks to Tajikistan’s efforts at enhanced regional cooperation
  as to whether they will deliver the results needed for ensuring that private sector efforts to
  diversify exports and Government efforts to expand road network can succeed.

 Risks related to poor governance. Tajikistan’s PFM system is characterized by insufficient
  internal controls, inadequate transparency, weak governance, low capacity, poor cash
  management and budget execution, all of which could undermine efforts to enforce fiscal
  discipline and accountability. During implementation, fiduciary risks will be mitigated by: (i)
  creating a dedicated foreign currency account into which World Bank funds will be disbursed,
  (ii) regular reporting on the use of funds disbursed, and (iii) requiring an independent audit on
  the use of funds provided under the proposed operation. In addition, the following actions will
  be required in order to realize longer term progress in public financial management: (i)
  implement key recommendations of the PEFA, the Country Procurement Assessment Report,
  and IMF reports; (ii) satisfactory implementation of the Public Sector Reform Project, and the
  PFM Modernization Project. The World Bank sees closer collaboration with donor partners as
  key to moving this agenda forward as well as a high degree of vigilance. Nevertheless, some
  risks related to weak PFM remain and cannot be fully mitigated.

 Program-specific risks. Tajikistan’s institutions remain very weak and vulnerable to capture
  by special interests. Stakeholders who benefit from the current institutional arrangements are
  likely to resist reforms that will leave them worse off. Although no signs of protest are
  currently apparent, vested interests that would be worse off from farmland restructuring or
  changes in the management of irrigation may block reforms. The World Bank will continue to
  support reforms by improving and expanding its efforts at communications, emphasizing the
  costs of continuing with the economic status quo, and the long-term benefits of reforms. Better
  dissemination of the findings of World Bank-supported analytical work, especially the CEM,
  will be an important vehicle of this enhanced communications effort, but it will also involve
  proactive efforts. The World Bank will regularly monitor progress and actively engage in
  dialogue and continue to coordinate closely with other development partners to monitor and
  respond to political developments. Nevertheless, the above risks related to weak institutions and
  their capture by special interests remain high and cannot be fully mitigated.

 Structural reform risks. The PDPG series supports a program of reforms agreed upon with
  the government which are important, but not all that are relevant actions for structural
  strengthening. Several areas related to TALCO, Roghun construction, cotton sector policies,
  and judicial reform are outside the scope of this program. However, there is complementarity
  between PDPG supported reforms and the above highlighted areas that could turn problematic,
  and if they do, there may be spillovers into fiscal area as well as into PDPG reform
  implementation.

Your Excellency Mr. President,


        I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you and World Bank Group for your continuous
support provided to the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan in implementation of social and
economic and institutional reforms.

         This letter on development policies (hereinafter referred to as LDP) is submitted to inform of
the progress and recent changes in social and economic situation in Tajikistan and relevant actions for
the following mid-term perspective. It is based on the fundamental strategic documents of the Republic
of Tajikistan, including the National Development Strategy up to 2015 (hereinafter referred to as NDS),
World Bank Country Partnership Strategy for 2010-2013 (hereinafter referred to as CPS) and Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper for 2010-1012 (hereinafter referred to as PRSP). In addition the National
Development Forum (hereinafter referred to as NDF) was organized by the government in Dushanbe in
December 2010 with the support of development partners, to review recent economic developments
and, in particular, to discuss Tajikistan’s reform priorities for the next two years of its PRSP.

        Overall vision of the state within the strategic development of the country in a long term
perspective is reflected in the NDS and the CPS, while PRSP is a mechanism for implementation of the
NDS objectives and tasks in a medium term perspective. In addition, the LDP is also drafted based on
sector strategic documents such as Public Administration Reform Strategy (2006), the National
Education Sector Development Strategy (NEDS) and National Health Sector Development Strategy
(NHDS) which are presently being implemented under support of development partners.

        Under CPS for 2010-2013, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan closely cooperates
with World Bank in the context of the Programmatic Development Policy Financing (hereafter referred
to as PDPF) to implement reforms and development of social sector, key sectors of economy including
energy, agriculture, transport infrastructure, aviation, including improvement of public administration
efficiency and promotion of entrepreneurial activity. PDPF actions are aimed at ensuring a sustainable
economic development, public sector reform, private sector development, and improving quality of
provision of public services in social area. The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan continues to
be fully committed to implement these reforms under PDPF as elaborated in the earlier Letter of
Development Policy dated May 7, 2011, which is proved by success achieved in implementing four
previous PDPF, as well as ongoing discussion of the reform program under the fifth tranche.

                    I. MANAGEMENT OF MACROECOMOMIC SITUATION

        While affected by the global economic downturn, the economy of Tajikistan managed to grow
at 3.8 percent in 2009, and thus performed better than most other countries in the region. The growth
rate has accelerated to 6.5 percent in 2010, but is still lower than the pre-crisis 2000-08 average rate.
The 2010 growth was supported by the recovery in exports mainly due to high international prices for
aluminum and cotton, which are two major export staples and a quick rebound of the inbound
remittances, which increased from $1.6 to $2 b.. At sector level, largest contribution to growth came
from services, followed by agriculture and industries.

         The Government of Tajikistan has reached an understanding with IMF staff on macroeconomic
policies for 2011. We seek to achieve GDP growth of at least 6 percent, and limit year-end inflation to
10 percent. Given the need to balance pressing social and development needs against limited domestic
resources, we intend to target a deficit of 1 percent of GDP in 2011 (excluding the externally financed
public investment program—PIP). This will help to ensure that the economic recovery does not falter,
and that the government can modestly increase social spending. We will protect social spending from
expenditure cuts in case of unexpected revenue shortfalls, and use any additional donor grants that are
available for spending in this area.

        We will also closely monitor the overall deficit (including the externally financed PIP) to ensure
debt sustainability. In the medium term, we hope that a more favorable international environment will
pave the way toward higher growth and external balance. In the fiscal area, we will balance the pressing
spending needs in the social and infrastructure areas, while broadly aiming for overall fiscal balance
(excluding PIP), with a view to keeping government debt below the ceiling of 40 percent of GDP that
we have set in our debt strategy. We are committed to strengthen public debt management and reporting
by public enterprises, and have requested World Bank help in using the Debt Management Performance
Assessment Tool to conduct a comprehensive assessment of Tajikistan’s debt management policy.

 II. PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT, INVESTMENT CLIMATE FACILITATION AND
                       FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORMS

        Creation of more favorable investment climate and private sector development are the priority
directions of the country. Significant progress has already been achieved in several sectors—notably
major reforms in agriculture underway since 2009 and continued efforts to rehabilitate and modernize
the country’s energy and transport infrastructure. The improved business environment is exemplified by
Tajikistan’s repeat performance as a top reformer in the World Bank/International Finance
Corporation’s Doing Business.

         At the recently concluded NDF in Dushanbe in 2010, we have reaffirmed our commitment to
continue implementation of key measures seeking to improve the business environment. With regard to
the financial sector, these include a properly sequenced roadmap aimed at strengthening the banking
system, enhancing the regulatory role of the National Bank of Tajikistan, and expanding the banking
system’s capital base. We are also continuing implementation of reforms to improve the business
environment based on ongoing collaboration with private sector and civil society institutions, as well as
Doing Business indicators, such as simplifying construction permits, completing implementation of the
“One-stop Shop”. We have recently enacted a new law on permits (codifying the reduced list and
regulating the process for introducing new ones), and also plan to (i) establish a “Single Window” for
trade; (ii) reform tax administration to make it more “user-friendly” and encourage compliance; (iii)
modernize the collateral regime to facilitate the use of movable assets as collateral, thereby improving
small- and medium-enterprises’ access to credit; (iv) strengthen the role of a single agency to provide
comprehensive information on Tajikistan’s business environment to potential domestic and international
investors; (v) implement the leasing law and remove VAT discrimination against leased equipment; (vi)
assess Tajikistan’s comparative advantage for potential investment in sectors such as mining and
tourism; and (viii) ensure full implementation and public awareness of business-related reforms.

         There have been a number of notable achievements in the energy sector in the areas of energy
conservation, loss reduction, and improved governance. In this latter connection, we recognize that
continued institutional reforms in both JSHC Barki Tajik and OJSC Tajiktransgas are prerequisite for
attracting private and public investments. The government’s main priority is to develop capacity to
export energy surpluses in the summer and to reduce, ultimately eliminate, energy deficits in the winter.
The government is committed to continue working with its development partners towards (i) completing
reforms in JSHC Barki Tajik and OJSC Tajiktransgas; (ii) adjusting electricity tariffs and improving
collection rates to ensure full-cost recovery; (iii) energy conservation and loss reduction; ; and, (iv)
revising the legal framework for the construction of small hydropower plants.

          In transport, we feel that the construction of additional road and railroad track are key measures
needed to boost regional trade integration, but at the same time also recognize that this sector faces
similar institutional challenges in financing, management and transparency as the energy sector. The
government plans to work with development partners to prepare a transport action plan, and to take
measures to (i) improve traffic planning and management; (ii) ensure that road user charges reflected
full economic costs; and (iii) implement national aviation policy, including access to international
airlines.

         The provision of rights to land is a fundamental issue in the context of improvement of private
investment prospects of the agricultural sector. Restructuring of agricultural lands by issuance of land
use certificates to family farms is one of the government’s main reform priorities. A precondition for
having a private-sector led financing mechanism will be the ability to use land-use rights as collateral.
We are working closely with the World Bank, ADB, and other donors on the implementation of the
action plan. We are also seeking donor financing for the agriculture sector to ensure that farmers have
sufficient access to credit under the new mechanisms being developed. At the recently concluded NDF,
the following measures related to the agricultural sector have been prioritized: (i) complete the “Action
Plan on Reforming the Agricultural Sector” (Resolution 406); (ii) continue implementation of ongoing
reforms such as “freedom to farm,” (iii) issuance of land use certificates, farmland restructuring, etc.;
(iv) develop and action plan for trade, tax and rural finance regulatory reforms to increase farmers’
access to inputs, financing, advisory services, and markets, and (vi) reform existing support services
services—input supply, marketing / processing, training/veterinary services—to the needs of new
smallholder-based agriculture.

                           III. PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORMS

         With assistance from the World Bank, we continue strengthening the civil service, and the
health, and education sectors. In the health sector, this involves allocating resources in an asymmetric
fashion favoring primary health care. In education, we are moving ahead with a per capita funding pilot
system. In this context, we are working toward a competitive and affordable civil service wage system.
We raised the minimum wage and pension in July 2010 and in October 2010 raised public sector
salaries in the context of introducing a new grade scale at five pilot government agencies. A new health
insurance law has been passed that plans, to introduce mandatory universal health insurance over the
medium-term. We are also preparing a new pension law that seeks to reform the pay-as-you-go and the
fully funded pillar, and generate an actuarially balanced system for migrant workers with pension
entitlements. Implementation of these laws will be postponed until they have been costed and integrated
into our medium-term budget framework and their poverty and social impact assessed.

        We seek to moderately raise the revenue-to-GDP ratio over time to create space for pressing
spending needs. The Government has recently approved a tax administration reform strategy to be
implemented during 2011-15, with a view to building capacity in tax administration and contributing to
improving the quality of tax administration services and increasing collection of budget revenue. This
includes an initiative to increase the number of taxpayers covered by the Large Taxpayer Inspectorate
(LTI) by June 2011. We have also prepared an initial inventory of existing tax and customs exemptions,
and an assessment of their costs, and a proposal for reform of the exemptions regime is now under
consideration. We intend to undertake a review of tax policy, with a view to formulating a strategy for
reform of the tax regime and decreasing our reliance on non-tax revenues. We have asked the IMF, the
World Bank, and other international financial institutions for technical assistance in these areas. We are
also pursuing steps to further enhance public financial and debt management. We have also recently
adopted a law on internal audit and state financial control, and also plan to submit to parliament a new
external audit law as well as a new law on public administration soon.

                                               CONCLUSIONS

        Taking into account the current social and economic reforms being conducted in industrial
sectors of the economy, and initiatives aimed at improving country’s investment climate and private
sector development, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan is firmly committed to continue
implementing respective critical reforms to promote a sustainable economic growth and improvement of
quality of the public services.

        In this context, the World Bank support of the actions of the Government of the Republic of
Tajikistan in implementation of the reforms will be significant through approval of the Programmatic
Development Policy Financing.

        We hope for further fruitful cooperation with the World Bank in implementation of the above
reform agenda.

        I availing myself of the opportunity to reassure Your Excellency in my highest consideration.

   “Agreed standards” refer to farmland restructuring to individual and family farms which have no more than 25 adult shareholders per farm. For PDPG6, “agreed standards” also refers to the land
parcels on the certificates being unique, with unique numbers assigned accordingly. The target number of land use certificates for PDPG4 is the applicable scheduled result target specified for the
Land Registration and Cadastral System for Sustainable Agriculture Project (LRCSP), as it corresponds to the appraisal date of the operation (i.e., 10,000). The agreed target for PDPG5 is 30,000
between January 1, 2007 and March 31, 2011 in both LRCSP and non-LRCSP areas, and quarterly reports describing progress with addressing relevant policy and institutional reforms which promote
the acceleration of farmland restructuring. The agreed target for PDPG6 is a cumulative total of 65,000 from LRCSP and non-LRCSP areas.

   Note that these figures can be skewed by the ostensibly “private” lending to cotton (through Kredit Invest or through the Ministry of Finance credit lines). Including such cotton lending, the figure is
25 percent in 2008; but the result focuses on the non-directed lending by private financial institutions, and this is only 14 percent of GDP in 2008.

         Annex 3: Debt Sustainability Analysis Under the Debt Sustainability Framework for
                                       Low Income Countries

Based on the external low income country (LIC) debt sustainability analysis (DSA), Tajikistan’s risk
of debt distress remains high.1Under the baseline scenario, external debt burden indicators in present
value terms remain below their respective indicative thresholds, with the exception of the debt-to-
exports ratio. Stress tests within the public DSA demonstrate the sensitivity of the fiscal position with
respect to a slightly lower long run growth rate and the necessity of the assumed fiscal consolidation.
The DSA results thus underscore the need for: i) the planned fiscal consolidation; ii) caution in
contracting new debt; and iii) careful cost-benefit assessment of large-scale investment projects, to
make sure that external resources are used productively. Furthermore, a one-off increase in the
government’s debt obligations, e.g. related to existing contingent liabilities, would push the debt-to-
GDP ratio higher, but would not put the country on an unsustainable debt path in the long run. Sound
macroeconomic policies and acceleration of structural reforms would also be needed to strengthen
Tajikistan’s growth potential and safeguard external stability.

                                                   I.        BACKGROUND

1.      While declining significantly over the last decade, Tajikistan’s debt burden remains
high. Tajikistan’s external debt2 to GDP ratio decreased from slightly over 100 percent in 2000 to
about 34½ percent in 2010. A debt-for-equity swap with Russia in 2004 reduced considerably the
debt burden and tilted the composition of debt toward multilaterals. Against the backdrop of a sharp
increase in loans from China since 2007, the share of bilateral creditors picked up rapidly. As of end-
2010, Tajikistan’s external debt is largely concessional and held in broadly equal parts between
multilateral and bilateral creditors, with the share of China quite prominent at about 38 percent. The
share of commercial creditors is small.3

2.       Domestic debt has constituted a very small part of overall public debt owing to low
primary fiscal deficits (excluding the externally financed public investment program) and a
shallow government securities market. Domestic debt represented about 2 percent of GDP (6
percent of total public debt) at end-2010, consisting mostly of nontradable government securities held
by the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT). Since 2009, the government has undertaken regular
issuance of Treasury-bills (T-bills), but only in small amounts, with short maturity, and at rates below
the current NBT refinancing rate.4 Moreover, eight-year government bonds were issued to
commercial banks in 2010 as part of the cotton debt resolution with rollover provisions and an
interest rate of only 2 percent.

 The DSA has been produced jointly by World Bank and IMF staff, in consultation with Asian Development Bank staff. It
updates the last DSA of May 2010 presented in the IMF Staff Report for the First and Second Review under the Extended
Credit Facility (EBS/10/95, 05/24/2010). The fiscal year for Tajikistan is January 1–December 31.
2
 Tajikistan’s public and publicly guaranteed external debt covers the general government and both guaranteed and non-
guaranteed debt of SOEs (state-owned enterprises).
3
 In addition, the authorities accumulated a trivial amount of arrears, which are not taken into account in this DSA as they do
not have any macroeconomic impact. External payments arrears were accumulated in 2010 on two loans guaranteed by the
government. For the first loan, arrears reached a maximum of Euro 103,032 (US$148,428) during the course of the year.
Original payment arrears were cleared by end-August 2010, and penalty interest was cleared by end-December. For the
second loan, an arrears of US$216 was cleared in January 2011.
4
    In 2010, the total level of issuance was less than 0.3 percent of GDP.


                                                                48
3.     The present value (PV) of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt at end-
2010 was higher than projected in the last DSA, mainly on account of higher external
borrowing. PPG external debt came to about 34½ percent of GDP at end-2010—roughly 2½ percent
of GDP higher than projected in the last DSA update.

4.       The current DSA concludes that Tajikistan’s risk of debt distress remains high (see
Figure 1).5 The PV of PPG external debt to exports of goods and services stood at 147 percent at end-
2010, significantly above its threshold, and prolonged breaches of the threshold throughout the
projection period are anticipated. Other debt burden indicators are projected to remain below their
respective thresholds under the baseline scenario. In Tajikistan, remittance inflows have become the
most prominent source of foreign exchange earnings through a dramatic structural increase from less
than 10 percent of GDP in 2003 to almost 40 percent in 2010 (after posting a pre-global crisis peak of
49 percent of GDP in 2008). However, projected prolonged breaches of the original threshold for the
NPV of debt-to-exports ratio under the baseline scenario and stress tests preclude the incorporation of
remittances in the debt sustainability assessment.6 If debt burden indicators incorporating remittances
in the denominator are used, Tajikistan’s risk of debt distress would likely be reduced to medium (see
Figure 2).

                                   II.       UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS

5.     The macroeconomic framework over the medium term is broadly comparable to the
one presented in the last DSA and is described in more detail in Box 1.

   Tajikistan’s underlying growth potential is projected to be about 5 percent, broadly comparable to
    the last DSA. Real GDP growth in 2010 turned out stronger than projected at 6½ percent,
    supported by robust growth in remittances and a pickup in manufacturing and construction.
   On account of anticipated terms of trade shocks in 2011 and 2012, a modest depreciation of the
    real effective exchange rate is incorporated, which would help bring the current account balance
    towards its estimated medium-term norm.7
   Medium- and long-term projections for growth in nondebt creating flows are comparable to the
    last DSA (see Table 1a).
   Underlying assumptions for the fiscal projections are that the government budget deficit
    (excluding Public Investment Program) of about 1 percent of GDP in 2011 will be eliminated in
    the medium term and beyond. This seems feasible based on current spending plans and revenue
    projections.

  According to the latest three-year average of the World Bank’s CPIA rating (2007–09) of 3.2, Tajikistan’s policies and
institutions are assessed as those corresponding to a “weak performer.”Three-year average of CPIA ratings is used according
to recently issued joint Bank-Fund Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability
Framework (October 2008). These guidelines aim at a less volatile assessment of risk than that based on a single latest CPIA
rating. The thresholds for the debt burden for weak performers are 100, 30 and 200 for the NPV of debt to exports, GDP and
revenue respectively; debt service thresholds are 15 and 25 percent of exports and revenue, respectively. In the scenarios
that include remittances, the thresholds have been revised downward by 10 percent so the corresponding threshold for NPV
of debt and debt service to exports and remittances is 90 percent and is 13½ respectively.

  Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries
(Jan 25, 2010 available from http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4419) identifies the maximum permissible
length of the breach of the thresholds as 10 years starting from the current period, i.e., half of the projection period.

                                                            49
                            Box 1. Tajikistan: Macroeconomic Assumptions

Real GDP growth is projected at 5¾ percent in 2011, and at 5 percent beyond 2011. These figures are
significantly below their ten-year historical average of 8 percent (2001–10). The historical output trajectory
was supported by fast growth in the aftermath of the civil war, a sharp structural increase in remittances during
2004–08, and a benign global environment for the most part of the historical base. Expected long-term growth
will be driven primarily by exports once investment in the energy sector is completed and structural reforms
trigger a more dynamic private sector. The U.S. dollar GDP deflator is projected to increase from 6 percent in
2010 to 12 percent in 2011, but expected to decelerate to about 3 percent through 2031 reflecting progress
toward a low-inflation environment while assuming no commodity price shocks beyond the medium term.

Export of goods and services is expected to pick up to an average of 9 percent during 2011–16, despite a
projected sharp deceleration in 2012 on account of an anticipated adverse shock to cotton prices. Expansion in
nontraditional agriculture sectors and increase in energy exports would support this growth. An average
growth rate of about 7¾ percent is projected for 2016–31 as export will be supported by completion of the
infrastructure projects in the energy sector and progress with structural reforms, including in the agriculture
sector and improvement in the business environment.

The external current account posted a surplus of 2¼ percent of GDP in 2010. However, the improvement is
expected to be temporary with the current account reverting to a deficit of 3¾ percent of GDP in 2011 in light
of anticipated adverse terms of trade shocks (higher food and fuel prices), the full year impact of Russian
export duties on fuel (imposed in May 2010), and the reversal of the one-off factors that curbed imports in
2010 (intermittent blockade of rail transit during the first half of 2010 and a slowdown in external
disbursements for the Public Investment Program). A projected significant drop in cotton prices in 2012 would
add to the balance of payments pressures. Reflecting these adverse shocks, a modest depreciation of the real
effective exchange rate that would help bring the current account balance close to its medium-term norm is
factored in. During 2012–15 external borrowing on concessional terms to finance the construction of Roghun
HPP is incorporated. Owing to its high import content, the current account deficit is expected to rise
temporarily to a range of 6–7 percent of GDP. Beyond the medium term, the current account balance is
expected to improve gradually. Reserve coverage is projected to build up gradually to about 3¼ months of
imports by 2031.

Fiscal policy is assumed to aim for an overall balance (excluding the externally financed public investment
program) over the medium term and beyond, after modest deficits in 2009–11.

External assistance. Official external loan financing on concessional terms is estimated to decline from
4¾ percent of GDP in 2011 to 2¾ percent of GDP through 2031. The grant element of new external debt is
assumed to decline slightly to 31 percent from 35 percent over the projection horizon.

Public domestic debt. A modest increase in domestic debt to GDP ratio is assumed from about 2 percent to
5½ percent by 2017 and gradually declining to 4 percent by 2031.

Real interest rates. For domestic debt, it is expected that real interest rate becomes slightly positive starting
2016.

                                            III.        EXTERNAL DSA

                                                   A.     Baseline

6.      Under the baseline scenario, only one of Tajikistan’s external debt burden indicators,
the PV of debt-to-exports ratio, is projected to breach the indicative policy-dependent
thresholds significantly and for a protracted period of time (see Figure 1 and Table 1a). The debt-
to-exports ratio will peak at 178 percent in 2015, exceeding the threshold of 100 percent significantly.
After that, it is projected to decrease gradually throughout 2031. However, during the entire
projection period the threshold will be breached by a wide margin.

7.       External debt service ratios are expected to stay below their thresholds over the entire
period. During the projection period, debt service payments continue to be manageable, albeit
spiking during the years when principal payments on loans from China fall due. As a result, from
2016 to 2019, the debt service-to-export trajectory approaches the indicative threshold. It is assumed
that all of Tajikistan’s external public and publicly guaranteed debt is contracted on concessional
terms.

                              B.        Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests

8.      Under the historical scenario, the debt burden indicators are significantly lower than
under the baseline scenario. The historical scenario is based on averages from 2001 to 2010,8 during
which the current account deficit was relatively low—at below 3 percent of GDP, and growth was
much stronger. Therefore, under this scenario, all debt burden ratios—excluding the PV of debt-to-
exports ratio—remain well below the baseline trajectory and follow a downward trend throughout the
projection period.

9.       A high-investment low-growth scenario underscores the risk to debt sustainability if
growth dividends are less than projected (see Table 1b). The scenario demonstrates that, starting in
2012, when growth is reduced by half due to lower-than-expected productivity of investments, all
ratios deteriorate notably, with the ratio of the PV of debt-to-GDP approaching its sustainability
threshold by the end of projection period. The ratio of the PV of debt-to-exports deteriorates even
further. Nevertheless, the growth projections under the baseline are already cautious and no
significant growth impact from the completion of Roghun HPP and other energy projects are
incorporated. Consequently, a high-investment low-growth scenario may prove pessimistic.

10.      A scenario assuming contracting external debt on less favorable terms would lead to a
significant deterioration of Tajikistan’s external debt indicators compared to the baseline
scenario. If all new borrowing were to be contracted on less favorable terms during the projection
period, Tajikistan’s PV of debt-to-export ratio would rise substantially. Specifically, with the increase
in the average interest rate on new disbursements by 2 percentage points, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio
would rise continuously and breach the threshold starting in 2030, and the PV of debt-to-exports ratio
would increase further from levels projected under the baseline and stay above the threshold.

  For exports and noninterest current account averages for only 2006–10 were used due to a break in the export series
reflecting a change in the treatment of exports of aluminum in the current account. For all others, the usual ten-year
historical average was applied.

                                                          51
11.     Bound tests show that adverse macroeconomic shocks would also have a profound
negative impact on Tajikistan’s external position. In the event of a shock to nondebt creating
inflows, all ratios, except debt service-to-revenues, exceed the indicative policy-dependent thresholds
by a significant margin and almost all of them remain above the thresholds throughout the projection
period.

                                                IV.       PUBLIC DSA

12.       The baseline trajectory in the public sector DSA is very similar to the trajectory in of
the external DSA, given that public sector domestic debt is small. The most extreme stress test is
embodied in a lower long run growth compared to the baseline. In other words, a growth rate 0.5
percentage points smaller compared to the one assumed in the baseline would result in ever-
increasing trajectories of all solvency and liquidity debt burden measures in the public template. This
stress reflects the sensitivity of fiscal sustainability to the underlying growth assumption. Another
important stress test in the public sector DSA includes the impact of the government facing a
contingent liability notionally equal to 10 percent of GDP.9 In this scenario, the PV of debt-to-GDP
ratio peaks at 40 in 2015, indicating considerable risks to debt sustainability from contingent fiscal
liabilities. Under low growth and/or fixed primary balance scenarios public debt is unsustainable (see
Figure 3). This highlights the importance of relying fully on concessional financing and risks
associated with diverging from the fiscal consolidation assumed in the baseline scenario.

                      V.        DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION AND CONCLUSIONS

13.     The current DSA concludes that Tajikistan’s risk of debt distress remains high. The PV
of PPG external debt to exports of goods and services breaches the indicative threshold significantly
throughout the projection period. Other debt burden indicators are projected to remain below their
respective thresholds under the baseline scenario.

14.      The results of the alternative scenarios and stress tests indicate that the debt
sustainability situation could further deteriorate. A modestly lower long run growth rate,
borrowing on less favorable terms of financing or absence of a fiscal consolidation could result in an
unsustainable debt burden trajectory. The DSA results thus underscore the need for fiscal
consolidation and extreme caution in contracting new debt and to carefully vet large-scale investment
projects, to make sure that external resources are used productively. Sound macroeconomic policies
and acceleration of structural reforms would also be essential for maintaining debt sustainability by
strengthening Tajikistan’s growth potential and safeguarding external stability. Going forward,
continued emphasis should also be placed on strengthening debt management capacity by closely
monitoring the debts of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs), assessing potential contingent liabilities
arising from the financial sector and quasi-fiscal activities of SOEs. The mission highly
recommended the authorities to undertake the Debt Management and Performance Assessment
(DEMPA) to identify and address weaknesses in various aspects of Tajikistan’s debt management
institutions and practices.



9
  Possible contingent fiscal liabilities stem from nonperforming loans in the financial system and arrears (tax and inter-
enterprise) in the state enterprises. The figure of 10 percent of GDP is notional, but likely represents an outer bound for
potential fiscal costs.

                                                           52
15.      The authorities concurred with the conclusions of the DSA exercise. The External Debt
Unit at the Ministry of Finance has received technical assistance to improve the in-house capacity for
debt sustainability assessment. The authorities’ results were in agreement with the staff findings. In
response to the authorities’ request, a World Bank DEMPA mission will take place during April 14–
24, 2011. Staff welcomed the authorities’ voluntary and swift action in this area that will help
facilitate assessment of the strengths and weaknesses in debt management and design of actionable
reform plans to improve debt management capacity.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitely assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review Under ECF Arrangement for Tajikistan and
Approves US$20 Million Disbursement
Press Release No. 10/464
November 30, 2010

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed its third review of
Tajikistan’s economic performance under a program supported by the Extended Credit Facility
arrangement (ECF) 1. The Board's decision was taken on a lapse of time basis2. The decision enables the
authorities to draw an additional SDR 13.045 million (US$20.11 million), bringing total disbursements
under the arrangement to an amount equivalent to SDR 65.265 million (US$100.59 million).

The three-year SDR 104.4 million (about US$160.91 million) Extended Credit Facility arrangement with
Tajikistan was originally approved by the IMF’s Executive Board on April 21, 2009 and subsequently
augmented on June 7, 2010 (see Press Releases No. 09/136 and No. 10/230.

Tajikistan has joined many other Central Asian countries on the path to economic recovery. An
improving external environment, an upswing in inward remittances, and favorable climatic conditions
(leading to an increase in hydroelectricity production) helped Tajikistan recover from the slowdown of
2009. Inflation has been low for most of the year, and although now rising, is expected to remain in
single digits in 2010. Barring new shocks, the recovery should continue to take root in the remaining
months of 2010 and into 2011.

Program performance through the first half of 2010 has been good. Despite a notable shock to VAT on
imports, the government was able to boost domestic tax revenue and limit the shortfall in overall tax
collections. Social spending through June fell short of expectations, however, and addressing this
shortfall should be a priority for the remainder of the year given the high incidence of poverty and
pressing social needs.

The overall fiscal deficit target for 2011 (at 1 percent of GDP) is appropriate, given pressing social and
infrastructure needs. Over the medium term, the fiscal accounts (excluding the foreign-financed public
investment program) will need to be broadly in balance to preserve fiscal and debt sustainability, as well
as ease pressures on the balance of payments. On monetary policy, provision of liquidity support to
commercial banks has been important during the economic downturn but should be phased out as
conditions improve. Exchange rate flexibility will also be necessary to ensure orderly adjustment while
continuing to build foreign exchange reserves.

Good progress on structural reform has been made in a number of areas, but it is important to maintain
momentum—particularly with respect to measures on transparency in the state enterprise sector.
Addressing underlying weaknesses in this sector, moving expeditiously in implementing the cotton debt
resolution, strengthening the financial system, and pressing ahead with public financial management and
revenue reforms will be essential to ensuring high and sustained rates of economic growth.

Continued successful program implementation under the ECF arrangement will help to strengthen
Tajikistan’s resilience to external shocks, improve the prospects for stable and sustained economic
growth and poverty reduction, and help to mobilize external support.

  The Extended Credit Facility (ECF) has replaced the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) as
the Fund’s main tool for medium-term financial support to low-income countries by providing a higher
level of access to financing, more concessional terms, enhanced flexibility in program design features,
and more focused streamlined conditionality. Financing under the ECF carries a zero interest rate, with a
grace period of 5½ years, and a final maturity of 10 years
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/ecf.htm). The Fund reviews the level of interest rates for all
concessional facilities every two years.

  The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse of time procedure when it is agreed by the Board
that a proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.

Partnership in Tajikistan’s Development Strategy

16.    The Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy discussed by the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors
on May 25, 2010, aims at reducing the negative impact of the crisis on poverty and vulnerability, and
paving the way for sustained post-crisis recovery and sustained development. It supports the
implementation of Tajikistan’s Third Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2010–2012 that was formally
approved by the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan in February 2010.

17.      Tajikistan has been badly affected by the 2008/09 global economic crisis. The economy, which
had been growing strongly during from 2000–08, grew by an estimated 3.4 percent in 2009, due to a
sharp decline in remittances and a fall in exports of cotton and aluminum. Remittances, which accounted
for nearly 47 percent of gross national product (GDP) in 2008, declined in 2009 by nearly 31 percent
from US$2.4 billion in 2008 to US$1.6 billion in 2009 (see Figure 1). Exports of goods and services fell
by 18.3 percent, due to lower international prices of cotton and aluminum. Revenues (excluding grants)
diminished substantially from 2008 levels. At the same time, expenditures rose to provide essential
services to the population and to returning migrants who have lost their jobs abroad rose. Budget support
from development partners helped to make up the revenue shortfall, resulting in an overall fiscal deficit in
2009 of –0.5. While affected by the global economic downturn, Tajikistan’s performance was better than
that of any other country in the region, and significantly exceeded expectations at the start of 2009.

18.      To restore growth to the previous robust levels, Tajikistan now needs to undertake much deeper
structural reforms to improve the business climate, strengthen the financial sector, promote agricultural
diversification, enhance transparency and governance of large state-owned enterprises, better public
financial management, and strengthen regional trade. Growth in non-cotton agriculture and related
agribusinesses following institutional reforms, a restoration of the inflow of remittances as the Russian
economy recovers, increased trade with other countries in the region and the world, and carefully
sequenced investments in hydropower infrastructure have the potential to support strong growth over the
long term.

19.      The IMF has taken the lead in assisting Tajikistan in enhancing macroeconomic stability. The
Fund has encouraged the authorities to continue with fiscal consolidation, maintain a restrictive monetary
policy, and manage debt prudently to enhance its sustainability.

20.     The World Bank has taken the lead in the policy dialogue on structural issues, including reforms
aimed at reducing poverty, promoting agricultural diversification and growth, encouraging private sector
investment, building public sector capacity, creating transparent public financial management, and
improving governance. The Bank has been supporting policy dialogue through policy based lending.
Following the successful completion of the first series of Programmatic Development Policy Operations
(PDPG) in 2009, the Bank is preparing a new series of three operations with the first expected to be
presented to the Bank’s Board for approval in June 2010. The development objectives of the
programmatic series are to protect basic services within a sustainable fiscal framework, and to lay the

foundation for post-crisis recovery and growth. The series is providing support for reforms to improve
the investment climate and to improve public sector effectiveness.

21.     The development policy operations complement support of investment projects and technical
assistance in health, education, municipal infrastructure, energy, agriculture and rural development, public
financial management, and public sector reform. The Bank in collaboration with other development
partners also undertakes analytical work to provide the basis for policy dialogue and for investment
operations. The most recent Bank work is the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM 2010).

World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas

Areas in which the World Bank leads and there is little direct IMF involvement

22.      Areas in which the Bank leads and there is little direct IMF involvement include the social
sectors, infrastructure, and environmental management. In the social sphere, the Bank has carried out
regular poverty assessments to monitor poverty and develop programs to alleviate poverty, the most
recent of which was issued in November 2009. Under the Strengthening National Statistics System
Project, data collection of a new living standards survey was completed in 2009; analysis of the results is
underway.

23.     In education, the Bank is providing policy advice and investment resources. The ongoing
Education Modernization Project (fiscal 2003) aims to upgrade the basic education system by supporting
reforms in education financing and management, curriculum and textbooks development; teacher training
and student assessment improvement, and upgrading school facilities. Tajikistan has also received grant
funding from the Education for All Fast Track Initiative catalytic fund, administered by the Bank. Key
issues in education, apart from infrastructure rehabilitation and capacity building, are pay reform, and
education financing reform, and implementation of measures to improve efficiency of resource use.
Assistance to this sector will continue through the PDPG, a multi-donor education investment program,
and the Public Sector Reform Program. The Bank is also helping with wage reform in education through
the PDPG. Jointly with the UNICEF the Bank assists the government in the overall national education
strategy formulation.

24.     In health, the Bank is helping the government to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of
delivery—both of which are aimed at ensuring the poor access to a basic level of services. Through the
Community and Basic Health Project and the PDPG, the Bank is helping to strengthen the institutional

                                                    65
capability (both at the center and district levels) to carry out health care reforms, to improve the system
for budgeting and spending for basic health services, and pay reform. It is also supporting programs to
prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other communicable diseases. The Avian Fluenza Control
and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response is minimizing the threat of highly pathogenic avian
influenza infection and other zoonoses posed to humans and poultry; and preparing for control and
respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans.

25.      With regard to infrastructure development, the Bank is concentrating on upgrading basic utility
services for the population as a whole and especially the poor. The Dushanbe Water Supply Project is
helping the Dushanbe municipality and the local water company to address the most critical deficiencies
of water supply services. The Pamir Private Power Project is supporting improvements in reliability of
electricity supply in the Gorno Badakshan region with participation of the private sector. The Energy
Loss Reduction Project is helping to reduce commercial losses and improve the financial viability of the
power and gas sectors. The Bank has also been leading policy dialogue (under the PDPG) on increasing
efficiency/viability to ensure long-term growth prospects of the energy sector. The Municipal
Infrastructure Project is providing support to improve urban infrastructure in big towns.

26.      In agriculture, the Bank is concentrating on restructuring farmland, rehabilitating irrigation and
drainage infrastructure, and reforming the cotton sector. The PDPG is leading the dialogue on farmland
restructuring and cotton debt resolution. The Land Registration and Cadastre Project is assisting the
government with the issuance of land certificates, and establishment of a modern cadastre system. The
Ferghana Valley Project aims to increase water supply and efficiency of irrigation systems in the
Ferghana Valley, and develop institutional capacity in land and water resources management. The Cotton
Sector Recovery Project is helping to improve the livelihoods of cotton farmers and to create conditions
for sustainable growth of cotton production in selected, low-income areas. The Community Agriculture
and Watershed Management Project is improving agricultural livelihoods and sustainable land
management in upland areas.

27.     The Bank is supporting measures to improve environmental management and to deal with
natural disasters through all its investment projects. A 2008 Country Environmental Analysis has
highlighted the country’s most severe environmental issues and proposed measures to strengthen the legal
and institutional framework for addressing them.

28.       The Bank also supported the government in coping with emergencies. The Energy Emergency
Project assisted the government in implementing an Energy Emergency Mitigation Action Plan to address
the energy crisis in 2008 due to the harshest winter in 25 years. Through the Global Food Price Crisis
Response Trust Fund, the Emergency Food Security and Seed Imports Project and Community and Basic
Health Project Additional Financing assisted the government in mitigating the impacts of food prices
crisis in 2008.

Areas in which the World Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMF program

29.     The Bank leads the dialogue on structural reforms through the PDPG series. Institution building
and technical assistance in support of PDPG structural reforms come from several sources, including the
Public Sector Reform Program, the Education Modernization Project, the Fast Track Initiative Catalytic
Grant, and the Community and Basic Health Project.

30.     The Bank and the Fund both support private sector development, including in the areas of
financial transparency and improvements in the regulatory framework. The Bank is preparing a Country
Economic Memorandum to identify the key constraints to growth and propose solutions to overcome
them. The Bank Group has also undertaken investment climate assessments, small and medium

                                                    66
enterprise surveys, and agriculture sector reviews to deepen understanding of issues affecting
performance in specific areas. Tajikistan has participated in Doing Business surveys and in Business
Environment and Enterprise Performance surveys since the mid-2000s. These provide insight into trends
within Tajikistan to improve the business environment and show how Tajikistan is performing relative to
other countries of the region. The Bank has supported the preparation of the government’s private sector
development strategy, which is now under implementation with support of an Institutional Development
Fund grant.

31.      Regulatory reforms include (a) changing role of anti-monopoly agency and further
strengthening its capacity, (b) improving the inspection regime for businesses; and (c) streamlining the
licensing and permitting systems. In addition, under the PDPG, the Bank is assisting with reforms aimed
at fostering competitive, convenient, and safe aviation services. It has supported the preparation and
adoption of the national aviation sector policy. Previously, it assisted with separating in aviation the
functions of policymaking, technical regulation, and accident investigation, with the aim of increasing the
transparency and performance of operations. It is has also helped with the restructuring the Tajik Air
Company aimed at creating separate entities to operate the airport, airline, and air traffic control system.
This aviation sector reforms are expected to increase the competitiveness of Tajikistan’s aviation sector,
with benefits for economic growth and poverty reduction.

32.     While the Bank has taken the lead in privatization and in structural reforms in the private sector,
the IMF has also a strong interest in these areas, since many of these reforms are critical to achieving
macroeconomic stabilization and enhancing growth. Accordingly, the two institutions maintain an active
dialogue with each other on these matters to ensure good coordination of interventions.

Areas of shared responsibility

33.    The Bank and the Fund are working jointly in the following four main areas (supported by the
Bank’s PDPG, grants, and several investment operations, and the Fund’s Extended Credit Facility):

       Public sector management. The Bank has provided technical support to the government to
        develop a comprehensive public administration reform strategy. It includes policy actions in
        public administration reforms aimed at redefining the role of the state in line with the market
        economy needs, reorganizing key ministries, strengthening the internal control and audit function,
        and supporting the pay reform. The Bank is involved in civil service reform while the Fund is
        providing technical assistance in support of tax and customs administration and treasury
        management.

       Public financial management. Both institutions work on providing support for a treasury,
        adoption of new law on public finances introducing modern budgetary procedures and improved
        fiscal management, and switching from norm-based costing and allocation of expenditures to per
        capita based financing in education and health sectors. The Bank will continue to provide
        technical support and mobilize donor funds to implement the medium-term budget framework.
        The Bank will also continue to support reform of public financial management through the
        PDPG, Institutional Development Fund grants, and the Public Financial Management
        Modernization Program. Both institutions work on Tax Policy and Administrative issues.

       Financial sector reforms. This area includes the acceleration of financial sector restructuring
        and closure of weak banks, a new regulatory framework for the establishment of non-bank
        intermediaries, and significant changes in the tax code making tax authorities’ access to bank
        accounts conditional on a court authorization. In terms of banking supervision, the IMF is
        monitoring the closure and merger of banks that do not satisfy prudential requirements. A

                                                    67
        Financial Sector Assessment Program (the country’s first), carried out jointly by the Bank and the
        Fund, was discussed with the authorities in late 2007. The Bank is administering a grant from the
        FIRST trust fund to support implementation of the assessment’s recommendations, especially
        reforms at the National Bank of Tajikistan and for resolution of problem banks.

       Utilities reform. The Fund included in its program supported under the Extended Term Facility
        a structural benchmark on preparing and releasing to the public external audits of the financial
        statements of Talco, the state-owned aluminum company, and Talco Management. The Bank is
        providing financial assistance to help Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgas to improve its financial
        management. It is also assisting repair the electricity and gas transmission system, to import the
        energy needed to meet periodic winter shortfalls, and to help implement the Energy Emergency
        Action Mitigation Plan. The Bank-supported Energy Loss Reduction Project is supporting
        implementation of reforms.

       Debt sustainability analysis: The Bank and the IMF have started carrying out joint debt
        sustainability analyses (DSA). The most recent update was prepared in March 2010.

Areas in which the IMF leads and its analysis serves as input into the World Bank program

34.     The Fund leads the dialogue on fiscal matters, setting the overall envelope for public
expenditures. The Bank’s work in key sectors, such as health, education and infrastructure, necessitates
close cooperation.

35.     In the budgetary area, the Fund is taking the lead on tax reforms and budget preparation and
execution. The IMF also leads the dialogue on polices to rationalize and contain expenditures in the
public sector. These include policies regarding wage setting in both the public service, and defining the
ceiling for public investment expenditures. In these areas, the Bank takes into account the policy
recommendations of the IMF and ensures that its own policy advice is consistent with the Fund’s.

Areas in which the IMF leads and there is no direct World Bank involvement

36.      The Fund takes the lead in the formulation and execution of fiscal and monetary policies, tax
policy, external trade policies, and issues involving economic and financial statistics. The Bank-financed
Strengthening National Statistics System Project is improving Tajikistan’s capacity to collect, analyze,
and disseminate key information required for evidence-based decision-making.
