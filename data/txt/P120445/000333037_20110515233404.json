Development\n            Policy Grant Program (PDPG) is the second in a programmatic\n            series of three operations for the Republic of Tajikistan.\n            PDPG 4-6 series is central to the World Bank's\n            engagement in Tajikistan, as envisaged in the FY10-13\n            Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) discussed by the Board in\n            May 2010. It supports the government's two pronged\n            strategy to mitigate the impact of the global crisis and to\n            pave the way for post-crisis recovery and sustained growth\n            and poverty reduction. PDPG 4-6 build on the PDPG1-3 series\n            completed in 2009. Under PDPG1-3, the government pursued a\n            program of reforms aimed at increasing the competitiveness\n            of the private sector, at strengthening public sector\n            management, and at improving the delivery of services.\n            Despite setbacks and delays, the earlier reform program\n            resulted in improvements in a number of areas. Details of\n            the reform program and its outcomes are presented in the\n            implementation completion report for the previous series.\n            The PDPG5 supports actions in all three areas aimed at\n            improving basic social services, private sector climate, and\n            government effectiveness. To protect basic services,\n            government has continued improving targeting and efficiency\n            of social spending, specifically it has adopted a health\n            sector master plan, issued resolutions for implementation of\n            per capita financing in general education, and introduced\n            pilot schemes for better targeting of social assistance in\n            two rayon's. To improve the environment for private\n            sector, the government has submitted a law codifying\n            reduction in coverage of permits and procedures to restrict\n            introduction of new permits, to continue issuing land-use\n            certificates to farmers, and to take further actions to\n            strengthen the financial sector. To enhance government\n            effectiveness, Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgas have made\n            progress in implementation of their financial management\n            improvement plans and in encouraging more efficient use of power."}, "docdt": "2011-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
