It was never signed, and\n            the loan was withdrawn by the Bank on October 31, 1989. As a\n            result, the project is not rated. Following the original\n            approval of the loan, it became clear that the Government\n            would not be able to meet some of the conditions, and the\n            loan was therefore amended. Subsequently, regular reviews\n            showed that important conditions of effectiveness still\n            could not be met and, above all, the macroeconomic\n            environment remained precarious and not conducive to\n            achieving the project objectives. Due to the accelerating\n            inflation and macroeconomic instability in Argentina at the\n            time, the cancellation was justified. Still, the preparation\n            of the project contributed indirectly to the country's\n            structural adjustment efforts during 1986 to 1990,\n            especially through the associated policy dialogue. Several\n            general lessons can be learned from this project. It\n            confirms the need to avoid excessive dependency on\n            institutionally fragile and highly politicized institutions,\n            especially at times when the Government's political\n            power is being tested. A second lesson regards the\n            conditionality of the loans. Some project actions were\n            carried out, but their benefits did not become apparent\n            until macroeconomic conditions were normalized. Due to\n            over-optimism at appraisal, the physical components of the\n            program could not be implemented. Finally, this project was\n            deliberately designed with safeguards to interrupt the loan\n            in case the Government could not demonstrate a conducive\n            macroeconomic environment, and those safeguards were effective."}, "docdt": "1993-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
