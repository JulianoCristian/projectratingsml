problems in\n            Argentina's banking system, this Banking Sector Loan\n            (BSL) Project contains a set of reforms designed to achieve:\n            (1) increased deposit mobilization and confidence in the\n            banking system; (ii) improved credit allocation; and (iii)\n            reduction in the cost of credit.  To that end, the loan\n            consists of a policy component and a technical assistance\n            component.  The policy component involves a set of policy\n            reforms directed at reaching the three above mentioned\n            objectives.  The technical assistance component is geared to\n            strengthen the banking superintendency's capabilities\n            on both credit risk analysis and assessment of the overall\n            financial condition of banking institutions.  This will\n            allow it to take timely actions to stop unsound financial\n            practices, or if necessary, to force insolvent institutions\n            to exit the market at an early stage of insolvency."}, "docdt": "1988-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
