to consolidate\n            ongoing fiscal stabilization efforts and protect the\n            development objectives set in the Ghana Shared Growth and\n            Development Agenda (GSGDA) for 2010-2013. The GSGDA\n            emphasizes the need for macroeconomic stabilization, greater\n            public sector efficiency and executive transparency and\n            accountability to provide the adequate setting for the\n            reduction of poverty and socio-economic inequalities through\n            agricultural, private sector, infrastructure and human\n            resource development. Specifically, the PRSG8 supports\n            continuing and deepening policy reforms initiated in 2009\n            to: (i) restore budgetary discipline and financial stability\n            and (ii) foster public sector reform and strengthen\n            sustainability in the energy sector, while (iii) protecting\n            the poor, and (iv) developing the oil and gas institutional\n            framework. The proposed operation is aligned with the World\n            Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for\n            FY08-121 and with the World Bank's strategy for Africa."}, "docdt": "2011-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
