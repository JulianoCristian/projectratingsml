     Independent Evaluation Group Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through
                                        excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
      The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two
purposes: first, to ensure the integrity of the World Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the World Bank’s
work is producing the expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures
through the dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25
percent of the World Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference
is given to those that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country
evaluations; those for which Executive Directors or World Bank management have requested assessments; and
those that are likely to generate important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examines project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible World Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the
borrower for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers'
comments are attached to the document that is sent to the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an
assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     World Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the World Bank ensured quality at entry
of the operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring
adequate transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) evaluates Ghana’s Economic
Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit (EGPRC) and Poverty Reduction Support
Credits 7 and 8. These were development policy operations. The EGPRC was unusual for
World Bank engagement because it used a two-tranche approach, disbursing a total of
$394 million between 2009 and 2010 ($151 million in the first tranche and $143 in the
second tranche). The follow-up engagement used a programmatic series of Poverty
Reduction Support Credits (PRSC-7 and 8) implemented between 2011 and 2012. The
two PRSC operations disbursed $219 million and $100 million, respectively.

This report presents findings based on a review of the program documents,
Implementation Completion and Results Reports, Implementation Completion and
Results Reviews, Aide Memoires, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank
reports, and other relevant materials, including a number of publically available studies
conducted by various donors. An Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) mission visited
Ghana’s capital city, Accra, between February 6 and February 20, 2016, to interview
government officials, World Bank staff, IMF staff, and other development partners and
stakeholders. IEG also interviewed World Bank staff members, donor representatives,
and other information providers at the World Bank’s Washington, DC headquarters and
by telephone. Appendix D provides a list of persons interviewed.

This report has a two-fold objective. As a PPAR it assesses various dimensions of
development policy operations (DPOs) performance and provides ratings for each of the
series based on both IEG and Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS)
guidelines. At the same time, the report builds on program-level evidence and contributes
to learning. It draws broader lessons on budget support’s role in promoting policy and
institutional change based on longer term, multisector engagement in Ghana under the
different series. It also assesses major design elements. The report’s structure reflects
these two goals. Chapter 1 introduces the background to the series and the report’s
motivation. Chapter 2 reviews the DPOs’ strategic underpinnings to assess the relevance
of the World Bank’s interventions and their objectives. Chapter 3 focuses on the
intervention logic and DPOs’ design. Chapter 4 presents the series’ results. Chapter 5
summarizes the performance evaluation according to IEG and OPCS guidelines, and
chapter 6 provides concluding remarks and lessons.

The assessment aims to review whether the operations achieved their intended objectives
and, if so, how they achieved them. The report provides additional evidence and analysis
of relevant and comparative data for a more complete picture of the outcomes and the
factors that influenced them. Covering 2013–16 provides an opportunity for broader
lessons, a longer time perspective, and reflection on the sustainability of policy reforms
and the long-term factors that facilitated outcomes.

IEG conducted this assessment in parallel to a joint budget support evaluation with the
European Union, and in parallel to an evaluation of World Bank budget support to the
agriculture sector. The assessment will be an important contribution to findings on World
Bank support and the overall macroeconomic and public financial management
engagement.

Summary
This Program Performance Assessment Report evaluates three consecutive development
policy operations (DPOs) in Ghana during 2009–12. The World Bank committed $300
million in 2009 through a two-tranche Economic Governance and Poverty Reduction
Credit (EGPRC). A programmatic series of two Poverty Reduction Support Credits
(PRSCs) followed: PRSC-7 provided a credit of $215 million in 2011, and PRSG-8
provided a grant for $100 million in 2012. Table S.1 summarizes the commitment figures
by year and operation.

Economic Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit
The objective of this two-tranche stand-alone operation, under which the World Bank
disbursed $300 million, was “to support the authorities’ three-pronged effort to restore
budgetary discipline and tackle long-standing public sector and energy issues, while
protecting the poor” (Project Document, EGPRC p.iv). The policy areas included public
financial management (establishment of a single treasury account, compliance with the
public procurement law, and correcting budget deviations); public sector reform
(implementing a net hiring freeze, eliminating ghost workers, reforming subvented
agencies,1 and adjusting energy pricing); and social protection (extending beneficiaries of
the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty [LEAP] Program and protecting pro-poor
expenditures). The objective was highly relevant to country circumstances, and World
Bank and government strategy, and was complementary to IMF engagement.

The operation’s design considered the higher-than-usual risks to the reform program’s
implementation. The instrument choice (stand-alone, two-tranche operation) was an
adequate risk mitigation measure. It was also an adequate choice to implement budget
support without other donors in a temporary departure from the performance assessment
framework (which did not include actions on macro and fiscal fronts), but in close
coordination with the IMF program, given the prevailing macrorisks and the authorities’
commitments to address them through a World Bank and IMF-supported stabilization

 Subvented means the public agencies and state-owned enterprises received state transfers and
subsidies.

program. Most of the specific policy actions the operation supported were relevant to the
objective. On balance, IEG rated the relevance of design as substantial.

The overall achievement of these objectives was mixed. IEG rated the efficacy of the first
objective (restoring budgetary discipline) as substantial, reflecting a reduction in the
fiscal deficit from 8.4 percent in 2008 to 3.2 percent in 2011. Critical actions in public
financial management, which were complementary to an IMF program with structural
benchmarks, included achieving quantitative targets on the nominal budget deficit,
foreign exchange reserves, and reduction of arrears. Actions on the wage bill growth
were particularly important, though they were insufficient in mitigating underlying risks,
which became evident under the follow-up series PRSC-7 and 8.

IEG rated the achievement of the second objective (addressing long-standing public
sector reform issues) as modest. Action plans for reforming utility companies were never
fully operationalized and were inconsequential to the recovery of their financial viability.
Regarding fuel subsidies, the government continued to set inadequately low
administrative retail prices during 2008–12 that did not reflect the extent of currency
devaluation. Lastly, political interventions undermined efforts to reform the civil service,
leading to increased wage hikes even after implementation of the single spine salary
system.2 Exempting the health and education sectors from the hiring freeze made the
action peripheral to the reform. Furthermore, ineffective commitment and establishment
control added to a continuous increase in the number of civil servants.

IEG rated the third objective (strengthening the protection of the poor) as substantial
because of a significant drop in poverty across the country and the faster-than-expected
implementation of the LEAP Program expansion. The program covered almost 40,000
households across 83 districts by 2010, which is a dramatic increase from the 1,654
households in 21 districts in 2008 and was well above the program target, though still
marginal against the background of high-magnitude poverty and vulnerability in Ghana.
However, the administrative expense was high in the early years. The overall budget has
become less service delivery and poverty oriented over the years, reflecting the fiscal
shift toward administrative and interest payments. Despite the fiscal consolidation, the
social sectors budget remained at about 50 percent of total expenditures in 2011.

IEG rated the overall outcome as moderately satisfactory, reflecting the high relevance of
objectives, substantial relevance of design, and substantial achievement for two out of
three objectives.

IEG rated the World Bank performance quality at entry as satisfactory, reflecting
program design strengths at entry that were relevant and implemented in coordination
with an IMF program. Supervision is rated moderately satisfactory, reflecting adequate
monitoring and evaluation of tranche release conditions, but also the lack of an adequate
assessment of the magnitude of the authorities’ plans for public wages. IEG rated
borrower performance as moderately satisfactory, given the progress made toward fiscal

structure for better alignment and consistency across sectors and agencies.

consolidation. However, the borrower made policy choices in public wages that would
later derail many of the achievements made.

PRSC-7 AND 8

The objectives of the PRSC-7 and 8 were similar to those of the EGPRC. They included
restoring budget discipline and financial stability; tackling long-standing public sector
and energy issues; protecting the poor; and preparing the economy for the oil era
(including managing expected oil revenues). Objectives continued to be highly relevant
to country context and circumstances. However, the operation design had significant
shortcomings, such as not addressing emerging risks to overall macroeconomic stability
from the single spine salary system implementation, and lack of strong policy content for
reforming subvented organizations. Furthermore, engagement with the Treasury Single
Account (TSA) was removed from the reform agenda after insufficient government
commitment. IEG rated the relevance of design as modest.

IEG rated restoring budgetary discipline and financial stability as modest because
unsustainable fiscal expansion in 2012 before the elections erased stabilization gains
under the previous operation. The World Bank–supported measures in PRSC-7 and 8 to
maintain fiscal discipline proved ineffective. Major macroeconomic destabilization
ensued characterized by monetary accommodation of the fiscal deficit, high inflation, and
persistent pressure on the exchange rate. The government launched its own stabilization
plan in 2013, but it was only partially successful. IMF program support and a new World
Bank programmatic DPO series helped to achieve macroeconomic stabilization in 2015.
IEG rated addressing long-standing public sector and energy issues as modest, reflecting
the negative impact of the single spine salary system implementation. However, because
of an effective freeze on real wages, the wage bill was reduced to less than 10 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) when this evaluation was conducted in 2016. An
employment freeze was largely ineffective because it excluded the health and education
sectors. The situation in public utilities improved somewhat due to tariff adjustments, but
previously accumulated debt significantly undermines their financial viability.

IEG rated protecting the poor as substantial due to considerable progress in the LEAP
Program (beyond the gains under EGPRC), and efficiency gains from joint targeting.
However, concerns about expenditure composition remain because administrative
expenditures and debt servicing demands appear to crowd out public service
expenditures.

IEG rated achievements regarding the objective of preparing the economy for the oil era
as substantial. Ghana established institutions that could allow transparent oil revenue
management and account for intergenerational considerations by creating the Ghana
Heritage Fund for accumulating oil revenues for the next generations. The overall weak
state of public financial management in Ghana, which significantly hinders the
effectiveness of government spending programs, is the main challenge in the use of oil
revenue.

IEG rated the outcome of PRSC-7 and 8 as moderately unsatisfactory, reflecting the high
relevance of objectives, modest design, substantial efficacy in two out of four objectives
                                           xvi


(social protection and oil revenue management), and the modest design of the other two
objectives (fiscal discipline and public sector reforms).

IEG rated the World Bank performance as moderately unsatisfactory. Performance at
entry was moderately unsatisfactory, given the insufficient consideration in project
designs to the single spine salary system and public financial management measures.
Supervision, also assessed as moderately unsatisfactory, suffered from ineffective
dialogue with authorities in a difficult environment. IEG rated borrower performance as
unsatisfactory because of the rapid deterioration of the fiscal position in response to
mounting political pressures, and the lack of commitment to addressing critical,
underlying public financial management problems, including the TSA.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES FOR EGPRC AND PRSC-7 AND 8

IEG rated the risks to development outcome as high. The IMF and the World Bank assess
Ghana as having a high probability of debt distress. National elections, scheduled for the
end of 2016, pose major risks for further weakening the fiscal situation. Another episode
of fiscal destabilization would likely be much more costly than in 2008 and 2012 because
of Ghana’s substantially increased indebtedness and extremely high costs of debt service.
The upcoming elections will be the first with an IMF program in place since 2004, but
this does not guarantee that they will not adversely affect fiscal discipline. Slow
implementation of public financial management reforms and inefficiencies in statutory
funds further amplify the risks to fiscal management. Not containing the cost of debt
service would undermine the long-term strategy of protecting the poor through
government expenditures, and this is already evident. Furthermore, major risks slowing
reforms in key areas (such as public sector employment, public utilities, and subvented
organizations) will enable the emergence of more persistent challenges that will be even
more difficult to address.

LESSONS

      Ghana again became a substantially indebted country that must direct a large
       share of its revenues to debt servicing, and it did so within a decade after a major
       debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative.
       This highlights the importance of prudent macrofiscal management in post-HIPC
       countries, and emphasizes that the World Bank has a place in its policy lending
       for helping its clients to preserve borrowing space and safeguard sustainability of
       pro-growth and pro-poor expenditure in the long run
      Adequate macroeconomic management is a critical precondition of budget
       support (which relates to the previous lesson). The World Bank made the right
       choice to focus on restoring fiscal discipline as part of risk mitigation for EGPRC
       in 2009. Similarly, its choice not to deploy DPOs in 2013–14 because of the lack
       of an adequate macroframework was also correct. Furthermore, Ghana’s case
       shows that the World Bank is not a substitute for the IMF in a challenging context
       that requires a comprehensive macroeconomic program. In this respect, Ghana is
       a good example of World Bank–IMF cooperation
      Ghana’s case shows that DPOs deployed in an extremely weak public financial
       management environment are unlikely to be successful. Ghana experienced a
                                       xvii


    deterioration in resource allocation during 2008–12 because of debt-financed
    expenditure hikes that led to interest payments of about 7 percent of GDP per year
    by 2016, taking precious resources away from pro-poor spending, thus
    undermining Ghana’s overall growth and poverty reduction agenda and the
    effectiveness of the World Bank’s budget support. This shows that the quality of
    public resource use in both public financial management and allocations is an
    important precondition of budget support success
   Donor coordination on budget support can be difficult in a challenging
    environment like that in Ghana in 2008–13. Assessment of eligibility for budget
    support is still a controversial area in relationships between various donors.
    Despite a move toward performance criteria based on agreed-to actions, various
    donors may interpret different shocks differently, which will affect donor
    coordination. Dealing with macro and fiscal mismanagement when the
    macroframework is not formally a part of the performance assessment can be an
    especially contentious issue
   Fiscal pressure can crowd out discretionary expenditures, and service delivery
    sectors are especially vulnerable. The World Bank can use DPF operations to take
    a crucial role in protecting pro-poor expenditures in such an environment
   The World Bank has a crucial role in providing advisory services that are
    complementary to budget support. A more proactive engagement in estimating the
    fiscal impact of the salary reform introduction could have helped in designing a
    phased approach consistent with the long-term budgetary envelope.

1. Background and Context
1.1     This Project Performance Assessment Report reviews three consecutive development
policy operations (DPOs) in Ghana. The World Bank committed $300 million through the
two-tranche Economic Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit (EGPRC) in 2009. A
programmatic series of two Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) followed: PRSC-7
provided a credit of $215 million in 2011, and PRSG-8 provided a grant for $100 million in
2012.

1.2     Ghana is a multiparty democracy that has held six general elections since 1990,
including two transfers of power between the ruling party and the main opposition. The most
recent elections were in December 2012. General elections scheduled for November 2016 are
to choose a president and members of parliament.

1.3     Ghana had mixed progress toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals. The
country reached targets such as halving extreme poverty, halving the proportion of people
without access to safe drinking water, universal primary education, and gender parity in
primary school, and made substantial progress in reducing HIV prevalence, improving access
to information and communication technology, and reducing the proportion of people
suffering from hunger. However, Ghana made slow progress on full and productive
employment, equal share of women in nonagriculture wage employment and women's
involvement in governance, reducing under-five and child mortality, reducing maternal
health, reversing environmental resource loss, and improving sanitation. Life expectancy
grew from 52 years in 1981 to 61 years, and population growth, at 2.5 percent in 2010, has
been slowly declining in recent decades. Significant regional inequities remain across income
quintiles, and the north part of the country lags farthest behind.

1.4    The World Bank and other development partners have a long-standing history of
budget support to Ghana. The World Bank alone committed $3,045 million, which is 36
percent of its total portfolio, since its first adjustment credit in 1983 (figure 1.1). Total budget
support, including other partners’ contribution disbursements, averaged about 1.6 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) annually in the last decade.

1.5     Ghana’s economy has been growing at about 4.5 percent annually in the last decade,
assisted by debt relief, additional donor support, and the discovery and production of oil
reserves. Ghana graduated from the group of low-income countries in 2011.3 Furthermore,
the structural shift in the economy resulted in increased nonagriculture employment, and the
formal sector in urban areas is an increasingly important source of income generation.

1.6      The fiscal position has been challenging, but Ghana made major inroads between
2000 and 2006. The country reduced external debt from more than 100 percent of GDP to
about 10 percent after major debt relief initiatives, and the fiscal stance improved markedly
on the back of strong growth. The World Bank provided predictable budget support through
the first two series of PRSCs (PRSC-1 to PRSC-6) in a benign macro and fiscal environment.
Fiscal situation, however, deteriorated markedly after 2007. The country increased spending
on wages and subsidies partly because of an over-optimistic outlook due to the discovery of
oil, and increased transfers to state-owned enterprises in the energy sector to cope with the
impact of supply shocks such as the hike in the fuel prices in 2007 and 2008 and supply
distruptions that led to more unfavorable electricity generation mix. The fiscal deficit rapidly
expanded in 2007 and 2008, which led to cancellation of the planned new PRSC series and its
replacement by a stand-alone operation focused on restoring fiscal stability. An IMF
Extended Credit Facility and fiscal consolidation efforts followed this period. The cycle
repeated in 2012, when preelection spending excesses on public wages seriously undermined
macro and fiscal stability.

 A 2010 revision of the accounts updated the base-year for Ghana’s national accounts from 1993 to
2006. This resulted in a 60 percent increase in gross domestic product after including economic
activities omitted from previous compilations.

1.7      The government’s policy framework has centered on poverty reduction strategies
since the early 2000s. The World Bank’s first series of PRSCs directly supported these
strategies to try to align lending closely with the client’s priorities. The first Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRS) covered 2003–05 and focused on infrastructure, agriculture,
services delivery, governance, and private sector development. The 2006–09 PRS II
followed, which introduced a strategic shift toward economic growth with the explicit goal of
reaching middle-income status. The Shared Growth and Development Agenda replaced PRS
II, covering 2010–13 and 2014–17, focusing on macroeconomic stability, competitiveness,
agriculture, natural resource management, oil and gas development, infrastructure, human
development, and governance. Despite recognizing that public financial management was a
critical area, the government made no provisions for an engagement strategy or reform
sequencing, partly because of a lack of consensus.4 The timeline in figure 1.2 outlines the
various national policies, electoral cycles, and other critical events.

restore a fiscally responsible expenditure trajectory after the elections, and mitigate the
impact of the global economic crisis.

1.9     Ghana experienced a pronounced decline in its policy and institutional framework
during 2008–15, which is especially notable because the violence and security issues that
frequently accompany such deteriorations were absent. The overall score of the Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) declined from 4 in 2007 to 3.4 in 2014, only
slightly above the 3.2 threshold that characterizes fragile states (figure 1.3). Ghana was once
again classified as a high debt distress country in 2015 because of weakening economic
management. The chronic problems of state-owned enterprises and public sector employment
and wages were not addressed. Public investment management is extremely weak, and
further fiscal deterioration is likely because of these underlying weaknesses and in the
context of upcoming elections. Social inclusion and equity—one of the focus areas of the
DPOs under review—is the only area with strong performance.

Implementation

Table 1.1 summarizes the key dates.

1.11 Implementing EGPRC outside the Multi-Donor Budget Support platform in 2009–10
was an important change in approach from the World Bank’s perspective, and it reflected
emerging risks and the need to shift the World Bank–supported operation’s focus to
macrostability. The World Bank resumed using the platform with PRSC-7 and 8.

2. Strategic Underpinning and Relevance of Budget
Support
2.1     This section discusses the strategic underpinning of budget support in Ghana,
including its relevance to country and World Bank strategy, the state of macrofiscal and
public finance preconditions at entry, and measures taken to mitigate risks.

Government Strategy
2.2      Poverty-oriented national development strategies began in 2003 when the first Ghana
Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS-I) was developed to underpin donors’ engagement under
the first series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC-1 through PRSC-3), which
focused mostly on the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative and directed
freed public resources to pro-poor expenditures. The subsequent GPRS-II covered the 2006–
09 period and underpinned the second series of PRSCs and the stand-alone Economic
Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit (EGPRC). The Ghana Shared Growth and
Development Agenda, introduced after GPRS-II, underpinned PRSC-7 and 8. National
development strategies drew on a long-term vision focused on human development, pro-poor
use of public resources, and growth-sustaining policies.

2.3     All strategies of this period strongly highlighted the need for official development
assistance for achieving the country’s development goals. The Ghanaian authorities also
showed strong preferences in the budget support modality. Toward the end of the 1990s and
in the early 2000s, Ghana showed an ability to implement structural reforms and ensure pro-
poor focus in policies and use of public resources, so regular budget support became
possible. Ghana earned the reputation of a donors’ “poster child” in pro-growth and pro-poor
reforms and secured predictable annual disbursements almost every year.

2.4     Strategies were flexible enough to address some of the concerns—for example, a
2009 revision of GPRS-II reflected fiscal deterioration, subsequent austerity measures to
regain macrostability, and measures for protecting pro-poor expenditures. The link between
strategies and budget allocations was relatively strong initially. However, this link then
weakened when Ghana entered a period of fiscal slippage from 2008 onward.
                                               6


World Bank Program
2.5      The World Bank Country Assistance Strategy for 2008–11 (and revised to cover
2012) underpinned the development policy operations (DPOs) under review. The strategy
drew on GPRS-II and had pillars on good governance, human development and service
delivery, and private sector competitiveness. The DPOs were largely consistent with these
pillars. However, the stand-alone, two-tranche EGPRC (which was not forecast in the
strategy documents) was a response to the fiscal policy deterioration and the breakdown of
the Multi-Donor Budget Support platform in 2009.6

2.6    Adjustment of the World Bank’s country strategy in 2011 reflected the need for
higher-than-expected external financing to support IMF-led stabilization through the three-
year Extended Credit facility of 2009–12 under the resumed PRSC series in 2011–12.
Revisions in the Country Assistance Strategy took place concurrently with the PRSC series
preparation. The World Bank revised the planned amount of $100 million per PRSC
operation to $300 million for PRSC-7 and $200 million for PRSC-8, substantially front-
loading available IDA resources and effectively directing more World Bank resources
through budget support. The need to stabilize the economy, support authorities’ austerity
measures (in place since 2009), and complement the ongoing IMF program justified these
increases. However, some of the assumptions on risks proved too optimistic, which led to a
suspension of budget support in 2013 and 2014 after a new episode of fiscal slippage in
2012.

Macroeconomic Underpinnings
2.7     According to the World Bank’s operations guidance for budget support (OP 8.60),
macroeconomic stability is a fundamental precondition to allow direct disbursement into the
client’s budget. In cases of macroeconomic instability, the policy still allows for deploying
development policy financing, but makes it contingent on measures taken to mitigate those
risks. This section examines the areas relevant for macroeconomic stability, and the
borrower’s and World Bank’s response to challenges in macromanagement.

2.8     Unlike the preceding DPO operations, the series under review (both EGPRC and
PRSC-7 and 8) was implemented in a challenging macroeconomic environment and
unsustainable fiscal trajectory. Ghana experienced a number of shocks that substantially
complicated the policy environment, including fuel and food price shocks in 2007 and 2008,
energy supply disruptions and the global financial crisis. At the same time many policy
choices were controversial, including the preference for large-scale borrowing and spending,
that further complicated Ghana’s overall economic situation. In this context, Ghana
experienced two major waves of macrofiscal destabilization in 2008 and 2012 largely related
to the electoral cycle, which significantly complicated the deployment environment for
World Bank DPOs.

2.9    The IMF was present intermittently since 2008 (figure 2.1). Ghana showed its
unwillingness to renew an IMF program after successful completion of the HIPC Debt
6
    Chapter 3 discusses this in more detail.
                                              7


Initiative in 2006. The authorities issued $750 million in Eurobonds in 2007— about 3
percent of gross domestic product (GDP)—immediately after completion of HIPC Debt
Initiative and the related IMF program. The formal justification was that the government
would use the proceeds for important investment projects with major developmental impact,
but the proceeds instead went to the consolidated budget and funded an election-related surge
in fiscal spending in 2008. This led to a deficit exceeding 15 percent of GDP in 2008,
partially funded by direct credits from the central bank, which resulted in double-digit
inflation and foreign exchange reserve loss.

2.10 Donor had mixed reactions to macroeconomic instability. Some found that Ghana
would not qualify for budget support because of the macroeconomic situation, even though
the performance assessment framework did not include macroeconomic actions and
indicators. Other donors showed higher tolerance and focused primarily on the agreed-to
actions incorporated in the performance assessment framework.

2.11 After the 2008 fiscal destabilization, the IMF returned with an Extended Credit
Facility arrangement in 2009. The program focused on preventing accumulation of new
arrears and strengthening public financial management, paving the way for the EGPRC that
the World Bank’s Board approved in June 2009 as a fast-track operation to support the new
IMF program and address newly emerged macroeconomic risks. Some informants
interviewed for this evaluation highlighted the IMF’s strong role in the World Bank’s
decision to proceed with a DPO despite the underlying macroeconomic challenges. Unlike
previous PRSC series, the program was a World Bank unilateral initiative not fully
embedded in the performance assessment framework, highlighting the unusual situation
concerning the macroframework at that time.
                                                   8


2.12 The program incorporated an objective to reduce the fiscal deficit as a mitigation of
heightened macrorisks and drew heavily on the new IMF program, the aim of which was to
lower the deficit to less than 5 percent of GDP by 2011. Despite major macrorisks, EGPRC
was an appropriate instrument because the credit supported mitigating measures and had
links to the IMF program.

2.13 Macroeconomic concerns remained prevalent throughout the EGPRC implementation
in 2009–10 and the subsequent PRSC-7 and 8. The PRSCs also adopted the objective of
restoring fiscal discipline, which was still a major concern in 2010–11. Despite some initial
progress with fiscal stabilization in 2010–11, the situation deteriorated sharply in 2012. The
authorities introduced the single spine salary system before the elections, an action that
almost doubled the public wage bill. Furthermore, it became clear that large, nonwage arrears
had accumulated in previous years (undisclosed at the time) that the authorities wanted to
clear before the elections. As a result, budget expenditures spiraled out of control in the
second half of 2012. With monetization of deficit financing, overall macroeconomic stability
was severely undermined. The IMF program expired in mid-2012 without a credible plan for
restoring fiscal control, and the program was not renewed.

2.14 Most donors, including the World Bank, assessed macroeconomic conditions as
unsatisfactory as a result and withdrew from budget support in 2013–14. Budget support fell
from about $500–600 million in 2009–12 to $100 million in 2013 and almost disappeared in
2014.

2.15 The authorities announced their own stabilization plan in May 2014 because of a lack
of consensus to reengage the IMF. The plan failed to lead to the resumption of external
budget support, and donors made it clear that an IMF program was necessary. World Bank
resumed its budget support after the introduction of a new program (an Extended Credit
Facility) in the spring of 2015.

 Box 2.1. The Political Economy of Fiscal Destabilization
 Election-related spending excesses were observed in the 2000 and 2004 elections, though on a
 smaller scale than in 2008 and without the major macro and fiscal consequences. Available
 political economy analyses highlighted the risks to fiscal management caused by electoral cycles
 and how parties work with their constituencies in a democratic context. In retrospect, the lack of
 willingness to renew the IMF engagement after the PRGF expired in 2006 was the first warning
 sign that the policy environment could deteriorate.
 The PRSC-8 program document (approved in 2012) predicted that a repeat of the largely election-
 driven 2008 macroeconomic destabilization would be unlikely because Ghana learned lessons from
 the experience. However, this prediction was not rooted in Ghana’s political economy realities.
 The political cost of losing the 2012 elections (which were close) was high. Furthermore, the
 opposition party during the 2008 crisis orchestrated the 2012 fiscal expansion, showing it might
 not have internalized the lessons of the 2008 experience.
 Ghana (especially in 2012) was relatively free of the constraints that might normally obligate a
 government not to proceed with a fiscal expansion of the scale it undertook. First, the oil discovery
 led to high expectations for oil revenues, but the initial expectations were unrealistically high (for
 example, that Ghana might receive up to 5 percent of gross domestic product in oil revenues
                                                     9


    annually starting in 2011). These optimistic expectations led to wrong intertemporal choices by the
    authorities.
    Second, Ghana benefited from a good reputation as a reforming democracy. The country
    successfully issued $750 million in Eurobonds immediately after completion of the Heavily
    Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative in 2006, followed by further non-concessional borrowing
    of $458 million in 2008, $448 million in 2009, and $215 million in 2010. The formal explanation
    was that high-return investment projects would use these funds, but instead of earmarking them
    for this purpose, the funds went to the consolidated budget (an example of poor investment
    management by the government).

Public Resource Use: Resource Allocation and Fiduciary Risks at Entry
2.16 Reasonable confidence that budget execution is policy based and benefiting the poor
is an important consideration for budget support. Ghana’s budget and the Poverty Reduction
Strategy aligned closely, and it made explicit allocations for pro-poor expenditure items.
Budget formulation was a strong dimension of the public financial management cycle.
However, the budget was not credible, even at the aggregate level, as large deviations
between budgets, outturns, and actuals showed. Furthermore, substantial contingency
amounts allocated during the year (primarily to cover increases in salary levels) were not
explicitly included in the original budget figures.

2.17 Poor expenditure efficiency and potential leaks of country systems can easily
undermine the development effectiveness of donor resources because budget support
instruments disburse directly into the general budget. Established commitment controls for
nonsalary expenditure were routinely bypassed or violated, and there was a proliferation of
bank accounts in the late 2000s. A TSA was instituted in 2009 but significant budget
amounts remained outside the treasury’s purview.7 The extent of the problem was not
documented (no estimate of idle balances or the number of bank accounts), but the
assumption is that it was extensive because it is still an issue today, despite having made
some progress. Furthermore, significant expenditure arrears stemmed from poor cash
management and disregarding existing commitment controls. Procurement as a potential
source of inefficiencies was competitive, though price differentials between public and
private sector procurement were not estimated.

2.18 The program recognized many of these risks and supported mitigation measures to
improve expenditure efficiency and mitigate fiduciary risks. Relevant policy actions included
improving compliance with the public procurement law, establishing the TSA, centralizing
hiring controls, and eliminating ghost workers in the health and education sector. However,


7
  While an effort of linking accounts has been made this means that balances would be known, but the
central bank will not be able to draw on them for investment (or fund requests from other spending
units), nor do they extend its overdraft limit. Further adherence to the annual budget law cannot be
strictly enforced for these balances under such an arrangement. An IMF guidance note on TSA that
discusses this issue extensively can be found at Pattanayak and Fainboim 2011.
                                                       10


these actions were taken without a public financial management strategy, and measures were
not prioritized or sequenced.

Objectives and their Relevance
2.19 The objectives of both EGPRC and PRSC-7 and 8 were similar (table 2.1), the only
difference being the addition to PRSC-7 and 8 in 2011 of an objective related to preparation
for the oil era. The first objective of the PRSCs also had a component on financial stability,
which was not a critical focus of the program. This section discusses the relevance of these
objectives regarding the country context, priorities, and the World Bank Group’s strategy for
Ghana.

2.20 The objective of restoring fiscal discipline was highly relevant. The preelection surge
in public expenditures in 2008 seriously undermined fiscal stability, and restoring fiscal
discipline became Ghana’s most critical short-term issue. The risks of fiscal destabilization
were once again present in 2011 during preparation of the PRSC-7 and 8 series.

2.21 The objective of tackling long-standing public sector and energy issues was also
highly relevant. Critical issues in the energy sector, public sector employment, and public
wages motived the objective, which strongly linked to the first objective because structural
issues contributed to further weakening the fiscal framework. The government’s program and
the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy also anchored the objective.

2.22 Regarding public employment and wages, Ghana suffered from the prevalence of
ghost workers and a lack of control over public sector hiring. Both issues were present in
2009 and 2011.

2.23 Concerning the energy sector, the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission reviews
and sets tariffs based on proposals from the utility companies.8 An adjustment formula
revised the tariff quarterly (based on the exchange rate and fuel prices) until 2008, when the
tariff adjustment process broke down—the government decided not to pass the revised tariffs
because of higher oil prices on consumers, but instead it would pay the difference as a

companies.

subsidy. This coincided with problems caused by supply shocks (shortages of gas from
Nigeria) and chronic underinvestment. The Public Utility Committee stopped applying the
quarterly tariff adjustment formula because the energy supply was no longer reliable, leading
to a deterioration of the utilities’ financial situation and large, government subsidies that
contributed to fiscal destabilization. Furthermore, the National Petroleum Association, which
had a mandate to set retail fuel prices, stopped passing the higher international fuel prices
through to the final producers, creating a gap that the budget had to cover. These factors were
major impediments to energy sector development and led to a severe fiscal burden.

2.24 The objective of social protection reflected the need to further expand and strengthen
Ghana’s nascent social protection mechanisms. Ghana’s Poverty Reduction Strategy and the
World Bank Group’s Strategy for Ghana anchored this objective, which related to the oil era
was highly relevant, reflecting the authorities’ realization that a quality policy framework
was crucial for translating Ghana’s oil wealth into long-term and sustainable poverty
reduction and for realizing development goals. Specifically, the goal was to support building
a sound framework for managing oil revenues through reforms to the fiscal regime and
establishing stabilization funds.

Safeguards
2.25 The World Bank’s Operational Policy governing DPOs (OP8.60) calls for negative
environmental impact and identifying mitigation measures, together with a discussion of
countries’ systems and knowledge gaps. Ghana faces significant environmental challenges
and is vulnerable to climate change. As part of this evaluation, the analysis that follows
reviews the treatment of environmental issues under the EGPRC and the PRSC-7 and 8
series. In summary, the analysis concluded that the specific reforms the proposed operation
supported were unlikely to have a significant, negative effect on the country’s environment
and natural resources or a negative social impact.

2.26 EGPRC. The supported reforms aim primarily at strengthening public financial
management and budgetary discipline, raising social accountability, and protecting the poor.
The electricity sector financial recovery program would examine options to restore financial
sustainability without considering expanding generation capacity. Regarding poverty, the
program expected to have a positive effect on poverty reduction through actions protecting
pro-poor expenditures and through strengthening a cash transfer program. The program did
not consider the potential impact of public sector reforms on real wages, which did not
require mitigating measures because of the subsequent expansion of the public sector wage
bill.

2.27 PRSC-7 and 8. Similar to the EGPRC, the implementation of the electricity sector
financial recovery program would restore financial sustainability without considering
expanding generation capacity, and therefore was not of environmental concern. The
extension of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative to the oil and gas sectors was
concerned with revenue measurement, and therefore it would not affect the environment. An
increase in electricity tariffs could improve energy conservation and was unlikely to induce
any significant switching to dirty energy in net terms. Concerning poverty reduction, the
                                             12


program continued to strengthen social protection mechanisms, including the streamlining
targeting.

Conclusion
2.28 Strategic underpinnings were largely present in 2009–12. Important weaknesses
threatened to undermine the effectiveness of World Bank support, such as less than
conducive macroeconomic environment that the series sought to address through measures to
reduce the budget deficit, working in close coordination with the IMF.

2.29 The weakest dimension was the poor quality of public financial management and the
resulting lack of a sound institutional underpinning for the appropriate use of public
resources. This weakness was prevalent throughout the implementation of both series,
reflecting long-term structural weaknesses and newly emerged challenges. The World Bank
tried to meet these challenges by focusing on public financial management reforms.
However, it was unsuccessful in persuading authorities to address issues such as the shift of
funding to the public wage bill, and the increase in external non-concessional borrowing that
sharply raised the cost of debt servicing (interest payments alone are about 7 percent of GDP
per year). These choices diverted public resources from pro-poor and pro-growth allocations.

3. Intervention Logic
3.1     This section discusses the World Bank’s choice of instrument (stand-alone operation
using tranches and a programmatic series), donor coordination, and the choice of policy
content the series supported, and assesses the quality of the results framework underpinning
the operations.

Choice of Instrument
3.2      The World Bank had provided a series of development policy operations (DPOs)
before the 2008 fiscal destabilization that consisted of three Poverty Reduction Support
Credit (PRSC) operations (PRSC-4, 5, and 6) built around the Ghanaian authorities’
implementation of the performance assessment framework. The first operation of the
planned, new PRSC series (PRSC-7) was cancelled in 2009 because of the macroeconomic
crisis and the need to adapt budget support to the challenges arising from a major fiscal
destabilization. Terminating the planned series allowed design of a new operation, the
Economic Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit (EGPRC), which would focus on
priorities such as fiscal discipline. The World Bank’s Board approved EGPRC as a fast-track
operation to capitalize on the momentum created by the IMF’s return in the summer of 2009.

3.3     The EGPRC’s design, a two-tranche stand-alone operation, makes the instrument less
flexible than a programmatic series. However, the World Bank chose this design to mitigate
the risks of possible nonimplementation of the agreed-to program. The risks materialized: the
World Bank could disburse the second tranche seven months later than scheduled because of
the delayed implementation of some agreed actions.
                                                       13


3.4     The PRSC series resumed in 2011 and consisted of two operations: PRSC-7 and 8.
Other development partners restarted their own budget support programs at the same time.
This occurred against the background of relatively good progress under the IMF Extended
Credit Facility in 2010 and 2011. Since the economic environment in the country and
internationally remained fraught with risks, the series was restricted to two operations instead
of the three operations envisioned under the previous PRSC series. This was an appropriate
choice because the risks materialized in 2012.

3.5     The World Bank disbursed $767 million in budget support between 2009 and 2012,
$613.5 million of which fell under the EGPRC and PRSC-7 and 8 operations—significantly
more than the average of $93.6 million for each PRSC operation during 2003–07, and
attributed to Ghana’s growing economy and large external financing needs caused by fiscal
stress. Table 3.1 summarizes disbursements by year and operation.9

3.6     The World Bank and other donors provided technical assistance in parallel to budget
support, but the pressure to make timely disbursements often made it impossible to use the
technical assistance effectively to support agreed-to policy actions. Experience elsewhere
also shows the difficulty of coordinating budget support operations with complementary
technical assistance.

3.7     The World Bank’s DPO portfolio also included four single-sector operations in
agriculture and two in natural resource management.10 These operations overlapped with
EGPRC and the two PRSCs. However, the leverage these sector DPOs provided was not
deployed to encourage the authorities to implement critical actions for fiscal stabilization.

Donor Coordination
3.8    Ghana is an interesting example of World Bank cooperation with development
partners in the budget support context. In 2003–07 (before the series under review), the

engagement.

  Four agricultural development policy operations (DPOs) totaled $207 million in disbursements in
2008–12, and $20 million was disbursed under the two DPOs in natural resource management in
2008–10.
                                               14


World Bank operated fully under the Multi-Donor Budget Support framework that included
most donors who used budget support as a modality. The World Bank and donors made joint
decisions on disbursements based on annual reviews of the performance assessment
framework. This donor coordination approach worked reasonably well in 2003–07 and
delivered timely disbursements on the back of satisfactory progress, though occasional
questions on flexibility versus performance arose due to differences in donors’ approaches
concerning slower-than-expected implementation of some of agreed-to actions. Overall, IEG
deemed Ghana’s performance as satisfactory because of strong economic performance
coupled with poverty reduction.

3.9     The situation changed in 2008 and 2009 against the background of weakened
economic management. With no IMF program, the World Bank took the leadership on macro
and fiscal dialogue. The new situation brought donors’ different approaches to budget
support into sharper focus, and these differences resulted in an effective breakdown of Multi-
Donor Budget Support in 2009. The World Bank proceeded unilaterally with EGPRC in
tandem with a three-year IMF Extended Credit Facility launched in 2009.

3.10 The Multi-Donor Budget Support framework was at least partially restored when the
new PRSC series was prepared and approved in 2011. However, fiduciary issues remained a
critical concern of donors because of the lack of budget control mechanisms in 2008 and
2009. The Multi-Donor Budget Support framework again ceased to operate in 2013 after the
new wave of fiscal deterioration in 2012. The World Bank returned to Ghana in 2015 with a
new DPO and a new Extended Credit Facility, but did not attract other development partners
because of widespread disappointment in budget support in Ghana and attitudes more
generally against budget support.

3.11 Experience in Ghana highlights some of the issues involved in coordinating budget
support activities. First, harmonization works smoothly as long as program implementation
goes well. Second, approaches toward the performance assessment framework differ—some
donors apply a so-called holistic assessment that includes judgments on areas that may not
feature specifically in the performance assessment framework, and others prefer to stick to
the letter of the agreed-to performance assessment framework. Divergent views may be
particularly significant concerning borrowers’ eligibility for budget support in a fiscal
destabilization context.11 Third, although donor harmonization is meant to reduce borrowers’
and donors’ transaction costs, the costs of reaching consensus and taking all stakeholders’
views into account in the performance assessment framework and annual assessments can
also be costly.

3.12 Ghana is also an interesting example of how a PRSP-based multi-donor budget
support mechanism built around the alignment of borrowers and donors’ interests through
developing and implementing a pro-poor policy program can collapse in a less-than-
conducive economic environment. Because of the authorities’ policy choices, Ghana is again
a debt-distressed country. Consequently, to restore stability and contain further debt


11
  In some cases, eligibility may be questioned for reasons beyond economic management issues (for
example, human rights and budget support in Uganda).
                                               15


accumulation, macro and fiscal stabilization programs had to replace external support based
on gradual implementation of a long-term development strategy.

3.13 Several stakeholders believe that the World Bank is not a substitute for the IMF in
helping countries to deal with major macrodestabilization. IMF programs are comprehensive
in nature and cover critical aspects of macro and fiscal framework in their entirety—and even
they are not always successful. Therefore, the World Bank’s decision to link the policy-based
interventions under review to IMF programs reflects an adequate assessment of the risks.

Assessment of Policy Content and the Results Framework
3.14 Restoring Fiscal Discipline: This objective was added to the objectives taken from
previous PRSC series. The focus was on fiscal reporting, establishing a Treasury Single
Account and strengthening commitment control, and ensuring desired fiscal outcomes
concerning the share of pro-poor public expenditures. These actions were important, but they
would not have been sufficient in themselves for restoring fiscal discipline without the
parallel IMF program that launched in 2009. In particular, IMF’s structural benchmarks
included quantitative targets on the nominal budget deficit, the central bank’s foreign
exchange reserves, accumulation of arrears, and others that captured the overall macro and
fiscal framework. This allowed the World Bank to focus on strengthening public financial
management.

3.15 It was clear by 2010 that the authorities could not successfully implement the IMF
program because of their political commitment to implement the single spine salary system.
This seriously undermined the likelihood of successfully implementing PRSC-7 and 8, which
launched in 2010. Even so, the program’s design did not respond to the expected
implementation of the single spine salary system policy or the resulting probability of fiscal
deterioration. The policy called for a major increase in public wages, and the newly elected
government announced it in 2009, before approval of the new series of PRSCs. The key
fiscal parameters after the policy’s introduction and estimates of its potentially large fiscal
impact were available in 2011 during the design and implementation of PRSC-8. The lack of
countervailing policy actions undermined the program’s intervention logic for achieving the
objective of restoring fiscal discipline.

3.16 The PRSCs also supported financial sector reforms in 2010–12. The program built on
the second financial sector strategic plan that was prepared in 2011, but this was not an
important focus of the program, and it did not directly link to the objective of restoring fiscal
discipline. The financial sector was a victim of fiscal destabilization because of the
deteriorating macro situation and the links between the quality of financial sector assets and
nonpayments to the private sector for goods and services.

3.17 The series pursued a number of specific results, including protecting pro-poor
expenditures, reducing deviations in budget executions, increasing the share of transactions
compliant with the procurement law (EGPRC), the amount of nonwage arrears, and the
banking system’s nonperforming loans and capital adequacy ratio.
                                              16


3.18 Public sector: The focus under this objective was on public sector employment,
reforms in subvented organizations (state-owned enterprises), energy sector reforms,
decentralization, and reforms in the Tema Oil Refinery. Although these were all largely
relevant for the objective, public wages and energy sector reforms were the most critical
areas, especially in the context of pressures on public employment and wages and the lack of
electricity tariff revision for a prolonged period that led to a power sector crisis. Policy
actions aimed at restoring tariff adjustment mechanisms in the energy sector were relatively
weak because they were mostly about developing financial recovery plans without a focus on
their implementation. Similarly, the actions on subvented agencies were extremely weak
because they lacked a clear implementation strategy, suggesting a lack in reform momentum
in that policy area at the time.

3.19 Only EGPRC focused on public wages. It supported a partial hiring freeze and actions
toward eliminating ghost workers from the payroll. The PRSCs did not support any policy
actions in this area, which reflected the lack of a conducive environment for public wages
reforms in 2010–12 because the authorities were implementing their ambitious single spine
salary system program to increase public wages substantially. This precluded commitment to
any rationalization of public employment and wages. Continued budget support without
addressing the key issue of public wage policy undermined the PRSC series’ intervention
logic.

3.20 Protecting the Poor: The focus under this objective was to enhance protection of the
poor through the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) Program.12 The
expectation was that policy actions would lead to an increase in the number of LEAP
beneficiaries and a growing number of newly enrolled beneficiaries, selected using targeting
mechanisms. The EGPRC supported an increase in the coverage of LEAP recipients, and the
policy matrix included a second tranche release condition on reclassification of pro-poor
expenditure. The PRSC series focused on introducing better targeting mechanisms. The
series sequenced the introduction of the improved targeting mechanism. PRSC-7 supported
the development of the institutional framework, and PRSC-8 supported the mechanism’s
launch.

3.21 Preparing for the oil era: Ghana started preparing for expected oil revenues in
2007–08, and EGPRC supported stakeholder consultations for establishing the Ghana
Petroleum Regulatory Authority and the fiscal regime for oil and gas revenues. The PRSCs
supported preparation of the Petroleum Revenue Management Bill and the institutional
framework for Ghana Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative, which was Ghana’s
adhesion to the initiative. PRSC-8 supported the establishment of the Ghana Petroleum
Regulatory Agency for regulating exploration and development of oil resources.

Conclusion
3.22 The intervention logic was of mixed quality. The instrument choice, based on
informed assessment of the risks, was appropriate for both EGPRC and the PRSC series. The
World Bank had a largely constructive role in donor coordination, taking the lead on macro
and fiscal dialogue during EGPRC preparation without an IMF program. EGPRC’s policy
content reflected critical issues in public financial management and public wages. However,
the policy program supported by the PRSC series suffered from weaknesses such as not
addressing emerging risks from the single spine salary system implementation in the policy
matrix. Although the lack of operational focus on this important issue can be explained by
Bank’s raliance on parallel IMF program that sought to address the overall fiscal risks, this
evaluation highlights the importance of thorough macroeconomic risk assessment by the
Bank in particularly challenging macro and fiscal situations. In addition, the policy content
on subsidized organizations in both programs was weak.

4. Results
Macrofiscal Developments
4.1     Ghana experienced an increase in per capita gross domestic product (GDP) from
about $2,500 in 2006 to $4,000 in 2014 (PPP 2014).13 However, external shocks and repeated
macroturbulences driven by inadequate and inconsistent policy choices also characterized
this period. The discovery of oil and an expansionary fiscal policy helped to maintain a
relatively high growth rate. However, growth tapered off after a record high in 2011 because
of a combination of factors (figure 4.1). These included a deteriorating trade balance (the fall
of gold and cocoa commodity prices and oil, more recently), external shocks (the breakdown
of the gas pipeline in West Africa, which led to an unreliable power supply), and structural
problems in public financial management (see following chapter).




13
  A 2010 revision of the accounts updated the base-year for Ghana’s national accounts from 1993 to
2006. This resulted in a 60 percent increase in gross domestic product after including economic
activities omitted in previous compilations. Ghana was classified as a middle-income country in 2011.

4.2     Confidence in Ghana’s economic and fiscal outlook was evident in the years leading
to the operations, partly driven by strong donor support, debt relief, the recently discovered
oilfields, and early access to Eurobonds. The government set off on an expansionary fiscal
trajectory, motivated by competitive elections and enabled by access to private finance and
an economic outlook that was too optimistic. The fiscal deficit increased from about 3
percent in 2005 to 15 percent in 2008. Fiscal targets periodically issued as part of the annual
budget law had little basis in reality. The period of fiscal expansions led to a massive debt
accumulation that offset previous gains from debt forgiveness under the Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries Debt Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative in the mid-2000s.
Figures 4.2 and 4.3 provide a historical overview of the fiscal deficit and its relation to fiscal
targets, and debt accumulation.

4.3     An IMF Extended Credit Facility launched in 2009 with structural benchmarks,
including quantitative targets on the nominal budget deficit, foreign exchange reserves, and
reduction of arrears. The focus of the World Bank’s program (discussed in chapter 3) was on
reducing budget deviations and improved fiscal reporting. The 2009 budget law took several
measures to curb the deficit. One was increasing revenues mainly by strengthening VAT
collection, raising airport taxes, and official grants (to catch up from historically low levels in
2008). The law compressed operational expenditures—goods and services, for example, by
reducing the number of ministries and cutting travel and conference costs in half. Another
measure postponed new, nonessential investment projects (with domestically financed capital
expenditures down from 10.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to 5.9 percent in 2009, as one-off
Eurobonds-financed investment expenditures conducted in 2008 will not be repeated).
Finally, the law established a Treasury Single Account (TSA) to improve cash management.

4.4      These measures were partially successful. As shown in figure 4.2, the deficit
subsequently dropped to 3.1 percent of GDP by 2011. The actual fiscal deficit was reduced
by significantly more than planned (figure 4.3), but cash basis accounting masked the true
fiscal stance in 2011 because of arrears accumulation that appeared in the 2012 actual
                                                                    19


budget. This explains large fluctuations in the ratio of actual versus planned budget deficits
in 2011 and 2012.

4.5     The measures taken were insufficient to counteract the implications of adopting the
single spine salary system, which the government promised to the electorate in 2008, but
only started taking full effect in 2011–12 (in anticipation of the upcoming elections). Public
wages increased by 4 percentage points to 12 percent of GDP between 2010 and 2012, which
increased the deficit and subsequently increased interest payments. Wages and interest
covered about 95 percent of all revenue generated by 2013.

4.6     Inflation remained high throughout this period, fluctuating between 8 and 20 percent
and largely following the pattern of fiscal expansion. The link between the fiscal deficit and
inflation highlights the central bank’s strong monetary accommodation of fiscal expansion.
By 2009 the central bank had already used the space to accommodate the fiscal policy
defined by the law at 11 percent of GDP (measured as the balance of outstanding credits to
the government in percent of GDP). After hitting this ceiling, the central bank continued
accommodation of the fiscal deficit through government bonds purchases, including from the
primary market. The central bank’s practice of automatically buying unsubscribed bonds
continued until 2014. The slippages in fiscal policy translated into total macrodestabilization
because the central bank monetized the fiscal deficit.

4.7     Successive Ghanaian governments showed a strong preference for non-concessional
borrowing that led to unsustainable debt accumulation. The ratio of public debt to GDP
surpassed 70 percent in 2016 compared with less than 20 percent in 2007, and interest
payments on public debt were close to 7 percent of GDP—one of the highest in the world.
This significantly reduced fiscal space available for pro-poor and pro-growth programs (box
4.1)14.

 Box 4.1. Ghana’s Debt Sustainability Analysis (IMF–World Bank)
 Ghana faces a high risk of debt distress. Vulnerabilities related to domestic debt reinforce the
 assessment of high risk. Fiscal consolidation under the Extended Credit Facility is on track as of
 spring of 2016, and debt trajectory and relevant indicators are broadly the same. However,
 projections show that two indicators will breach the policy-based thresholds under the baseline
 scenario—the thresholds were lowered because of Ghana’s deteriorating Country Policy and
 Institutional Assessment scores in the past three years. The authorities decided to lower the

  The quantum of public debt used in the IMF program does not includethe debt by state owned
enterprises. According to various estimates, state-owned enterprise debt explicitly guaranteed by the
government would add another 5 percent of GDP to the public debt, bringing total public and publicly
guaranteed debt to 75 percent of GDP

 issuance of a Eurobond to $1 billion from the initially envisioned $1.5 billion because of growing
 uncertainties about the prospects of emerging and frontier markets and the impending United States
 interest rate hike. Domestic financing (larger than was planned) covered this shortfall in financing.
 The unwinding of capital inflows to emerging and frontier markets and global investors
 rebalancing their portfolios (which factors not specific to Ghana could drive) may further
 complicate Ghana’s access to financing in 2016.
 Sustained fiscal adjustment and an appropriate choice of financing options are now crucially
 important. Under increasing uncertainties about the global economy, the Ghanaian authorities need
 to strike an appropriate balance between meeting imminent financing needs and extending
 maturity, and additional risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations. It is essential that Ghana
 firmly maintain the ambitious fiscal consolidation envisioned under the IMF-supported program,
 including during the 2016 election year. It is also important to develop an appropriate overall
 financing package, taking account of ever-changing market conditions and the best balance
 between external and domestic financing options. The possible diminishing appetite for Ghanaian
 debt—due to Ghana-specific factors and others not specific to Ghana— continues to be one of the
 most significant risks. Ghana is now classified as a lower-middle-income country with limited
 access to concessional resources, but it should continue to seek external loans on the most
 concessional terms possible.

4.8     The yields on Ghana’s international bonds have been above 10 percent in recent
years, highlighting the country’s high borrowing costs. Furthermore, on the share of short-
term domestic debt for deficit financing in total public debt is substantial, which is costly and
has negative implications for debt refinancing.

4.9      The IMF Extended Credit Facility approved in April 2015 focused on urgent steps
needed for restoring macrostability, concentrating on both spending and revenue measures in
the budget. The fiscal deficit declined to 7 percent in 2015, and the primary deficit was near
zero.15 Strengthening of cyclically adjusted fiscal position was even larger reflecting the fact
that fiscal deteroriation took place during a period of economic boom (2011-2012) and fiscal
adjustment was implemented during a period of relatively weak growth (2014-2016).

4.10 The program does not allow monetization of the fiscal deficit. The central bank
cannot buy government bonds even for its REPO operations. After an initial depreciation, the
exchange rate has been relatively stable since mid-2015, while the current account balance of
payments deficit was reduced because of the mix of fiscal consolidation and devaluation.

4.11 The program aims to bring inflation down to less than 8 percent in 2016. However,
most of the actions that underpin the stabilization do not have structural depth and are not
long term in their nature. Budget cuts were made in capital investments and in goods and
services, but sustaining this progress going forward is not guaranteed. On the revenue side, a
tax of 17.5 percent on petroleum was introduced in 2014, and a special import levy
(established in 2013 and extended until 2017) will generate additional revenue equal to 1.5

percent of GDP. Government is working to rationalize its system of tax exemptions,
estimated to cost more than 5 percent of GDP.

Public Financial Management
4.12 Considerable operational efficiency and resource allocation issues were present
during preparation of the Economic Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit (EGPRC) in
2008. Although a number of mitigation measures were taken, the public financial
management environment remains problematic across a number of important dimensions.

4.13 Both revenue and expenditure projections have been off target in recent years (figure
4.3), which affects expenditure allocations, creates uncertainty among the budget-executing
agencies, weakens cash management, and makes the overall system more prone to
accumulating arrears. Actual revenues, in particular, were short of budgeted figures in 2013
and 2014, partly due to external factors (price volatility of export commodities, for example),
but also complicated by optimistic oil revenue forecasting. The disaggregated budget
performance of expenditures was particularly volatile, especially in the years after the
introduction of the single spine salary system. Actual expenditures on wages and subsidies
exceeded the amounts budgeted, especially since 2012, when the actual wage bill was 19
percent greater than budgeted. A sharp drop in investment and transfers to other statutory
funds16 (which are part of government, receiving less than the mandated 15 percent of
revenue) compensated for this.17 Indicators of the 2013 Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment for aggregate revenue and expenditure outturns scored a
C.18 Composition of expenditure outturn was not rated. The PEFA assessment is based on
2009–11 figures, and this rating would have almost certainly deteriorated since, given the
strong deterioration in 2012 and afterward.

4.14 Unanticipated cuts to programs implied significant delays or nonpayment for critical
expenditure items and consequent arrears. Poor budget performance particularly affected
statutory funds and investment programs, resulting in a significant accumulation of arrears
that subsequently reduced the effectiveness of pro-poor and pro-growth programs. The stock
of arrears was 16 percent of total primary expenditure in 2009, 25 percent in 2010, and 10
percent in 2011 (Ecorys 2013). The government started to clear arrears in 2013, cutting about
₵2,984 million in 2013 (about 2.6 percent of GDP). However, continued liquidity constraints
and weak cash flow management undermined these efforts, and total arrears were estimated
at 5.5 percent of GDP in 2014. The reduction of the stock of nonwage arrears was a critical
prior action in both the EGPRC and the Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) 7 and 8.

 Statutory funds include the District Assemblies Common Fund, the Road Fund, and the National
Health Insurance Fund.

  In percent of gross domestic product, arrears on statutory payments were 0.8 percent, 1.3 percent,
and 1 percent in 2012, 2013, and 2014.
18
  A score of C means that actual primary expenditure deviated from expenditure estimates by more
than 15 percent for one of the years considered (35 percent in 2011), and actual domestic revenue was
between 92 percent and 116 percent of budgeted domestic revenue in at least two of three years.

System (GIFMIS) with corresponding commitment controls should have a positive effect on
the development of arrears. However, at the time of writing, statutory funds and internally
generated funds transactions do not use the platform and thus are not subject to the same
level of control.19

4.15 The program identified the lack of a TSA as a factor that undermines cash
management, so it created a strategy for developing a TSA between the central bank and the
ministry of finance and piloted it in accounts in the Consolidated Fund (the government’s
general bank account at the Bank of Ghana). The effective link of ministries, departments,
and agencies’ bank accounts to the TSA and the facilitation training of public servants started
in 2010, but progress was slow. The government reduced the number of accounts held at the
central bank from about 5,000 to 3,500. The program developed a facility that links
government bank accounts to provide a global cash balance in real time, but the central bank
is not yet actively using it. Of even greater concern is that the TSA pertains only to accounts
under the Consolidated Fund. Statutory funds and internally generated funds are not under
the TSA’s purview and continue to accumulate idle balances, resulting in inefficient cash
management. The independence of statutory funds means that they can buy treasury bills
with their idle balances. In an environment of poor budget performance and cash
management problems, it is particularly important to allocate unused funds to high-priority
areas and reduce pressure on interest rates. The scale of idle balances and the number of
commercial bank accounts used for public purposes was not estimated. However, the number
is likely to be significant, given the size of transactions that occur outside the TSA (about 40
percent of expenditures).20

4.16 The TSA was an important part of the operations, but there was no associated
indicator or target. The monitoring and evaluation framework in particular would have
benefitted from measuring the number of commercial bank accounts, idle balances, and the
government’s ability to operate sweep accounts through an electronic platform. Progress in
establishing and effectively using a TSA is limited.

4.17 The budget structure undermines allocative efficiency in Ghana. Government
management oversight is lacking, given the fragmented financing streams. The government
draws budget allocations for spending agencies from the Consolidated Fund, statutory funds,
and internally generated funds. Consolidation of the various sources is difficult. An updated
chart of accounts aligns Ghana with international good practice and allows effective


19
  Some progress with regards to integrating IGFs has been made. However overall, IFMIS coverage
remains limited. In 2015 the total value of transactions was cidi 7.9bn out of a total expenditure
envelope of cidi 37.3, which is about 21 percent.
20
  While an approach of linking accounts means that balances would be known, the central bank will
not be able to draw on them for investment (or fund requests from other spending units), nor do they
extend its overdraft limit. Further adherence to the annual budget law cannot be strictly enforced for
these balances under such an arrangement. An IMF (2011) guidance note on TSA makes this quite
clear. For a TSA to work effectively, accounts should operate on a zero balance basis, and balances
need to be swept into the central bank unconditionally—not periodically on an as-needed basis. The
1998 Ukraine Treasury Systems Project20 may offer some guidance to that end.

application of a financial management information system (FMIS).21 With the introduction of
the FMIS, the government publishes fiscal accounts on the Web (a program indicator that
was met). However, the FMIS rollout was achieved only for the Consolidated Fund. Similar
to the TSA, the FMIS does not cover other transactions, thus making budget execution
reports partial (coverage in 2016 was estimated at no more than 65 percent). Furthermore,
commitment controls do not apply to transactions handled outside of the FMIS. The
introduction of advanced budgeting techniques (activity- and program-based budgeting)
while the FMIS rollout is still in its infancy further complicates improvements in budget
execution.

4.18 IEG noted some improvements in procurement. The implementation completion
report states that transactions largely comply with the public procurement law (exceeding the
program target of 80 percent), but the 2013 PEFA notes that procurement is still largely
uncompetitive. Furthermore, no reliable data exist that document the value of contracts in
which tenders that should have been openly competed were sole sourced and not referred to
the Public Procurement Authority.

4.19 On balance, management of public finances had some improvements, but structural
problems persist, especially for transactions outside the Consolidated Fund.

Public Sector Employment
4.20 Civil service management was inadequate and a bottleneck for effective service
delivery in the mid-2000s. The payment arrangement was highly fragmented across sectors,
with each appealing to its own constituencies. For example, a civil servant in one sector
could earn significantly more than a civil servant in a different sector despite doing a similar
job (and depending on the wage-bargaining arrangements). Gross pay inequities are present
across the 18 different pay schemes. The health sector in particular negotiated exceptionally
high pay. An informant told the mission that nurses and midwives earn more than the Chief
of Police for the entire country.

4.21 A reform proposal was presented in 2006 to realign the numerous salary scales onto a
single spine and merge various allowances into the payroll that were previously handled
outside. The proposal aimed to address the inequities outlined in the previous paragraph and
provide a significant pay increase for most civil servants, given that employees at lower
levels would be adjusted upward. To offset the expected expense, an effort was made to
rationalize staff. The government performed a costing exercise, but it significantly
underestimated this reform’s eventual fiscal implications. A number of parallel wage
increases and an increase in allowances (particularly in agencies receiving subventions from
the Consolidated Fund) worsened the single spine salary system’s fiscal impact. Wage
negotiations in 2009 were particularly notable, leading on average to a 20 percent real
increase in the public wage bill. Allowances more than doubled during 2001–14.
Furthermore, the single spine salary system was implemented with retroactive effect (2008),

thus accumulating wage arrears.22 Public wages and salaries increased from 3.9 percent of
GDP in 2000 to 12 percent in 2012, which is well above figures for peer countries (figures
4.5 and 4.6). Wages as a share of revenue is particularly high and an outlier (more than 60
percent in 2012). These figures decreased after a strict adjustment program (since 2014) and
nominal increases below inflation, but they remain at the high end of regional comparator
countries.

4.22 The overall work force grew at a faster rate than population, despite a commitment to
rationalize staff. The state employs half of those in formal sector wage employment.23 The
education and health sectors recorded the largest increase in civil servants, even though both
sectors were exempt from a general hiring freeze. Figure 4.6 shows growth and share as a
percentage of the labor and workforce. The spike in 2013 requires cautious interpretation
because it also reflects the entry of civil servants from state-owned enterprises and subvented
agencies into the single spine salary system.

4.23 The government took several steps to reduce the wage bill. For example, an electronic
salary payment voucher system allows the government to identify ghost workers and holds
line managers accountable by requiring them to certify payments. A biometric unit in the
Ministry of Finance Development Planning matches employees’ biometric records to the
payroll to identify and remove absent employees. The system removed 133,000 employee
records that lacked bank account information or had other discrepancies. Important work
continues on preparing an establishment register within the human resources component of


22
  Because employees gradually shifted to the single spine salary structure, retroactive payments
(deferred wages) applied to those who transferred after the effective date. Furthermore, because of the
time it took to enter a new recruit on the payroll, deferred wages incurred after the expansion of
employment (particularly in the Ghana Education Service).
23
     However, this is estimated to represent only about 12 percent of total employment in Ghana.

the GIFMIS. While establishment control is reportedly adequate, budget controls are not
fully in place as transactions are entered on an ex-post basis.

4.24 However, wage increases have not been in line with the budgets allocated in recent
years, reflecting an inadequate commitment and establishment control system. Wage and
salary payments fluctuated significantly between 2009 and 2013, which was a volatile period
marked by salary increases, in-year adjustments, and unbudgeted labor force growth. The
wage bill only recently declined below 10 percent, after the most recent IMF program and
stricter controls (figure 4.7). However, the payroll system is still problematic and a source of
inefficiencies (Government of Ghana 2015). A comprehensive audit was conducted in 2012
and updated in 2015, but the government did not act enough to implement its
recommendations.

4.25 The EGPRC had two related policy actions. The first was implementing a net hiring
freeze in the public sector (excluding trainees absorbed in education and health) by
completing an employment audit, eliminating ghost workers from the Ghana Health
Service’s payroll, and requiring the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning and the
Office of the Head of Civil Service to approve all ministries, departments, and agencies’
hiring decisions. The second action was appointing a minister of state in charge of public
sector reform, eliminating ghost workers from the Ghana Education Service’s payroll, and
initiating employment audits in all remaining ministries, departments, and agencies. As
discussed previously, a hiring freeze was implemented and an attempt was made to identify
and eliminate ghost workers. However, it did not address the most pertinent issue because it
excluded the education and health sector from the hiring freeze. Problems also remain with
the establishment and commitment control system, and positions are still created without
sufficient budget allocations. Therefore, the target of a net hiring freeze is partially met. The
second indicator used to monitor progress was satisfactory budget execution of item 1
(personal payments). This indicator was not met because this was volatile, and outturns
repeatedly exceeded the budgets by large margins. Attribution to the program is also
questionable because the supported policy actions did not specifically address this issue. The
PRSC-7 and 8 follow-up operations did not address the public wage bill, which is crucial to
fiscal health.

Financial Sector
4.26 The PRSCs supported formulation and implementation of the financial sector strategy
plan aimed at improving the banking system’s performance. Ghana’s banking system
remained largely liquid during 2012–15 despite repeated macroeconomic turbulence.
Nonperforming loans declined to about 11 percent as of the end of 2014, and the capital
adequacy ratio remained strong at about 16 percent. The situation changed somewhat after
mid-2015 with an observed overall deterioration of the quality of the banking system’s assets
and an increase in nonperforming loans, largely reflecting protracted weak performance of
state-owned enterprises. The central bank was revising the standards of asset quality
assessment because of methodological issues in the current approach. IMF supported efforts
to use independent audit firms for asset classification. However, this evaluation could not
establish the actual extent of weakening of nonperforming loans based on a more rigorous
methodology.

Electricity, Fuel Subsidies, and Subvented Organizations
ELECTRICITY AND FUEL SUBSIDIES

4.27 The World Bank (under EGPRC and the PRSCs) supported the adoption of action
plans for the utility companies’ financial recovery and reintroduction of an automatic tariff
adjustment mechanism. However, these actions did not lead to substantial results because the
action plans were never fully implemented operationalized. The tariff adjustment mechanism
the PRSCs supported was inadequate because it did not allow a full pass-through of changes
in input prices to consumer tariffs.
                                                   28


4.28 The situation changed in 2013 and 2014 as part of a domestic stabilization program.
The government started passing on to consumers a larger share of the increased cost of
energy production as the budget pressure became unsustainable due to currency depreciation.
This led to an increase in electricity tariffs—the median tariff rose by 160 percent between
October 2013 and December 2014. The government removed the subsidies completely in
January 2016 as part of the implementation of the IMF Extended Credit Facility and the
World Bank’s new development policy operation (DPO). It maintained a moderate cross-
subsidization between different groups of consumers to allow low lifeline tariffs.24

4.29 Concerning fuel subsidies, the government continued to set inadequately low
administrative prices for the retail prices of fuel in 2008–12 that did not reflect the extent of
currency devaluation. This led to subsidies to the operators, which further increased the fiscal
burden. A new policy took effect in February 2013 when gasoline and diesel prices increased
by 20 percent. Prices increased further in December 2014 by 100 percent. The government
discontinued subsidies in June 2015 as part of the new stabilization program, and eliminated
the remaining subsidies and cross-subsidies in January 2016, except for the subsidy for boat
fuel, which is a cross-subsidy funded by a levy on premium gasoline.

SUBVENTED ORGANIZATIONS AND STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES

4.30 World Bank DPOs supported reforms in the electricity sector and the Tema Oil
Refinery, including developing sectoral financial recovery plans and supporting their
implementation. Despite these reforms, the financial performance of state-owned enterprises
is still a major challenge. The boards of state-owned enterprises are highly politicized, and
management has little autonomy. The sector is heavily in debt (estimated at $1.5 billion
dollars in 2016), and it keeps growing because of high interest charges. Tema Oil Refinery is
also a major concern. Its intermittent operation substantially increases operating costs and
undermines its financial viability. The government securitized the debt of some state-owned
enterprises and directed the proceeds of a special petroleum levy (in place since 2014) toward
repayment of state-owned enterprises’ debt.

Preparing for the Oil Era
4.31 Oil production began in 2011, four years after its discovery in 2007. The state-owned
Ghana National Petroleum Corporation and a number of private operators manage oil
production, and the state-owned enterprise has a 25 percent share in total production. Private
companies operate under a five-year cost recovery contract. The original forecast for daily
output was about 120,000 barrels, but actual production fell short because of production
problems and fluctuated between 100,000 and 110,000 barrels per day.

4.32 PRSC-7 supported adoption of the Petroleum Revenue Management Act in 2011 (the
main legislation governing oil revenue management), which was revised in 2015.25 Ghana’s


24
  The tariff structure is based on these groups: 0 to 49 kilowatts per hour, 50 to 300, 300 to 600, and
600 and above.

Petroleum Commission was established in 2013 after approval of the law submitted to the
parliament, the preparation of which was supported by PRSC-8.

4.33 According to the legislation, 70 percent of oil revenues go to the consolidated budget,
10 percent to the Ghana Heritage Fund (established to accumulate oil wealth for future
generations), and 15 percent to the Ghana Stabilization Fund. Amendments to the legislation
in 2015 addressed important issues such as more detailed mechanisms for distributing oil
revenues when prices are lower or higher than the benchmark. It also specified conditions
under which the authorities can use the Ghana Stabilization Fund—specifically, it set an
annual withdrawal cap of 75 percent of the total fund balance. The law also stipulates that 70
percent of annual disbursements from the Ghana Stabilization Fund for the budget should be
used for capital expenditures. It is yet too early to assess the degree of compliance with these
requirements.

4.34 Ghana is compliant with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and
regularly publishes annual reports. The Public Interest and Accountability Committee further
enhances the transparency of oil revenue management. The committee is a citizen-led
statutory body established under section 51 of the Petroleum Revenue Management Act to
provide additional independent, non-parliamentary oversight of the collection and utilization
of Ghana’s petroleum revenues (box 4.2). Overall, Ghana established institutions that allow
for transparent oil revenue management and account for intergenerational consideration. The
overall weak state of public financial management in Ghana, which significantly hinders the
effectiveness of government spending programs, is the main challenge in the use of oil
revenue.

 Box 4.2. The Public Interest and Accountability Committee
 The Public Interest and Accountability Committee, mandated since September 2011, has the
 oversight responsibility of monitoring and evaluating the management of Ghana’s petroleum
 resources by the government and relevant stakeholder institutions. The committee has published
 four annual and four semiannual reports since its inception covering 2011 to June 2015. These
 reports aim to inform Ghanaians and other interested stakeholders about how the government
 manages the country’s petroleum revenues, and provide platforms for collecting and sharing
 citizens’ feedback with those charged with responsibility in the sector. The reports cover a broad
 range of issues associated with petroleum revenue management, such as information on
 production, liftings, total revenues accruing, government allocation and utilization of these
 revenues, and management of the funds in the Ghana Petroleum Funds (Ghana Stabilization Fund
 and the Ghana Heritage Fund). The reports also examine issues and findings relevant to the
 performance of various institutions charged with responsibilities under the Petroleum Revenue
 Management Act. The committee expects that the citizens of Ghana will find time to read the
 report and provide feedback during the public forums held after publication of the report.

Strengthened Protection of the Poor
4.35 Poverty has decreased rapidly in the last two decades (figure 4.8). However,
household-level data are not consistently available for the period. The number of people
                                                     30


  living on less than $1.90 a day has dropped remarkably from 7.1 million in 1991 to 5.4
  million in 2005, which is equivalent to a drop of 47.4 percent to 25.2 percent of the
  population. According to the national poverty line, 31.9 percent of the population was poor in
  2005, falling to 24.2 percent in 2012. However, significant geographical disparities remain—
  the three northern regions have the highest incidence of poverty (80 percent of the poor).
  Inequalities between regions explain (on average) 40 percent of the total change in the Gini
  coeffcient.

  4.36 The EGPRC and PRSC-7 and 8 had actions relating to protection of the poor. The
  first tranche of the EGPRC required an increase in the number of households covered by the
  Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) Program, and the second tranche a
  protection of pro-poor expenditures after fiscal consolidation. The PRSCs aimed to
  strengthen and unify targeting mechanisms across fragmented programs (LEAP, the National
  Health Insurance Scheme, and the school uniform program). Enrollment in LEAP made
  significant progress. Furthermore, beneficiary targets identified using the common targeting
  mechanism were met. The total funds allocated to the LEAP Program increased significantly
  during the evaluation period (table 4.1). Although the administrative expense was relatively
  high (especially in the early years), it decreased from more than half in 2009 to about 10
  percent in 2014, which also reflects efficiency gains through joint targeting. However, an
  effort to reach out to significantly more districts in 2015 increased the relative administrative
  cost to about 25 percent.

4.37 On the downside, IEG found evidence that pro-poor expenditures were crowded out
through excessively high wage and salary expenditures and interest payments.26 As a share of
the total budget, allocations to social sectors decreased from nearly 50 percent to less than 20
percent between 2011 and 2014. Table 4.2 shows these developments in percent of GDP, in
which administrative expenses increased dramatically to 26.3 percent while expenditures in
health and education remained about the same.

   Public expenditure management is fragmented in Ghana, which makes it difficult to analyze the
allocation of public resources by sectors. The sectors receive funding through the budget, earmarked
funds, and internally generated funds.

5. Performance Evaluation
5.1     This chapter evaluates the outcomes of the two series— Economic Governance and
Poverty Reduction Credit (EGPRC) and Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs)—and
World Bank and borrower performance. The previous chapters presented in-depth analyses
of various dimensions of the two series, and this chapter summarizes the resulting
performance ratings. As not all improvements represent continuity with the operations under
review, these operations cannot be credited with all these developments. Attribution is
discussed on a case-by-case basis.

evaluation.

Relevance of Objectives
EGPRC: High
PRSCs: High

5.3     Relevance of objectives for both series was high, reflecting strong relevance to the
context characterized by emerging risks to the fiscal discipline and the discovery of oil, along
with long-term and persistent challenges in public sector management. Objectives aligned
with Ghana’s national development strategies during 2008–13, and they reflected the
strategic priorities of the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategies for the period covered
by EGPRC and PRSC-7 and 8.

Relevance of Design
EGPRC: Substantial

5.4    EGPRC’s design reflected higher-than-usual risks to the reform program’s
implementation and the World Bank’s measures to mitigate them. The choice of the
instrument (a stand-alone, two-tranche operation) and frontloading of important policy
                                               33


actions in the first operation were important risk mitigation measures. Implementing the
budget support without other donors in a temporary departure from performance assessment–
based framework, but on the back of the IMF program, was also an adequate choice, given
prevailing macrorisks and the authorities’ commitments to address them through a World
Bank and IMF-led stabilization program.

PRSC-7 and 8: Modest

5.5      The PRSCs had mixed design quality. The choice of instrument was adequate, and
the World Bank had a constructive role in reviving the Multi-Donor Budget Support platform
for donor coordination. The World Bank continued its support to establishing sound
institutions for transparent and efficient oil revenue management. However, the policy
program supported by PRSC series suffered from weaknesses such as not addressing
emerging risks from the single spine salary system implementation to overall macroeconomic
stability and specific objectives, and lack of strong policy content for reforming subvented
organizations.

Achievement of Objectives
EGPRC

5.6     Support the authority’s three-pronged effort to restore budgetary discipline.
Fiscal discipline improved substantially in 2009–11 on the back of the new IMF program
after the major deterioration in 2008. Volatility in fiscal indicators declined, and preliminary
steps were taken to strengthen public financial management through establishing a Treasury
Single Account (TSA) and strengthening commitment control. The program closed in June
2010, and Ghana was broadly on track to regain fiscal discipline by the end of 2010 and early
2011. Major risks to fiscal discipline emerged in 2011 during preparation of the PRSC-7, and
it became clear that the authorities’ plans to implement the single spine salary system would
undermine nascent fiscal discipline. Achievement of this objective was substantial.

5.7      Tackle long-standing public sector and energy issues. Under this objective, the
government sought to implement a net hiring freeze and improve the operational efficiency
of major public utility companies. The hiring freeze was partial and weakly implemented,
and the proposed major public wage increase through the single spine salary system ran
against the spirit of reforms in the public sector. The authorities could not improve the public
utilities’ financial situation because of the lack of tariff adjustment, which further worsened
the impact of supply shocks on power production and distribution. Achievement of this
objective was modest.

5.8     Protect the poor. The Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) Program
rolled out significantly under the EGPRC. The number of districts participating grew from 21
to 83 between 2008 and 2010, and the total number of beneficiaries increased from 1,654 to
39,146. Resources dedicated to the program almost tripled during the period. The second
tranche required measures to protect pro-poor expenditures after fiscal consolidation. This
was partially achieved—about 50 percent of the budget was dedicated to social sectors in
2011. However, pro-poor expenditures were crowded out afterward because of increased
                                                34


pressure from non-discretionary items. Poverty declined by 7 percent between 2005 and
2011. On balance, achievement of this objective was substantial.

PRSCS

5.9     Restoring budgetary discipline and financial stability. Fiscal stabilization gains
achieved in 2010–11 were erased because of unsustainable fiscal expansion ahead of the
elections in the second half of 2012. An IMF Extended Credit Facility that expired in mid-
2012 was not renewed because of the lack of a credible macro program. The World Bank–
supported measures in PRSC-7 and 8 to maintain fiscal discipline proved ineffective. Major
macroeconomic destabilization ensued characterized by monetary accommodation of the
fiscal deficit, high inflation, and persistent pressures on the exchange rate. Attempts to
stabilize the program in 2013 and 2014—without World Bank budget support or an IMF
program—were mostly ineffective, though some important measures were taken, such as an
effective freeze on real wages and reducing the fiscal burden of subsidized fuel prices and
electricity tariffs. Macroeconomic stability was regained only after IMF returned in early
2015, further supported by a large World Bank budget support operation that combined a
traditional development policy operation (DPO) with a policy-based guarantee for Eurobond
issuance to refinance maturing debt.27 Public financial management reforms advanced
slowly, affected by the 2012 fiscal destabilization. The TSA’s role grew, and overall public
financial management practices might improve with the full rollout of the Ghana Integrated
Financial Management Information System. The banking system remained largely stable
despite the macroeconomic turbulences of 2012–15. Although official nonperforming loans
and capital adequacy ratios seem comfortable, a revised approach to the quality of assessing
asset quality is required. On balance, achievement of this objective was modest.

5.10 Tackling long-standing public sector and energy issues. The public wages
situation deteriorated in 2011 and 2012 because the negative impact of the single spine salary
system implementation exceeded expectations due to retroactive payments. Public wages
reached 12 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012. However, the wage bill was
reduced to less than 10 percent of GDP by 2016 because of an effective freeze on real wages
achieved through relatively low, nominal increases in a high-inflation environment. The
employment freeze was largely ineffective because public employment grew faster than the
labor force. The situation in public utilities improved somewhat due to tariff adjustments in
2014–16, but their financial viability remains significantly undermined because of large debts
accumulated over the years and continuing underinvestment that affects their production
base. Government’s reforms of subsidized organization were largely ineffective, and this is
still a major area of concern. Overall achievement of this objective was modest.

5.11 Protect the poor. The LEAP program continued its significant progress, rolling out
to all 185 districts between 2011 and 2015 (from 99 districts in 2011). Beneficiary
households increased more than twofold from 64,241 to 144,980 during the same period. The
PRSCs indicator of a single targeting mechanism was implemented, resulting in reduced

27
  The Macroeconomic Stability for Competitiveness and Growth Credit included a $100 million IDA
credit and a $400 million policy-based guarantee used to support the issuance of Eurobonds in 2015
for debt refinancing.
                                              35


administrative cost that dropped from more than 40 percent to 10 percent of total
administrative expenditure in 2014. The ratio increased to 25 percent in 2015 because of a
renewed effort to reach new districts. On the downside, IEG found evidence that pro-poor
expenditures were crowded out through excessively high wage and salary expenditures and
interest payments. As a share of the total budget, allocations to social sectors decreased from
nearly 50 percent to less than 20 percent between 2011 and 2014. On balance, achievement
of this objective was substantial.

5.12 Preparing the economy for the oil era. PRSC-7 supported adoption of the
Petroleum Revenue Management Act in 2011 (the main legislation governing oil revenue
management), which was revised in 2015. Ghana’s Petroleum Commission was established
in 2013 after approval of the law submitted to the parliament as part of PRSC-8. Ghana is
compliant with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and regularly publishes
annual reports. The Public Interest and Accountability Committee further enhances the
transparency of oil revenue management. The committee is a citizen-led statutory body
established under section 51 of the Petroleum Revenue Management Act to provide
additional independent, non-parliamentary oversight of the collection and utilization of
Ghana’s petroleum revenues (box 4.1). Overall, Ghana established institutions that allow for
transparent oil revenue management and accounts for intergenerational consideration. The
overall weak state of public financial management in Ghana, which significantly hinders the
effectiveness of government spending programs, is the main challenge in the use of oil
revenue. Achievement of this objective was substantial.

Outcome Ratings
EGPRC: Moderately Satisfactory

5.13 The overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory, reflecting the high relevance
of objectives, substantial relevance of design, substantial achievement of fiscal discipline
objectives, modest achievement of the objective in public sector reforms, and substantial
achievement of the objective to protect the poor. The program stabilized public finances (in
coordination with the IMF program) and, as a result, stabilized the overall macroeconomic
situation in 2009–10. This stabilization, together with the initial steps toward strengthening
public financial management, contributed to restoring the preconditions for budget support
that helped revive the Multi-Donor Budget Support platform. The program was less effective
in addressing long-term public sector reform needs, such as wage and employment control,
material public financial management improvement, and reforms of subsidized organizations.

PRCS: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.14 The overall outcome rating is moderately unsatisfactory, reflecting the high
relevance of objectives and modest relevance of design, substantial achievement of
objectives of protecting the poor and preparing for the oil era, and modest effectiveness of
the objectives in fiscal discipline and long-standing public sector reforms. Ghana experienced
a substantial deterioration in the macrofiscal environment during implementation of the
series because of government wage policy and overall fiscal loosening ahead of the 2012
elections. Most of the important reforms needed in the public sector advanced slowly.
                                                36


However, the program was successful in helping Ghana establish the necessary institutions
for transparent and efficient oil revenue management. The government maintained its focus
on improving targeting of assistance to the poor.

Risk to Development Outcome
5.15 IEG assessed the risks to development outcome as high.28 The IMF and the World
Bank assess Ghana as having a high probability of renewed debt distress. National elections,
scheduled for the end of 2016, pose major risks of fiscal weakening. Another episode of
fiscal destabilization would be much more costly than in 2008 and 2012 because of Ghana’s
substantially increased indebtedness and extremely high costs of debt service. On the positive
side, the upcoming elections will be the first to take place under an IMF program since 2004,
which somewhat contains the risks, but does not guarantee that electoral cycles will not
affect fiscal discipline. Slow implementation of public financial management reforms and
inefficiencies in statutory funds further amplify the risks to fiscal management. Not
containing the cost of debt service would undermine the long-term strategy of protecting the
poor through government expenditures, and this has already occurred. Furthermore, major
risks slowing reforms in key areas (such as public sector employment, public utilities, and
subsidized organizations) will become persistent challenges that will be even more difficult
to address.

World Bank Performance
EGPRC

Quality at Entry—Satisfactory

5.16 This evaluation highlights the World Bank’s role in addressing fiscal destabilization
in Ghana through a DPO prepared in close coordination with an IMF program, and that
included an objective to restore fiscal discipline. The choice of instrument (a two-tranche,
stand-alone operation) reflected the risk. The World Bank conducted the operation outside of
the performance assessment framework’s Multi-Donor Budget Support platform because of
newly emerged macro and fiscal risks, but it maintained strong coordination with other
donors. The choice of results indicators was a weakness.

Quality of Supervision—Moderately Satisfactory

5.17 The World Bank team conducted supervisions through missions based in the country
office. Supervision focused on monitoring implementation of tranche release conditions for
the disbursement in 2010 and on overall monitoring of macro and fiscal developments in
coordination with the IMF. Supervision coincided with preparation of the next PRSC series,
in which the World Bank returned to the performance assessment framework’s donor
coordination platform. Quality of supervision suffered from the lack of an adequate


28
  IEG provided only one rating to the risk to development outcome because the objectives were
similar, and the PRSCs came after the Economic Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit.
                                              37


assessment of the magnitude of authorities’ plans for public wages, which were actively
discussed during supervision.

PRSC7 AND PRSG8

Quality at Entry—Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.18 The World Bank’s performance strengths included coordinating budget support with
other development partners as part of the renewed Multi-Donor Budget Support, and
incorporating into program design the results of analytical products that provided diagnostics
and policy recommendations. However, World Bank performance suffered from lack of
adequate response to the increase in public wages under the single spine salary system. Full
information and details on the government’s plans were available during preparation of the
second operation, but the World Bank did not consider this information in the second
operation’s design. This shortcoming in the quality of entry significantly affected design.

Quality of Supervision—Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.19 The World Bank’s strengths in supervision of the PRSCs were strong cooperation and
dialogue with the donors, World Bank team participation in monthly sector working groups,
and annual Multi-Donor Budget Support reviews. However, this evaluation notes that the
World Bank was operating in a challenging environment caused by the authorities’ decisions
on public expenditures. This affected the quality of policy dialogue during program
supervision. The dialogue suffered further because the IMF program was not renewed.

Borrower Performance
5.20   The government was the implementing agency, so there is only one rating.

EGPRC: Moderately Satisfactory

5.21 The authorities were quick to reverse the 2008 fiscal deterioration in 2009. Ghana
invited the IMF back to the country, which was crucial for ensuring an adequate environment
for donors’ budget support. The policy matrix agreed to with the World Bank reflected the
authorities’ policy priorities. The government took strong ownership of several reforms,
including creating institutions necessary for managing oil resources. The authorities’
commitments to reforms weakened toward the end of the series implementation, especially in
fiscal management.

PRSCs: Unsatisfactory

5.22 The authorities committed to the ongoing fiscal and macrostabilization program at the
program preparation, but the situation deteriorated shortly after disbursement of the first
operation. Political economy constraints proved strong, which led the government to
implement an expansionary spending plan before the elections. The authorities’
commitments remain strong in management of oil revenues.
                                              38


Monitoring and Evaluation
5.23 Overall, the design of monitoring and evaluation for both series suffered from data
limitations that are typical of many governance and institutional reforms. Many indicators
were output oriented instead of outcome oriented. The main weakness was the lack of
consistent fiscal data due to persistent arrears accumulation and cash-basis fiscal accounting,
which undermined the monitoring of public resource use, especially the extent of spending in
pro-poor priorities.

5.24 Monitoring and evaluation design largely drew on the Multi-Donor Budget Support
performance assessment framework. However, because of this reliance, the operations’
departure from the platform and framework affected monitoring and evaluation quality, as
did newly emerging priority areas, such as fiscal discipline and public wages. In addition to
Multi-Donor Budget Support platform, reports made publicly available included annual
reports on macroeconomic developments in the context of the framework agreed-to with the
World Bank, the government, and the IMF; monthly budget expenditure reports (with a
breakdown by ministry and agency) available within six weeks after the end of the month;
quarterly poverty expenditure reports; and quarterly fiscal reports.

6. Lessons
6.1    Ghana again became a substantially indebted country that must direct a substantial
share of its revenues to debt servicing, and it did so within a decade after a major debt relief
under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. This highlights the
importance of prudent macrofiscal management in post-HIPC countries, and emphasizes that
the World Bank has to place in its policy lending for helping its clients to preserve borrowing
space.

6.2     Adequate macroeconomic management is a critical precondition of budget support
(which relates to the previous lesson). The World Bank made the right choice to focus on
restoring fiscal discipline as part of risk mitigation for the Economic Governance and
Poverty Reduction Credit in 2009. Similarly, its choice not to deploy development policy
operations (DPOs) in 2013–14 because of the lack of an adequate macroframework was also
correct. Ghana’s case also shows that the World Bank is not a substitute for the IMF in a
challenging context that requires a comprehensive macroeconomic program. In this respect,
Ghana is a good example of World Bank–IMF cooperation.

6.3     Ghana’s case shows that DPOs deployed in an extremely weak public financial
management environment are unlikely to be successful. Ghana experienced a deterioration in
resource allocation during 2008–12 because of debt-financed expenditure hikes that led to
interest payments of about 7 percent of gross domestic product per year, taking precious
resources away from pro-poor spending, thus undermining Ghana’s overall growth and
poverty reduction agenda and the effectiveness of the World Bank’s budget support. This
emphasizes the importance of the quality of public resource use in both public financial
management and public resource allocations, as a pre-condition of budget support success.
                                              39


6.4     Donor coordination on budget support can be difficult in a challenging environment
like that in Ghana in 2008–13. Assessment of eligibility for budget support is still a
controversial area in relationships between various donors. Despite a move toward
performance criteria based on agreed-to actions, various donors may interpret different
shocks differently, which will affect donor coordination. Dealing with macro and fiscal
mismanagement when macroframework is not formally a part of the performance assessment
can be an especially contentious issue.

6.5     Fiscal pressure can crowd out discretionary expenditures, and service delivery sectors
are especially vulnerable. The World Bank can use DPF operations to take a crucial role in
protecting pro-poor expenditures in such an environment.

6.6    Giving due weight to the underlying factors of fiscal imbalances and addressing them
appropriately is crucial. Measures taken to contain the public wage bill and mitigate
fragmentation of bank accounts were insufficient to translate into lasting results.

6.7    The World Bank has a crucial role in providing advisory services that are
complementary to budget support. A more proactive engagement in estimating the fiscal
impact of the single spine salary reform introduction could have helped in designing a phased
approach consistent with the long-term budgetary envelope.
