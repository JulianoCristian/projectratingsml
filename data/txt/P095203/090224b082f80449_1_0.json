development outcome was\n            substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            enterprise finance is delivered most effectively through a\n            sound financial institution with a proven implementation\n            track-record. Flexibility is key to effective design and\n            implementation. At the design stage, it is important to\n            elaborate outcome indicators for participating banks and\n            beneficiary enterprises that will enable assessment of the\n            project development objective (PDO). The implementation\n            support missions often identified opportunities to improve\n            the project, including through discussions with the project\n            implementation unit (PIU), participating banks, and\n            beneficiary enterprises. Lines of credit should take\n            advantage of opportunities for leveraging the impact of Bank\n            financing, and this was evident in the impact of the Ukraine\n            financial sector development policy loan program initiated\n            during the last year of EDP2 implementation."}, "docdt": "2015-06-01T00:46:04Z"}
