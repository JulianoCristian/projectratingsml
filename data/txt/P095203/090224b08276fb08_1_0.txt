                         (i) Serve as a catalyst to support export and real sector growth in Ukraine during the EDP 2 implementation period (2006-2011) and beyond, by providing medium and
                         long-term working capital and investment finance to Ukrainian private exporting enterprises. (ii) Further improve the ability of the Ukrainian banking sector to provide
                         financial resources to the enterprise sector, through further development of intermediation, by expanding its depth and breadth through more and better lending
                         products.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, EDP2 continues to be implemented in satisfactory manner, although disbursement has proceeded slower than expected, hampered by the extremely challenging political and
                         economic environment. The factors that negatively affected the credit decisions by Ukrainian exporting enterprises in the first half of CY2014 include: continuing economic
                         contraction, political crisis and armed conflict in the industrial heartland, currency devaluation, and trade difficulties with a major export destination (Russia). In the first quarter of

                         trade in these regions. Still, Ukreximbank and other Participating Financial Insitutions continued lending to eligible exporting enterprises, with total disbursement under the Additional
                         Financing to EDP2 ($150 million) reaching $73.61 million by July 1, 2014 (49% of the AF amount). Ukreximbank and two other current PFIs remain adequately capitalized and fully
                         comply with the prudential norms. Overall, the Project continues to be achieving its stated Developmental Objectives.
