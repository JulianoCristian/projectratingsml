To the Board of Directors of Joint Stock Company "The State Export-Import Bank of Ukraine"

The accompanying summary special-purpose financial statements of the Additional Financing for the
Second Export Development Project ("AF for EDP2") administered by Joint Stock Company "The State
Export-Import Bank of Ukraine" (the "Borrower", "Ukreximbank" or the "Bank"), financed under the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the "IBRD") Loan Agreement N2 8089-UA (the
"Loan Agreement"), which comprise the summary of funds received, the summary of expenditures, the
statement of designated account and the summary of statement of expenditures (SOEs) for the year ended
31 December 2013, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information
(the "summary special-purpose financial statements"), are derived from the audited special-purpose
financial statements of AF for EDP2 for the year ended 31 December 2013. We expressed an unmodified
audit opinion on those special-purpose financial statements in our auditors' report dated 4 June 2014.
Those financial statements, and the summary financial statements, do not reflect the effects of events that
occurred subsequent to the date of our auditors' report on those financial statements.

The summary special-purpose financial statements do not contain all the disclosures required by the
financial reporting provisions of the "Guidelines: Annual Financial Reporting and Auditing for World Bank-
Financed Activities" issued by the World Bank and dated 30 June 2003. Reading the summary special-
purpose financial statements, therefore, is not a substitute for reading the audited special-purpose financial
statements of AF for EDP2.

Management's responsibility for the summary special-purpose financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of a summary of the special-purpose financial statements on
the basis described in Note 2 to these summary special-purpose financial statements.

Auditors' responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the summary special-purpose financial statements based on
our procedures, which were conducted in accordance with International Standard on Auditing (ISA) 810,
"Engagements to Report on Summary Financial Statements."

Opinion

In our opinion, the summary special-purpose financial statements derived from the audited special-purpose
financial statements of AF for EDP2 for the year ended 31 December 2013 are consistent. in all material
respects, with those special-purpose financial statements, on the basis described in Note 2.

Other Matter -Restriction on Use

Without modifying our opinion, our auditors' report on AF for EDP2 audited special-purpose financial
statements for 4 June 2014 draws attention to Note 2 to the audited special-purpose financial statements,
which describes the basis of accounting used in those special-purpose financial statements. Those special-
purpose project financial statements were prepared to assist the Bank to comply with the financial
reporting provisions of the guidelines referred to above. As a result, the special-purpose financial
statements may not be suitable for another purpose. Accordingly, without modifying our opinion on the
summary special-purpose financial statements, we draw attention to Note 2 of the summary special-
purpose financial statements, which reproduces Note 2 to the audited special-purpose financial statements
and describes the basis of accounting used in the audited special-purpose financial statements. As a result,
the summary special-purpose financial statements may not be suitable for another purpose.
