Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 (i) Serve as a catalyst to support export and real sector growth in Ukraine during the EDP 2 implementation period (2006-2011) and beyond, by
 providing medium and long-term working capital and investment finance to Ukrainian private exporting enterprises. (ii) Further improve the ability of
 the Ukrainian banking sector to provide financial resources to the enterprise sector, through further development of intermediation, by expanding its
 depth and breadth through more and better lending products.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 As EDP2 approaches its closing date on 31 December 2014, implementation has accelerated despite the extremely challenging political and economic
 environment. The factors that negatively affected the credit decisions by Ukrainian exporting enterprises in the first 11 months of CY2014 include:
 continuing economic contraction, political crisis and armed conflict in the industrial heartland, currency devaluation, and trade difficulties with a major
 export destination (Russia). In the first quarter of 2014, the outlook for the economy became very uncertain due to acute political crisis. While the
 peaceful presidential elections and signing of Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with EU provide positive signals for exporting
 enterprises, on the other hand, conflict in eastern regions has deepened during 2-3Q2014, further disrupting logistics and trade. Still, Ukreximbank and
 other Participating Financial Institutions continued lending to eligible exporting enterprises, with total disbursement under the Project reaching
 USD285mln (>95% of WB financing for the Project) as of December 9, 2014. Ukreximbank and two other current PFIs remain adequately capitalized
 and fully comply with the prudential norms. Overall, the Project is on track to achieving its stated Developmental Objectives.

               End 2014 data will be available by February 2015, and will be reported in the ICR. It can be expected that, due to severe economic and
               political distress experiences by Ukraine in 2014 the Return on Assets may fall below 1%.
