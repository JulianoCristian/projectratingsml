                         (i) Serve as a catalyst to support export and real sector growth in Ukraine during the EDP 2 implementation period (2006-2011) and beyond, by providing medium and
                         long-term working capital and investment finance to Ukrainian private exporting enterprises. (ii) Further improve the ability of the Ukrainian banking sector to provide
                         financial resources to the enterprise sector, through further development of intermediation, by expanding its depth and breadth through more and better lending
                         products.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The EDP2 Project continues to be implemented in a satisfactory manner, although the speed of implementation is somewhat hampered by difficult economic environment,
                         characterized by negative economic growth, nearly flat credit growth of banking system, and industrial and export contraction. Disbursement under the Additional Financing to EDP2
                         ($150 million) reached $36.68 million by the end of CY13 (24% of the AF amount). Ukrexim Bank remains adequately capitalized and is performing well both as the Project
                         implementing agency and direct lender to exporting enterprises. Overall, the Project continues to be achieving its stated Developmental Objectives.
