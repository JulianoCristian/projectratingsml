IndependentAuditor's Report
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Joint Stock Company "The State Export-Import Bank of
Ukraine"
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Joint Stock Company "The State
Export-Import Bank of Ukraine" and its subsidiaries (the "Group"), which comprise the consolidated
statement of financial position (consolidated balance sheet) as at 31 December 2014 and the consolidated
statement of profit and loss (consolidated income statement), consolidated statement of comprehensive
income, consolidated statement of changes in equity (consolidated statement of equity) and consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes comprising a summary of significant accounting
policies and other explanatory information.
Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
L             whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's
preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Group as at 31 December 2014, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year
then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Emphasis of Matter
We draw your attention to Note 23 and Note 33 to the consolidated financial statements. The operations of the
Group, and those of other entities in Ukraine, have been affected and may continue to be affected for the
foreseeable future by the continuing political and economic uncertainties in Ukrat*e. Our opinion is not
qualified in respect of this matter.

accounting policies, for example investment securities available-for-sale, investment securities designated at fair value
through profit or loss, buildings and investment property have been measured at fair value.
These annual consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of Ukrainian hryvnia ("UAH") unless
otherwise indicated.
Going concern. Management prepared these consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis. Going
concern assumption is supported by strong liquidity position of the Bank, support provided by the government (refer to

Notes to the ConsolId    Financial SeTruent: t, the year ended 31 December 2014
3.       Summary of accounting policies
Changes in accounting policies
The following new standards and interpretations becaie effective for the Bank from 1 January 2014:
"Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" - Amendments to IAS 32 (issued in December 2011 and
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1January 2014). The amendment added application guidance to
lAS 32 to address inconsistencies identified in applying some of the offsetting criteria. This includes clarifying the
meaning of 'currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off' and that some gross settlement systems may be
considered equivalent to net settlement. The standard clarified that a qualifying right of set off (a) must not be
contingent on a future event and (b) must be legally enforceable in all of the following circumstances: (i) in the normal
course of business, (ii) the event of default and (iii) the event of insolvency or bankruptcy. The amended standard did
not have a material impact on the Bank's financial statements.
"Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 - Investment entities" (issued on 31 October 2012 and effective
for annual periods beginning 1January2014). The amendment introduced a definition of an investment entity as an
entity that (i) obtains funds from investors for the purpose of providing them with investment management services, (ii)
commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for capital appreciation or investment income
and (iii) measures and evaluates its investments on a fair value basis. An investment entity is required to account for its
subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss, and to consolidate only those subsidiaries that provide services that are
related to the entity's investment activities. IFRS 12 was amended to introduce new disclosures, including any significant
judgements made in determining whether an entity is an investment entity and information about financial or other
support to an unconsolidated subsidiary, whether intended or already provided to the subsidiary. The amended standard
did not have a material impact on the Bank's financial statements.
IFRIC 21 - "Levies" (issued on 20 May 2013 and effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2014). The
interpretation clarifies the accounting for an obligation to pay a levy that is not income tax. The obligating event that
gives rise to a liability is the event identified by the legislation that triggers the obligation to pay the levy. The fact that an
entity is economically compelled to continue operating in a future period, or prepares its financial statements under the
going concern assumption, does not create an obligation. The same recognition principles apply in interim and annual
financial statements. The application of the interpretation to liabilities arising from emissions trading schemes is
optional. The interpretation did not have a material impact on the Bank's financial statements.
Amendments to LAS 36 - "Recoverable amount disclosures for non-fiancial assets" (issued in May 2013 and
effective for annual periods beginning 1January 2014; earlier application is permitted if IFRS 13 is applied for
the same accounting and comparative period). The amendments remove the requirement to disclose the recoverable
amount when a CGU contains goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets but there has been no impairment. The
amended standard did not have a material impact on the Bank's financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 39 - 'Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting" (issued in June
2013 and effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2014). The amendments allow hedge accounting to
continue in a situation where a derivative, which has been designated as a hedging instrument, is novated (i.e. parties
have agreed to replace their original counterparty with a new one) to effect clearing with a central counterparty as a
result of laws or regulation, if specific conditions are met. The amended standard is not relevant for the Bank.
Basis of consolidation
Consolidated financial statements. Subsidiaries are those investees, including structured entities, that the Bank
controls because the Bank (i) has power to direct relevant activities of the investees that significantly affect their returns,
(ii) has exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investees, and (iii) has the ability to use its
power over the investees to affect the amount of investor's returns. The existence and effect of substantive rights,
including substantive potential voting rights, are considered when assessing whether the Bank has power over another
entity. For a right to be substantive, the holder must have practical ability to exercise that right when decisions about the
direction of the relevant activities of the investee need to be made. The Bank may have power over an investee even
when it holds less than majority of voting power in an investee. In such a case, the Bank assesses the size of its voting
rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders to determine if it has de-facto power over
the investee. Protective rights of other investors, such as those that relate to fundamental changes of investee's activities
or apply only in exceptional circumstances, do not prevent the Bank from controlling an investee. Subsidiaries are
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Bank, and are deconsolidated from the date on which
control ceases.

(t/iosaued of Urainin hiynia, inlns obrse stated)
The acquisiton method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. Identifiable assets acquired
and liabilitiesnd d contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their fair values at the
acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.
The Bank measures non-controlling interest that represents present ownership interest and entitles the holder to a
proportionate share of net assets in the event of liquidation on a transaction by transaction basis, either at: (a) fair value,
or (b) the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of net assets of the acquiree. Non-controlling interests that are
not present ownership interests are measured at fair value.
Goodwill is measured by deducting the net assets of the acquiree from the aggregate of the consideration transferred for
the acquiree, the amount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree and fair value of an interest in the acquiree held
immediately before the acquisition date, Any negative amount ("negative goodwill") is recognised in profit or loss, after
management reassesses whether it identified all the assets acquired and all liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed,
and reviews appropriateness of their measurement.
The consideration transferred for the acquiree is measured at the fair value of the assets given up, equity instruments
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed, including fair value of assets or liabilities from contingent consideration
arrangements, but excludes acquisition related costs such as advisory, legal, valuation and similar professional services.
Transaction costs incurred for issuing equity instruments are deducted from equity; transaction costs incurred for issuing
debt are deducted from its carrying amount and all other transaction costs associated with the acquisition are expensed.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated;
unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the cost cannot be recovered. The Bank and all of its subsidiaries use uniform
accounting policies consistent with the Bank's policies.
Non-controlling interest is that part of the net results and of the equity of a subsidiary attributable to interests which are
not owned, directly or indirectly, by the Bank. Non-controlling interest forms a separate component of the Bank's
equity.
Financial assets
Initial recognition
Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans
and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. When financial assets
are initially recognised, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or
loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The Bank determines the classification of its financial assets upon initial
recognition, and subsequently can reclassify financial assets in certain cases as described below.
Date of recognition
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date i.e. the date that the Bank
commits itself to purchase an asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require
delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulation or convennon in the market place.
Finandal assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets, designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception, are included in the item 'Investment
Securities' of the statement of financial position (balance sheet). Derivatives are classified as held for trading unless they
are designated and effective hedging instruments. Gains or losses on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss (the consolidated income statement).
Financial assets classified in this category are designated by management on initial recognition when the following
criteria are met:
-    The designation eliminates or significantly reduces the inconsistent treatment that would otherwise arise from
measuring the assets or liabilities or recognising gans or losses on them on a different basis; or
-    The assets are part of a group of financial assets, financial liabilities or both which are managed and their
performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or
investment strategy.

"The State Export-Import Bank of Ukraine"
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2014
(thouainds of Ukraisian bgnia, alers othernvse stated)
If the Bank is unable to determine the value of the embedded derivative separately at the acquisition date or at the end
of the next financial reporting period, these financial assets are accounted at fair value with changes through profit or
loss.
He/d-to-maturdy investments
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified as held-to-maturity
when the Bank has the intention and ability to hold them to maturity. Investments intended to be held for an undefined
period are not included in this classification. Held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost. Gains and
losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss (the consolidated income statement) when the
investments are impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an
active market. These loans and receivables are not entered into with the intention of either immediate or short-term
resale and are not classified as trading securities or designated as investment securities available-for-sale. Such assets are
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated
statement of profit and loss (the consolidated income statement) when the loans and receivables are derecognised or
impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are
not classified in any of the three preceding categories. After initial recognition available-for sale financial assets are
measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised in other comprehensive income until the investment is
derecognised or until the investment is determined to be impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously
reported in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit and loss (the consolidated
income statement). However, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the consolidated
statement of profit and loss (the consolidated income statement).
Investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and if their fair value
cannot be reliably measured are accounted at cost less any allowance for impairment.
Determination offair value
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value for financial instruments traded in active market at the reporting date is based on publicly available
market prices or direct dealer price quotations (bid price for long positions and ask price for short positions), without
any deduction for transaction costs.
For all other financial instruments not listed in an active market, the fair value is determined by using appropriate
valuation techniques. Valuation techniques include net present value techniques, comparison to similar instruments for
which market observable prices exist, options pricing models and other relevant valuation models.
Offsehilng
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial
position only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to
either settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Such a right of set off (a) must
not be contingent on a future event and (b) must be legally enforceable in all of the following circumstances: (i) in the
normal course of business, (ti) the event of default and (iii) the event of insolvency or bankruptcy.
Rvclassl#ication off6nancial assets
If a non-derivative financial asset classified as held for trading ceases to be held for the purpose of selling in the near
term, it may be reclassified out of the fair value through profit or loss category into one of the following:

- a financial asset that would have met the definition of loans and receivables above may be reclassified to loans
and receivables category if the Bank has the intention and ability to hold it for the foreseeable future or until
maturity;
-    other financial assets originally held for trading may be reclassified to available-for-sale or held to maturity
categories only in exceptional circumstances.
A financial asset classified as available- for-sale that would have met the definition of loans and receivables may be
reclassified to loans and receivables category if the Bank has the intention and ability to hold it for the foreseeable future
or until maturity.
Financial assets are reclassified at their fair value on the date of reclassification. Any gain or loss already recognised in
profit or loss (consolidated income statement) is not reversed. The fair value of the financial asset on the date of
reclassification becomes its new cost or amortised cost, as appropriate.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, amounts due from the NBU, excluding restricted mandatory
reserves, amounts due from credit institutions and reverse repurchase agreements that mature within ninety days of the
date of origination and are free from contractual encumbrances, and are not impaired individually.
Precious metals
Gold and other precious metals are recorded at fair value, which approximate the NBU bid prices and are quoted at a
discount to London Bullion Market rates. Changes in the NBU bid prices are recorded as revaluation differences from
precious metals in the consolidated statement of profit and loss (the consolidated income statement).
Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending
Sale and repurchase agreements ("repos") are treated as secured financing transactions. Securities sold under sale and
repurchase agreements are retained in the consolidated statement of financial position (the consolidated balance sheet)
and in case the transferee has the right by contract or custom to sell or repledge them, reclassified as securities pledged
under sale and repurchase agreements. The corresponding liability is presented within amounts due to credit institutions,
the NBU or customers. Securities purchased under agreements to resell ("reverse repo") are recorded as cash and cash
equivalents, amounts due from credit institutions or loans to customers as appropriate. The difference between sale and
repurchase price is treated as interest and is accrued over the life of repo agreements using the effective interest method.
Securities lent to counterparties are retained in the consolidated financial statements. Securities borrowed are not
recorded in the consolidated financial statements, unless they are sold to third parties, in which case the purchase and
sale are recorded within gains less losses from trading securities in the consolidated statement of profit and loss (the
consolidated income statement). The obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability.
Promissory notes
Promissory notes purchased are included in available-for-sale investment securities, or in amounts due from credit
mnsottuons or in loans to customers, depending on their substance and are accounted for in accordance with the
accounting policies for these categories of assets.
Derivative financial instruments
In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into derivative financial instruments including swaps in the foreign
exchange market. Such financial instruments are held for trading and are recorded at fair value. The fair values are
derived based on quoted market prices or valuation models that take into account current and contractual market
prices of the underlying instruments and any other relevant factors. Derivatives are carried as assets when their fair value
is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Gains and losses resulting from these instruments are
included in the consolidated statement of profit and loss (the consolidated income statement) as net gains/ (losses) from
foreign currencies and precious metals dealing.

(thousands of Ukrainian bryonia, unless othenvise stated)
De iatives embedded in other financial instruments are treated as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value if their
economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract, and the host contract is not itself
held for trading or designated at fair value through profit or loss.
Borrowings
1stued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities, where the substance of the contractual
arrangement results in the Bank having an obligation either to deliver cash or another financial asset to the holder, or to
satisfy the obligation other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number
of own equity instruments. Such instruments include amounts due to the National Bank of Ukraine, amounts due to
credit institutions, amounts due to customers, debt securities issued, Eurobonds issued and subordinated debt. After
initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains
and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss (the consolidated income statement) when the
borrowings are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
If the Bank purchases its own debt, it is removed from the consolidated statement of financial position (the consolidated
balance sheet) and the difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the consideration paid is recognised in
the consolidated statement of profit and loss (the consolidated income statement).
Leases
i.      Finance - Bank as a lessor
The Bank recognises lease receivables at value equal to the net investment in the lease, starting from the date of
commencement of the lease term. Finance income is recognised based on a constant periodic rate of return on the net
investment outstanding. Initial direct costs are included in the initial measurement of the lease receivables.
iK.     Operating - Bank as a lessee
Leases of assets under which the risks and rewards of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor are classified as
operating leases. Lease payments under an operating lease are recognised as expenses on a straight-line basis over the
lease term and included into other operating expenses.
iii.    Operating - Bank as a lessor
The Bank presents assets subject to operating leases in the consolidated statement of financial position (the consolidated
balance sheet) according to the nature of the asset. Lease income from operating leases is recognised in the consolidated
statement of profit and loss (the consolidated income statement) on a straight-line basis over the lease term as other
income. The aggregate cost of incentives provided to lessees is recognised as a reduction of rental income over the lease
term on a straight-line basis. Initial direct costs incurred specifically to earn revenues from an operating lease are added
to the carrying amount of the leased asset.
Impairment of financial assets
The Bank assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of
financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired only if there is objective evidence
of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred
loss event) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the
group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may include indications that the
borrower or a group of borrowers is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or
principal payments, an increased probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation and where
observable data indicates that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in
arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
Amounts due from credit institutions and loans to customers
For amounts due from credit institutions and loans to customers carried at amortised cost, the Bank first assesses
individually whether objective evidence of impairment exists for financial assets that are individually significant, or
collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If the Bank determines that no objective evidence of
impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asser, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group
of financial assets with similar credit risks characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. Assets that are
individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to be, recognised are not
included in a collective assessment of impairment.

(thousands of UkZaiau, bria, unless othernvie stated)
If there is an objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the
difference between the assets' carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding furute
expected credit losses that have not yet been incurred). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of
an impairment allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and
loss (the consolidated income statement). Interest income continues to be accrued on the reduced carrying amount
based on the original effective interest rate of the asset. Loans together with the associated impairment allowance are
written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery and all collateral has been realised or has been
transferred to the Bank. If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or decreases
because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is
increased or reduced by adjusting the impairment allowance account. If a future write-off is later recovered, the recovery
is credited to the consolidated statement of profit and loss (the consolidated income statement).
The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.
If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest
rate. The calculation of the present value of the estimated future cash flows of a collateralised financial asset reflects the
cash flows that may result from foreclosure less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether or not foreclosure
is probable.
For the purpose of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial assets are grouped on the basis of the Bank's internal
credit grading system  that considers credit risk characteristics such as asset type, industry, geographical location,
collateral type, past-due status and other relevant factors.
Future cash flows on a group of financial assets that are collectively evaluated for impairment are estimated on the basis
of historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics similar to those in the group. Historical loss
experience is adjusted on the basis of current observable data to reflect the effects of current conditions that did not
affect the years on which the historical loss experience is based and to remove the effects of conditions in the historical
period that do not exist currently. Estimates of changes in future cash flows reflect, and are correlated with changes in
related observable data from year to year (such as changes in unemployment rates, property prices, commodity prices,
payment status, or other factors that are indicative of incurred losses in the group or their magnitude). The methodology
and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss
estimates and actual loss experience.
Held-to-malomity investments
For held-to-maturity investments the Bank assesses individually whether there is objective evidence of impairment. If
there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the
difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows. The carrying
amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss
(the consolidated income statement).
If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss decreases because of an event occurring after the
impairment was recognised, any amounts formerly charged are credited to the consolidated statement of profit and loss
(the consolidated income statement).
Availablefor-sale finanial assets
For available-for-sale financial assets, the Bank assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an
investment or a group of investments is impaired.
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, objective evidence would include a significant or
prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its acquisition cost. Where there is evidence of impairment,
the cumulative loss - measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any
impairment loss on that investment previously recognised in the consolidated income statement - is reclassified from
other comprehensive income and recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss (the consolidated income
statement). Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed through the consolidated statement of profit and
loss (the consolidated income statement); increases in their fair value after impairment are recognised directly in other
comprehensive income.

No to the  <noldatedl inancil Stateents for the year ended 31 December 2014
In the case of debt instruments classified as available-for-sale, impairment is assessed based on the same criteria as
amounts due froni credit institutions and loans to customers. Future interest income is based on the reduced carrying
amount and is accrued using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the
impairment loss. The interest income is recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss (the consolidated
income statement). If, in a subsequent year the fair value of a debt instrument increases and the increase is objectively
related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss
(the consolidated income statement), the impairment loss is reversed through the consolidated statement of profit and
loss (the consolidated income statement).
Renegotiated loans
Where possible, the Bank seeks to renegotiate loans rather than to take possession of collateral. This may involve
extending the payment arrangements and the agreement of new loan conditions.
The accounting treatment of such renegotiation is as follows:
-   If the currency of the loan has been changed the old loan is derecognised and a new loan is recognised.
-   If the loan renegotiation is not caused by the financial difficulties of the borrower but the cash flows were
renegotiated on favourable terms for the borrower: the loan is not recognised as impaired.
-   If the loan is impaired after renegotiation, the Bank uses the original effective interest rate in respect of new
cash flows to estimate the recoverable amount of the loan. The difference between the recalculated present
value of the new cash flows taking into account collateral and the carrying amount before renegotiation is
included in the impairment charges for the period.
Once the terms have been renegotiated, the loan is no longer considered past due. Management continuously reviews
renegotiated loans to ensure that all criteria are met and that future payments are likely to be met. The loans continue to
be subject to an individual or collective impairment assessment, calculated using the loan's original or current effective
interest rate.
Asset management
The Bank acts as an asset manager in respect of certain funds related to construction financing. The Bank acts as an
agent in these arrangements and its responsibility is limited to fiduciary duties, which are commonly applied in the asset
management industry. Accordingly, the Bank does not incur any liability relating to the funds under management. These
funds under management do not comprise legal entities under the laws of Ukraine and the management of these funds is
administered by the Bank. The funds are held in current accounts in the Bank until such time as they are invested in
eligible assets which meet the investment requirements of these funds.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
Finandal assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is
derecognised where:
-   the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;
-   the Bank has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset, or retained the right to receive cash
flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party
under a 'pass-through' arrangement; and
-   the Bank either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the
asset.
Where the Bank has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the
extent of the Bank's continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee
over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum
amount of consideration that the Bank could be required to repay.

(thousands of Ukrainian byoia, unlesi othenvise slted
Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written and/or purchased option (including a cash-settled option or
similar provision) on the transferred asset, the extent of the Bank's continuing involvement is the amount of the
transferred asset that the Bank may repurchase, except that in the case of a written put option (including a cash-settled
option or similar provision) on an asset measured at fair value, the extent of the Bank's continuing involvement is
limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option exercise price.
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the
terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of
the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss (the consolidated income statement).
Financial guarantees
In the ordinary course of business, the Bank gives financial guarantees, consisting of letters of credit, guarantees and
avals. Financial guarantees are initially recognised in the consolidated financial statements at fair value, in 'Other
liabilities', being the premium received. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Bank's liability under each guarantee is
measured at the higher of the amortised premium and the best estimate of expenditure required settling any financial
obligation arising as a result of the guarantee.
Any increase in the liability relating to financial guarantees is taken to the consolidated statement of profit and loss (the
consolidated income statement). The premium received is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss
(the consolidated income statement) on a straight-line basis over the life of the guarantee.
Commitments to provide a loan are initially recognised at their fair value, which is normally evidenced by the amount of
fees received. This amount is amortised on a straight line basis over the life of the commitment, except for commitments
to originate loans if it is probable that the Bank will enter into a specific lending arrangement and does not expect to sell
the resulting loan shortly after origination; such loan commitment fees are deferred and included in the carrying value of
the loan on initial recognition. At the end of each reporting period, the commitments are measured at the higher of (i)
the remaining unamortised balance of the amount at initial recognition and (ii) the best estimate of expenditure required
to settle the commitment at the end of each reporting period.
Taxation
The current income tax charge is calculated in accordance with Ukrainian taxation regulations.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method. Deferred
income taxes are provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
carrying values for financial reporting purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition
of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are
expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint
ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Ukraine also has various operating taxes, which are assessed on the Bank's activities. These taxes are recorded in other
operating expenses in the consolidated statement of profit and loss (the consolidated income statement).

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the vear ended 31 Decemb<er 2014
(thouanmds of Ukrainian bryeia, unless otheneise stated)
Property and equipment
Equipment is carried at cost or cost restated for effects of hyperinflation (for assets acquired prior to 31 December
2000), excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment.
Buildings are measured at fair value less depreciation and impairment charged subsequent to the date of the revaluation.
The carrying values of equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Following initial recogrnon at cost, buildings and land are subsequently carried at their revalued amount, which is the
fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated
impairment losses. Valuations are performed frequently enough to ensure that the fair value of a revalued asset does not
differ materially from its carrying amount,
Any revaluation surplus is credited to the property revaluation reserve which is included in other comprehensive income,
except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in the consolidated
statement of profit and loss (the consolidated income statement), in which case the increase is recognised in the
consolidated statement of profit and loss (the consolidated income statement). A revaluation deficit is recognised in the
consolidated income statement, except that a deficit directly offsetting a previous surplus on the same asset is directly
offset against the surplus in the property revaluation reserve.
An annual transfer from the property revaluation reserve to retained earnings is made for the difference between
depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the assets and depreciation based on the assets' original cost.
Specifically, the accumulated depreciation at the revaluation date is subtracted from the original (revalued) cost of
property, plant and equipment, and the resulting net carrying amount is revalued to its fair value. The revalued amount
of an asset as at the revaluation date equals its fair value and the accumulated depreciation equals zero. Upon disposal,
any revaluation of property relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings/(accumulated
deficit).
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the
following estimated useful lives:
Years
Buildings                                                           15-75 years
Furniture and other assets                                          2-25 years
Equipment and computers                                             2-15 years
Motor vehicles                                                      5 years
Leasehold improvements (refurbishment costs for premises under lease contract) are depreciated over a period not
exceeding the leasing period.
The asset's residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed and adjusted as appropriate, at each financial year-end.
Costs related to repairs and renewals are charged when incurred and included in other operating expenses unless they
qualify for capitalisation.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets include acquired computer software and licences. Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on
initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite
or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic lives of five to ten years and
assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. Amortisation periods
and methods for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year-end.
Investment property
Investment property is property held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation and which is not occupied by the
Bank.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statemenrs for the year ended 31 December 2014
(thousands of Ukramvan bryimiia, Inlex othense stated)
Investment property is initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs, and subsequently re-measured at fair value
based on its marker value. Market value of the Bank's investment property is obtained from reports of independent
appraisers, who hold a recognised and relevant professional qualification and who have recent experience in valuation of
property in similar locations and categories.
Assets held for sale
The Bank classifies a non-current asset as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale
transaction rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case, the non-current asset must be available for
immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets and the
prospective sale is deemed feasible.
The prospective sale is deemed feasible if the Bank's management is committed to a plan to sell the non-current asset
and an active program to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated. Furthermore, the non-current asset
must have been actively marketed for a sale at price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and the sale
should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification of the
non-current asset as held for sale.
Provision
Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, and it is
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a
reliable estimate of the amount of obligation can be made.
Retirement and other benefit obligations
The Bank has contribution pension plan separate from the State pension system of Ukraine, which requires current
contributions by the employer calculated as a percentage of current gross salary payments; such expense is charged in the
period the related salaries are earned. The contribution payable to a contribution plan is in proportion to the services
rendered to the Bank by the employees, age of employees and years working for the Bank and is recorded as an expense
under "Personnel expenses". Unpaid contributions are recorded as a liability. The Bank has no other post-retirement
benefits or significant other compensated benefits requiring accrual.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Share capital contributions received before 31 December 2000 are recognised at
cost in the consolidated statement of financial position (consolidated balance sheet) as at 31 December 2014 and 31
December 2013.
Segment reporting
The Bank's segmental reporting is based on the following operating segments: Retail banking, Corporate banking and
Financial institutions and investments.
Contingencies
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position (the consolidated balance
sheet) but are disclosed unless the possibility of any future outflow is considered remote. A contingent asset is not
recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position (the consolidated balance sheet) but disclosed when an
inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Recognition of income and expense
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Bank and the revenue
can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Interest and similar income and e:xpense
For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost and interest bearing securities classified as trading or available-
for-sale, interest income or expense is recorded at the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts
estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period,
where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. The calculation takes into
account all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment options) and includes any fees or

(thousands of Ukrainian brvnia, unless othenvise stated)
incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and are an integral part of the effective interest rate, but
not future credit losses. The carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability is adjusted if the Bank revises its
estimates of payments or receipts. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original effective interest rate
and the change in carrying amount is recorded as interest income or expense.
Once the recorded value of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been reduced due to an impairment
loss, interest income continues to be recognised using the original effective interest rate applied to the new carrying
amount.
Comwission income
The Bank earns fee and commission income from the diverse range of services it provides to its customers. Fee income
can be divided into the following two categories:
- Fee incone earned/rom services that at provided over a certain period of time
Fees arising for the provision of services over a period of time are accrued over that period. These fees include
comrmssion income and asset management, custody and other management and advisory fees. Loan commitment fees
for loans that are likely to be drawn down and other credit related fees are deferred (together with any incremental costs)
and recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest rate on the loan.
Fee incoeefrom providing transaction services
Fees arising from negotiating or participating in the negotiation of a transaction for a third party - such as the
arrangement of the acquisition of shares or other securities or the purchase or sale of businesses - are recognised on
completion of the underlying transaction. Fees or components of fees that are linked to a certain performance are
recognised after fulfilling the corresponding criteria.
Dividend income
Revenue is recognised when the Bank's right to receive the payment is established.
Foreign currency translation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Ukrainian hryvia ("UAH"), which is the Bank's functional and
presentation currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency, converted at
the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. Gains and losses
resulting from the translation of foreign currency transacuons are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and
loss (the consolidated income statement) as gains less losses from foreign currencies- translation differences. Non-
monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates
as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated
using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Differences between the contractual exchange rate of a transaction in a foreign currency and the NBU exchange rate on
the date of the transaction are included in gains less losses from dealing in foreign currencies. The official NBU
exchange rates at 31 December 2014 and 2013 were UAH 15.7686 and UAH 7.9930 to 1 US dollar and UAH 19.2329
and UAH 11.0415 to I euro, respectively.
Future changes in accounting policies
Standards and inteipretations itsued but not_yet effective
Certain new standards and interpretations have been issued that are mandatory for the annual periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2015 or later, and which the Bank has not early adopted.

annual periods beginning on or after 1january 2018). Key features of the new standard are:

"The State Export -Import Bank of Ukraine"
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2014
(thousands of Ukrainian bryifa, miless othenvise stated)
*  Financial assets are required to be classified into three measurement catcgories those to be measured subsequently at
amortised cost, those to be measured subsequently at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and
those to be measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL).
* Classification for debt instruments is driven by the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and
whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). If a debt instrument is
held to collect, it may be carried at amortised cost if it also meets the SPPI requirement. Debt instruments that meet the
SPPI requirement that are held in a portfolio where an entity both holds to collect assets' cash flows and sells assets may
be classified as FVOCI. Financial assets that do not contain cash flows that are SPPI must be measured at FVPL (for
example, derivatives). Embedded derivatives are no longer separated from  financial assets but will be included in
assessing the SPPI condition.
* Investments in equity instruments are always measured at fair value. However, management can make an irrevocable
election to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income, provided the instrument is not held for trading.
If the equity instrument is held for trading, changes in fair value are presented in profit or loss.
* Most of the requirements in IAS 39 for classification and measurement of financial liabilities were carried forward
unchanged to IFRS 9. The key change is that an entity will be required to present the effects of changes in own credit
risk of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss in other comprehensive income.
* IFRS 9 introduces a new model for the recognition of impairment losses - the expected credit losses (ECL) model.
There is a 'three stage' approach which is based on the change in credit quality of financial assets since initial recognition.
In practice, the new rules mean that entities will have to record an immediate loss equal to the 12-month ECL on initial
recognition of financial assets that are not credit impaired (or lifetime ECL for trade receivables). Where there has been
a significant increase in credit risk, impairment is measured using lifetime ECL rather than 12-month ECL. The model
includes operational simplifications for lease and trade receivables.
*  Hedge accounting requirements were amended to align accounting more closely with risk management. The standard
provides entities with an accounting policy choice between applying the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 and
continuing to apply IAS 39 to all hedges because the standard currently does not address accounting for macro hedging
The Bank is currently assessing the impact of the new standard on its financial statements.
Amendments to LAS 19 - "Defbned beneft plans: Employee contributions" (issued in November 2013 and
effective for annual periods beginning I July 2014). The amendment allows entities to recognise employee
contributions as a reduction in the service cost in the period in which the related employee service is rendered, instead of
attributing the contributions to the periods of service, if the amount of the employee contributions is independent of the
number of years of service. The amendment is not expected to have any material impact on the Bank's financial
statements.
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012 (issued in December 2013 and effective for annual periods beginning on
or after 1July2014, unless otherwise stated below). The improvements consist of changes to seven standards. IFRS 2
was amended to clarify the definition of a 'vesting condition' and to define separately 'performance condition' and
'service condition'; The amendment is effective for share-based payment transactions for which the grant date is on or
after 1 July 2014. IFRS 3 was amended to clarify that (1) an obligation to pay contingent consideration which meets the
definition of a financial instrument is classified as a financial liability or as equity, on the basis of the definitions in IAS
32, and (2) all non-equity contingent consideration, both financial and non-financial, is measured at fair value at each
reporting date, with changes in fair value recognised in profit and loss. Amendments to IFRS 3 are effective for business
combinations where the acquisition date is on or after 1 July 2014. IFRS 8 was amended to require (1) disclosure of the
judgements made by management in aggregating operating segments, including a description of the segments which
have been aggregated and the economic indicators which have been assessed in determining that the aggregated
segments share similar economic characteristics, and (2) a reconciliation of segment assets to the entity's assets when
segment assets are reported. The basis for conclusions on IFRS 13 was amended to clarify that deletion of certain
paragraphs in IAS 39 upon publishing of IFRS 13 was not made with an intention to remove the ability to measure
short-term receivables and payables at invoice amount where the impact of discounting is immaterial. IAS 16 and IAS 38
were amended to clarify how the gross carrying amount and the accumulated depreciation are treated where an entity
uses the revaluation model. IAS 24 was amended to include, as a related party, an entity that provides key management
personnel services to the reporting entity or to the parent of the reporting entity ('the management entity), and to
require to disclose the amounts charged to the reporting entity by the management entity for services provided. The
Bank is currently assessing the impact of the amendments on its financial statements.
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2013 (issued in December 2013 and effective for annual periods beginning on
or after 1 July 2014). The improvements consist of changes to four standards. The basis for conclusions on IFRS 1 is
amended to clarify that, where a new version of a standard is not yet mandatory but is available for early adoption; a
first-time adopter can use either the old or the new version, provided the same standard is applied in all periods
presented. IS 3 was amended to clarify that it does not apply to the accounting for the formation of any joint

arrangement under IFRS 11. The amendment also clanfies that the scope exemption only applies in the financial
statements of the joint arrangement itself. The amendment of IFRS 13 clarifies that the portfolio exception in IFRS 13,
which allows an entity to measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on a net basis,
applies to all contracts (including contracts to buy or sell non-financial items) that are within the scope of IAS 39 or
IFRS 9. iAS 40 was amended to clarify that IAS 40 and IFRS 3 are not mutually exclusive. The guidance in IAS 40
assists preparers to distinguish between investment property and owner-occupied property. Preparers also need to refer
to the guidance in IFRS 3 to determine whether the acquisition of an investment property is a business combination.
The Bank is currently assessing the impact of the amendments on its financial statements.
Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations - Amendments to IFRS 11 (issued on 6 May 2014
and effective for the periods beginning on or after 1January 2016). This amendment adds new guidance on how to
account for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation that constitutes a business. The Bank is currently assessing
the impact of the amendments on its financial statements.
Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation - Amendments to IS 16 and IS 38
(issued on 12 May 2014 and effective for the periods beginning on or after 1January 2016). In this amendment,
the IASB has clarified that the use of revenue-based methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset is not appropriate
because revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset generally reflects factors other than the
consumption of the economic benefits embodied in the asset. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of the
amendments on its financial statements.
IFRS 13, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (issued on 28 May 2014 and effective for the periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2017). The new standard introduces the core principle that revenue must be
recognised when the goods or services are transferred to the customer, at the transaction price. Any bundled goods or
services that are distinct must be separately recognised, and any discounts or rebates on the contract price must generally
be allocated to the separate elements. When the consideration varies for any reason, minimum amounts must be
recognised if they are not at significant risk of reversal. Costs incurred to secure contracts with customers have to be
capitalised and amortised over the period when the benefits of the contract are consumed. The Bank is currently
assessing the impact of the new standard on its financial statements.
Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements - Amendments to IAS 27 (issued on 12 August 2014 and
effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2016). The amendments will allow entities to use the equity
method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in their separate financial statements.
The Bank is currently assessing the impact of the amendments on its separate financial statements.
Sale or Contribution ofAssets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture - Amendments to IFRS
10 and AS 28 (issued on 11 September 2014 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January
2016). These amendments address an inconsistency between the requirements in IFRS 10 and those in IAS 28 in dealing
with the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture. The main consequence of
the amendments is that a full gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves a business. A partial gain or loss is
recognised when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business, even if these assets are held by a
subsidiary. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of the amendments on its financial statements.
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 (issued on 25 September 2014 and effective for annual periods beginning
on or after 1 January 2016). The amendments impact 4 standards. IFRS 5 was amended to clarify that change in the
manner of disposal (reclassification from "held for sale" to "held for distribution" or vice versa) does not constitute a
change to a plan of sale or distribution, and does not have to be accounted for as such. The amendment to IFRS 7 adds
guidance to help management determine whether the terms of an arrangement to service a financial asset which has been
transferred constitute continuing involvement, for the purposes of disclosures required by IFRS 7. The amendment also
clarifies that the offsetting disclosures of IFRS 7 are not specifically required for all interim periods, unless required by
LAS 34. The amendment to IAS 19 clarifies that for post-employment benefit obligations, the decisions regarding
discount rate, existence of deep market in high-quality corporate bonds, or which government bonds to use as a basis,
should be based on the currency that the liabilities are denominated in, and not the country where they arise. LAS 34 will
require a cross reference from the interim financial statements to the location of "information disclosed elsewhere in the
interim financial report". The Bank is currently assessing the impact of the amendments on its financial statements.
Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IS 1 (issued in December 2014 and effective for annual periods on or
after IJanuay 2016). The Standard was amended to clarify the concept of materiality and explains that an entity need
not provide a specific disclosure required by an IFRS if the information resulting from that disclosure is not material,
even if the IFRS contains a list of specific requirements or describes them as minimum requirements. The Standard also
provides new guidance on subtotals in financial statements, in particular, such subtotals (a) should be comprised of line
items made up of amounts recognised and measured in accordance with TFRS; (b) be presented and labelled in a manner
that makes the line items that constitute the subtotal clear and understandable; (c) be consistent from period to period;
and (d) not be displayed with more prominence than the subtotals and totals required by IFRS standards.

Investment Entities; Applying the Consolidation E.xceprion Amendment to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and LAS 28
(issued in December 2014 and efective for annual periods on or after 1January 2016). The Standard was amended
to clarify that an investment entity should measure at fair value through profit or loss all of its subsidiaries that are
themselves investment entities. In addition, the exemption from preparing consolidated financial statements if the
entity's ultimate or any intermediate parent produces consolidated financial statements available for public use was
amended to clarify that the exemption applies regardless whether the subsidiaries are consolidated or are measured at fair
value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 10 in such ultimate or any intermediate parent's financial
statements.
Other new standards are not relevant for the Bank. Unless otherwise described above, the new standards and
interpretations are not expected to affect significantly the Bank's consolidated financial statements.
4.       Significant accounting judgements and estimates
In the process of applying the Bank's accounting policies, management has used its judgement and made estimates in
determining the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. The most significant use of judgements
and estimates are as follows:
Allowance for impairment of loans and receivables
The Bank regularly reviews its loans and receivables to assess impairment. The Bank uses its judgement to estimate the
amount of any impairment loss in cases where a borrower is in financial difficulties and there is little available historical
data relating to similar borrowers. Similarly, the Bank estimates changes in future cash flows based on the observable
data indicating that there has been an adverse change in the payment status of borrowers in a group, or national or local
economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets in the group. A 10% increase or decrease in actual loss
experience compared to the loss estimates used would result in an increase or decrease in loan impairment losses of
UAH 844.5 million and UAH 2,572.7 million (2013: UAH 418.7 million and UAH 1,020.2 million), respectively. The
Bank increased or decreased by 10% probability of default (PD) for each individual customer and calculated deviation
(increase or decrease) of the impairment provision compared to the actual provision in the calculation of the above
provision sensitivity to changes in actual loss experience compared to the estimated. Management uses estimates based
on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar to
those in the Bank of loans and receivables. The Bank uses its judgement to adjust observable data for a group of loans
or receivables to reflect current circumstances. In particular, the Bank increased loss given default (LGD) in assessing
impairment by 15% as at 31 December 2014. The impact of such an increase on the provision for impairment is UAH
334,079 thousand.
Deferred income tax assets
The recognised deferred tax asset in the amount of UAH 1,307,279 thousand (31 December 2013: UAH 82,963
thousand) represents income taxes recoverable through future deductions from taxable profits and is recorded in the
statement of financial position. Deferred income tax assets are recorded to the extent that realisation of the related tax
benefit is probable. The future taxable profits and the amount of tax benefits that are probable in the future are based on
a 3-year business plan prepared by management. The business plan is based on management expectations that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Key assumptions in the management expectations include
stabilisation of the economy of Ukraine together with the recovery of the whole banking sector's profitability in 2016, as
well as moderate growth in loan portfolio and reduced loan loss provisions charges due to the expected improvement in
the economy. Taking into account planned future profits for 2016-2017 and the fact that current Ukrainian tax
legislation does not place limits on the term of utilization of tax losses carried forward, management believes that it is
appropriate to recognise the deferred tax asset.
5.       Segment information
For management purposes, the Bank recognizes the following operating segments (business units):
Retail banking              Business Unit focussing on servicing retail customers on the full list of products, and
selling products that are mainly in standardized form (as per the tariffs approved and the
standard procedures) and generally do not require individual approach.
Corporate banking           Business Unit focussing on corporate customers selling products that require individual

approach and are mainly offered to corporate clients.
Inter-bank and investments  Business Unit focussing on the provision of services to participants in the financial
business                   markets (money, currency, stock, etc.) and the sale of products related to transactions on
the financial markets.
The Board monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about
resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance, as explained in the table below, is measured taking
into account income and expenses from other segments.
Unallocated amounts include:
-   Income tax receivables and payables, the share of assets and costs associated with the work of the Bank's TOP
management, i.e. personnel performing general management functions at the level of the whole Bank's system and
the Bank's staff, supporting directly the work of TOP management;
-   The result of the revaluation of open currency position;
-   The difference between inter-segment revenues and costs of all business lines, obtained as a result of transfer
rates.
For the purposes of segment reporting interest is split on the basis of uniform transfer rates set by the Assets and Liabilities
Committee based on the borrowing rate of the Bank.
During the twelve months ended 31 December 2014 and 2013, the Bank had revenues from transactions with a single
external customer that accounted for more than 10% of the total income of the Bank, namely UAH 2,111,974 thousand (31

7.      Mandatory restricted reserves with the National Bank of Ukraine
Since August 2014 Ukrainian banks are required to keep mandatory reserves on a correspondent account with the
NBU. Prior to that time Ukrainian banks were required to keep part of mandatory reserves on a separate account with
the NBU (2013: until 01.07.2013 - 50%, from 0107.2013 to 23.02.2014 - 40%, from 24.02.2014 - 20%, as at 31
December 2013 the amount of funds on a separate account with the NBU was UAH 629,753 thousand). Since October
2013, the Ukrainian banks have been allowed to cover the mandatory reserve balance held on a separate correspondent
account with the NBU with the purchased foreign-currency denominated Ukrainian state bonds amounting to 10% of
their carrying value in the hryvnia equivalent and long-term national currency denominated Ukrainian state bonds with
the maturity of more than 3,600 days according to the initial offering terms amounting to 100% of their carrying value.
In addition, the Ukrainian banks can use placements on a correspondent account opened with PJSC "Clearing Centre".
As at 31 December 2014, Ukrainian state bonds with a carrying value of UAH 30,898,854 thousand (31 December
2013: UAH 15,016,084 thousand) were used by the Bank to cover its NBU mandatory reserve requirement (Note 10).
Since August 2008, Ukrainian banks were required to deposit 20% of funds raised from non-residents in foreign
currency for a period of less than 183 days on a separate account with the NBU, in the form of non-interest bearing cash
deposit. Starting from August 2014 the reserve requirement for funds raised from non-residents in foreign currency is
set by the NBU at 0%. As at 31 December 2014 no funds was placed by the Bank on this account (31 December 2013:
UAH 6,312 thousand).
Since 2009, Ukrainian banks were required to deposit an amount equivalent to the amount of impairment allowance
(defined in accordance with the NBU regulations) created for loans granted in foreign currencies to borrowers with no
foreign currency income, on a separate account with the NBU in the form of non-interest bearing cash deposit. Starting
from February 2014 the NBU temporarily allowed not to keep such reserves on a separate account with the NBU (31
December 2013: UAH 104,892 thousand was placed by the Bank).
As at 31 December 2014 and 2013 the Bank meets all the NBU's mandatory reserve requirements.

Individually im,paired loans
As at 31 December 2014 interest income on loans, for which individual impairment allowances have been recognised,

In accordance with Ukrainian legislation, loans may only be written off with the approval of the Board of Directors.
Collateral and other credit enhancements
The amount and type of collateral required depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty. Guidelines
are implemented regarding the acceptability of types of collateral and valuation parameters.
The main types of collateral obtained are as follows:
-   For securities lending and reverse repurchase transactions - cash or securities,
For commercial lending - charges over real estate properties, inventory and trade receivables,
For retail lending - mortgages over residential properties and vehicles.
The Bank monitors the market value of collateral, requests additional collateral in accordance with the underlying
agreement, and monitors the market value of collateral obtained during its review of the adequacy of the allowance for
loan impairment.
As at 31 December 2014, loans to customers with a carrying value of UAH 6,899,998 thousand are pledged as collateral
under loans received from the NBU (31 December 2013: UAH 5,462,087 thousand) (Note 17).

10.     Investment securities
As at 31 December 2014, investment securities designated at fair value through profit and loss presented Ukrainian state

United States dollar per month, prior to the month of issue, and the average exchange rate of Hryvnia to United States
dollar per month, prior to maturity month. The Bank decided not to separate an embedded derivative instrument and to

In 2014, the Bank sold an investment property item with the gain of UAH 136 thousand (2013: UAH 13 thousand).
In 2014 the Bank revalued its investment property. The valuation was performed by an independent appraiser, who holds a
recognised and relevant professional qualification and who has relevant experience in valuation of property of similar
location and category. The highest and best use method is the key valuation principle underlying the fair value
measurements in the appraisers' reports. The highest and best use method specifies that the market value of the real estate
property is based on its highest and best use which creates the highest value for the property. Only asset utilisations that
are technically feasible, permissible and economically justifiable are considered.
In 2014 the Bank recognised the result from remeasurement of investment property fair value in the amount of UAH
1,713,229 thousand in other operating expenses (2013: UAH 34,614 thousand in other operating expenses).

Nature and purpose of revaluation reserves
Property revaluation reserve
The revaluation reserve for property and equipment is used to record increases in the fair value of buildings and
decreases to the extent that such decrease relates to an increase on the same asset previously recognised in equity.
Unrealisedgains/ (losses) on investment securities available-for-sale
This reserve records changes in fair value of available-for-sale investments.
Reserves and otberfunds of /e Bank
The reserve fund is created in accordance with the Charter to achieve 25 per cent of the size of the regulatory capital at
the beginning of each year. The size of the allocations to the reserve fund is not less than 5 per cent of the amount of
the Bank's annual profit. The reserve fund is created for incidental losses for all assets and off balance sheet
comnutments.
The Bank's distributable reserves are determined by the amount of its reserves as disclosed in the accounts prepared in
accordance with UAR. As at 31 December 2013 the Bank has distributable reserves amounting to UAH 215,688
thousand. As at 31 December 2014, the Bank did not have distributable reserves. The amount of non-distributable
reserves was UAH 1,491,305 thousand (31 December 2013: UAH 1,167,323 thousand). Non-distributable reserves are
represented by a statutory revaluation reserve and a general reserve fund, which is created to cover general banking risks,
including future losses and other unforeseen risks or contingencies.
23.     Commitments and contingencies
Operating environment
The Ukrainian economy while deemed to be of market status continues to display certain characteristics consistent with
that of an economy in transition. These characteristics include low levels of liquidity in the capital markets and the
existence of restrictive currency controls which cause the national currency to be illiquid outside of Ukraine. The
stabilisation and recovery of the Ukrainian economy will be significantly impacted by the duration and implications of
the conflict in the east of the country, the amount of the international financial aid and the policies and decisions of the
Government and the NBU with regard to administrative, legal and economic reforms. As a result, banking operations in
Ukraine involve political and economic risks that are not typical for developed markets.
The Ukrainian economy is vulnerable to changes in the global financial and commodity markets. Deteriorated conditions
of economic cooperation with the Customs Union's countries have resulted in the reduced export of commodities and
accompanying services. A sharp devaluation of the national currency, acceleration of inflation, reduction of personal
disposable income, decrease of revenue proceeds and capital investments, and capital outflow from the Ukrainian
economy in the light of the annexation of Crimea and the "anti-terrorist" operation ("ATO") conducted in the east of
the country have resulted in a decline in the gross domestic product. In particular, decrease of industrial production in
2014 in the Donetsk region was 31.5%, Lugansk - 42%.
Military actions in certain areas of Donetsk and Lugansk regions make impossible the normal functioning of the
branches of the Bank on this territory, make it difficult to service loans for customers and have a negative impact on the
Bank's overall activity.
Whilst the Ukrainian Government continues to introduce various stabilisation measures aimed at supporting the State
finances, banking sector and liquidity of Ukrainian banks and companies, an actual lack of access to capital markets for
the Bank and its counterparties has an adverse impact on the Bank's financial position, results of operations and business
prospects in the medium term.
In addition, factors such as the growth of unemployment in Ukraine, lower levels of liquidity and profitability in the
corporate sector and a threat of a significant increase in the number of instances where legal entities and individuals
become insolvent had a negative effect on the borrowers' ability to repay the amounts owed to the Bank. Negative
developments in the economic environment have also resulted in a reduced value of collateral pledged for loans and
other liabilities. After receiving the relevant information, the Bank promptly revises its estimates of expected future cash
flows in impairment assessments.

"The State Export-Import Bank ot Ukraine"
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2014
(thousands of Ukrainian bmyia, w;less othenise stated)
Whilst the Government and the Bank management take appropriate measures to support the sustainability of the Bank's
business in the current circumstances, continued further deterioration in the areas described above could negatively
affect the Bank's results and financial position.
As at 31 December 2014 the official NBU exchange rate of Hryvnia against US dollar was UAH 15.769 per USD 1,
compared to UAH 7.993 per USD 1 as at 31 December 2013. According to data of the State Statistic Service of Ukraine,
real GDP contracted by 15.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, inflation for 2014
amounted to 24,9% and industrial output in 2014 contracted by 10.7% compared to 2013.
Legal aspects
In the ordinary course of business, the Bank is subject to legal actions and complaints. Management believes that the
ultimate liability, if any, arising from such actions or complaints will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition or the results of future operations of the Bank.
Tax and other regulatory compliance risks
Ukrainian legislation and regulations regarding taxation and other operational matters, including currency exchange
control and custom regulations, continue to evolve. Legislation and regulations are not always clearly written and are
subject to varying interpretations by local, regional and national authorities, and other Governmental bodies. Instances
of inconsistent interpretations are not unusual. Management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is
appropriate and that the Bank has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are
applicable.
At the same time there is a risk that transactions and interpretations that have not been challenged in the past may be
challenged by the authorities in the future, although this risk significantly reduces with the passage of time. It is not
practical to determine the amount of unasserted claims that may manifest, if any, or the likelihood of any unfavourable
outcome.
Since 1 September 2013 transfer pricing rules came into force. These rules provide that in the case of transactions with
1b                 related parties and, in some cases with unrelated parties (controlled operations) are not at market value, entities should
charge additional taxes.
The Bank enters into controlled transactions solely at market prices. The Bank has implemented the necessary internal
controls for compliance of the transfer pricing.

26.      Risk management
Introdaction
The Bank is exposed to risks i.e. credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk (which is subdivided into interest rate risk,
currency risk and trading book risk), operational risk as well as strategic and reputation risk which are continuously
identified, assessed and controlled within the Risk management process. The risk management process makes a crucial
contribution in ensuring the Bank's efficiency and profitability and each employee of the Bank is responsible for
adhering to the risk management rules and procedures in the course of fulfilling their tasks and duties.
The Bank adheres to the following key risk management principles:
centralisation of liquidity, interest and currency risk management at the Head Office level;
unification of analysis and monitoring procedures for credit projects, assessment of the creditworthiness of
each borrower and establishment of credit rating and rules for creating allowance for loan impairment across all
branches of the Bank;
clear definition of the roles of all participants in the risk management process and the interrelations among
those participants;
definition of risk limits for transaction volumes: by Bank or Branch Officer, limits on exposures to single
borrowers, limits on exposures to related parties, credit portfolio concentration limits (by industry,
counterparty banks, separate transactions/ balance sheet items, etc.);
-   ensunng continuous risk monitoring and control and compliance with all established limits;
avoidance of conflicts of interest;
-   ensuring internal control over compliance with policies and procedures.
The risk management process includes four stages: identification of risk, its sources and risk areas; estimation of the level
of risk; minimisation of risk or limitation of risk at an acceptable levels; on-going monitoring of positions at risk.
The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environment, technology
and industry. These risks are monitored through the Bank's strategic planning process.
Risk management structure
The Supervisory Board is generally responsible for establishment and approval of objectives in the sphere of risk
management and management of capital. In addition, the Bank has separate independent bodies responsible for
managing and monitoring risks. The following bodies are responsible for the risk management process at the Bank:
Management Board, Assets and Liabilities Committee ("ALCO"), Credit Committee, Retail Business Committee,
Securities Division, Treasury Division, Risk Management Division, Audit and Revision Division.
Superisor Board
The Supervisory Board is responsible for the overall risk management approach and for approving the risk strategies and
principles.
Management Board
The Management Board has the overall responsibility for the development of the risk strategy and implementing of
principles, frameworks, policies and limits within the Bank. Fundamental risk issues are managed and monitored by
relevant risk decisions based on quarterly reports of the Risk Management Division, ALCO, Credit Committee and
Retail Business Committee. The Management Board approves the Bank's risk management.

The Credit Committee and Retail Business Committee have the overall responsibility for implementing principles,
frameworks, policies and limits regarding credit risk within the Bank and ensuring that credit risk indicators are within
the specified ranges approved by the Management Board. These committees report to the Management Board.
Rirk Maagement Division
Risk Management Division is responsible for control, monitoring, analysis and reporting of key risk indicators connected
with the Bank's activities. In addition, Risk Management Division elaborates and supervises implementation of risk
management methodologies, norms and procedures, estimates the risk of all banking products and structured
transactions. The Risk Management Division reports to the Management Board,
Treasu and Secmiies Divisions
Treasury is responsible for the management of the Bank's liquidity position via money market operations, while
Securities Division is responsible for management of the Bank's liquidity position via capital market operations. The
Treasury Division and Securities Division report to the Management Board.
InternaAudit Division
The risk management processes are audited on a regular basis by Internal Audit Division, which examines both the
adequacy of procedures and the Bank's compliance with those procedures. Audit findings, conclusions and
recommendations are submitted to the Management Board and the Supervisory Board.
Risk measurenent and risk repoii,g ystems
The Bank's risks are measured using methods which reflect both the expected loss under normal circumstances and
unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on statistical models. The models make use of
probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic environment. The Bank also runs
worse case scenarios reflecting the impact of extreme events with la low probability of occurrence . The Bank carries
out back-testing of the models to checks their adequacy.
Risks are monitored and controlled primarily based on limits established by the Bank. These limits reflect the business
strategy and market environment of the Bank as well as the level of risk that the Bank is willing to accept, with additional
emphasis on selected industries. In addition, the Bank monitors and measures the overall risk bearing capacity in relation
to the aggregate risk exposure across all risks types and activities.
Information regarding the balance-sheet structure, capital adequacy, compliance with limits and indicators established by
the ALCO, and covenants under contractual obligations of the Bank is submitted to the ALCO on a monthly basis. The
Management Board receives a comprehensive risk report once a quarter which is designed to provide all the necessary
information to assess and conclude on the risks of the Bank.
For all levels of the Bank's management, various risk reports are prepared in order to provide comprehensive, relevant
and up-to-date information to all of the Bank's units.
Risk Mifigaion
The Bank does not use derivatives to manage risks arising from changes in interest rates, credit risk and liquidity risk
since a market for such financial instruments does not yet exist in Ukraine.
The Bank extensively uses collateral to minimise credit risk (see below for more derail).
Excessive isks concenhahon
Concentration arises when a number of counterparts are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same
geographic region, or have similar economic characteristics, which determine their ability to meet contractual obligations
that are equally affected by the changes in economic, political or other environment. Concentration indicates the relative
sensitivity of the Bank's performance to the developments affecting a particular industry or geographical area.
In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risks, the Bank's internal policies and procedures include specific
guidelines to focus on maintaining a diversified portfolio. Identified risks concentration is duly controlled and managed.

Credit risk
The Banks considers credit risk as the probability of non-timely and/or insufficient receipt of funds from customers
(coonterparties) under their commitments.
Credit risk management is primarily aimed at ensuring fulfilment of commitments by the Bank's customers
(counterparties) in form, volume and time periods adequate for maintaining liquidity, yield and capital adequacy ratios
within the lintits acceptable for the Bank,
In managing credit risk, the Bank considers the following-
- structural (strategic) management - acceptable level of loan portfolio structure and volume (on balance sheet
and off balance sheet) in short, medium and long term horizon taking into consideration estimated and
unpredictable changes in the financial and economic environment;
-   on-going (operational) management - acceptable quality and volume of individual loans and commitments
taking into consideration estimated and unpredictable changes in the financial and economic environment;
-   structural (strategic) and on-going (operational) management of the allowance for impairment effect on the
Bank's capital adequacy ratio in short, medium and long term horizon taking into consideration estimated and
unpredictable changes in quality of the individual loans, credit portfolios and total credit portfolio.
The Bank manages and controls credit risk based on the following principles:
-   setting targets (optimal and acceptable for the Bank), critical (undesirable, but manageable) and threshold
(requiring urgent measures) values of the key credit risk exposures;
-   providing loans or loan related commitments solely in accordance with the approved Credit policy and the
Bank's internal regulations;
-   creation and maintaining allowances and provisions for loan related operations in volumes, which are not lower
than the Bank's best estimates;
-   constant monitoring of the actual values of the key credit risk exposures at the level of individual
loans/commitments, credit portfolios and total credit portfolio;
-   taking efficient measures if the actual values of credit risk exposures approach their critical and/or threshold
values.
Key credit risk exposures, their target, critical and threshold values are updated at least annually and approved by the
Management Board of the Bank.
In response to the difficult economic and political situation in Ukraine during 2014, annexation of Crimea, the conflict
in the east, the Bank in its credit policy imposed limits on the decisions in respect of credit risk (lending) for branches
located in Crimea and on the territory not controlled by Ukrainian government. Collateral for the loans, which are
located on the teritory not controlled by Ukrainian authorities is not taken into account for the purposes of calculation
of the allowance for impairment. In addition, the Bank created provisions for impairment for loans to customers located
in Crimea approximately 100%.
Individual credit risk
Individual credit risk is a risk which can be attributed to a particular transaction or counterparty.
Individual credit risk is managed through: loan and customer (or counterparty) classification via the system of internal
credit ratings determined on the basis of the customer's (counterparties) creditworthiness and an evaluation of their loan
repayment quality; evaluation and monitoring of collateral value and liquidity; setting credit risk limits and monitoring
compliance with the limits; creation of adequate allowance for asset's impairment.
The Bank's lending policy determines the type of collateral required for a particular transaction, industry or customer.
The primary types of collateral include: guarantees of primary banks, deposits with the Bank, real estate property and
pledges of equipment or vehicles. The Bank requires obligatory insurance of collateral to be provided by the customer.
In order to limit individual credit risk, the Bank sets the following limits: maximum volume of credit transactions (loans,
securities, receivables) per single counterparty (or group of related counterparties), including financial commiments and
contingencies; maximum volume of credit transactions (loans, securities, receivables) for one insider, including financial
commitments and contingencies.

Notes to rte Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2014

Porfoio credit rsk
Portfolo credit risk is the risk typical for a group of credit transactions (loans, securities, receivables) and group of
counterparties with similar credit characteristics.
Portfolio credit risk management is exercised through: industry classification on the basis of an internal system of
industry ratings, which characterises the systematic risk of the industry; monitoring of the crerlit portfolio structure (by
category of customers, industries atsd credit ratings of customers and loans); establishment of concentration limnits and
appropriate monitoring and control thereof; diversification of credit portfolio (both by industry and customer category).
Diversification of credit portfolio (both by industry and customer category) is provided through establishment of the
following limits: by industry; by maximum total volume of "large" loans (which constitute 10% or more of the regulatory
capital of the Bank as to each counterparty or group of related counterparties); by maximum total volume of loans to
insiders; by credit portfolio concentration per category of customers; by total indebtedness of 5 largest customers; by
total indebtedness of 10 largest customers; by total indebtedness of 20 largest customers.
Credit-related commzritmvent risks
The Bank issues guarantees to its customers, under which the Bank may be required to make payments on behalf of the
relevant customers. These guarantees expose the Bank to risks similar to credit risks, and are mitigated by similar control
procedures and principles.
The Bank undertakes to effect payment against presentation of complying documents under letters of credit. If the
letters of credit are opened on uncovered basis the Bank has risks similar to credit risks, which are mitigated by similar
control procedures and principles.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the consolidated statement of financial position before the
effect of mitigation through the use of collateral agreements, is best represented by their carrying amounts.
Where financial instruments are recorded at fair value, the carrying value represents the current credit risk exposure but
not the maximum risk exposure that could arise in the future as a result of changes in values.
For more details on the maximum exposure to credit risk for each class of financial instrument, references shall be made
to the specific notes.
Credit quaity by category offinanidal assets
The Bank uses an internal system of credit ratings from A + to F (16 grades), where the highest rating of A+ is
characterized by an extremely high ability of the borrower to fulfil its debt obligations, and the worst rating F is for
borrowers who have stopped work and/or are bankrupt. In the table below, for loans that are not past due and not
individually impaired, rating A and B mean the minimum level of credit risk. Other borrowers with good financial
position and quality of debt servicing are included in the credit ratings of C and D and lower. This rating have lower
credit quality compared to previous ratings, but loans are not necessarily individually impaired. For loans that are past
due or individually impaired, rating D and higher indicates that there is a possibility of delays in loan repayment as a
result of adverse changes in commercial, financial and economic conditions. Rating E and F or no rating means that
there is a high probability of default of loan, the borrower's activity is poor, loss making or ceased. For the exposures of
foreign credit institutions: rating A and B is equal to the Fitch rating BBB- and higher, rating C is equal to lower than
BBB- , but higher than CCC+, and rating D and lower is equal to rating CCC+ and lower.

It is the Bank's policy to maintain accurate and consistent risk ratings across the credit portfolio. The rating system is
supported by a variety of financial analytics, combined with processed market information to provide the main inputs
for the measurement of counterparty risk. All internal risk ratings are tailored to the various categories and are derived in
accordance with the Bank's rating policy. The attributable risk ratings are assessed and updated regularly.
The ageing analysis of past due but not impaired loans is provided below:

Impaiment asterswent
The main considerations for the loan impairment assessment is based on a determination whether any payments of
principal or interest are overdue by more than 90 days or whether there are any known difficulties in the cash flows of
counterparties, credit rating downgrades, or infringement of the original terms of the respective contract. The Bank
addresses impairment assessment in two areas: individually assessed allowances and collectively assessed allowances (on
a portfolio basis).

Liquidity risk
The Bank considers liquidity risk as the risk of an inability to finance growth of the Bank's assets and to fulfil its own
obligations when they fall due.
The main purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure the ability of the Bank to fulfil its obligations when they fall
due by maintaining acceptable (manageable) liquidity gaps. While managing liquidity risk, the Bank is considering a
combination of the following:
-   structural (short and long-term) assets and liabilities management focused on ensuring appropriate liquidity
levels in the short and long-term time horizon;
-   current (short-term) assets and liabilities management focused on ensuring appropriate level of instant and
current liquidity taking into consideration estimated and unpredictable cash flow changes.
Liquidity risk management is based on acceptable levels of maturity gaps (by currency) and on the following principles:
-   setting target (optimal and acceptable to the Bank), critical (undesirable but manageable) and threshold
(requiring urgent measures) levels of key liquidity risk indicators;
-   permanent monitoring of actual key liquidity risk indicators;
-   use of adequate corrective actions if actual key liquidity risk indicators approach their critical and/or threshold
levels.
Key liquidity risk indicators, their respective targets, critical and threshold levels are updated at least annually and
approved by the Management Board of the Bank.

Assessmnt of the iquidity position
The adherence to the internal limits set by the Bank is in line with the liquidity risk standards established by the National
Bank of Ukraine. The liquidity position is assessed and managed by the Bank, based on certain liquidity ratios established
by the NBU.
The liquidity position, assessed by respective liquidity ratios established by the NBU, was as follows:

Analysis of financial liabilities by remaining contractual maturities
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Bank's financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted
repayment obligations. Less than 3 month liabilities are those that are due on the earliest date. However, the Bank
expects that many customers will not demand repayment on the earliest date when the Bank could be required to make a
respective repayment and the table does not reflect the expected cash flows calculated by the Bank on the basis of
information on deposit repayment in previous periods.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2014
(thiouaeds of Ukrnan bryia, unless othen2ise staed)
The above table shows the timing of expiry dates of commitments and contingent financial liabilities of the Bank
according to the respective agreements. The Bank expects that not all of the contingent liabilities or commitments will
he drawn before their expry. In order to limit liquidity risk arising from asymmetric prepayment and early repayment
prospective of the term  assets and liabilities, the Bank incorporates in standard client agreements conditions that
motivate customers not to use the options of prepayment and early repayment.
Market risk
The Bank considers market risk as the aggregate of interest rate risk and currency risk, i.e. inability to secure excess of
income (including interest income) over expenses (including interest expenses) by currency in volumes required to fulfil
the Bank's obligations and to maintain liquidity and capital adequacy risks within the range acceptable to the Bank.
Market risk management is performed by systematic combination of-
-   interest risk management;
-   foreign currency risk management.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is considered by the Bank as the inability to secure excess of interest income over interest expenses in
volumes required to fulfil the Bank's interest payment obligations and to maintain liquidity and capital adequacy risks
within the range acceptable to the Bank. The Bank considers the mismatch of interest receipts and interest payments by
volumes or dates to be the main source of interest rate risk.
The Bank considers interest rate risk management as an integral part of the Bank's operations including the effect of
negative impact by internal and external factors.
Interest rate risk management is performed through a combination of:
-   structural (strategic) and current (operational) management of interest-earning assets aimed at achieving
acceptable structure and volume of interest income in short, middle and long-term time horizon taking into
consideration estimated and unpredictable changes in interest rates;
-   structural (strategic) and current (operational) management of interest-bearing liabilities aimed at achieving
acceptable structure and volume of interest expenses in short, middle and long-term time horizon taking into
consideration estimated and unpredictable changes in interest rates.
Interest rate risk management is aimed at securing the excess of interest income over interest expenses in volumes
sufficient to fulfil the Bank's interest payment obligations and to maintain liquidity and capital adequacy risks within the
range acceptable to the Bank. Interest rate risk management is performed via:
-   setting target (optimal and acceptable to the Bank), critical (undesirable but manageable) and threshold
(requiring urgent measures) levels of key interest rate risk indicators;
-   permanent monitoring of actual values of key interest rate risk indicators;
-   taking efficient measures if the actual values of key interest rate risk indicators approach their critical and/or
threshold levels.
Key interest rate risk indicators, their respective targets, critical and threshold levels are updated at least annually and
approved by the Management Board of the Bank.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change in interest rates, with all other variables
held constant, of the Bank's consolidated statement of profit and loss (consolidated income statement).
The sensitivity of the consolidated statement of profit and loss (consolidated income statement) reflects the effect of the
assumed changes in interest rates on the net interest income for one year, based on the floating rate non-trading financial
assets and financial liabilities held at reporting date.

The equity sensitivity is calculated by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets with fixed rate as at
31 December to assess the possible effects of the assumed changes in interest rates. For securities classified at the 1 and
2 levels of the fair value hierarchy of the asset, the method of modified duration is used, for securities classified at the 3
level of the hierarchy - a method of yield curve, with the following assumptions: +/- 400 b.p. for corporate bonds with
government guarantee, +/- 300 b.p. for corporate bonds, +/- 300 b.p. for Ukrainian state bonds denominated in local
currency, +/- 200 b.p. for Ukrainian state bonds in USD, +/- 20% interest rate change for corporate bonds of the 3
level of hierarchy. As at 31 December 2014, the total effect of the changes on the Bank's equity is: UAH (1,532,772)
thousand / UAH 1,532,772 thousand (2013: UAH (597,858) thousand / UAH 597,858 thousand).
Sensitivity of net profit / (loss) on investment securities designated at fair value through profit or loss is calculated by
the revaluation of financial instruments with fixed interest rate, and are revalued through profit / (loss) as of 31
December in terms of effects of the assumed changes in interest rates using the method of modified duration. The effect
of changes in interest rate of +/- 200 b.p. for Ukrainian state bonds on the Bank's income is UAH (163,839) thousand /
UAH 163,839thousand (2013: UAH (106,890) thousand / UAH 106,890 thousand).
Currency risk
The Bank considers currency risk as the inability to secure excess of foreign currency cash inflow over foreign currency
cash outflow (by currency) in amounts required to maintain liquidity and capital adequacy risks within the range
acceptable to the Bank. The Bank considers the inconsistency of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates to be
the main source of currency risk.
Currency risk management is performed through a combination of:
-   structure (strategic) and current (operational) management of assets by currency aimed at achieving an
acceptable structure and amount of foreign currency cash inflow in short, medium and long term time horizon
taking into consideration estimated and unpredictable changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
-   structure (strategic) and current (operational) liabilities management aimed at achieving an acceptable structure
and amount of foreign currency cash outflow in short, medium and long term time horizon taking into
consideration estimated and unpredictable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Currency risk management is aimed at securing an excess of foreign currency cash inflow over foreign currency cash
outflow at the level acceptable for the Bank and necessary for maintaining liquidity and capital adequacy risks within the
range acceptable to the Bank, and is performed via:
-   setting targets (optimal and acceptable to the Bank), critical (undesired but manageable) and threshold (urgent
measures) values of key currency risk indicators;
-   continuous monitorng of actual values of key currency risk indicators;
-   taking efficient measures if the actual values of key currency risk indicators approach their critical and/or
threshold values.
Key currency risk indicators, their target, critical and threshold values are updated at least annually and approved by the
Management Board of the Bank.
The tables below indicate the currencies to which the Bank has significant exposure at 31 December 2014 on its non-
trading monetary assets and liabilities and its forecast cash flows. The analysis calculates the effect of a reasonably
possible movement of the currency rate against hryvnia, with all other variables held constant on the consolidated
statement of profit and loss (consolidated income statement) (due to the fair value of currency sensitive non-trading
monetary assets and liabilities). The effect on equity does not differ from the effect on the consolidated income
statement A negative amount in the table reflects a potential net reduction in consolidated statement of profit and loss
(consolidated income statement) or equity, while a positive amount reflects a net potential increase.

The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for those annual consolidated
financial instruments, which are not recorded at fair value in the financial statements.
Assetsfor which fair value approxiiiates carrying value
For financial assets and financial liabilities that are liquid or having a short term maturity (less than three months) it is
assumed that the carrying amounts approximate to their fair value. This assumption is also applied to demand deposits,
savings accounts without a specific maturity and variable rate financial instruments.
Fixed rate finanial instruments
The fair values of fixed rate financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by comparing market
interest rates when they were first recognised with current market rates offered for similar financial instruments. The
estimated fair value of fixed interest bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows using prevailing money-market
interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and maturity. For quoted debt issued the fair values are calculated based on
quoted market prices. For those notes issued where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash flow model is
used based on a current interest rate yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity.
Investment securities designated at fair value through profit or loss and available-for-sale investment seemites
Investment securities designated at fair value through profit or loss and investment securities available for sale (excluding
shares), are valued using market quotes. Securities available for sale which are valued using a valuation technique or
pricing models primarily consist of shares. These securities are valued using models utilising data which is not based on
the market observations. The non-observable inputs to the models include assumptions regarding the future financial
performance of the investee, its risk profile, and economic assumptions regarding the industry and geographical
jurisdiction in which the investee operates level of enterprise goodwill, its management and founders / shareholders.
Investnentproperly
The highest and best use method specifies that the market value of the real estate property is based on its highest and best
use which creates the highest value for the property. Only asset utilisations that are technically feasible, perissible and
economically justifiable are considered.

Other vtluation principles are used in line with the selected valuation approaches subject to the provisions of the
national standard Nl "General Principles of valuation of property and property rights", approved by the Cabinet
Ministers of Ukraine .N 1440 from 10/09/2003.
Land plots are valued by applying the sales comparison approach.
Real estate is valued using either the comparative or income approach (based on the principle of expected future benefits
from the use of a valued item) subject to the availability of market information and best use.
Real estate properties specialised in nature (engineering structures) are valued using the cost approach (by calculating the
replacement cost of similar property taking into account further depreciation of a valued item).
Buildings
The fair value of buildings was measured mainly using the comparative approach and in certain cases by applying either
or both of the cost and income approach.

The maturity analysis does not reflect the historical stability of current accounts. In the table above current accounts are
reflected in the Amount due to customers in "Within one year" maturity bucket. It should be noted that historically
substantial portion of funds have remained on the current accounts for periuds longer than one year. The category
Amounts due to customers includes term deposits of individuals in accordance with their contractual maturity dates.
However, under Ukrainian legislation the Bank is obliged to repay such deposits upon the demand of a depositor. The
Bank expects that a significant portion of the customers will not request early repayment and expects that a substantial
portion of deposits will be rolled over.

control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial or operational decisions.

merely the legal form.
Related parties may enter into transactions which unrelated parties might not. The terms and conditions of such
transactions may differ from those between unrelated parties.
Transactions and balances with related parties comprise transactions with Ukrainian government-related entities (both
directly and indirectly controlled by and under significant influence of the Government) and key management personnel.
The outstanding balances of key management personnel as at 31 December 2014 and 2013, and related income and

33.     Subsequent events
In 2015 the negative trends of 2014 continued due to destruction of industrial enterprises and infrastructure in the
Eastern Ukraine as a result of military actions, decrease in external demand, in particular due to deterioration of trade
relationships with Russian Federation, deterioration of consumer and investment internal demand. After the reporting
date Ukrainian hryvnya significantly depreciated against major foreign currencies, in particular exchange rate UAH/USD
increased to UAH 21.616059 per USD 1 as at 15 March 2015 compared to UAH 15.7686 per USD 1 as at 31 December
2014. The NBU discount rate was increased to 19.5% from 6 February 2015 (from 14%) and further increased tro 30%
from 4 March 2015.
In January 2015 inflation accelerated to 28.5% in annual terms as a result of devaluation of the national currency and
high inflationary and devaluation expectations. Internal migration and economic downturn lead to narrowing of labour
market and growing unemployment which, in turn, resulted in decrease in real wages of population.
All these factors had further negative impact on the Ukrainian banking system and as a result, in 2015 the National Bank
of Ukraine assigned further 11 banks to the insolvent category.
The Bank has balances with two of these banks as at 31 December 2014. Amounts due from one of these banks were
fully provisioned as at the reporting date. Balances with another one were represented by interbank loans, which were
fully collateralised and investment securities available for sale, for which the Bank raised impairment provision to reflect
the impact of subsequent events.
On 11 March 2015 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund approved an Extended Arrangement under
the Extended Fund Facility for Ukraine totalling USD 17,5 billion for the period of four years. As outlined in the
Investor Presentation delivered by the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine, further savings of over USD 15 billion during the
IMF program period should be generated in public sector financing from external debt payments on the sovereign,
sovereign-guaranteed and state-owned entities debt. The list of such state-owned entities includes Ukreximbank which
has Eurobonds maturing during this period (refer to Note 20). However, as clarified by the Government, each entity will
undergo a separate procedure targeting its specific situation.
