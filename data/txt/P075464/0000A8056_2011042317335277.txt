                         Implementation Status Overview
                           The project underwent level 2 restructuring with the re-allocation of the unallocated 20 million USD to the public health component and other minor re-allocations. The reform areas
                         supported by the project are progressing with disbursements nearly complete for component 2 and 4. Disbursement for component 1 is finally expected to be made this quarter. A
                         formal request for a 9 month extension is expected soon to allow the government time to fully implement and disburse component 1.
