     PHILIPPINES â€” NATIONAL SECTOR SUPPORT FOR HEALTH REFORM
                                 P075464
                          {LOAN NUMBER 7395}

                                 Restructuring Paper

1. The closing date for Philippines, National Sector SUPPORT FOR HEALTH
   REFORM, [Loan No7395], P075464 will be extended from June 30, 2011 until
   March 31, 2012.

2. The project underwent level 2 restructuring last August 16, 2010 which primarily re-
   allocated funds to increase support for the expanded immunization program. Since
   then, all the policy reforms supported by the project are finally in place with an
   ongoing scaling up of the implementation of the said reforms. PhilHealth has fully
   embraced the use of the National Household Targeting System (NHTS) and
   enrolment of all of poor families who are not currently enrolled into the National
   Health Insurance Program (NHIP) is aggressively being pursued. The immunization
   program now includes new vaccines (MMR and HiB vaccines) and population
   coverage of the traditional vaccines has increased. A performance grant mechanism to
   facilitate the provision of maternal, newborn and child health and nutrition (MNCHN)
   services had been institutionalized. The modernization law for the Bureau of Foods
   and Drugs was passed and the now renamed Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
   gained expanded regulatory powers with income retention privileges. Better
   information is available for managing health human resources (HHR). Performance
   grants to local governments have led to province-wide investment plans and the LGU
   health scorecard. Disbursements for the public health and local health system grants
   are nearly complete while the initial disbursement for the national government
   subsidy to the NHIP is finally being processed now that the NHTS is fully accepted
   by PhilHealth. Processing for disbursements to support FDA, HHR and MNCHN
   grants are ongoing.

3. The latest ISR was approved in April 2011 with a PDO rating of Moderately
   Satisfactory and IP rating of Satisfactory. There are no pending audit reports.

4. The proposed extension is necessary to complete the implementation and
   reimbursement of the project components, particularly the health financing
   component. With PhilHealth now enrolling all the NHTS poor families, DOH needs
   time to complete the documentation of their enrolment and the calculation of the
   national government subsidies which the project will finance. DOH expects nine (9)
   months to be sufficient to complete all the activities; processing of the reimbursement
   submissions; and liquidation of all advances particularly for the vaccine purchases.
   DOH expects the utilization of the full allocated amount and has prepared an action
   plan for the completion of the project.

5. This      will      be      the      first     extension      of      the      project.
