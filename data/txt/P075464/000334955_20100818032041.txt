II.          Project implementation progress summary.

      As a national program support loan, the implementation progress of the different project
      components is directly linked to the pace and progress of the reform areas the
      components are supporting.

      The reforms on expanding public health service delivery or component B have exceeded
      our projections and expectations with the country tripling its spending for vaccines by
      fully covering all eligible children with polio, DPT, measles and Hepatitis B
      vaccinations, and introducing MMR and HiB vaccines in the county. The public health
      performance grants have also progressed. We are about to fully utilize all allocations for
      this component.

      The reforms on local health systems or component D have moved ahead with the
      convergence provinces preparing and implementing their province-wide investment plans
      for health. As such, up to 70% of the local health system reform grants have either been
      disbursed or have been advanced by the DOH and being readied for reimbursement.

      The component A reforms on improving the targeting of the poor that would be
      subsidized into the Sponsored Program of the National Health Insurance Program had
      been delayed as PHIC found it difficult in determining the appropriate means test
      methodologies. PHIC eventually accepted the National Household Targeting System
      (NHTS) for Poverty Reduction's proxy means test in 2008 as an appropriate means test
      but it then took a year of negotiations before PHIC and DSWD finally signed a MOA last
      December 16, 2009 that would allow PHIC to validate its members enrolled in the
      Sponsored Program against the listing of poor. Both agencies are now cross-matching the
      PHIC Sponsored Program database with the DSWD's listing of poor. Nonetheless,
      although the delayed reforms had lead to no disbursement against this component, we
      now expect this reform and project component to move given the recent pronouncements
      by both the President and the Secretary of Health that the government shall immediately
      subsidize the enrolment of the DSWS's list of poor into PhilHealth.

      The reforms that component C supports have moved ahead but the approval of income
      retention for the then BFAD in 2008 lead DOH and BFAD to defer utilizing this
      component. Subsequent re-affirmation of this income retention in 2009 with the FDA law
      further delayed this utilization of this component. Nonetheless, FDA has finally requested
      that the project support quality assurance innovations.

      Given the progress of the reforms and project implementation, only 34.5% or around 38
      million USD of the 110 million USD loan had been disbursed with 95% or 35.6 million
      USD of the allocated 38.5 million USD for component B has been disbursed. However,
      as earlier discussed, we expect disbursements of the 40 million USD component
      supporting PHIC reforms to soon happen.

      The project has a 20 million unallocated amount which was expected to be used to
      support the reforms that moved the quickest. As determined and agreed in the last
                                                  5
       mission, component B or the public health reform reforms have moved the quickest and
       now needs the re-allocation of the unallocated amount to support the vaccine needs for
       calendar year 2010.

III.          Justification for re-allocation

       The proposed reallocation of an additional $20,725,000 to component B is primarily to
       provide funding cover for the 2010 vaccines with $20,225,000 of the re-allocated amount
       to finance the vaccines. The funding for vaccines has increased from 6 million USD to 18
       million USD brought about by the full coverage to all eligible children of polio, DPT,
       measles and Hepatitis B vaccines and expansion of the vaccine and the introduction of
       HiB and MMR vaccines. The $500,000 additional allocation to the performance-based
       public health awards is expected to support further scaling up of the said performance
       grants. The re-allocated amount shall be primarily coming from the unallocated 20
       million USD. There will be no extension of the project closing date.
