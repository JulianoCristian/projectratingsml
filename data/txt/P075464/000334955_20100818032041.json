The public health performance grants have also\n            progressed. The reallocation of an additional $20,725,000 to\n            component B is primarily to provide funding cover for the\n            2010 vaccines with $20,225,000 of the re-allocated amount to\n            finance the vaccines. The funding for vaccines has increased\n            from 6 million USD to 18 million USD brought about by the\n            full coverage to all eligible children of polio, DPT,\n            measles and Hepatitis B vaccines and expansion of the\n            vaccine and the introduction of HiB and MMR vaccines. The\n            $500,000 additional allocation to the performance-based\n            public health awards is expected to support further scaling\n            up of the said performance grants. The re-allocated amount\n            shall be primarily coming from the unallocated 20 million\n            USD.
