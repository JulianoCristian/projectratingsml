Obiectivesand       The thirdProgrammatic Social ReformLoan (PSRL 111)
Description:       continues to provide Bank support to the Government's medium-
                   term social reform program. The medium term objectives of this
                   program are to: (i)improve the anti-poverty focus of public
                   expenditures; (ii) improve the access of the poor to quality health
                   and education services; and (iii)improve the transparency of
                   social programs and empower their beneficiaries in the design and
                   implementation of these programs. The main achievements of
                   PSRL I11 are: Component I: Improve the anti-poverty focus of
                   public expenditures: (i) Priority Social Programs (PSPs) are
                                              the
                   being protected despite pressures arising from demands for
                   increased teacher and health worker salaries and from new
                   administrative needs linked to decentralization; (ii)  targeting of
                   several key anti-poverty programs has improved; (iii)    legislation
                   has been approved to reduce untargeted subsidies to high income
                   pensioners; (iv) legislation presented to Congress includes the
                   decentralization of food aid programs with measures to improve
                   targeting and performance-management. Component 2: Improve
                   the access of the poor to health and education programs: (i)
                   significant gains in health care coverage have been obtained and
                   pro-poor reforms inhealthpolicy are becoming mainstreamed; and
                   (ii)progresshasbeenmadeindevelopingtheeducation sector's
                   human resources management system. Component 3: Improve the
                   transparency and social oversight of resource allocation: (i)
                   transparency has improved with the widespread implementation of
                   a user-friendly information system that allows beneficiaries to
                   monitor budgets and expenditures for all PSPs and physical goals
                   and results for a group of PSPs; and (ii)  social participation was
                   strengthened by the launch of user satisfaction scorecards and the


                                    i

          institutionalizationof user satisfaction surveys and by the approval
          of new TransparencyLegislation.


          The PSRL I11will continue to protect critical social programs for
          the poor in a time when the country is facing the double
          adjustment of reducing the fiscal deficit and confronting the cost
          of decentralization.    It will also help increase the quality and
          efficiency of social expenditures by increasing the coverage of key
          services for the poor. It will help set the framework for
          decentralization    by   supporting    the launch    of    the  first
          decentralization package, particularly food programs. At the same
          time, PSRL I11 helps set the stage for further social sector
          decentralization by supporting the development of key instruments
          (such as SIS,      Performance Agreements, teacher electronic
          payrolls) needed to decentralize health and education services.
          The mechanismsfor public oversight of social policy supported by
          the operation will enhance the influence and voice of the poor on
          key social programs and help strengthen civil society at the
          national, regional andlocal level. The intersectoral approach of the
          PSRL has strengthened the contacts between the Ministry of
          Economy and Finance, the Office of the Prime Minister, the
          Ministry of Women and Social Development and the Ministries of
          Educationand Health.

Risks:    The country faces four principal risks to the successful
          continuation of the social reform program. The first risk is fiscal
          sustainability related to insufficient tax reform, pressure for high
          spending linked to pressuresto increase wages in the public sector
          and an inadequate fiscal decentralization framework. Mitigation
          actions for this risk include: the granting of legislative powers to
          the executive to pass a tax reform in September 2003; the positive
          IMFreview of the Stand By Arrangement and the relaunch of the
          National Agreement to regain consensus and governance; and the
          passing of key legislation to ensure that subnational government
          debt and tax policy have a fiscally responsible framework. The
          second risk i s external; a narrow export base dependent on
          commodities increases the economy's exposure to terms of trade
          shocks. Mitigation actions include the promotion of export
          diversification   and competitiveness       enhancement and the
          maintenance of a flexible exchange rate policy which permits the
          country to adapt better to external shocks. A third risk is that the
          Government commitment to priority social programs (PSPs) i s lost
          in the context of decentralization, leading to backtracking in the
          gains achieved in targeting, efficiency, quality and monitoring of
          the PSPs or that there is lack of capacity to implement the reforms.
          To mitigate these risks, the draft 2004 Budget Law and the draft
          Intergovernmental Transfer Law (both presented to Congress)
          provide special protection to the budget of PSPs, utilize pro-poor
          criteria to distribute their funds, and provide for the use of

1.       This memorandum describes the third Programmatic Social Reform Loan (PSRL 111)to
the Republic o f Peru, a single-tranche loan for US$150 million to continue Bank support to the
Government's medium-term social reform program.             The medium term objectives of this
program are to: (i) the anti-poverty focus of public expenditures; (ii)
                    improve                                                      improve the access
of the poor to quality health and education services; and (iii) improve the transparency of social
programs and empower their beneficiaries in the design and implementation of these programs.
The PSRL Iwas prepared in 2001 with the Transition Government that followed the demise o f
the Fujimori Government and emphasized transparency and budgetary protection of key social
programs. PSRL I1was prepared in 2002, during the first year of the Toledo Administration and
supported the design and launch of longer term reforms in anti-poverty programs and the social
sectors.  The Implementation Completion Report for PSRL I1 rated the loan as having a
satisfactory outcome, likely sustainability and modest institutional development impact.
2.       Inits original design, the PSRLseries was expected to conclude with a consolidation of
social and anti-poverty reforms in PSRL 111. Indeed progress in implementing the original
program to be supported by PSRL I11has been broadly on track with a few areas proceeding
faster and a few others more slowly (see paragraph 5, Sections IV and V and annex 2).
However, progress in two additional areas has been considerably faster than expected. In the
area of pensions, there i s a renewed effort to give a strategic direction to reforms and to control
the growth of untargeted subsidies. Second, decentralization i s being implemented more rapidly
than expected, with a major impact on the social sectors. Starting in mid-2002, legislation has
been passed giving regional governments and municipalities significant responsibilities and
funding for social programs, also regional authorities have been elected for the first time. A
group of social programs are being transferred to municipal and regional governments in 2003,
and more programs and funds will be transferred in 2004. Reflecting these new, larger
challenges and accelerated reforms, the proposed PSRL I11is in an amount of US$l50 million
(from an original expected amount of US$lOO million) and a fourth PSRL i s proposed to be
added to the program to consolidate the social reform program in a decentralized context. In the
new context, several areas o f reform not previously foreseen have been added to PSRL 111: (i)
legislation has been presented to Congress to ensure that the decentralization of the food aid
programs also improves the targeting and the emphasis on results; (ii) 2004 Budget proposed
                                                                         the
to Congress provides new institutional safeguards to prevent diversion of funds from Priority
Social Programs (PSPs) in the context of decentralization; (iii)     legislation has been passed to
reduce subsidies to high-income pensioners; and (iv) a new Transparency Law has been passed,
giving increased access to public information.
3.      The Government has also requested a new Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan
focusing on Growth and Fiscal decentralization. In the area of decentralization, the new PSAL
would cover the broader issues of decentralization, including fiscal decentralization and
competitiveness, while the PSRL IV would exclusively deal with the decentralization of the
social programs. These two loans have been envisaged as part of the High Case scenario in the
CAS approved by the Board on August 19, 2002. Peru has complied with all triggers enabling
it to move to the HighCase lendingscenario as discussed inAnnex 3.
4.     Reforms under the PSRL series have been supported by policy dialogue and technical
assistance provided through analytical and advisory services, and under World Bank-financed


                                                  1

investment and technical assistance operations. The design of the PSRL benefited from the
recommendations of several economic and sector reports including a health report (Peru:
Improving Health Care for the Poor. Report No. 18549, dated May 28, 1999), an education
report (Peru: Education at a Crossroads. Report No. 19066, dated December 30, 1999), a Public
Expenditure Review (Peru:       Restoring Fiscal Discipline for Poverty Reduction. Report No.
24286, dated October 24, 2002), and a study on pensions, currently under preparation (Peru:
Restoring the Multiple Pillars of Old Age Income Security) or from informal advisory studies on
decentralization of the social sectors and the food aid programs.   Furthermore, implementation
of the reforms under PSRL i s being supported by ongoing Bank-financed investment projects in
health (Health Reform APL. Loan No. 3244-PE), education (Rural Education APL, Loan No.
7176-PE), and water and sanitation (PRONASAR. Loan No. 7142-PE).              They will also be
complemented by a technical assistance from a JSDF grant, a technical assistance loan currently
under preparation and by a further analytical work on food aid programs. Support from other
agencies has also been important for the implementation of the PSRL, including on
decentralization by the IADB, in health by IADB, PAHO, USAID and DFID and in Education
by IADB, USAID, DFID, GTZ and CIDA.
5.      As explained in more detail below (in sections IV and V), the main achievements of
PSRL I11consist of
ComponentI:Improve the anti-povertyfocus of public expenditures:
        The Priority Social Programs (PSPs) are being protected despite pressures arising from
        demands for increased teacher and health worker salaries and from new administrative
        needs linked to decentralization;
        Targetingof several key anti-poverty programshas improved;
        Legislation has been approved to reduce untargeted subsidies to highincome pensioners;
        Legislation presented to Congress includes the decentralization of food aid programs with
        measuresto improve targeting andperformance-management.
Component 2: Improve the access of thepoor to health and educationprograms
        Significant gains in health care coverage have been obtained and pro-poor reforms in
        health policy are becoming mainstreamed;
        Progress has been made in developing the education sector's human resources
        management system.
Component3: Improve the transparency and social oversight of resource allocation
        Transparency has improved with the widespread implementation of a user-friendly
        information system that allows beneficiaries to monitor budgets and expendituresfor all
        PSPs and physical goals and results for a group of PSPs;
        Social Participation was strengthened by the launch of user satisfaction scorecards and
       the institutionalization of user satisfaction surveys and by the approval of new
       Transparency Legislation.

                           11. THE ECONOMICAND SOCIAL SETTING

A. PoliticalContext

7.      The arrival of President Toledo has strengthened democracy in Peru. After a decade o f
the Fujimori regime and a short transitional government, President Toledo was elected to office
amidst an economic recession. Beginning its period in July 2001, the new government received
support from the international community at the Madrid Consultative Group Meeting in October
2001, signed a two-year Stand-By Agreement with the IMF in February 2002, and a National
Agreement ("Acuerdo National") to catalyze consensus between the major political parties,
unions and civil society on an ambitious poverty reduction agenda supported by fiscal discipline
and decentralization inJuly 2002.
8.      Though the economy i s stable and growing, the Government's agenda continues to face
difficult political challenges. Political tensions have risen, but the administration has so far
maintainedlegislative support for keeping the reform program on track. By end-2002, a regional
protest in Arequipa stopped the privatization of two power plants. In May 2003, the country
entered into a state of emergency to deal with a strike by public sector workers and agriculture
producers.    Recently, elected regional governments are pressing for greater transfers some
remain opposed while others are reaching a more realistic approach, looking for ways to balance
their finances with their own initiatives. Nevertheless, the Government has maintained fiscal
responsibility. In April it passed a revised Law of Fiscal Prudence and Transparency; and in
June-July, i t approved tax and spending measures to finance the increased wages, rather than
seeking a higher deficit.
9.      A new Cabinet was appointed inJuly. The new Prime Minister, Beatriz Merino, and her
team have brought renewed strength to the Government's reform program.               Her plan is
comprehensive and ambitious and includes a new system of concessions that would be attractive
to the regional governments, a tax reform and fiscal measures to ensure the fiscal sustainability
of the reform process, and the merging and decentralization of the social programs, including the
introduction of conditioned transfers, benchmarks and performance management at the
subnational level. She also declared a state of emergency in the Education Sector. The polls
have reacted very favorably to the new Cabinet, giving it approval ratings of over 50 percent.
The international markets have also reacted favorably: by end-August, the EMBI fell to its
lowest historic level during the present administration: 357 basis points.

B. MacroeconomicConditionsand Outlook

10.     The political environment has not affected the continued improvement of the
economy. In 2002, a year of deep recession for Latin America (average GDP growth was -1.2
percent), Peru's growth was highest in the region.          Led by mining, manufacturing and
construction, real GDP grew 5.3 percent (nearly two points above the original forecasts of 3.5
percent). In 2003, GDP growth in the non-primary sectors slowed down in April-May, but



                                                 3

improved in June, indicating that the projected 4 percent growth i s likely to be achieved (Figure
1). The annual inflation rate at 1.5 percent (end-of period) was the second lowest inthe region in
2002. InJuly 2003, following a four month consecutive decline, inflation was at 2 percent year
over year; near the bottom of the Central Bank's target range of 1.5-3.5 percent for 2003.
International reserves are adequate-more            than twice the level of short term external debt
liabilities-and    increasing due to a dynamic export performance and strong private capital-
namely foreign direct investment-inflows           into sizable mining investment projects, which put
moderate pressure on the Nuevo Sol to appreciate. Supported by declining international interest
rates, spreads on local and dollar interest rates remain stable. The unemployment rate shows a
moderate declining trend since March, although unemployment in Lima has not fallen and most
employment increases have been concentrated inlarge firms.

11.      The economic programsigned under the Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF is on
track and international markets remain confident that it will continue on sound course. All
Stand-by performance criteria and most structural benchmarks were met for the end of June.
Structural benchmarks include a revised Fiscal Prudence and Transparency Law (FPTL), new
proposed legislation on tax reform (including the elimination of regional and sectoral tax
exemptions), and legislation on fiscal decentralization.            Negotiations for a new Arrangement
would start late this year. EMBI spreads on Peruvian external bonds have followed a declining
trend, linked to domestic political events: it decreased from a peak 820 basis points in August
2002 to 420 basis points last May, then increased to 490 basis points following the events that
led to the Cabinet reshuffle last July, and bottomed down again to a historic low level of 357
end-August following new Prime Minister Merino's announcement of "strict austerity" as
general policy, and consolidation of the reform o f the state, tax, social security, decentralization

and education as specific policy priorities. Currently, Peru's spreads are in line with those of
Mexico and Panama.
12.      A marked improvement in external conditions-terms                               of trade and capital
inflows-have         contributed to Peru's economic recovery, healthy external balances and
solid reserve position.          Supported by a 2.5 percent increase in the terms of trade, due to
increasing mineral prices and falling oil prices, exports grew 9.1 percent in 2002 and imports 2.3
percent, a trend that continued up to the first semester of 2003. As a result, the current account
deficit decreased to about 2 percent of GDP in 2002. Significant public and private capital
inflows of about US$1 billion also contributed to an increase in gross international reserves of
about US$832 million in2002. Inflows remained strong as of mid-2003.
13.     Fiscal balances are also improving based on two pillars: tax reform and austere
expenditure policies. A projected small primary surplus for 2003, will be the first since 1998
(Figure 3), and the 2 percent o f GDP fiscal deficit target of the Non-Financial Public Sector
(NFPS) (consistent with a combined fiscal deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP), as contained in the
FPTL, i s estimated to be met this year for the first time. These achievements are partly the
outcome of a gradual tax reform that aims to increase revenues, widen the tax base and give the
tax collection agency strengthened powers to reduce tax evasion.                               Following several
administrative tax reform measures adopted in 2002, Congress approved a tax package on July
2003, including a one-percentage point VAT rate increase through end-2004, and excise taxes
hikes on alcoholic and petroleum products. Tax measures have led to a marked improvement in
the tax ratio, which was close to 13 percent o f GDP in the first quarter o f 2003 (Figure 2), and
projectedto reach 12.7 percent of GDP by end-2003. Improving fiscal balances also result from
austere expenditure policies.          These include cuts in the President's salary by 30 percent,
ministers' salaries by 20 percent and other public officials between 10-30 percent depending on
the salary earned. Goods and services expenditures were also reduced by 5 percent.                              The
Government has requested extraordinary powers to Congress to approve the last set of tax reform
measures announced in late July,* and resisted populist pressures for additional spending from
newly created regional governments in the draft budget law for 2004. Both actions are essential
to meet a projected 1.5 percent of GDP fiscal deficit target of the NFPS, as required by the
revamped Fiscal Responsibility Law for 2004.




2. Key pending measures include the elimination of regional and sectoral tax exemptions, the re-launchingof the
   single unified minimum tax for small and medium firms, and further administrative measures to strengthen
   income tax administration. The reform could also lower the VAT rate from 19 percent to 18 percent (reversing
   the recent rise), but imposinga financial transactions tax, although only for transactions above a certain amount.

14.     Authorities have adopted debt management measures to increase Peru's medium
term debt sustainability. Although Peru's debt is high, vulnerability indicators have improved
over the past few years (Table 1). Public debt ratios, in particular, have decreased: the public
sector debt ratio i s estimated to decrease from 46.1 percent of GDP in 2002 to 44.3 percent of
GDP in 2003; and, following a successful Brady bond debt buyback of US$923 million in
February 2002, the public external debt service ratio will decrease from 31.6 percent of exports
in2002 to 22.0 percent of exports in2003. The public debt profile makes Peruless vulnerable to
sudden changes in investor sentiment compared to other Latin American emerging markets:
external debt accounts for about 78 percent and i s virtually all medium and long term, with
almost three-quarters committed to multilateral and bilateral creditors. Moreover, international
reserves ratios are stable and increasing, and the share o f foreign currency deposits in total
banking deposits is stable. In addition, the economy is buffered by a fiscal consolidation, a
managedfloating exchange rate regime, a well capitalized banking system, diversifiedtrade links
and limited dependence on financing from international capital markets. In the medium term,
and    according      to   the    revised    Multi-Annual Macroeconomic       Framework         (Marc0
Macroecono'mico Multianual-MMM                in Spanish), public debt would decrease to a sound
benchmark of 40 percent of GDP by 2006. Bank debt sustainability analysis confirms that Peru
could achieve this benchmark if it continues to have growth rates above 4 percent and obtains
primary fiscal surpluses close to 1percent of GDP in 2005-06.3

15.     Consolidationof Peru's medium-termfiscal stance relies onexternalfinancing. Peru
requires a minimumexternal fiscal support of US$1.5 billion during the period 2003-05 (Table
2). Assuming compliance with the fiscal deficit targets of the FTRL and growth o f 4 percent of
GDP, Peru's financing needs are approximately US$2.7 billion in 2003, of which about 55
percent correspond to public debt amortization. Projected external sources of financing represent
about 80 percent (US$1.9 billion) o f total needs, of which US$1.5 billion i s expected to be
budget support. The estimated increase in financing needs in the next two years is due to two
factors: (i)  scheduled amortization payments have an additional bump o f about US$500 million
in 2005, bringing the share of public debt amortization in total financing needs to about 75
percent in 2005; and (ii)       projected sources have a shortfall from the phasing out o f privatization
revenues. Peru's debt management strategy under the revised Marc0 Macroeconbmico
Multianual (MMM) is based on minimizing the cost of new borrowing and on extending
maturity through multilateral financing. Multilateral debt i s about 450 basis points below market
rates, and additional domestic debt i s not a cheaper substitute for multilateral financing and
would worsen Peru's repayment profile.                      As domestic interest rates-on nuevos soles or
dollars-are     substantially higher than those from multilateral financing, and as the domestic
market remains reluctant to absorb notes beyond a three-year horizon-which                  means that any
bond issued in 2003 would likely be repaid in 2005-further                       domestic debt would only
complicate an already difficult debt amortization profile scheduled for that year.

C. Poverty and social indicators

16.     The economic growth of 2002 had a positive effect on reducing poverty. The poverty
and extreme poverty rates diminished by about 1 percent in 2002, while unemployment has
fallen from about 10 percent to just over 9 percent between 2000 and 2003. The poverty rate in
Peru for 2001 was estimated at about 55 percent and extreme poverty at about 25 percent (Table
3).

17.     Poverty i s much higher in the rural areas, where it reaches about 78 percent and where
extreme poverty i s about 50 percent (versus 42 percent poverty rate and 10 percent extreme
poverty rate in urban areas). Poverty also varies greatly within regions, with Sierra (mountain)
and Selva (jungle) regions much poorer than the Costa (coastal) region and Lima, the capital
city. More than half o f the extreme poor live in the rural Sierra.




                                                   a

18.     Rural areas also have worse health and education indicators than urban areas, with much
higher rates of chronic malnutrition (40 percent vs. 13 percent), infant mortality (45 per thousand
vs. 24 per thousand) and lower net attendance rates to secondary school (74 percent vs. 44
percent). Indigenous people, who account for 15 percent of the population and live mostly in
rural areas, suffer from exclusion, discrimination and poverty rates of around 70 percent.
Indigenous people and rural inhabitants also have less access to basic services such as water and
sanitation, justice or public security.
19.     Many o f the extreme poor work in agriculture and fishing (80 percent), making them
particularly vulnerable to climate shocks. Thirty percent of households report to have been
subject to exogenous shock in the last year, according to 2001 ENAHO household survey.
Natural phenomena such as the El Niiio event, droughts or avalanches affect some areas o f the
country almost every year.
20.     In contrast, health indicators have improved substantially in recent years, although they
remain below the average for countries of Peru's income level. Infant mortality rate was 33 per
thousand in 2000, down from 60 per thousand in 1991. Half of the infant mortality occurs in the
first month of life, and is connected to poor birth conditions. Chronic malnutrition (stunting) for
children under 5 was 25 percent in 2000, down from 36.5 percent in 1991.
21.     Education indicators have also improved. Access to basic education i s widespread, with a
primary attendance rate of over 90 percent, and coverage of secondary education continues to
increase despite the recent recession. Adult illiteracy rates are still high (26 percent in rural
areas) but mostly concentrated in older people. However, education quality and outcomes are
low, comparing poorly with other L A C countries, because of low effective hours of instruction,
inadequate learning materials and poor teacher quality and motivation.
22.     The quality of other social services has improved as well, although there i s still room for
further gains. A recent nationwide survey rated the quality of services of five social programs
between 3.2 and 3.6 in a 1to 5 scale (with 5 being the highest score). As well, only 5.2 percent
of people surveyed reported being the victim of corruption (paid a bribe or similar), and only 12
percent thought that hospital services were "bad".

D.Recenttrends inSocialExpenditure

23.     Since 2001, the Transition and the Toledo Governments have emphasized the importance
of increasing social expenditure and of bringing budget protection to priority social programs.
Both the National Agreement and the Basespara la Estrategia para la Superacidn de la Pobreza
call for a gradual and sustained increase in social expenditure. The National Dialogue proposes a
minimum annual increase of 0.25 percent of GDP in the national budget to education, until it
reaches a benchmark 6 percent of GDP.4 In a similar vein, the Buses para la Estrategia pura la
Superacidn de la Pobreza calls for a 2 percent of GDP increase in the overall budget assigned to
social expenditures by 2010. Recognizing these targets are ambitious and subject to budget




4.  The recently approved General Education Law also states the 6 percent of GDP target.




                                                      9

constraints derived from fiscal sustainability, the Estrutegiu also calls for a significant
restructuring of poverty alleviation programs in order to make them more efficient and effective.
24.     The share of social expenditure to GDP, after collapsing during the hyperinflation period
of the 1980s, recuperated sharply from 3.9 percent of GDP in 1990 to 6.8 percent o f GDP in
2000. The three broad components ("functions") of social expenditures in the Peruvian budget
(education, health and social assistance) have been steadily increasing (Figure 4). In recent
years, this share has continued increasing, albeit at a more moderate pace, reaching a budget
allocation equivalent to 7.1 percent o f GDP in the 2003 budget.                This is a remarkable
achievement during a period of fiscal retrenchment that reduced government non-interest
expenditure from 18.4 percent of GDP in 2000 to 17.0 percent of GDP in 2003, and cut the fiscal
deficit by a third.

        Note: Datafor 1999-2002 refers to effective expenditures, data for 2003 i s allocation.

25.     The priority social programs (PSPs) are the main source of the increase in the social
budget, rising from 0.6 percent of GDP in 1999 to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2003. PSPs comprise
the expenditures for basic education, health and community assistance, that are oriented to
expenditures and critical inputs such as textbooks and medicines, rather than the payment of
salaries or pensions (Figure 5). In this way, the Peruvian government has been protecting and
expanding the expenditures that are more easily cut during crisis, and that play a crucial role in
improving the quality o f basic services to the poor.

26.     Improving targeting in education and health i s a long-term task, as relocating schools or
health clinics i s very difficult, and new facilities are put in place gradually.            However, the
Peruvian government i s aiming to improve targeting with programs such as the Seguro Integral
de Sulud (SZS),that guarantees free access to a package of health services mostly for mothers and
children, and that puts emphasis in the poorest departments. In education, a WB-financed rural
education project targeting high-poverty rural areas has recently been approved. Other social
programs, such as food-aid programs and rural infrastructure programs, are much more flexible.
These programs have improved targeting in the past years: expenditures o f food-aid programs in
the first quintile of districts have gone up from 30 percent in 2002 to 35 percent in 2003 and 38
percent inthe 2004 budget.

                    111. THE GOVERNMENT'S MEDIUMTERM STRATEGY

A. The NationalAgreement

27.     The National Agreement i s a joint statement adopted in July 2002 by the government
with representatives of the major political parties, religious groups and civil society. It contains
29 policies directed to accomplish four objectives: (i)   Democracy and Rule of Law; (ii)           Equity
and Social Justice; (iii)   Competitiveness; (iv) Efficiency, Transparency and Decentralization.
The relevant policies aimed at poverty reduction and the social sectors state that the Government
will:
        Assign an increasing proportion of public expenditures to investments in education and
        health care, improve the efficiency of these investments and target these expenditures
        toward the poorest;
        Favor the participation of poor citizens in the identification o f needs, the design of
        solutions and the management of social programs;
        Establish systems for the identification, attention and promotion o f employment for
        people without means o f support;

    0   Encourage institutional development, efficiency, equity and transparency o f the
        government in resource allocation, especially on programs oriented to reduce poverty,
        encouraging participation and supervision by civil society organizations;

    0   Guarantee the exercise of rights and access to justice administration for the poor;

    0   Encourage a culture of prevention and control of risks and vulnerabilities, assigning
        resources for prevention, assistance and reconstruction.

B. The Strategy for Poverty Reduction

28.     The guidelines for social policy are established in the "Bases para la Estrategia de
Superacidn de la Pobreza y Oportunidades Econdmicas para 10s Pobres" ("Guidelines for a
Poverty Overcoming Strategy and Economic Opportunities for the Poor"-hereafter            Estrategia),
approved inJanuary 3rd, 2003,5 that comprise three pillars:

    0  Pillar of dignity, whose objective is to accelerate economic recovery, achieve sustainable
        growth and generate worthy and sustainable jobs, as well as to establish a social
       protection network and budget protection for priority social programs.
       Pillar of equity, whose objective is the development of human abilities that permit social
       development and the access of poor people to quality social services, such as health,
       education and culture.
       Pillar of institutionality, whose objective is to improve resource allocation transparency
        and bolster citizen involvement inits oversight.
29.    As stated inthe Estrategiaand with the support of PSFU I1and PSRL III,large numbera
of programs o f food aid, infrastructure for poor areas and social assistance for the elderly,
orphans and disabled have been grouped under the institutional umbrella of the Ministry of
Women and Development (MIMDES). To further reorganize and improve the targeting and
efficiency of these social protection programs, in the context of decentralization, the strategy
proposed a reform in their structure.          Social protection will be implemented by local
governments and would consist of three integrated programs financed by conditional transfers
regulated by MIMDES. These programs would transfer resources to the local governments
according to agreed upon procedures, objectives and targets. The proposed programs are: (i)         a
Local Development program, that will transfer resources directed to create infrastructure and
economic opportunities for the poor; (ii) Solidarity program, that will transfer the resources
                                             a
currently used for food aid to improve the vulnerable groups' quality of life; (iii)        a Family
Assistance program, that will transfer resources to assist people in physical and moral risk, and
families in catastrophic situations. The reforms leading to the new structure will be put in place
by the 2004 BudgetLaw and by the Law of Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers (IFT).6
30.    To assure the effective accomplishment of the strategy, the Inter-sectoral Commission for
Social Affairs (CIAS) of the Presidency of the Council o f Ministers i s leading the effort of
strengthening inter-sector coordination. The government i s also planning to develop a monitoring

and evaluation system for social programs that will support the Estrategia and will receive
support from a Bank-financed technical assistanceloan (TAL) underpreparation.

C. The DecentralizationProcess

31.      Significant progress has been made since 2001 in the creation of the legal framework for
decentralization.     The Decentralization Framework Law sets out the principles for: (i)               the
assignment of services and competencies (shared, exclusive and delegated) to different levels of
government; (ii)    the development of fiscal rules and transfer mechanisms; (iii) sequencing of
                                                                                             the
decentralization, starting with anti-poverty programs, to be followed by other sectoral transfers.
Other key decentralization laws have also been passed, including one for regional governments
and another for municipal governments, broadly defining their institutions, roles and resources.
Progress has also been made in drawing up the fiscal decentralization framework. Laws on fiscal
decentralization and on Inter overnmental Fiscal Transfers have been drafted in close
coordination with the Bank!            The implementation of the institutional framework for
decentralization has also substantially advanced, with the creation of the National
Decentralization Council to coordinate the decentralization process and the setting-up of regional
and local government institutions, including the consultative bodies with civil society
representation. In parallel to the PSRL, a PSAL for Growth and Decentralization i s under
preparation by the Bank with a focus on decentralization, economic growth and competitiveness.
This loan will provide the broader framework for decentralization by promoting the fiscal and
institutional framework for reform. Key components of this loan are the design of the fiscal
responsibility mechanisms for subnational government; the design of the accreditation system
and performance contracts that will help maintain minimum sectoral standards for decentralized
service delivery; civil service reform; participatory budgeting and competitiveness.
32.     While the Government has achieved progress in passing legislation that established the
overall principles for decentralization and the organization of the regional government and the
municipalities, it still has significant challenges ahead in relation to establishing the rules that
will govern the social sectors and the anti-poverty programs in a decentralized context. The IFT
draft law contains a chapter of "Programmatic Transfers" (Le. transfers subject to achieving
targets to be set by national programs). One of the contributions of PSRL I11i s the drafting o f
this chapter (see details in section IV.A.6.), and PSRL IV will contribute to drafting the
regulations for this law, while the TAL under preparation will support the implementation of the
system of programmatic transfers. Another challenge i s to define the role of the sector ministries
vis-a-vis the regional governments in health and education.                      The existing legislation i s
ambiguous about the roles of the different actors in these sectors, yet de facto the
decentralization of these sectors has already began as more than 50 percent of education and
more than 44 percent of health expenditure will be managed by the newly elected regional




7. The dialogue to draft these laws was led by the team preparing the Growth and Decentralization PSAL, with
    inputs from the PSRLteam for the chapter of the IFT law on the decentralization of food programs.

authorities in2004 (mostly for salaries).8 A clear legal basis for the decentralization of education
and health remains indispensable and will be supported by PSRL IV. This legislation should
build on international lessons suggesting that the decentralization of health and education must
clearly establish the responsibilities to be undertaken by the regions and establish the policy and
regulatory role of the sectoral ministries providing the ministries with financial and other
incentives to help them enforce their role.            Latin America offers several examples where
decentralization of the social sectors was followed by years of deterioration of these services
which forced the Central Government to reassume the financial responsibility for these sectors,
at a high fiscal cost. A transitory legal safeguard has been added to the 2004 Budget law,
prohibiting the regional government from reallocating funds assigned for health and education.


                                IV. THE SOCIALREFORMPROGRAM

33.    The social reform program supported by the PSRL has three main components: (a)
improve the anti-poverty focus of public expenditures; (b) improve access of the poor to quality
health services and education; and (c) improve transparency and participation o f the poor in
social programs. The progress achieved in these components with support of PSFU I, and I11            I1
andthe challenges for PSRLIVare described below.

A. Improvingthe anti-povertyfocus of publicexpenditures.

34.    The GOP i s improving the anti-poverty focus o f public expenditures, to reinforce its
targeting and increase its effectiveness. Four groups of activities are being implemented to
achieve this objective:

            (i)     Formulation and initialimplementation of a poverty reduction strategy.
            (ii)    Reorientation of public expenditures towards social programs that benefit the
                    poor.
            (iii)   Improvements in targeting social expenditures by reforming pension systems,
                    establishing a well-targeted anticyclical workfare program and improving
                    targeting of rural infrastructureprograms.
            (iv)    Reforming the food distribution programs by integrating them, improving
                    their targeting, and focusing on results inthe context of decentralization.

         A.1. PovertyReductionStrategy

35.    The lack of a strategy weakened the impact of Peru's anti-poverty efforts during the last
decade.   Absence of clear objectives, coexistence of overlapping social programs, lack of
coordination between sectors and programs, inadequate designs and lack of monitoring and



8. While the Framework Law mandates that Health and Education are to be transferred at the final stage of the
   process, as of 2004 the Regional Directorsof Health and Education will cease to be appointed by the sectoral
   ministries and will become officials of the Regional Authorities (with technical accountability to the sectoral
   ministries). Also, against the letter of the law, a Supreme Decree of August 2003 transferred the teacher
   payrollsof Callaoto the RegionalAuthorities and opens the door to do the same in Lima during2004.




                                                      14

evaluation were some of the main problems in this area. These problems were reinforced by a
clientelistic and untransparent use of the anti-poverty programs. This led to inefficiencies,
increased administrative costs, poor targeting of beneficiaries and the prevalence of programs
that do not contribute to reducing poverty or to increasing human capital.
36.      Duringthe transition government and under PRSL I, "Social Letter"(Cartu Social) was
                                                               a
approved by the Mesa de Concertacidn de Lucha contra la Pobreza. The Social Letter
established broad guidelines for social and economic policy adopted by the government, civil
society, the Catholic Church and international cooperation agencies for poverty reduction.
During the preparation of PSRLII, in December 2001 President Toledo issued a Social Policy
Letter stating the "pillars" that guide the government's social policy (dignity, equity and
institutionality). In July 2002, the National Agreement (Acuerdo Nacional) was signed by
representatives o f political, religious, civil society and Government, approving 29 policies,
including one for poverty reduction.
37.     The poverty reduction strategy was further developed duringthe preparation of PSRL I11
with the publication of the Bases para la Reduccidn de la Pobreza. The Bases are described
above (Section IIlB).
38.     Under PSRL lV, the anti-poverty strategy will become fully mainstreamed into the
Governments' planning and budgeting process by the adoption of a a macro-social multi-annual
framework as a chapter of the macroeconomic multi-annual framework. This policy will have
several advantages: (i) the macroeconomic multi-annual framework i s institutionalized and has
to be approved each year by the council of ministers, (ii)  it will set the base for a multi-annual
budgetingin the social sectors, and could provide a clearer protection for priority programs, (iii)
will establish more clear objectives, goals and policies for social policy in a medium-term
strategy.
          A.2. Shifting to Pro-Poor Protected Expenditure
39.     Budgetary protection under PSRLs has played a critical role in preserving the quality o f
pro-poor social expenditure, and was designed to play a countercyclical role. The Government
initiated a social protection policy in the 2001 budget (table 3).        It selected 11 programs
distributed among eight sectors: education and culture, health, transport, justice, social and
community assistance, sanitation, agriculture and energy.        Budget protection consisted of
assigning a minimum envelope for the 11 programs equivalent to US$1 billion (Y3.5 billion),
representing about 10 percent o f the national budget or 2 percent of GDP. This protection was
initiated as a tool to preserve a minimum level of quality social investment during fiscal
adjustment and economic contraction. It then became an important instrument of the overall
strategy for poverty reduction in the medium term.
40.     Under PSRL 11, the Government complied with the execution of the 2001 budget for the
protected programs.    Spending in these programs surpassed the target, despite recessionary
trends. Four issues, though, were identified reviewing the experience of 2001: (i)           budget
protection at the level of aggregate sector expenditure was also needed to guarantee "floor"
spending required to make progress towards medium-term development goals; (ii) broad    the
coverage of the protected programs and large amount assigned to them increased budget rigidity;
(iii)fewindividualprogramsexhibiteddeviationsbetweenplannedandexecutedexpenditures,
     a
with education programs showing a significant under-execution, and social and community
assistance indicating over-execution; and (iv) critical monitoring and evaluation of protected


                                                 15

spending was missing. As a result, the protection policy was refined. Budgetary protection at
the level o f aggregate sector expenditure was introduced. Protection became limited to six
programs in three sectors (down from 11 programs in eight sectors), with a global allocation
equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP, which reduced budget rigidity (Table 4). To deal with
deviations between planned and executed expenditure, individual indicative targets for each of
the programs were again defined for 2002, but with flexible contingency clauses for the event o f
a budgetary resources shortfall or to allow for up to 30 percent spending reallocations from
underexecuting to overexecuting programs. Inaddition, the government agreed to develop pilot
user-friendly monitoring and evaluation tools for PSPs, supported by the SIAF, and in some
cases performance management contracts for specific projects (sub-categories of the PSPs) likeA
Trabajar or the Mother and Child Health Insurance (SIS-MI).

41.     Under PSRL 111, the Government had a mixed performance in the implementation of
budgetary protection. The global executed expenditure for all six programs exceeded its
aggregate target (adjusted inreal terms) in 2002. However, the original individual targets for the
three education PSPs--pre-primary education, primary education and secondary education-were
missed. In2003, the approved budget allocations for each of the three sectors were also met, but
individual allocations missed their original target in four out o f the six programs (pre-primary
and primary education, and collective and individual health programs).                In view of these
outcomes, the Bank agreed to allow inter-program transfers up to 50 percent of their original
allocations, and in exchange the authorities complied with two compensatory actions. First, to
offset original budget underallocations to individual PSPs in 2003, authorities approved
supplementary budget allocations for about W O O million, bringing five individual PSP
allocations to at least their executed 2002 level, adjusted in real terms. Second, the 2004 Budget
Law (art. 8) explicitly banned further diversion of funds from the PSPs ineducation.

42.    Decentralization has brought new challenges to budgetary protection policy. In the
context of the decentralization process, four new issues have emerged in 2003: (i)   priority social
spending i s being reviewed, with significant uncertainty arising from the transfer of education
and health sectors to regional governments; (ii)    a level of under-execution i s likely from the
budget shortfall of privatization revenues earmarked to finance the PSPs executed by subnational
governments; (iii)  social community and assistance programs addressing extreme poverty are
being reorganizedinto three funds, and at the same time their execution i s being decentralized to
the subnational level; and (iv) given decentralized execution, the need of a monitoring and
evaluation system i s even more critical.
43.    To address these challenges, under PSRLIV,the government and the Bank have adjusted
the PSPs. These adjustments aim to preserve the national priorities through the decentralized
programs, while improving their focus, efficiency, transparency and monitoring mechanisms.
They include:
       (i) AMarcoSocialMultianual(MSM)isbeingdesignedtoincludeasachapterin
       the Marco Macroeconomico Multianual (MMM). The MMM provides an annual
       consensus on national macro/fiscal priorities, and i s approved by the Cabinet, every year,
       subject to quarterlyreviews and publishedby the media.
       (ii) New legislation topreservepriority social spending in education and health
       under the decentralization process will be submitted to Congress. According to the
       decentralization chronogram, a new law will be submitted by March 30, 2004. The new
       law will define a policy framework (rationale, objectives, and instruments) and norms for
       conditional transfers to regional and local governments in both sectors. It will include
       physical and financial benchmarks and monitoring indicators, periodic reporting
       requirements, and incentives and performance agreements. This law will be consistent
       with the law of fiscal transfers being proposed under PSRLI11(see section below).
       (iii) Global execution is adjusted to at least 85 percent for 2003 and budget
       reallocations from under-pe~ormingto over-pe$orming programs are reduced to a
       maximum of 30 percent. The 2004 approved budget will maintain the global execution,
       and the execution level of no less than three individual budget allocations for the PSPs,
       at least at their 2003 levels in real terms. For 2004, the execution of the PSPs for the
       months prior to the appraisal of PSRL IV will have reached at least 85% of their global
       target with individualreallocations not above 30 percent (target to be measured according
       to the average seasonality of 2001, 2002, and 2003). N o diversion of funds from the
       PSPs to payrolls, benefits or to other programs will be allowed. The authorities indicated
       that the 2004 budget figures for individual PSPs under PSRL IV are only "floor"
       allocations that will be increased if tax reform i s completed successfully before end-2003,
       and that the final allocations will be contained inthe approved Budget Law.
       (iv)    Based on the successful pilot experiences and supported by the TAL, the SZAF
       will expand its user-friendly and decentralized management system to track and control
       the implementation of conditional transfers to local governments by MWIDESRONDEL;
       and will monitor benchmarks agreed for the remaining PSPs (based on their intermediate
       indicators, performance management contracts and/or accreditation mechanisms).

           A.3. Targeting of Socialprograms: PensionReform'

44.     Peru's pension system i s not achieving its main goal of providing income security to the
elderly. Only 15 percent of the labor force contributes to one of the existing programs, and less
than 25 percent of the elderly receive a benefit. Considering that nearly 40 percent of the
population aged 65 and more lives on an income below the poverty line, and that participation in
the pension system i s strongly related with income level (only 1.6 percent of the poorest quintile
o f workers make contributions to Social Security), it i s safe to assert that the system needs
important changes. The situation in Peru i s one of the worst in South America, only Paraguay
has lower social security coverage than Peru.
45.     While the coverage of the system i s low, Peru makes a significant fiscal effort to finance
the pension systems from general revenues, partly as a result of the transition costs generated by
the 1992 reform and partly due to the deficit of the Civil Servants program. The deficit of the
public pension systems in 2002 was close to 2 percent of GDP, equivalent to 69 percent of the
amount set aside to service Peru's external debt; 63 percent of public spending on education; 1.8
times the government's expenditure on healthcare; and 1.4 times the amount set aside to alleviate
poverty.
46.     The pension system in Peru has three main components. The Private Pensions System
(Sistema Privado de Pensiones-SPP)            was created in 1992 to replace the old unfunded system
and i s organized as a competitive, multiple provider and individual account based scheme, where
workers make monthly contributions and receive, after retirement, a benefit in the form of an
annuity or a scheduled withdrawal from their accounts. The system i s run by four pension fund
managers ("Administradora de Fondos de Pensiones"-AFP), andhas almost 3 million affiliated
workers, but only 1 million contributes each month.                    The pension funds have on average
obtained a significant return (close to 7 percent real), but their costs are too high, close to 40
percent of net contributions (of which one third i s used to pay a disability and survivors
insurance). The fees do not reflect high operational costs, which have steadily declined in the
last few years, but rather a lack of competition and transparency inthe market. The supervisory
agency i s a specialized division of the Superintendency of Banks and Insurance, which has been
trying to promote competition and reductions infees, with little success.
47.     The second component is the National Pensions System (Sistema Nacional de
Pensiones-SNP),       a traditional PAYG scheme that continued for some workers after the 1992
reform. It pays benefits after 20 years of contributions and 65 years of age; benefits increase with
the years of contributions. As o f December 2001, the average pension was approximately 70
percent of average wages. SNP also pays benefits to workers retired before the 1992 reform and
provides a Recognition Bond to those who joined the SPP but had contributed before. The
program i s managed by a central pension office ("OJicina de Nomalizacidn Previsi0naZ"-
ONP), an autonomous agency attached to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The 2002
deficit of SNP was equivalent to 0.6 percent o f GDP. Several parametric reforms, introduced by
Law 27617 in early 2002, have corrected a medium to long term tendency to increase deficits,




9. This section is based on the findings of a World Bank study of the Peruvian pension system. (Peru-Restoring
    Pillars of Old Age Income Security) The draft of this study i s currently beingreviewedby the Government.




                                                        18

and current projections indicate that the cost will slowly decline to around 0.2 percent o f GDP in
the medium term.
48.     Finally, a civil servants program called Ckdula Viva (CV) offers very generous benefits
and runs a large deficit, close to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2002. Workers can retire after fifteen
years of service, with no minimum age, and benefits are equal to 100 percent of the wage of
active civil servants. The government has tried to close the system and limit benefits since the
early 1990s, but legal challenges and political pressures have weakened these attempts. In 1996
the Government passed Decree 817, establishing maximum benefits, limiting access to the
system and, more important, creating a central registry o f all participants, managed by ONP.
This decree was repealed by the Constitutional Court in 1998 and the effort to centralize the
administration was then terminated.
49.     The most critical problem in Peru's pension system i s the very low coverage, especially
among the poor, and the lack of a reasonable strategy to overcome it. While the main cause can
be linked to weak labor markets and extended informality, specific measures can be adopted to
improve access, without generating additional fiscal pressures or creating negative incentives for
labor force formalization. As fiscal resources are limited, efforts should be made to increase
compliance within the existing systems by improving enforcement and by increasing incentives,
and to protect the poor elderly excluded from the system. New, targeted non-contributory
benefits designed to complement the pension system benefits could be created to provide basic
assistance to the poorest elderly, preserving the fiscal sustainability. A medium term strategy
should be developed to attain these goals, but until recently no government office had such
responsibility. As of mid 2003, most strategic decisions were taken at the Ministry of Economy
and Finance, although there was no office or staff formally responsible for this.
50.    The fiscal cost of C V and SNP limits the possibility o f developing a targeted anti poverty
program for the elderly. Expenditures in these two programs are inflexible, but they should
decline over time, provided that no new challenges to the legal framework are successful.
Simulations prepared by World Bank staff indicate that expected savings in the next few years
should be enough to finance a targeted non-contributory benefit to cover poor individuals aged
75 and more.
51.    Finally, SPP has some important efficiency problems, affecting the cost of the system for
active workers and reducing the incentive to participate. Both at the accumulating stage and
after retirement the level of competition among providers i s low, resulting in high costs for
workers and high returns for fund managers (in 2002 the average return on equity for pension
fund managing companies was close to 80 percent). The excessive costs in the accumulating
stage results in lower income for workers, and on top o f that, high fees in the annuity markets
results in lower retirement benefits.      The regulatory framework i s designed assuming a
competitive environment, but the industry appears to have, as in other countries in the region, an
oligopolistic structure.
52.    Government Strategy and Actions under PRSL 111. The pension system inPeru is not
offering adequate income security to the elderly. Improvements in the design and operation o f
the system are necessary, focusing in two areas: (i)      institutional organization and strategic
planning; and (ii) the high fiscal cost and serious equity problems of CV. The government has
recognized these problems and several actions have been taken to address them. Among those,
the most relevant are:



                                                 19

    (A)To solve the institutionalproblems and increase coverage, MEFhas issued RM326-2003-
        EF/15, charging the Direccidn de Asuntos Econdmicos y Sociales (DGAES), with the
        authority to:
        (i) Develop a strategy to increase the coverage of the system, considering the
               coordination of contributory and noncontributory schemes.
        (ii) DevelopastrategytoincreaseefficiencyandtransparencyinSPP,SNPandCV,
               inorder to reduce costsfor workers andpublic finances.
        (iii)Collect,processanddisseminateinformationaboutthedifferentpensionsystems,
               including periodic statistical reports, actuarial studies, short and long term
               projections, fiscal and equity impact assessments, links to the tax system, et
               cetera.
        (iv)   Prepare draft legislation or norms to implement the strategies described above.
    (B)To reduce the inequity and fiscal costs linked to the C V and improve control over the
        system, Decree 870/2002 was passed in February 2003 requiring that all entities paying
        benefits under the CV scheme must present actuarial balances, and send the basic
        information to ONP. As a result, ONP and the DGAES should have access to detailed
        information regarding the liabilities of most public entities by the time PSRL lV is
       prepared. Also, new legislation was approved by Congress in July 2003 (Laws 28046
        and 28047) including:
        (i) ThecreationofanewcontributiontotheCVschemetobemadebybeneficiaries
               of the system earning more than S/43,600 a year. Contributions rates will be
               similar to those of the income tax.
        (ii)   An increase inthe contribution rate paidby active workers to CV from the current
               6 percent to 13 percent immediately and further increases to reach 27 percent by
               2009.
        (iii)  Establishment of a maximum benefit of S/3,100 per month
53.    These measures should produce additional income to finance CV by approximately S/ 80
million in 2004, a relatively low amount. However, as the main problem of Cedula Viva in the
last decade has been the inability of the Government to effectively close the access to the system,
the impact o f higher contribution rates and lower benefits for future retirees should result in a
realignment of incentives to join C V and, consequently, a reduction in pressure from different
groups of civil servants to gain access. While these changes represent a clear improvement, past
experience indicate that there i s a significant risk of reversal by the Constitutional Court and
careful monitoring will be necessary.
54.    Finally, the Government has taken measures to increase transparency and reduce costs in
the SPP, promoting competition and efficiency. The SBS issued a regulation in mid-June,
modifying disability and survivors' insurance. The new regulation eliminates a scheme created
soon after the new SPP started operations requiring beneficiaries o f survivor or disability
benefits to obtain an annuity from the same company that provided the basic insurance. The new




                                                20

system will allow beneficiaries to choose from among several annuity providers, resulting in
more transparency, competition and reduced costs for pensioners."
55.     By the time PSRL N is negotiated it is foreseen that:
        (9           DGAES should have prepared and published documents describing the
                     strategy it will adopt to increase coverage and reduce inefficiencies in the
                     system, defined an action plan and schedule, and has initiated its
                     implementation;
        (ii)         An information system should be operative, resulting in publication of
                     quarterly statistical reports and other documents including the financial and
                     actuarial balances of the SNP and C V institutions. Following Decree 026-
                     2003-EF, ONP should collect information on the actuarial status of each
                     institution participating in C V and report to DGAES. This includes detailed
                     demographic and financial data, which should be part of the information
                     system developed by DGAES;
        (iii)        The changes in CV legislation approved by laws 28046 and 28047 should be
                     fully implemented; and
        (iv)         B y mid-2004 affiliates will be able to switch funds by internet, and select
                     annuity providers using an electronic bidding process that protects them and
                     promotes reductions incosts.

          A.4. Targeting of SocialPrograms-The               A Trabajurworkfare program

56.     Three years of economic downturn (1998-2001) had adverse effects on the employment
and incomes of the poor. The poverty rate went up 7 points, from 48 percent to 55 percent,
between 1997 and 2001 and urban unemployment went up, reaching 9 percent. However, the
government didn't have social protection programs clearly designed to deal with this issue.
During the first months of its administration the Toledo government put in place a workfare
program known as "A Trubujur", with urban and rural components.                       The rural component
combines the social protection objective with that of rehabilitating and maintaining small
infrastructure-mainly      rural roads.     The urban component is more tilted towards the social
protection objective. The government has implementedbothA Trubujur programs, generating in
2002 and 2003 the equivalent to 70,000 six-month jobs in 1,500 subprojects in more than one
thousand rural districts, at a cost of approximately US$86 million, and 125,000 four-month jobs
in2,600 urbansubprojects at a public cost of US$54 million.
57.     With PSRL I1support, the main characteristics of these programs were established, with
emphasis on adequate targeting: (i) 300 soles wage was fixed to self-target the poor; (ii)
                                           a                                                                    a
geographical targeting mechanism that uses a poverty map to allocate resources to districts was
used in both urban and rural A Trubujur programs; (iii) on non-salary expenditures were
                                                                    caps
established, and (iv) it was agreed to carry out impact evaluations o f both programs.



10. Also, SBS i s preparing regulationsto increase the transparency at the time any beneficiary selects an annuity
    provider, by designing an electronic quoting system, and also to simplify the process of switching between
    AFPs, in order to promote competition and reduce fees. These last two regulations should be complete and
    implementedby the time PSRL IV is prepared.




                                                       21

58.     During the design period, there was some concern about the self-targeting wage rate.
Although earnings distribution data indicated that this rate was adequate to target the poorest
income quintile in urban areas, in rural areas incomes are lower. For PSRL 111, before a second
stage o f A Trubujur rural was initiated, the government did a study on the adequacy of the 300
soles wage for rural areas. The study revealed that the wage was not higher than the rural
equilibrium wage and that less than 10 percent o f beneficiaries where non-poor," revealing a
well-targeted program.
59.     The successful targeting of both A Trubujur programs has been confirmed with
household survey data, complying with the goals set for PSRL 111. In A Trubujur Rural, 45
percent o f beneficiaries come from the poorest income quintile and 79 percent from the first and
second income quintiles. InA Trubujur Urbuno, 52 percent of beneficiaries belong to the first
urban quintile, and 32 percent to the first quintile. Thirty percent o f urban beneficiaries suffered
a shock that reduced family income in the last year. These numbers show a program much better
targeted that any other national social program in Peru, reflecting a good combination o f
geographical targeting and self-targeting with the wage. The first i s probably more effective in
rural areas, andthe second inurban areas.
60.     Maintaining the focus of the program on transferring income to the poor and controlling
administrative expenses has also been addressed within PSRL III.A Trubujur Rural take
measures to limit its non-wage expenditures to 60 percent of the total, higher because it also has
a infrastructure maintenance objective.         In A Trubujur Urbuno, the program financing to
subprojects has a cap of 25 percent for non-wage expenditures. Administrative costs have been
of 10.5 percent o f the total, but this include some 2 percent of fixed start-up costs. Direct income
transfers (wage expenditures) as a proportion o f all costs, are 63 percent-efficient by
international standards.
61.     Finally, evaluations have been made. The impact evaluation for A Trubujur Urbuno has
now been completed by an independent researcher, after an extra sample of the national
household survey (ENAHO) was taken for program beneficiaries and its households.                  The
evaluation shows the program i s well-targeted, but also that it only gives expected additional
income of one fourth of the total wage. That is, if the beneficiaries haven't been working for A
Trubujur, their expected income would have been of 220 soles. For A Trubujur Rural, the
analysis done early on wage adequacy has been complemented by a qualitative evaluation.
62.     Due to the economic recovery, now in its second year, and to the efforts to transfer social
protection responsibility to the municipalities the government i s downsizing the anticyclical A
Trubujur programs. A Trubujur Rural is virtually finished as no budget has been made available
for this program in 2004. A Trubujur Urbuno i s downsizing its operations, and may also be
discontinued in 2003.

          AS. Targeting of SocialPrograms-Rural infrastructure programs

63.     One of the main causes of the highpoverty rate in rural areas i s lack o f infrastructure. To
overcome this, over the last decade Peru developed numerous and overlapping rural

                                                   22

infrastructure programs, including some components of Foncodes, Pronamach, PAR, Caminos
Rurales and others, that had a total 2002 annual budget of S/. 200 million. Policies aimed to
improve their efficiency have been under way under several WB projects, including
Pronamach's Rural Poverty Alleviation Project (closing shortly), Caminos Rurales I1 and
Pronasar Rural Water and Sanitation project (approved in 2002).
64.      PSRLIand 11. With PSRL Isupport there was an initial attempt to improve efficiency
by strengthening the coordination between key programs. Specific improvements included: (i)
the use of the same poverty map, (ii)    coordination of wages paid, (iii)
                                                                         monitoring and evaluation
procedures and (iv) the introduction of performance agreements with MEF. In PSRL 11, the
unification of some of these programs was attempted, and a Supreme Decree merging Foncodes,
the Pronamach and the small projects within INADE was issued.               However, institutional
resistance stopped the process, even after a second Supreme Decree ratifying the first was issued.
More recently, the MIMDES issued a resolution merging three specialized agencies (Foncodes,
PAR andCoopop) into the structure of the line ministry.
65.     PSRL 111. The preparation of PSRL I11included a trigger to improve the targeting of
rural infrastructure programs. The goal set in the trigger has been surpassed and currently 52
percent of expenditures go to the first district quintile and 80 percent go to the first and second
district quintiles.
66.     PSRL IV.The government is now studying the creation of a unified local infrastructure
fund that will operate through municipalities as part of the decentralization process. As the WB
i s actually processing, in parallel to the PSRL, a Growth and Fiscal Decentralization Loan, and
as several of these rural infrastructure programs are going to be transferred to regional and local
governments, the infrastructureprograms will be addressedinthe future by this other loan.

           A.6. Decentralization and reform of food programs

67.     The government spends approximately S/. 850 million per year (0.45 percent of GDP) in
food programs that reach 44 percent of the Peruvian households and 61 percent o f the poor
households. These include the municipal Vas0 de Leche program and other food programs
managed by PRONAA, an agency under MIMDES. The PRONAA program includes: i)infant
food programs, targeted to pre-schoolers with nutritional objectives, ii)school feeding programs,
with nutritional and educational objectives; and iii)food programs for adults (the largest of
which i s ComedoresPopulares).
68.     Government Strategy. Duringthe 1990s,these programs were subject to corruption and
clientelistic misuse and were fragmented in more than a dozen programs spread over three
different institutions (PRONAA, INS and FONCODES), with overlapping beneficiaries. Most
of them also lackedclear objectives, had almost no monitoring and evaluation, andits linkages to
health, sanitation, interventions in mothers' education and capacity building at the community
level were weak. The Transition and Toledo Governments have sought to reform these programs
to allow them to play a role in a safety net, because they reach a large proportion of the poor and
have some self-targeting elements induced by the quality of the food and the requirement that
mothers participate and collaborate with their time. A reform of these programs was necessary
to improve targeting, transparency and participation, developing new strategies to make them
efficient in pursuit of clearly set goals. But this proved to be a daunting task, as political
pressures from long-time beneficiaries, mayors and lobbies from food producers pressed hard to



                                                 23

avoid any changes. After makingprogress in several areas, the government has now decided to
launch an over-arching strategy for reform taking advantage of the decentralization process.
69.     PSRL Iand 11. In 2001 and supported by PSRL I,the transition government greatly
improved the transparency and accountability of the food programs, and began unifyingthem by
transferring the FONCODES' infant and school feeding programs to INS. In2002 within PSRL
I1and exceeding the original benchmark, the GOP approved a Supreme Decree unifying all the
central government food programs in PRONAA and established a multisectoral Board o f
Directors for PRONAA, so as to improve links with the education and health sectors. The
Ministry of Health normative role in nutrition matters was confirmed in that process. The
government also set and complied with targeting goals, and reduced the budget for Comedores
(the worst targeted and least efficient food program but also one of the more difficult to reform)
as it launched the A Trubujur program as part of its social protection strategy.
70.     PSRL 111. The reform path set in 2002 for PSRL I11 was to continue improving
targeting, introduce health and nutritional education components on the food programs, produce
impact evaluations or baselines and develop a conditional cash-transfer pilot program. However,
the global strategy for the reform of the food programs has been modified in the context of the
decentralization process. In this process, social protection programs, including food programs,
will be among the first to be transferred to sub-national governments, this will be done together
with the introduction of mechanisms to reinforce accountability and participation in social
programs. Beginning in October 2003, food programs will be transferred to municipalities,
which i s consistent with the fact that the Vusode Leche program, that accounts for 40 percent of
the food programs' expenditures, has been managed by municipalities since its creation almost
twenty years ago.
71.     However, the experience of Vuso de Leche program i s a clear example that
decentralization does not necessarily mean an improve in efficiency or transparency. A recent
WB-financed PETS study showed that only 70 percent of Vuso de Leche transfers to
municipalities reach the local committees in charge of the food distribution. The study also
found that 40 percent of the food distributed to the households i s not consumed by the target
population (children less than 5 year old), but by other household members. Another WB recent
impact study on Vuso de Leche (Alderman and Stifel) showed that while the program i s well
targeted to the poor, with local women's committees contributing to targeting, its food
contribution does not have a measurable nutritional impact.
72.     Inthis context, the PSRLI11reforms of the food aid programs have beenredefined. The
GOP now faces the difficult task of completing the unification o f food programs, initiating their
decentralization and-in      that difficult context-continue improving their targeting and
performance. As the decentralization of the programs requires a redefinition of the procedures
followed by the food programs, the Government views this as a unique opportunity for reform.
Two significant steps are being taken under PSRL 111. First, in the proposed 2004 budget, the
government allocated food aid resources directly to municipalities using a pro-poor index. The
index i s composed of two formulas. The first formula improves marginally the targeting of the
actual distribution of the food programs for adults (a more ambitious attempt of reform met with
strong political resistance). The second formula establishes a pro-poor distribution for all the
other food programs, based on under nutrition and unsatisfiedbasic needs indicators.




                                                24

73.     Second, to promote efficiency and transparency in the food programs, within PSRL I11
the government presented the IntergovernmentalFiscal Transfers Law that will: (i) these             protect
resources from being diverted to other uses (an increased risk in the context o f decentralization),
(ii)formalize the use of a pro-poor formula in later years for allocations to municipalities, and
(iii)establish that the resources will be transferred following performance agreements signed
with the local governments by a central agency that will monitor them in a participatory way.
These measures would ensure that the decentralization process i s set in a path that protects social
protection funds, improves targeting and promotes efficiency-enhancing reforms of the food
programs.
74.     Inthe context of preparing this decentralization process, the government has also made
progress in the originally planned targets. There has been important progress on geographical
targeting, exceeding the goal agreed with the Bank for PSRL 111-now                   35 percent of the food aid
budget i s going to the poorest quintile of districts and 60 percent i s going to districts on the two
poorest quintiles, setting the pace for an improved geographical allocation o f funds to
municipalities in the decentralized context. The conditional cash transfer pilot (which had been
originally established as a trigger for PSRL 111) has been designed and approved but has not yet
been launched. There has also been progress in producing impact evaluations and baseline
studies for several programs, including Vas0 de Leche, PANFAR, PACFO and PANTBC (an
independent evaluation has also been made for school feeding programs), that can be the
beginning of a clearer policy-making role of PRONAA or the central agency that will follow it.

Transparency has also been enhanced, by publishing in the Consultu Amiguble the budget and
food distributed to each district, attention center and program.12
75.     PSRL IV. For PSRL lV, the objective is to institutionalize a well-functioning
decentralization process of the food programs, with the approval of the Intergovernmental Fiscal
Transfers Law and its regulations. The proposed trigger i s the implementation o f the pro-poor
allocation formula, of the performance agreements as the means to transfer funds and of the
transparency of the results included in this law.                The performance agreements would be
implemented by PRONAA or the agency responsible, establishing clear goals and procedures o f
the programs, and a monitoring system should be in place. Another trigger for PSRL IV would
be to improve the purchasing procedures for food under these programs.
76.     As these reform objectives demand developing and strengthening the capacities of
MIMDES and PRONAA, the TAL under preparation will provide support for it, inparticular for
the design of the performance agreements, the negotiations of them with local authorities, the
implementation of the monitoring system that will support those PASand for the inclusion o f the
Performance Agreements andtheir results in the Consultu Amiguble.




12. Complementing the various efforts underway with the food programs, the Ministry of Health has defined a
    nutrition program to be followed by all public health providers. Additionally, it has included the provision of
    iron supplements within the SIS benefit plan, securingits access for children under two years of age, as well as
    for pregnant women. MOH i s already buying and distributing needed supplies throughout the service delivery
    network to jump start the use of iron supplements. In the immediate future, SIS reimbursement will allow
    hospitalsand centers to replenish stocks, maintaining the availability of iron supplements.




                                                        25

B. Improvingaccess to quality healthand education services

77.      One of the key objectives of Peru's strategy to overcome poverty i s to continue the thrust
to obtain universal coverage of basic health and education services. Peru has a broad coverage
of primary education but still has a way to go on secondary education, and health services do not
reach some 20 percent of the population. Poor people confront not only geographical barriers,
but also economic and cultural barriersto these services. The quality of the services must also
improve to make them attractive to users. The current context of decentralization i s both a
challenge and an opportunity for the health and education sectors. As explained above, in many
countries, the coverage and quality of the social sectors has suffered following decentralization.
Other countries have shown that-if     done carefully-the  process o f decentralization can be used
to improve the incentives facing regional authorities and service providers. Some countries in
Latin America have succeeded in doing this by decentralizing the provision of services, while
centralizing the financing o f these services, and tying the financing to specific performance
criteria. It should be noticed that decentralization of healthand education should not be equated
with the transfer of all responsibility over health and education workers to subregional
governments and that this particular reform has failed in most Latin American countries where it
has been attempted.

          B.l. HealthCare

78.      Inequitable access to health services and financial inefficiencies are the two main
challenges facing the health sector. Despite an expansion in the supply o f health services,
economic and cultural barriers persist as significant obstacles to access, especially for the poor
and the rural segments o f the population. Duplication with poor service coordination among
various health care subsystems also persists throughout the country creating troublesome
inefficiencies. These are particularly significant between the two largest financial sources in
Peru's health sector: the public hospital network (run by the Ministry of Health and the sub-
national health authorities) and the nation's social security institute (ESSALUD, financed
through payroll taxes and covering approximately 6.8 million Peruvians).
79.      The Government's Strategy.        In order to overcome economic barriers to service
utilization, the GOP launched an infant and maternal public health insurance scheme, focusing
on the poor and rural populations.      Simultaneously, cultural barriers to basic services were
addressed through the expansion of an innovative arrangement (known as the CLAS model) that
empowered local communities to administer their own primary health services.
80.      Parallel to these policies on access, the GOP identified specific actions to improve the
overall efficiency of the health sector, chronically affected by the lack of coordination within
public health expenditures and the absence o f linkages with performance indicators. Initial steps
taken include promoting better service coordination between ESSALUD and the public hospital
network, and introducing management agreements between the Ministry o f Health and sub-
regional and local governments. In the long-term, these actions are expected to contribute to
preparing instruments and capacities required for the health sector to perform well in an
increasingly decentralized environment.
81.      The Decentralization framework law mandates the decentralization of health and
education services, but does not specify what this will entail and leaves the design o f this process



                                                 26

to norms or legislation that i s yet to be produced. At present, a technical team at the Ministry of
Health i s developing a proposal that would transfer the provider networks to the regional
governments and would strengthen the policy-making and regulatory role of the ministry using
SIS and the performance agreements.
82.     Actions under PSRL-Iand -11. Under PSRL-I, the GOP launched a health insurance
scheme initially known as the "Seguro Materno-Infantil"; later on, in 2001, this program was
merged with an existing school-based insurance (the "Seguro Escolar"), forming what i s known
today as the "Seguro Integral de Salud" (SIS). SIS's objective i s to reduce service costs for poor
citizens by reimbursing public providers for variable costs incurred in health care delivery
(mainly, essential drugs and medical supplies).          Additionally, by using a fee-for-service
reimbursement mechanism, SIS induces the supply of those basic health interventions included
inits benefits package.
83.     Under PSRL-11, SIS coverage rates for women and children were greatly expanded
nationwide, surpassing all initial estimates (see Table 5).       Financial resources for SIS were
secured by the national government via general revenues, maintaining the commitment level for
the infant and maternal components despite the recent inclusion of additional benefits plans13.
Legal and organizational actions were taken, in close coordination with the MOH and the
Ministry of Finance, to guarantee a stable managerial status for SIS. Although SIS still faces
challenges and has considerable opportunities for further improvement, preliminary evaluations
indicate that it has been an effective instrument for targeting health services to the poor and
increasing access to basic health care (such as prenatal care, skilled birth assistance, and
ambulatory pediatric visits).




13. Between 2002-03, the COP included two new benefit plans in SIS: plans D and E, covering specific adult
     populations.

84.       Complementing the insurance effort, community involvement was strengthened as a
means to reduce cultural barriers to access and enhance the responsiveness of primary health
facilities. The first two phases of this program supported progress made in involving local
communities in co-managing primary health care, via local health plans discussed and agreed
with the health authorities. With support by this program, roughly 25 percent of all basic health
centers in Peru became "Comunidades Locales de Administracidn de Sewicios de Salud"
(CLAS); that is, local not-for-profit citizen associations enabled to actively run primary health
care in their communities.
85.      To address the efficiency challenge, previous stages of the program introduced results-
oriented instruments in the health sector. Management agreements between the MOH and the
departmental health services (DISAS) were first signed during 2002, as part of the PSRL-II.
These agreements were initially limited to indicators related to individual health services.
Simultaneously, efforts conducive to better coordination of ESSALUD and the M O H progressed,
setting the stage for two successful pilot service-exchange agreements in two departments, now
inprocess of being scaledup.
86.      The GOP also attempted to advance with comprehensive reforms in ESSALUD that
would improve its efficiency and effectiveness.          These included designing and approving a
comprehensive managerial plan that would enhance performance and transparency (via




                                                     28

performance      agreements, cost and productivity studies,                tariff reviews and others).
Unfortunately, intense political instability (reflected in frequent abrupt changes in ESSALUD's
top management) hampered progress inmost of these action^.'^
87.     Actions under PSRL-111. PSRL-I11 consolidates and expands previous efforts in both
equitable access and efficiency, while preparingthe Peruvian health sector for advancing in the
decentralization process. Policy actions recognized by PSRL-I11 have (i)                 improved access to
health services for the poor, via consolidating and expanding SIS and increasing local
community involvement in primary health care; and (ii)            further reduced sector inefficiencies, by
advancing coordination between ESSALUD and the M O H and supporting the use of
management agreements within the public sector.
        (i)Reducing access barriers to health care for the poor. PSRL-111maintains SIS's
focus on infant and maternal health care, further strengthening its insurance function and
expanding coverage. Affiliation rates for pregnant women and children under 5 years o f age
have significantly increased, surpassing initial targets: by the end of 2002, 544,876 women and
2,013,923 children were affiliated (this compares to initial targets of 339,000 and 823,000,
respectively). Service utilization rates suggest improved access for these groups. However, the
recent inclusion of additional benefits plans and the expansion of eligible services (now
including tertiary care) have created a worrisome tendency that could divert SIS from its original
objectives: reimbursements are increasingly moving towards high complexity care, mostly
limited to urban settings. In order to prevent this distortion from affecting basic health care
coverage for the rural poor, the GOP has included in the 2004 national budget law presented to
Congress a clear separation of SIS's primary and secondary health care expenditures from those
corresponding to tertiary care, hence protecting the former.
88.     Additionally, the government has taken needed actions to strengthen SIS's managerial
capacity, including (a) integrating its information systems; (b) being fiscally responsible (all
changes in targets and/or benefit plans have been accompanied by the correspondent budgetary
allocations); (c) assuring sufficient resources to maintaining expected coverage goals; and (d)
directly reimbursing providers for services delivered, thus guaranteeing the presence of a proper
in~entive'~.Efforts related with quality assurance (auditing o f perinatal and maternal deaths) and
improvements of monitoring and internal control systems are underway with technical assistance
from the WB-financed health reform project (loan No. 4527-PE). Additionally, a detailed 2003
performance agreement has been signed between SIS and MEF and i s being closely monitored.
89.     Local co-management of primary health services has increased in Peru, supported by
various studies that indicate positive results in terms of access to health care, consumer
satisfaction and efficiency. Under PSRL-111, 762 CLAS associations now function throughout
the country, including 2,091 health centers (or roughly 35 percent of all first level
establishments), up from 1,461 that existed by the beginning o f 2002. These CLAS, with a total



14. More recently (June, 2003), the approval by Congress of an autonomy law for ESSALUD further distanced its
    management from the control locus of the executive branch. Nonetheless, the law does define that ESSALUD
    must maintain its fiscal responsibility.
15. Currently, SIS reimburses directly to 128 "unidudes ejecutorus" throughout the country. Included here are the
    34 departmental health services ("Direcciones de SaluaP', DISAS) and public hospitals head of referral
    networks.




                                                      29

annual budget estimated in 73.2 million soles and accounting for over 4,900 active community
members and 5,800 health care workers, serve now more than 8 million citizens, mostly in poor,
rural settings.
        (ii)Improvingtheefficiencyofhealthcare delivery. Also under PSRL-111, the MOH
has signed new management agreements with all 34 DISAS for 2003. These agreements are now
more comprehensive, including additional health indicators such as SIS coverage rates, disease
surveillance results, and immunization rates, among others. Close monitoring of the 2002 and
(current) 2003 agreements has been conducted b y the MOH anddiscussed with the DISAS. This
exercise has lead to policy alignment and timely decision making.
90.     Lessons learned during previous phases of this program, with attempts to improve the
internal efficiency of ESSALUD in a context of political and managerial instability, has lead
PSRL-I11 to focus efforts on securing basic coordination in service exchange and investments
between ESSALUD and the MOH. Arrangements were made for exchanging services in five
departments, reducing inefficiency in the supply of services in both institutions and improving
access both to basic health services (for ESSALUD affiliates) and to complex care (for MINSA-
dependent uninsured citizens).I6 Both entities are now jointly reviewing their major procurement
and investment plans for 2003 and 2004, making sure there are no redundancies and arranging
proper agreements to further share excess service capacity.
91.     Perspectives and Triggers for PSRL-IV. While maintainingachievements reached in
the previous phases o f the program, the PSRL-IV will further advance two policy instruments
considered critical for the health sector to gradually decentralize: SIS and management
agreements. Specifically, the fourth operation will recognize SIS' s efforts to further expand
infant and maternal coverage rates (reaching now over 560,000 pregnant women and 2,400,000
kids under 5 years of age), improve skilled birth attendance rates, and introduce reforms in
design and operational features (e.g. in its benefits packages, tariffs and referral systems) that
will help controlling excessive resource allocation intertiary care.
92.     As mentioned above, a key trigger for PSRL IV will be the putting in place of a legal
framework for the decentralization of the health sector. The PSRL-IV will also recognize
progress made with results-based management within a decentralized context.                Annual
management agreements between the national and sub-national health authorities will be
maintained, now including close monitoring with results made public for enhanced
accountability and citizen participation. The M O H anticipates that management agreements will
become the critical instrument for guiding a gradual decentralization process o f health functions
without deteriorating key indicators.




16. The departments with active service exchange agreements between MINSA and ESSALUD are Tacna,
     Huhuco, Huancavelica, Loreto and Ucayali.

          B.2. Education

93.     The Education sector in Peru suffered a difficult blow when the PISAI7 student
performance evaluation results were published. The evaluation showed that 15 year-old
Peruvian students have serious difficulties reading and understanding what they read. Prior
student assessments had given similar results, but this test, which allows comparisons with other
countries, led to national outrage and the subsequent declaration of emergency inthis sector.
94.     A key underlying reason for these poor results are the poor quality and motivation of the
teaching staff in Peru. The average teacher salary in Peru i s approximately 230 dollars per
month, which i s relatively low for Latin America. The salary scale i s also quite compressed with
average pay in the highest teacher         category only 1.4 times that of the starting pay level
compared with a good practice ratio of at least 5:l. There are no salary adjustments or other
incentives for teaching in rural areas or other hardship posts which result in a high share of
schools in rural and low-income urban areas operating with teacher shortages even though the
system-wide student-teacher ratio i s a relatively low 25:l at the primary level, which suggests
that the overall quantity of teachers i s adequate.
95.     In order to introduce processes that will address human resource problems, it is
indispensable to restructure the way that teachers are managed in the sector. Currently, 49
percent of the teachers are still being paid through payroll systems that are subject to
manipulation, either in the process of manually entering the individual's payroll information or
when giving orders to the bank to proceed with payment. In addition, the payrolls are not linked
to teacher positions so that staff may be paid salary amounts that may not correspond to the
position they work in. For example, in an initial cross-check carried out in Lima, Ministry of
Education (MINED) found that some janitors and teacher assistants were reported and paid as
teachers or even as school directors.
96.    Another human resource problem i s that teachers are poorly deployed.                       Teacher
deployment i s highly centralized. Open-ended contracted teachers "own" their positions and are
very difficult to move. On the other hand, term-contracted teachers are subject to redeployment.
Given that contracted teachers today amount to approximately 18 percent of the teaching body,
the impact of rationalizing this group, through redeployment or cancellation of their contracts, i s
limitedbut can still have an important impact in the system.
97.    The current context o f decentralization urgently requires addressing the human resources
problem in the sector. Initial estimates show that $50 million per year could be saved if the
payroll system i s cleaned up and rationalized. If this i s not done, in the medium term, regional
governments could start demanding more budget to finance non-existent teacher positions, thus
ballooning the recurrent cost education budget, putting at risk the services and investment
budget, which finance school materials, training, and other quality inputs.


17. The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an OECD-sponsored effort which aims at
     measuring how well 15-year-olds perform in three forms of literacy: reading, mathematical and scientific.
     The PISA 200/2001 was administered to 43 countries of which 15 were non-OECD. Peru was the lowest
     ranking country.

Government Strategy

98.      Throughout the Toledo Government, education has been highup on the national agenda.
It i s an important component of the Acuerdo Nacional and the Estrategia de Superacio'n de la
Pobreza. In addition, Congress recently approved a new General Education Law which is very
much in line with both these documents, all of which aim at improving the quality o f education
in Peru, ensuring equity, and taking into consideration cultural and language differences. They
also emphasize the significant role that teachers play inthis process.
99.      The publication of the PISA results forced the Government to take immediate actions.
The sector was declared in emergency, prioritizing key strategic actions which are expected to
contribute to improving education quality, while at the same time preparing for the
decentralization process. Key priorities are to: (a) improve the quality of education with a focus
on reading-comprehension and math; (b) improve teacher quality and motivation; (c) increase
access to education to excluded populations through strategic projects and programs; (d) increase
system accountability; and (e) increase education financing. These policies are in line with the
critical policies identified inthis sector, but the declaration of emergency allows the Government
to take swifter actions and to have education spending prioritized in the budget, if and when
revenues increase.
100. MINEDis focusing on improving teacher quality and motivation through a two-pronged
approach. MINEDi s committed to implementing a unified payroll system; developing a teacher
position system which allows for cross-checking of teacher positions with the payroll; and
launching a rationalization process, where contracted teachers would be redeployed to schools
with greater need for teachers. At the same time, MINEDi s designing teacher incentive schemes
that will promote greater time-on-task and improved quality. It should be emphasized that based
on lessons learned in many Latin American countries that have attempted to municipalize the
teachers and failed at the attempt-the    government is notconsidering the full transfer of teachers
to the regional governments.

Actions under PSRLIand PSRL I1

101. The PSRL Program has supported the GOP sector policies, with an emphasis on teacher
quality and motivation. Prior sector work and other studies carried out during the preparation of
the Rural Education Project showed that Peru had improved significantly in its curricular reform
and in the distribution of materials at the primary level. However, teachers lacked appropriate
training and motivation to be able to implement the changes decreed by MINED.
102.    The GOP has long recognized that teacher quality and motivation need to be addressed in
order to ensure overall improvement in the quality o f education. This objective was approached
through two strategies: (a) the introduction o f new information systems to allow for greater
efficiency in teacher management; and (b) development of incentive pay to increase teacher
motivation. As part of the first strategy, PSRL Isupported an important effort to try to clean-up
the payroll and career management system in order to make it more transparent and efficient.
The new payroll system was implementedin six payroll processing units reaching a coverage of
44 percent of the teachers nationwide. With this system, MINED was able to detect teachers
who were no longer in the system but were still being paid, or teachers who were not being paid
appropriately according to the position that they were holding. Subsequently, under PSRL 11,


                                                   32

MINEDrepresentatives stated their interest inpromoting an overall reform of the teacher career,
as part of an ambitious vision that would lead to a new Teacher Career Law. This vision turned
out to be too optimistic, given the national political context. A teachers' strike in May 2003
showed that any reform would require a difficult negotiationprocess.
103.    As part of the second strategy, under PSRL IMINED identified the following teacher
incentives as key policy instruments, particularly for rural areas where teacher quality i s lowest:
(a) financial incentives for teacher attendance, scaled with respect to distance between the school
and the provincial capital, (b) financial incentives for teacher's ability to speak the local tongue
fluently; (c) living facilities; and (d) appropriate training for multigrade environments. Under
PSRL 11, MINED initiated a pilot program to provide incentives to teachers in rural areas with
the specific objective of ensuring teacher attendance in rural schools.              The pilot was
implemented, but with insufficient evaluation thus far.
104.    A second policy supported under the PSRLI1addressedtwo population groups which are
commonly excluded from the system: pre-school children and indigenous children whose mother
tongue i s not Spanish. It was agreed that these excluded groups should be targeted in the
prioritization of education investments in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of
universalprimary education.
105.    A thirdpolicy area addressedthe issue of transparency and participation. Under PSRL 11,
MINED had committed to the reorganization of schools through the creation of strong school
councils in order to promote dialogue between the school and the community and to promote
accountability at the local level, MINED issued a decree which makes school councils
compulsory.
106.    The GOP has made an overall effort to improve transparency. As part o f this general
effort, under PSRL I,MINED published 1998 student assessment data and the comparative
analysis of the 1996 and 1998 data. Under PSRL 11, in November 2001, MINED carried out
student performance assessments, including, for the first time, children in rural multigrade
schools and Quechua and Aymara speakers, and has publishedpreliminary results. Also, under
PSRL 11,the final report of the Commission for National Consensus on Education was published
as inserts in newspapers with national distribution--"Propuestu       de Acuerdo Nacional por la
Educacidn" and "Las Vocesdel Pais" and a complaints hotline and center was installed.

Actions under PSRLI11

107.    Inthis phase, the PSRL continued to support all three priority policies, but with a greater
emphasis on the teacher component. The Government had committed to continue implementing
the human resource management system as a trigger for PSRL 111, as the implementation of the
system i s a key prior action for the decentralization of the sector. Under this operation, MINED
has implemented the payroll system in two additional Regional Offices, thus reaching a total
coverage of 51 percent o f the teachers. MINED has also developed a teachers position system
which has been implemented in Lima and Callao. This system was used to cross-check teacher
positions with the payroll, resulting in significant clean-up.       Finally, MINED initiated the
rationalization of teachers through a pilot in two Lima districts, identifying approximately 20
percent of teachers that could be redeployed to areas where teachers were in greater need or
whose contracts were cancelled.          MEF has also supported MINED by initiating the




                                                 33

implementation of the automated payment of teacher salaries through the SIAF system, thus
hinderingmanipulation inthis step of the process.
 108.    A second key action is the design of teacher incentives to promote deployment and
permanence of teachers in rural areas, as well as to improve performance system-wide. MINED
has re-launched the pilot in three rural areas of Peru. The pilot covers 1000 teachers and will
evaluate the impact of providing monetary and non-monetary incentives for teacher attendance
and performance.        As part of the pilot, MINED is strengthening the Consejos Escolares
Consultivos (school councils), with the assistance of DFID, which will be responsible for
monitoring teacher attendance. A monitoring and evaluation system has been designed and the
baseline is under implementation.
 109.    As part of the teacher incentives system, MINED is carrying out an in-depth study to
design incentives for teachers nationwide. This study will propose a new teacher pay scale that
would include greater differentiation between payment levels and performance incentives. This
study i s expected to be ready duringthe first quarter of 2004.
110.     Inaddition, during this phase, MINEDcarried out actions to cover excludedpopulations.
MINEDdeveloped, approved and initiated implementation of a comprehensive early childhood
development strategy. In the case of bilingual education, PSRL I11targeted increased coverage
to 75,000 rural indigenous children (15 percent of the total population) for the 2002 school year,
through the provision of bilingual materials and an improved teacher training program. MINED
trained approximately 4,300 teachers, achieving an approximate coverage of 90,000 students.
Materials were distributed to these children too.
111. Finally, in the area of transparency, MINED implemented the Centro de Atencio'n a la
Comunidad Educativa, CACE (a complaints center) which has been operating mainly in Lima,
but also receiving calls, through its toll free number, from other areas in Peru. In early April,
CACE launched a promotion program nationwide announcing their web sites and email address.
This had a positive impact on the ratio of feedback received from outside Lima. As part of this
strengthening process, MINED has issued a Directive which requires that regional and sub-
regional offices receiving complaints through CACE, to respond within 72 hours of receiving the
complaint.

Perspectivesfor P S R L I V

112.     The main challenge for the education sector in the next year will be the implementation
of the proposed National Education Emergency Plan and to get ready for formal decentralization
in 2005. MINED i s in the process of mapping the actions towards the decentralization, but is
clear that implementing the sector's Human Resources Management System and designing
incentives for improving quality of education and redeployment of teachers to hardship areas are
critical initial steps to achieve an ordered transition.
113.    MINED is committed to the implementation of the Human Resources Management
System nationwide.         The system includes the operation of the unified payroll system,
crosschecking of payroll and positions, electronic payment of salaries, and rationalization of
short term contract positions. MINED has planned to install the system and process the payroll
in at least 75 percent of the executing units, reaching an expected coverage of 80 percent of the
teaching staff. Payroll and teaching positions will be cross-checked for at least 50 percent of the
teachers. The payroll system will be linked to MEF's SIAF which will pay at least 50 percent of


                                                   34

the teachers directly into individual accounts. Finally, MINED will rationalize 50 percent of
term-contracted teachers so that they are redeployed to areas where there are greater needs, or
their contracts will be canceled. MINED expects that the combination of these measures will
help ensure that personnel are being paid for the specific job they carry out. Initial estimates in
saving to the sector are about US$50million per year, or approximately 45 percent of the non-
salary annual budget for the sector.
114.     The second benchmark, addressing a teacher incentives system, will be implemented
using a two-pronged approach. MINED will continue implementation of the rural teachers
incentive pilot during the 2004 school year. This pilot i s expected to provide lessons regarding:
(a) the impact of monetary and non-monetary incentives to teachers and schools in teacher
attendance and student performance, and (b) the role of school councils in monitoring teacher
attendance. DFID i s currently providing technical assistance in training school councils to carry
out this monitoring function. MINED i s also evaluating possible teacher incentives that would
be applicable system-wide. A study, initiated under PSRL 111, should be concluded during the
PSRL IV phase. The study i s expected to design a new teacher pay structure that will include
base pay plus performance incentives based on periodic evaluation. Recommendations from this
study and from the pilot program will be used to draft the new teacher pay scale and incentive
structure.

C. Transparency and Participationof the poor''

115.     When the transition government came to power, years of weakened democratic
institutions, lack of government transparency and increased levels of corruption had undermined
the accountability o f the Peruvian state to its citizens. The lack of transparency and lack of
access to information was manifested in the limited availability of information on state budgets
and expenditures, and on the eligible beneficiaries and the expected results of government
programs.      There was also little public awareness regarding citizens' rights and the
responsibilities of civil servants. Finally, there was little or no space for citizens to participate in
the formulation and elaboration of public policies, and no formally recognized mechanisms to
allow users and citizen oversight of state actions and programs.
116.     Following the opening up of Peru's political environment, the transition government of
President Paniagua and subsequently the Toledo administration announced a strategy to
consolidate transparent and democratic institutions in Peru, buildinga state aimed at "serving the
people."   An emphasis was placed on giving voice to the people and transparently managing
state resources. Within the PSRL, this translated into the objective of improving transparency in
social programs and expenditures and empowering beneficiaries to participate in the policy and
budget process. The specific objectives were to i)provide access to information for all citizens,
depoliticizing the use o f public information and restoring its credibility; ii)provide citizens with
the means to plan, budget and oversee the services which are provided to them and thereby
ensure that their voice i s heard and reflected accurately in government actions; and iii)provide

an institutional framework and recourse mechanisms for citizens to seek resolution in the case of
abuse of public roles or funds.
117.    The strategic priorities of the PSRL were defined through a broad consultative process
and national dialogue in Peru which involved the GOP, the World Bank as well as other key
stakeholders of the reform, such as public sector representatives, the private sector, civil society
and the donor c~mmunity'~.
118.    DuringPSRL Iand 11,the GOP made important advances inenhancing citizens' accessto
information by increasing transparency of government actions and programs through a series of
new initiatives. The GOP launched an Economic Transparency portal aimed at makingfinancial
and budget information easily accessible and useful to citizens as a source for influencing and
monitoring public action, providing monthly information on budget transfers to and expenditures
of a selected number of social programs. Increasing access to information also meant ensuring
that the information made accessible was accurate and reliable.                  The National Institute of
Statistics and Informatics (INEI) was identified as key to the production of credible statistical
information. In order to reduce political interference in the INEI, as was the case during the
FujimoriAdministration, and reinforce its role as a technical agency, it was agreed that measures
needed to be taken to move more forcefully in that direction. Finally, in order to measure the
impact of the afore-mentioned actions and to enhance citizens' voice on issues of corruption, the
GOP proposed to assess public perceptions on transparency and corruption by first establishing a
baseline. To do this, it was proposed to incorporate a module on transparency into the ENAHO
national survey.
119.    PSRL 111: Piloting; accountability mechanisms and creating; institutional frameworks. The
PSRL I11focused on providing voice to the users of the Priority Social Programs concerning the
quality and transparency of services received, and on institutionalizing measures to enhance
transparency and participation in a context of increasing decentralization. In that context, the
PSRL I11witnessed significant advances in providing citizens with greater voice in planning and
oversight of government activities though two main actions. The first was the inclusion and
analysis of a module on transparency in ENAHO, and the second was the implementation of a
pilot applying the citizen report card methodology to evaluate the performance of a selected
number of social services, as experienced by users. The results of both the ENAHO survey and
the outcomes of the report cards was disseminated by high-ranking government officials in an
event that brought together media, government and civil society representatives.
120.    The GOP also made important progress in providing a legislative framework for
institutionalizing greater citizen participation in public policy formulation, implementation and
monitoring, greater transparency and improved access to information. Most importantly, the
DecentralizationFramework Law, together with its constitutional changes and the respective law
for the newly created regions and the law for municipalities created an unprecedented framework
for citizens' participation, civic engagement and social vigilance, granting far-reaching
individual and collective rights and institutionalizing participation and transparency. This can be
exemplified by several important advances:

        (i>        Citizens participation i s recognized as a fundamental right throughout the legal
                   framework and will soon be codified in detail through a special law.
        (ii) RegionalandLocal Coordination Councils were created inaddition to the
                   respective regional or local councils, and are required by law to take into
                   account citizens' voice. Buildingon the positive experience with the mesas de
                   concertacion and other initiatives, they seek to establish a forum for
                   coordination and consultation between government and civil society. With 35
                   percent and 40 percent civil society representation respectively, they are
                   consultative legislative and executive bodies to participate in and monitor
                   public action.
                   Participatory planning processes have been established that require the creation
                   of a regional, provincial and district development plan, which are based on
                   consultations with civil society.     Likewise, inputs from civil society are
                   required for all subnational investment plans.
                   A major innovation i s the mainstreaming of participatory budgeting.         The
                   Framework Law on Participatory Budgeting that establishes a uniquely strong
                   process for participation of civil society in the creation of the subnational
                   budgets, unparalleled in Latin America. Participatory budgeting will be the
                   focus of the participation and transparency component of the Decentralization,
                   Growth and Competitiveness Loan that will complement the important
                   advances made under the PSRL.
                   The Transparency and Access to Information Law and its regulations stipulate
                   a far-reaching right to information and creates corresponding mechanisms to
                   hold the public sector more accountable.
                   Community participation in the design, execution and monitoring of local
                   projects has been expanded in several social programs, and efforts are
                   undertaken to mainstream community oversight to all social programs to be
                   decentralized.
121.    This new framework for participation means Peru has one of the most advanced
legislative structures for citizen participation inpublic policy and budgeting processes at national
and especially at the subnational levels in all of Latin America.
122.    Enhanced user oversight of the performance of service providers and the implementation
of a legal framework to improve public transparency are not possible without accessible, timely
and reliable information. In that respect, PSRL I11supported the development o f the Economic
Transparency Portal into an accessible database of information on all government budgets and
expenditures updated on a monthly basis (including not just social programs, but also such items
as defense), down to the departmental level. This site (called Consulta Amigable) i s accessible
to everyone on the Internet. For three programs (PRONAA, SIS and A Trubujar Urbano),
expenditures were also linked to physical goals, facilitating the monitoring of expenditures
versus achievement of results. For these programs, information on their objectives, services
offered and eligibility criteria were included as well.
123.   In the same direction, PSRL I11 supported the effort to reinforce INEI's technical
character and reduce its susceptibility to political interference.    Although total financial and
political autonomy was initially visualized, this initiative met with resistance, due to fiscal and
legal considerations. Several alternatives are under deliberation to achieve the same objectives



                                                  31

in the current political context, including strengthening the capacity of INEI with technical
assistance and providing it with an external oversight body with representatives from academia,
civil society and the public sector. In the framework of the PSRL I11dialogue, the GOP has
proposed the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system and has designated the
authority which will be responsible for its design and implementation. In that respect, INEIi s
expected to play a key role as a provider of official statistical information to the M&E system,
and therefore will need to be strengthened to fulfill this function?'
PSRL N:Monitoring and EvaluatingResultsto Support Performance Management
124.    Building on the efforts initiated during the previous PSRLs, the transparency and
participatory mechanisms developed will be implemented within the context of the monitoring
and evaluation system to be developed by the GOP under the PSRL N. The implementation of a
transparent, participatory and results-oriented M&E system will help put in place processes by
which the government will be able to effectively track progress in reaching the objectives o f the
PSPs within a decentralized context and will help enhance the transparency, quality and
efficiency of expenditure.         This requires strengthening the capacity of regional and local
governments to effectively monitor the implementation of their programs, both regarding targets,
such as inputs and outputs, as well as process, such as participation. It also requires strengthening
the capacity to make effective use of the information derived from the M&E system to adjust
program performance, so that any detected weaknesses can quickly feed into program
management and be translated into performance improvement. The M&E system will be closely
linked to the accreditation system and performance management agreements, especially
regarding sectoral minimum standards and institutional capacity.                    A set of participatory
monitoring and evaluation mechanisms will be put in place, allowing the views o f service users
and citizens to be effectively heard with the aim of improving service delivery and empowering
the poor.
125.    With the support of the TAL, currently under preparation, the M&Esystem will track and
evaluate the levels and appropriate mix of spending on the PSPs at the national, regional and
when applicable, at the municipal level, the critical inputs and outputs, and the level o f
satisfaction of users measured through user-satisfaction monitoring methodologies. The TAL
will also support activities aimed at strengthening INEI's capacity to produce reliable and timely
information needed for the M & E system. In the first year of implementation the system will
report results at the national and regional level every six months. The reports will gradually
disaggregate information down to the provincial and district level.
126.    Inorder to ensure the neutrality and objectivity of the M&E system and its connection to
result-based management and decision-making processes, a multi-sector oversight committee
composed of ministries, other government agencies, and representatives of regional and local
governments, will be formed. The committee will coordinate and oversee the information
produced for the M&E system.
127.    The Consultu Amiguble constitutes a key tool of the M&E system.                         However, the
information made accessible in Consultu has to be not only complete and accurate, but also


20. A Technical Assistance Loan (TAL) to support the development of capacity of government and civil society
     actors for the design and implementationof the monitoringand evaluation system is under preparation.




                                                      38

understandable and communicated in a user-friendly manner. The PSRL N will thus support an
even more user-friendly Consulta, and ensure that the quality o f its information improves by
providing more complete information on expenditures linked to achievement o f results for all
PSPs, down to the provincial and, when applicable, to the local (district) level. It will also
include technical descriptions of the programs, for users to have access to information such as
type of services offered, eligibility criteria and geographical coverage.             A grant21 has been
approved and is meant to complement the activities of the PSRL, focusing specifically on
strengthening the capacity of civil society to monitor the performance of PSPs. It will also seek
to improve access o f the poor to the information contained in Consulta by creating interfaces
tailored to their needs and through complementary means to the web, such as for example
community radio, bulletin boards and community media, as the Internet still remains out reach
for many of Peru's poor.
128.    The PSRL N, the TAL and JSDF grant will also support the institutionalization of
participatory M&E mechanisms. This will include, among other efforts, systematizing the use of
such tools as participatory users' satisfaction evaluations and community-based expenditure
tracking mechanisms in the monitoring and evaluation of the PSPs, permanently including the
user satisfaction and perception of corruption module in ENAHO, and a greater participation of
community-based organizations which are involved in the management of social protection
programs. To this extent, the TAL will also support the strengthening of M&E in the
decentralized social programs of MIMDES, according to the fiscal transfer law.
129.    The implementation of an effective participatory M&E system requires that citizens are
easily able to access information on public programs and services at all levels o f government.
Duringthe PSRL IV,the implementationof the Law of Transparency andAccess to Information
will be an important objective, particularly strengthening the capacity of CCLs and CCRs to
disseminate information on PSPs and other decentralized social program to citizens and
communities.
130.    The trigger and benchmark of the PSRL IV in the area of transparency and participation
are based in part on feedback received from civil society organizations and multi-stakeholder
roundtables, which have followed the progress in the area o f transparency andparticipation since
the approval of the first PSRL22.

22. Consultation meetings on the progress on the PSRL I11 and on the proposed policy matrix in the area of
    transparency and participation for the PSRL IV were held with civil society organizations and Mesas de
    Concertacio'n in June and August 2003. Participatingorganizations included Red CientljCica Peruana (RCP),
    Redde Radios Comunitarias, Propuesta Ciudadana, Care Peru, nationaland regional representativesof Mesas,
    the Ombudsman (Defensoria del Pueblo), the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, MIMDES, the
    Ministry of Finance, CIAS-PCM, the CND (National Center for Decentralization) and the private sector. In
    addition, an on-going dialogue with civil society and other stakeholders has been maintained by the World
    Bank inPeru. For a complete list of these consultative meetings,refer to Annex V.

D.Transparency of Financialand Procurement Administration

          D.l. ProcurementAdministration

131.    Procurement initiatives in the context of the PSRL aim at improving transparency,
economy and efficiency in management of public procurement and are fully consistent with the
objectives of the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR)'s Action Plan update jointly
prepared by the Government of Peru and the Bank in September 2001. Most recommendations
included in the Action Plan aim also to strengthen both the control of the General Comptroller
(Contraloriu General de la Republica-CGR) and the supervision role of national procurement
regulatory agency (Consejo Nacional del Contrutaciones y Adquisiciones del Estado-
CONSUCODE) over government agencies responsible for management of public procurement
and contracting.
132.    Government Strategy. Consistent with these objectives, the GOP outlined in 2001 a
two-pronged strategy towards improvement of transparency in public procurement based on: a)
the signing of an inter-institutional agreement between the CONSUCODE and the CGR to
increase coordination between them and more efficiency in control and supervision of public
procurement; and b) the issuing of a Policy Guide for development and implementation of an
electronic   government procurement system (Sistema Electrdnico de Adquisiciones y
Contrutaciones del Estudo-SEACE) that will provide increased transparency and efficiency,
and reduce transaction costs in public procurement.        Each step's output were agreed as
benchmarks for the PSRL 11.
133.    SEACE's conceptual framework envisages overall implementation of the e-procurement
system inthree stages: i)a web page for advertisement of biddingopportunities; ii)a government
e-purchase system for procurement of minor goods and services; and iii)a government e-
procurement system for acquisition of goods and contracting of works. Specific benchmarks for
implementationof the first two stages were agreed as triggers for the PSRL111.
134.    Actions Under PSRL Iand PSRL 11. PSRL Iincorporated only indicative benchmarks
to mark progress in the program development towards PSRL I1 and minimum triggers.
Identification of those triggers at that time served later as a basis for the GOP to define the
above-described strategy for increased transparency inpublic procurement.
135.    Inline with the conditions agreed for the PSRL 11,the GOP issued pursuant to Supreme
Decree No. 031-2002-PCM published in May 2002 a Policy Guide outlining the implementation
of an e-Government procurement system.
136.    Also, CONSUCODE and CGR signed an inter-institutional agreement in December
2001.   Preparation and issuance of guidelines for control and supervision of procurement
processes through administrative decrees were agreed as a trigger for PSRL 111.
137.    Actions Under PSRL 111.          Implementation of the web page in the portal of
CONSUCODE was successfully completed and a number of approximately 660 agencies were
regularly advertising procurement related information by end of June 2003. This allowed
meetingthe benchmark o f 600 agencies agreed for PSRL 111.
138.    At the PSRL I1 implementation stage, development of an e-purchase system for
procurement of minor goods and services on a pilot basis was started by MEF's SIAF team.



                                               40

Duringthis stage the GOP decided to review the e-procurement system's overall implementation
strategy in the context of preparation of the State Reform and Modernization Project to be
financed with funds from an IADB loan.          Factors leading to review of the initial strategy
involved changes in system design and development approach; and migration to an Internet-
based new operation platform not compatible with the one used for implementation of the
SIAF' s e-procurement pilot system. The adopted operations platform, however, i s compatible
with the one under which the CONSUCODE portal and web page i s currently operated. Due to
these changes, completion of the SIAF e-procurement pilot system by MEF was considered no
longer relevant and thus disregarded for PSRL 111.
139.    Implementation of a task force comprised of CGR and CONSUCODE staff enabled the
preparation and issuing of guidelines and directives of control and supervision relevant to
distinct thematic areas of public procurement and contracting in a coordinated and smooth
fashion. Delivered output satisfactorily met this trigger agreed for PSRL III.

Perspectives for PSRL IV.

140.    Implementation of the Central Government approach towards decentralization to other
sub-national government levels along with a decentralized management o f procurement at all
level of governments requires buildingcapacity in public contracting agencies and strengthening
the limited capacity of control and supervision in public procurement delegated to the CGR and
CONSUCODE. Achievement of this goal requires an effort beyond the scope of intended social
sector reforms proposed in the context of the PSRL. Therefore, it was agreed that actions aimed
at building capacity and ensuring transparency and efficiency in public procurement shall be
more properly managed within the scope of a more comprehensive Bank lending operation such
as the Decentralizationand Economic Growth Project currently under preparation.
141.    For implementation of the PSRL IV specific measures dealing with the purchase of foods
carried out at PRONAA's Food Aid Program shall be incorporated to ensure adequate
transparency and economy and reducing to the extent possible conflicts of interest in bidding
processes to be managed in a decentralized fashion by provincial municipalities. Procurement of
food by PRONAA from medium and small local producers i s currently ruled according to the
provisions of Law No. 27060 and Law No. 27767 and their regulations as provided in Supreme
Decrees Nos. 002-99-PROMUDEH and No. 001-2003-MIMDES. To this end, CONSUCODE
will perform a comprehensive revision of current regulations governing the food purchase and
shall propose revised regulations including provisions for wide dissemination of bidding
opportunities    and increased public access to procurement            information through the
CONSUCODE web page and other means of advertisement. Issuingo f revised regulations shall
be a trigger for PSRLN.

          D.2. FinancialAdministration

142.    The Government has been committed to improving transparency and access to
information and to promoting better governance and administration of public finances.
143.    The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) conducted in 2001 concluded
that the financial tools at the disposal of the Congress and Executive Branch included a robust
financial administration legislation, highly dedicated staff and an effective integrated financial
management system (SIAF). The major recommendations of the CFAA related to (a) more


                                                41

effective oversight by Congress of the budget process and review of the allocations of available
funding; (b) more detailed and frequent reporting on expenditures to Congress; and (c) unfettered
surveillance and reporting by the Controller General of the acts and reports of the executive.
Three (indispensable elements of a sound fiduciary framework were built into the CAS and
policy framework for the PSRL 11: (1) Strengthening congressional oversight of the use of
public funds; (2) increased independence of the Controller General; and (3) expansion of the
scope and coverage of the integrated financial management system SIAF.23
144.    SIAF was implemented in 1998 as a mandatory internet-based system for recording data
related to expenditures and revenues for the national budget. SIAF i s a powerful repository of
financial transactions. At the central government level, there are four modules: TreasuryBudget
Execution, Accounting, Financial Statements Generation and Debt Management. Budget
classifications are integrated into the Chart of Accounts. Information generated i s put to good
use by the MEF and spending agencies. The implementation of the system has promoted
effective control, optimum cash management and informed decision making. The SIAF i s also
used by some Bank-Financed Projects, and Basic financial Statements are generated directly
from the government's system.

Actions underPSRL I11

145.    Strengthened Legal Framework: The National Control Law No 27785 was approved on
July 22, 2002 and ensures functional autonomy of the Controller General's Office (CGR), in
accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The CGR i s now exercising ex-post control,
according to its legal mandate, over the finances of the Ministry of Defence and other security
services, and a special audit has been carried out.
146.    Financial and Economic Reporting: MEF regularly publishes in its web page (Portal de
Transparencia Econdmica and Consulta Amigable) semi-annual reports on progress of
Benchmarks of the Multi-Annual Macro-Economic Framework, monthly and quarterly reports
on budget execution, and data on the timing and amount of transfers to municipalities. These
reports are comprehensive and easily accessible. Monthly reports of budget execution data have
been published for all entities in the central government and decentralized entities.                         The
extension of SIAF to the Ministry o f Defence and other civilian ministries has strengthened the
oversight environment. SIAF i s implemented in 42 operating units of the central government
and decentralized agencies.
147.    Municipal Governments: The development of the SIAF for municipal governments was
completed. The budget execution module has been installed in 21 provincial governments and at
least 1,700 municipalities. Extensive user training has been provided.                     Due to absence of
modems, the systems in some municipalities are not yet functional, but these technical issues are
being resolved.     The original target was 100 and it i s expected that the systems will be
implementedin an additional 38 provincial governments inthe second semester of 2003.



23.  Some SIAF core subsystems are still not fully developed and some available modules have not been
    implemented. These modules include: a) Human Resource Management-essential for civil service reform; b)
    National Assets- for due registry of state assets; and c) Contingent Liabilities- for due registry and to make
    proper provisionsfor future budgets.

Other Government Initiatives
 148.   Financial Reporting: The National Accounts are comprehensive and include central,
regional and local governments as well as state-owned enterprises, quasi-state companies, and
the Central Bank. The accounts for the fiscal year ended 2002 have been prepared and submitted
to the CGR for auditing, in accordance with the Constitution.
 149.   Accounting Standards: The Strategic Plan for 2002-06 for the Accountant General's
Office focuses on (1) unification of local accounting standards with the standards issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board, (2) improvement in the quality of financial reporting,
and (3) more in-depth analysis and evaluation of results.                 Given the drive toward
decentralization, the AG has issued guidance to municipal governments to facilitate the transfer
of accountinginformation to the new municipal authorities.
 150.   New Regulations to Implement and Support the National Control Law: During2003, two
important regulations were issued to support the Control Law issued during 2002. The first
regulation institutionalises the role and function of the internal auditor at all levels of government
(central, regional, local) and the second regulates the eligibility of private audit firms to perform
financial and operations audits of public entities, including the procedures for registration,
evaluation, designation, public competition, and ex-post quality control by the CGR.
 151.   External Audit: The CGR has begun implementing its 2003-2007 Strategic Plan and i s
focusing on the following key reforms: (1) institutional development, (2) modernization of
government operations, (3) furthering the fight against corruption, and (4) strengthening the
National Control System. Each of these four strategic initiatives are being implemented through
specific actions which taken together are part o f the government's agenda for institutional
capacity buildingin the mediumand long term.
 152.   Public Access to Information: Through the Portal de Transferencia and the Consulta
Amigable, a wide range of financial and economic data i s available to the public. According to
reports published by the Bank's Civil Society Team, there i s a high level of interest in public
finances, reflected by the numerous hits to these web pages.            Information i s available on
macroeconomic projections, the strategic plans of each central government entity, consolidated
data on     budget execution, transfers to regional and local governments, consolidated debt
position (internal and external), and execution o f investment projects.

Perspectives for future reforms

 153.   General reform in financial management to build capacity and ensure transparency and
efficiency in financial management are required in the new context o f decentralization. These
reforms will be monitored within the more comprehensive PSAL for Growth and
Decentralization currently under preparation.          Given the accelerated scheme of fiscal
decentralization, careful consideration should be given to detailed prioritisation, sequencing and
permanent training on the use of SIAF, both at central and municipal levels, to ensure capacity
for public financial administration. In the quarterly reports on budget execution, the MEF will
provide summary information on corrective actions taken to bring budget execution in line,
justifications for budget reallocations and explanations of spending on social expenditures. At
municipal level, the MEF will introduce performance indicators to track implementation of
decentralised policies and include new modules for regional governments, including electronic
payroll, accounting, debt management, and revenue collection.

2002 (report No 24205-PE), included programmatic assistance for the PSRL as a key element in
the Bank's assistance strategy. The PSRL i s supporting a medium-term social reform program
that i s fully in line with the CAS objectives and priorities. In the CAS base case, programmatic
assistance under the PSRL was expected to comprise a series of two loans-PSRL         I1and PSRL
I11(PSRL Iwas approved under the previous CAS). PSRLI1(Loan No. 46780) for $100 million
was approved (together with the CAS) in August 2002. The CAS envisaged PSRL I11in the
amount of $100 million and a proposed $8 million Social Reform TAL to support PSRL
implementation. The Government is now requesting that the loan amount for PSRL 111be
increased to US$150 million, and that a fourth PSRL be consider to provide continuing support
to its more ambitious program.
155.      Since discussion of the Bank's CAS for Peru, the Government has complied with the
four triggers for operating in the CAS' high lending scenario. These triggers included the need
to maintain: (a) a macroeconomic framework acceptable to the Bank; (b) a fiscal policy/debt
management strategy in place conducive to: (i)         a tax revenue/GDP ration higher than 12.5
percent, and (ii)   increase debt sustainability in the medium term; (c) a successful launching of
policy and institutional reforms toward growth and poverty alleviation including actions to
reform state institutions, develop decentralization in a fiscally sound framework, and promote
private sector competitiveness; and (d) a satisfactory portfolio performance measured by a
disbursement ratio higher than 20 percent and a ratio of commitments in problem projects below
20 percent. A detailed description of compliance in each of these areas i s provided inAnnex 3.
156.      The CAS envisaged a high case lending program that includes moving from about $220
million per year in the base case to up to about 400 million in the high case, of which about 50
percent would be provided in adjustment lending. In view of the strength of the social reform
program and the challenges in the area of decentralization---for which the social programs will
be at the forefront---the Government has requested additional financial support. The proposed
$50 million increase in the amount of PSRL 111-from         $100 million to $150 million-and  the
addition of a proposed PSRL IV, respond to the additional effort and needs of reforms in the
social area.     To complement these efforts, a proposed programmatic adjustment loan for
Decentralization and Competitiveness i s being prepared. This operation will support broad
economy-wide reforms, and will address efforts towards improving procurement and financial
management of the public sector, which inthe past were included under the PSRL series.
157.     In addition, reforms under the PSRL have been, and will continue to be, supported by
policy dialogue and technical assistance provided under AAAs, and investment and technical
assistance operations. The design o f the PSRL benefited from the recommendations of various
formal AAA reports including a 2000 Health Report (Peru: Improving Health Care for the Poor),
a 2000 Education Report (Peru: Education at a Crossroads), a 2002 Public Expenditure Review
(Peru: Restoring Fiscal Discipline for Poverty Reduction), and a FY04 pensions study (Peru:
Restoring the Multiple Pillars of Old Age Income Security) and from informal Bank studies
reviewing the decentralization o f the social sectors and the food aid programs.              The
implementation of the reforms agreed under PSRL i s supported by ongoing investment projects


                                                  44

in health (Health Reform APL), education (Rural Education APL), and water and sanitation
(PRONASAR). It will also receive technical assistance from a JSDS grant (TF051333-Giving
Voice to the Poor) and from a TAL currently under preparation. The TAL may provide support
to the PSRL and to the Programmatic Reform for Growth Loan.

B,Programobjectives,Benchmarksand Triggers

158.    The principal objective of PSRL I11i s to continue to support Peru's medium-term social
reform program. While building on the progress achieved under PSRL Iand 11, the third and
fourth phases of the reform will put emphasis on supporting the implementation of the social
development strategy and adapting it to the new context of decentralization. The priority would
be to ensure that resources are being allocated for and getting to the poor population, and
preventing the deterioration and backtracking in social programs that have occurred in other
countries at the time of decentralization. Specific objectives of PSRL I11are to help:
        Consolidate a pro-poor social expenditure regime and adequate social protection
        programs for the poor in a decentralized environment,
        Continue to improve access of the poor to basic health care and education through the
        establishment of new incentives for service providers and the development of a system o f
        explicit targets for subnational governments;
        Continue to improve transparency in social programs and expenditures and empower
        beneficiaries to participate inthe design and implementation of priority social programs.


          B.l. Prior Actions for PSRLI11and triggersfor PSRLIV

159.    The Prior Actions for PSRL I11are listed in Table 7. To a large extent, the prior actions
for PSRL I11correspond to the ten triggers originally foreseen in the documentation for PSRL
11-these  are compared in Table 6 in summary form and in detail in Annex 2. Most of the prior
actions correspond literally to the original triggers. The reform of the food programs had to be
adapted to the new context generated by the rapid pace of political decentralization.         The
protection of the individual PSPs could not be fully met in its original design and was
complemented by additional actions taken to correct the root of the problem (the passage o f
legislation prohibiting the diversion of PSP funds to pay for salary increases).        Other prior
actions correspond to the objectives of PSRL 111,but had not been originally foreseen (including
the approval of legislation to reform the pension system and the approval o f a Transparency
Law)-these    actions add to the "critical mass" of the reforms supported by the loan.   Reflecting
these new, larger challenges and accelerated reforms, the proposed PSRL I11i s in an amount of
US$150 million (from an original expected amount of US$lOO million) and a fourth PSRL i s
proposed to be added to the program to consolidate the social reform program in a decentralized
context
160.    Table 7 also lists the proposed benchmarks and triggers for PSRL IV. Triggers are in
bold.
161.    The table also lists the proposed monitoring indicators for PSRL N and the GOP's
mediumterm indicators for actions supported by the programmatic social reform loans. A large
part of the effort to be made for PSRL IV will be in the area of monitoring and evaluation.


                                                 45

While some progress was achieved in developing instruments and a culture o f monitoring results
under PSRL 111, the decentralization of social programs requires an even greater emphasis on
monitoring and evaluation. The setting up of an appropriate system for a decentralized country
i s a key trigger for PSRL JY. The preparations under way to build up this system are described
inAnnex 4,

C. LoanDisbursementandAudits

 162.   Disbursement arrangements would follow the simplified procedures for SALS/
SECALs approved by the Board on February I,1996. The Borrower will open an account in
the Central Bank of Peru. Once the Bank formally notifies the borrower that the loan is
available for withdrawal, the borrower will submit a simplified withdrawal application so
that the proceeds of the loan are deposited by the Bank inthis account, for use in accordance
with the Loan Agreement. Disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases, and
supporting evidence for disbursements i s therefore not required. The proceeds of the loan
may not be used to finance expenditures typically excluded under the Loan Agreement.
Although a routine audit of the deposit account would not be required, the Bank reserves the
right to request that an audit be conducted in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing, by an independent firm acceptable to the Bank. If requested, the audit will be
performed in accordance with terms of reference (TORS) approved by the Bank.

D.Procurement

 163.   Key procurement actions agreed in the Peru CAS to achieve the objectives o f
increased transparency, economy and efficiency and reduced levels of corruption in public
procurement are being implemented inthe context of the PSRL 111. Among these actions are
the strengthening of the control and supervision roles of the CGR and CONSUCODE over
the public contracting system and the phased implementation of an E-Government
procurement system. Progress achieved in implementing these activities i s provided in the
Policy Matrix discussed above.
164.    The review of the country legal procurement framework, including the development
of specific local regulations for selection and contracting of consultants and the
implementation of local standard biddinghelection documents are also paramount actions
agreed in the CAS to enable the achievement of increased transparency and efficiency in
public procurement. Although the GOP has recently conducted a review of the procurement
law and a revised draft proposing specific changes in it i s expected to be submitted to
Congress shortly, it will not address issues regarding procedures and practices in conflict
with international accepted procurement standards. The preparation and implementation of
national standard procurement/selection documents has not yet started.

E.EnvironmentalAspects

165.    Peru's efforts of the last few years to address environmental issues have continued
with some success and new challenges. In 2001, an Environmental Issues and Strategic
Options Study was carried out jointly by FA0 and the World Bank to identify the major
environmental issues and their underlying causal factors; review the institutional framework,
policies and instruments in place; and suggest strategic options. The main environmental
issues identified in the study remain largely unchanged; but some progress has been made in
the development of a regulatory framework, laws and norms to govern environmental
management of sectoral activities.       The national coordinating and consultative body
(Consejo Nucional del Ambiente-CONAM) under the President of the Council of Ministers i s
the regulatory entity for environmental management in Perk Its role i s to coordinate,
supervise and enforce sectoral environmental regulations. The CONAM has: (i)       established
an institutional framework to harmonize environmental legislation and institutional



                                              54

 responsibilities; (ii)developed a body of sectoral-based environmental legislation; (iii)
 established a series of prevention and control instruments (e.g. environmental impact
 assessments, environmental compliance programs, and territorial environmental assessments
 for public and private projects,           environmental quality     standards,  I S 0  14000,
 decontamination plans and others); and (iv) established a national protected area system.
 Progress i s also discernible in the private sector as demonstrated in the number of approved
 environmental management plans developed by industries to bring them into compliance
 with the legislation, particularly in the fishing, mining and energy sectors. Most recently,
 special attention has been given to environmental issues related to the mining and
hydrocarbon sector in connection with large private investments inthis sectors.
 166.    The institutional capacity for environmental management, however needs significant
improvement. Inparticular, Peru's environmental assessmentframework i s characterized by
fragmentation among line ministries, overlapping of mandates and competing -and often
contradictory - interests. Although regulations, standards, procedures and instrumentshave
been nominally adopted, their enforcement is still very weak. Environmental assessment
review i s currently under the responsibility of several sectoral units, including: INRENA at
the Ministry of Agriculture, DIGESA at the Ministry of Health, the environmental units at
the Ministry of Energy and Mining, the Vice-Ministry of Transports and the Vice-Ministry
of Housing.        The recent decentralization has further complicated the institutional
arrangements for environmental management.             In addition to sector-based units at the
central level, CONAM established 23 new Regional Environmental Commissions
responsible for bringing together the public and private sector, and civil society to discuss
and coordinate environmental policies at the regional level. This effort responds to the policy
on Sustainable Development and Environmental Management adopted through the National
Agreement which focuses on poverty alleviation and environmental management through
increased institutional coordination and citizen participation.
 167.   The increasingly complex institutional arrangements continue to present major
challenges for an effective and efficient environmental management in Peru. A simplified
institutional set up would help address important and growing gaps in technical and
managerial capacity, surveillance and monitoring systems, enforcement and public
awareness. Priorities for action are the consolidation of an integrated environmental and
social impact assessment system; the harmonization of standards, criteria and parameters for
environmental management (in particular for air, water and solid waste); and strengthening
the institutional capacities for the enforcement of environmental legislation and
environmental management. These challenges form part of the Bank's continuing dialogue
with the GOP. Venues for this dialogue are definedin the FY03-07 CAS, which include the
preparation of new investment projects (e.g. roads, urban transport, agriculture) that
normally require an environmental analysis and should include components to strengthen
environmental units in sector ministries, as well as environmental data collection and
monitoring. Currently, the Bank i s working with the Government of Peru in two analytical
areas for policy development and regulations:         Environmental and Social Issues of the
MiningSector and Environmental Health. The results of this work will be incorporated into
the range of Bank operations including activities related to the PSRL IV as appropriate.
168.    With regard to the indigenous population, special attention i s given to this population
by some protected social programs, as well as Bank-financed projects (education, health,
Indigenous and Afro-Peruvians Peoples Development LIL)on the needs of the dispersedand
indigenous groups. Also, the GEF-financed Indigenous Management of Protected Areas in



                                                55

the Amazon Project will help regularize issues related to land-tenure and environment inthe
Amazon area.

F.Monitoringand Evaluation

169.    Under PSRL I,the principal emphasis for social sector reform was placed on
transparency of information. The development of a monitoring and evaluation system was
initiated, leading to the establishment of specific objectives by districts which were
published on the web, but generally the indicators established to monitor the loan were not
generally quantified and outcomes were defined in general terms, without clearly specifying
the indicator or the quantitative goal. This strategy was modified under the PSRL 11, in
which the M&E system focused on medium-term impact indicators (such as for example
percentage of poor and infant mortality), developed with technical assistancefrom the World
Bank. The government for the first time specified indicators and established medium-term
goals (for 2006), linking them to the social reform program included in the Letter of Policy.
The emphasis was thus placed on linkingactions to medium-term objectives and to establish
the corresponding indicators.
170.    During preparation of PSRL 111, the government has made an effort to review the
progress made towards the medium-termindicators and results of this effort are presented in
table 7 and in Annex 4, and suggest that there has been progress in many key areas. At the
same time, efforts to monitor and evaluate the key social programs have brought to light the
need to implement: a new system of monitoring and evaluation will be needed once the
social programs become decentralized, since several programs will be implemented by sub-
national governments, regulated by sectoral ministries and financed by the Ministry of
Finance. Progress has also been made on the impact evaluations of the key social programs
done by independent professionals or institutions. Similarly, the score card methodology
which i s based on client satisfaction of services was carried out for 5 social programs. For
the future, M & E will be fine-tuned in the following two areas: First, the matrix of triggers
(Table 7) establishes revised, more realistic medium-term development goals, in order to
maintain credibility in the efforts to focus on results. Second, emphasis has been placed on
specifying and quantifying monitoring indicators that can be tracked on a yearly basis.
Further details on progress on this area are described inAnnex 4.
171.    The establishment of a M&E system for the six PSPs incorporating elements of
social participation and transparency i s defined as a trigger for the PSRL IV. This system i s
aimed at improving decision-making and accountability and supporting management based
on results in a decentralized context. The government has already designated a technical
coordinator for this effort. The Bank plans to provide support for this effort under the
proposed Social Sector Technical Assistance Loan whose principal objective i s expected to
be the development of this monitoring and evaluation system.

 G.Benefitsand Risks
 172.    The immediate major benefit of the PSRL program will be its contribution to Peru's
 maintenance of social stability during a difficult period of adjustment towards economic
 recovery. The PSRL I11will continue to protect critical social programs for the poor in a
 time when the country i s facing the double adjustment of reducing the fiscal deficit and
 reducing the cost of decentralization. It will also help increase the quality and efficiency of
 social expenditures by increasing the coverage of key health services for the poor and
 prevent the loss of education coverage and quality. It will help set the framework for
 decentralization by supporting the design of the first decentralization package, particularly
 food programs. At the same time, in a country where decentralization will profoundly
 change the social sectors, it helps set the stage by supporting the development of key
 instruments (such as SIS, Performance Agreements, teacher electronic payrolls) that prepare
 the stage for the decentralization of health and education. The mechanisms for public
 oversight of social policy supported by the operation will enhance the influence and voice of
 the poor on key social programs and help strengthen civil society at the national, regional
 and local level. The intersectoral approach of the PSRL has strengthened the contacts
 between the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Office of the Prime Minister, the
 Ministry of Women and Social Development and the Ministries of Education and Health.
 The ultimate success of the programmatic operation will be measured by the extent to which
 public expenditures have actually reached the poor and had a positive impact on their quality
 of life. Risks are summarized inTable 8.

IRESUMEN

L a politica social del Gobiemo es uno de 10s instmmentos claves en la lucha contra la
pobreza. L a primera prioridad es garantizar el acceso universal a servicios bisicos de calidad
(salud, educacidn, nutrici6n) para evitar la pe'rdida de potencial humano. Una segunda
prioridad se orienta a incrementar las oportunidades econ6micas para la poblaci6n pobre
incidiendo, en primer lugar, en el mantenimiento preventivo de la infraestmctura social y
productiva (postas, escuelas, vias, canales de regadio, etc). De otro lado, se trata de mejorar
la eficiencia y transparencia de la gestidn pdblica a1 mismo tiempo que proteger y
racionalizar el gasto social, en el context0 de la descentralizacibn y sobre la base de 10s
recursos que ya han sido asignados a 10s sectores.

Generar oportunidades de trabajo digno y productivo es el gran desafio para toda la sociedad.
L a inversibn, producci6n y productividad son responsabilidad principalmente del sector
privado. L a acci6n del Estado s610 genera condiciones y tiende unpuente a las comunidades
con familias que no pueden expresar sus demandas en el mercado y adolecen de un alto
de'ficit de consumo. L a inversi6n social adicional se guia por las seiiales de alerta basadas en
las demandas de las familias en riesgo, lo que permite integrar y simplificar las acciones que
se derivan del diagn6stico.

Teniendo como antecedentes el Acuerdo Nacional, la Carta Social suscrita en el marco de la
Mesa de Concertaci6n de Lucha Contra la Pobreza, y las Bases para la Estrategia de
Superaci6n de la Pobreza y Oportunidades Econ6micas para 10s Pobres, este documento
contiene: diagn6stic0, objetivos y requisitos de la politica social, prioridades y compromisos
para el perfodo 2003-2006, culminando en medidas inmediatas a aplicar para garantizar su
cumplimiento.

11.DIAGNOSTICO

El 54 por ciento de peruanos -en proporci6n coincidente con quienes se encuentran en el
subempleo y desempleo- vive con menos de US$ 2 diarios', la mitad en keas rurales (7,4
millones de personas) y la mitad (7,2) en el &rea urbana, incluyendo Lima Metropolitana. L a
pobreza extrema afecta a 4,8 millones de personas; cuyo ingreso, es menor a un d6lar a1dia,
y no alcanza a cubrir necesidades basicas de alimentacibn. El 77,1% de la poblaci6n rural es

EldCficit de consumo se expresa en la cantidad adicional de recursos monetarios anualesque
las familias pobres necesitarian generar para salir de la pobreza. EldCficit de consumo basic0
que afecta a1total de pobres (i.e. la diferencia entre el costo promedio de la canastab6sica de
consumo per &pita, aproximadamente US$2 diarios, y el gasto per c6pita de cada familia) se
estima en US$ 3 260 millones para el aiio 2003, mientras que el dCficit de consumo
alimentario que afecta a1 total de pobres extremos (Le. la diferencia entre el costo promedio

El crecimiento econ6mico es indispensable, para la reducci6n de la pobreza. En el period0
1994-1997, caracterizado por un importante crecimiento econ6mico, se produjo una
disminuci6n de la pobreza y pobreza extrema, sobre todo en las zonas urbanas, siendo asi que
en las Areas rurales la pobreza est6 vinculada a factores mAs permanentes. Luego de superar
la fase de estancamiento iniciada en 1998, la economia peruana ha crecido en 5,3 por ciento
en el aiio 2002, la mayor tasa de 10s Cltimos cinco aiios lograda en un context0 de turbulencia
econdmica y politica en la regibn. Sin embargo, el crecimiento no es condici6n suficiente; se
requiere asegurar su carActer inclusivo y su efecto redistributivo, alineando la politica

econ6mica y la politica social en funci6n del objetivo comdn de reducir la pobreza. Se trata
de superar la situacidn actual del mercado de trabajo -caracterizado por una alta proporci6n
de trabajo independiente y familiar en unidades de escasa productividad- asi como el
desarrollo incipiente de la infraestructura productiva bfisica y 10s mercados locales en las
zonas rurales; reconociendo, a1 mismo tiempo, que la discriminaci6n cultural y la debilidad
en el ejercicio de la ciudadania se suman a 10s factores econ6micos para explicar la pobreza.

El gasto social del Estado tambiCn aument6 en la dCcada del 90; sin embargo, su enfoque
asistencial y la falta de eficiencia en muchos de 10s programas limitaron su impacto. En la
actualidad se pretende incrementar la cobertura y la eficacia en el ejercicio de la funcidn
social del Estado a trave's de un conjunto de medidas orientadas a mejorar la gerencia, a
reorientar el us0 de fondos para una mejor atenci6n de prioridades y a garantizar
transparencia, comprometiendo en ese sentido a todos 10s niveles de gobierno.

peruanos unnivel de vida digno y el acceso a bienes y servicios pdblicos.

El gobierno est6 comprometido, en el marco de la Estrategia de Superacih de la
Pobreza,con 10s siguientes objetivos:
       Reducci6n de la Pobreza Total y Pobreza Extrema.
       Aumentar el acceso integral (simult6neo) a 10s servicios basicos de salud, educaci6n y
       nutricidn de 10s pobres extremos.
       Aumentar el acceso de 10s distritos a lainformaci6n sobre la ejecuci6n fisica y
       presupuestal de 10s programas sociales.


Sus objetivos coinciden con 10s contenidos del objetivo Equidad y Justicia Social del
Acuerdo Nacional,el cual contiene las siguientes politicas


                                              64

       a) Reducci6n de la pobreza.
       b) Acceso aunaEducaci6n PiiblicaBhsica Gratuita y de Calidad
       c) Acceso a 10s Servicios de Salud y a la Seguridad Social
       d) Garantizar laNutrici6nInfantil y Promoci6nde la SeguridadAlimentaria familiar
       e) Promoci6n del Empleo Digno y Productivo
       f) Promoci6nde la Igualdadde Oportunidades sinDiscriminaci6n

Sin embargo, la politica social por s i sola no puede lograr el desarrollo humano a1 que
aspiramos. Por ello, las acciones encaminadas a1cumplimiento de 10s otros tres objetivos del
Acuerdo Nacional, se constituyen en requisitos para potenciar y hacer sostenibles 10s logros
de la PoliticaSocial:

    - Competitividaddel pais, que comprende -entre otros prop6sitos- laformaci6n del
       capital humano, la formalizacibn de la actividad empresarial de la pequeiia y
       microempresa, el desarrollo de las cadenas productivas, indispensables para
       incrementar las oportunidades econ6micas de 10s pobres, mejorar su inserci6n en el
       circuit0 de la producci6n, permitiendo con ello la generaci6n de empleo de calidad.
    - DemocraciayEstadodeDerecho, cuyoprop6sitoesasegurarunclimadeestabilidad
       y cooperaci6n politica, promover la competencia democritica y garantizar las
       elecciones libres y transparentes, el pluralism0 y la alternancia en el poder, es decir
       generar el ejercicio pleno de la ciudadania y del clima de confianza y seguridad que
       necesitaunpais para avanzar en el desarrollo.
    - EstadoEficiente, TransparenteyDescentralizado,cuyoprop6sito finalesconstruir y
       mantener un Estado eficiente, eficaz, modern0 y transparente a1 servicio de las
       personas y de sus derechos, creando las condiciones para el desarrollo ciudadano, y
       alentando el fortalecimiento del sector privado y la sociedad civil.

En particular, es importante que se cumpla una serie de desarrollos paralelos que haran
viables y sostenibles 10s logros en el campo social, principalmente: Consolidaci6n de la
gobernabilidad en 10s distintos niveles de gobierno; Modernizaci6n y racionalizaci6n del
Estado; Transparencia y Acceso a la Informaci6n del Estado; Consolidaci6n de 10s espacios
de concertaci6n entre Estado y Sociedad Civil; Reforma del Poder Judicial, en particular lo
concerniente a la primera instancia; asi como el sistema de pensiones.


IV. PRIORIDADESY COMPROMISOSDEPOLiTICA SOCIAL 2003-2006

Las prioridades y compromisos, como tambiCn las medidas que posteriormente se seiialan se
establecenteniendo en cuenta el contexto, que en este period0 est6 marcado por el proceso de
descentralizacibn y por la necesidad de racionalizar y proteger el gasto social, asegurando
que 10s recursosinvertidos realmente lleguen a la poblaci6n objetivo.




                                             65

IV. 1PrioridadesPresupuestales

Las prioridades se expresan de dos maneras, dependiendo del origen de 10s recursos
financieros: 1) con 10s recursos actualmente asignados, reasignaci6n de 10s presupuestos al
interior de cada una de las 3 grandes areas; y 2) con eventuales aumentos presupuestales, en
un escenario de bonanza fiscal, 10s recursos se destinartin siguiendo este orden de
prioridades. Para aplicar sus prioridades, el gobierno ha definido una politica presupuestaria
orientada a incrementar gradualmente 10s recursos destinados a esas actividades e
inversiones, dentro del marco del equilibrio fiscal.

Esta politica presupuestaria se refleja en las siguientes orientaciones, que se han venido
aplicando y se mantendran en el futuro pr6ximo:

    i)     Atender preferentemente el presupuesto orientado a las funciones de educaci6n y
           cultura, salud y saneamiento, y asistencia social:
           o Durante el 2002, se ejecut6 mas del 95% de lo presupuestado en cada una de
               estas tres funciones.
           o Enel 2003, se ejecutar6por lo menos lo ejecutado en el 2002.
           o Para el 2004, se ha presupuestado una cantidad superior a la del 2003 en el
               proyecto de ley entregado a1Congreso el 30 de agosto.
    ii)    Proteger el presupuesto dirigido a 6 programas sociales protegidos (educaci6n
           inicial, educaci6n primaria, educaci6n secundaria, salud individual, salud
           colectiva y promoci6n y asistencia social y comunitaria), particulmente respecto
           a 10s gastos no salariales niprevisionales.
           o Durante el 2002, en estos rubros globalmente se ejecut6 una cantidad superior
               altotal presupuestadoinicialmente.
           o Para el 2003, se presupuest6 un monto global superior, y se mantuvieron
               montos para 4 de estos 6 programas superiores a 10s del aiio anterior. A1
               menos 85% de este monto global sera ejecutado.
           o En el proyecto de ley de presupuesto del 2004, se ha aumentado el monto
               global y 10s presupuestos de 3 de estos programas (cambigndose el programa
               de asistencia social y comunitaria por 10s programas sociales y de lucha contra
               la pobreza transferidos a 10s gobiernos locales).
           o En el proyecto de ley de presupuesto 2004 se ha incorporado un articulo
               impidiendo que presupuestos orientados a estos rubros Sean trasladados a
               gastos salariales o a otros programas.
           o En el proyecto de ley de equilibrio financiero, se ha establecido que en cas0
               haya recursos ordinarios mayores en 2% a l o presupuestado, estos ser6n
               destinados como primeras prioridades a educaci6n y salud.

       aiios hasta diciembre del 2002). Para promover la eficiencia del SIS y mejorar su
       sostenibilidad financiera, el presupuesto del 2004 separar6 10s recursos orientados a1
       primer y segundo nivel de 10s orientados a hospitales, de tal manera de evitar que las
       atenciones complejas, menos equitativas y menos costo-efectivas, capturen la mayor
       parte del presupuesto.
  - Consolidar la separaci6n y especializaci6n de las funciones de provisi6n
       descentralizada de 10s servicios a travCs del fortalecimiento de las Comunidades
       Locales de Administraci6n de Salud (CLAS) y del rol de gobierno del Ministerio de
       Salud, a traves de 10s Convenios de Gesti6n con 10s Gobiernos Regionales y/o
       Locales.
  - Consolidar y avanzar en el intercambio de servicios de salud entre el MINSA,
       ESSALUD y el sector privado, utilizando mecanismos de mercado (compra o venta

  desarrollando un proyecto piloto en zonas rurales y se ha publicado un estudio sobre 10s
  sistemas de incentivos aplicables a la educaci6n ptiblica peruana.
     - Implementar un sistema automatizado de planillas y de control de plazas a nivel
  nacional, que permita evitar 10s "maestros fantasmas", realizar el analisis de carga

           programas aseguran una adecuada focalizaci6n mediante una combinaci6n de
            autoselecci6n mediante el salario y de focalizaci6n geogrifica. Asimismo, se ha
           tenido cuidado que no generen costos administrativos excesivos, y se han
           desarrollado evaluaciones de impacto. A futuro, en funci6n del crecimiento
           econ6mico logrado y las mejores oportunidades de empleo que se esth
            generando, estos programas serin paulatinamente desactivados, rescatando las
           lecciones aprendidas en el marco de una politica permanente de mantenimiento

           fines y define mecanismos para que 10s recursos Sean entregados mediante
           convenios de gesti6n que establezcanmetas y procesos a ser monitoreados.
       -   Mejoramiento de la equidad en el sistema de pensiones, corrigiendo las
           distorsiones generadas por el sistema de CCdula Viva, limitando beneficios y
           estableciendo contribuciones mayores a 10s afiliados. Asimismo, se ha definido
           una autoridad gubernamental encargada de desarrollar y monitorear el conjunto de
           las politicas de seguridad para la vejez, que seri la Direcci6n General de Asuntos
           Econ6micos y Sociales (DGAES) del MEF.


V. REFORMAS INSTITUCIONALES ENSECTORES SOCIALES

I.SUMMARY

The Government's social policy is one of the key tools in the struggle against poverty. The
first priority i s to ensure universal access to quality basic services (health, education and
nutrition) to prevent the loss of human potential. A second priority i s directed at increasing
economic opportunities for the poor, underscoring in the first place the preventive
maintenance of social and productive infrastructure (health facilities, schools, roads,
irrigation canals, etc.).  Inaddition, we aim at improving the efficiency and transparency of
government spending while protecting and rationalizing social expenditure, against the
backdrop of decentralization and based on the resources that have already been allocated to
the sectors.

Creating opportunities of dignified and productive work for the poor i s every society's major
challenge. Investment, production and productivity are mainly the responsibility of the
private sector.     State initiatives can only create enabling conditions and bridges for
communities where families cannot express their demands through markets, and suffer major
consumption deficits. Social investment i s guidedby the warning signals sent by households
at risk. These signals allow us to integrate and simplify the actions that will follow our
diagnosis.

Having as background the National Agreement, the Social Letter signed in the framework of
the Consensus Round Table Against Poverty and the Foundations for the Strategy to Defeat
Poverty and Create Economic Opportunities for the Poor, this document deals with the social
policy diagnosis, objectives and requirements,as well as the priorities and commitments for
the 2003-2006 period. As a conclusion, it lists the immediate measures aimed at ensuring
their accomplishment.

11. DIAGNOSIS
Fifty-four percent of Peruvians, a ratio similar to the percentage of underemployed and
unemployed persons, live on less than US$2 a day,l half of them in the countryside (7.4
million people), and the other half (7.2 million) in cities, including Metropolitan Lima.
Extreme poverty grips 4.8 million persons with incomes under one dollar a day who are
unable to meet their basic food needs. The poor comprise 77.1 percent of the rural
population and 50.3 percent of them live in extreme poverty.              In cities, including
Metropolitan Lima, 1.71 million persons live inextreme poverty.

Consumption deficits are expressed by the additional amount of annual money resources
poor families would need to generate to lift themselves out of poverty.                          The basic
consumption deficit that grips the entire poor population (Le. the difference between the
average cost of the per capita basic consumption basket of approximately US$2 per day and
each household's per capita expenditure) i s estimated at US$3,260 million for 2003, while
the food consumption deficit endured by the population in extreme poverty (Le. the
difference between the average cost of the per capita basic consumption basket of
approximately US$1 per day, and each family's per capita expenditure) i s estimated at
US$716 million for that year.

Economic growth i s indispensable for reducing poverty. From 1994 to 1997 when Peru
experienced major economic growth, poverty and extreme poverty diminished, in particular
inurban areas. Inrural areas, poverty is related to factors of a more permanent nature. After
overcoming the stagnation period that started in 1998, Peru's economy grew 5.3 percent in
2002, the highest rate in the most recent five year period, despite the region's economic and
political turmoil. However, growth i s not sufficient. We must ensure that it will be inclusive
and have a distributive effect by aligning economic and social policies to the shared objective
of reducing poverty. The twofold purpose i s to overcome the present condition of the labor
market characterized by a high proportion of independent and household labor organized in

units of low productivity, and to provide momentum to the incipient development of basic
productive infrastructure and local markets in rural areas, while recognizing that cultural
discrimination and a weak exercise of citizens' rights are other non-economic factors in that
contribute to explaining poverty.

Duringthe 1990s,the State's expenditures also increased. However, emphasis on handouts
and the inefficiency of many programs reduced its impact. At present, we aim at expanding
coverage and increasing the efficacy of the State's social function through a number of
measures aimed at improving management, redirecting the use of resources to better serve
priority needs while ensuring transparency, with a commitment from all                       levels of
government.


111.    SOCIAL POLICY, OBJECTIVES AND REQUIREMENTS
Social policy has as its objective to accomplish the full development of human, social and
institutional potential, in the search for social equity and justice.            It translates into the
guidelines and initiatives identified by the Government to ensure all Peruvians a dignified
life and ready access to public goods and services.

Inthe framework of the Strategy to DefeatPoverty, the Government of Peruis
committed to accomplish the following objectives:
            Reduce poverty and extreme poverty.


        0   Provide comprehensive (simultaneous) access to basic health, education and food
            services for the extremely poor.


            Increase district level access to information on the physical and budgetexecution
            progress of social programs.


Its objectives are similar to those of the Social Equity and Justice goal, included in the
National Agreement. It includes the following policies:


                                                 76

    a) Poverty reduction.
    b) Access to Free Quality Basic PublicEducation.
    c) Access to Health Care Services and Social Security.
    d) EnsuringChildNutrition and PromotingFamily Food Security.
    e) Promoting Dignified and Productive Work.
    f) PromotingEqualOpportunities without Discrimination.

However, social policy in itself cannot achieve the human development to which we aspire.
For this reason, the initiatives below, leading to the accomplishment of the three other goals
of the National Agreement, are also necessary to leverage and achieve the sustainability of
the Social Policy accomplishments.

    - National competitiveness, comprising among others, building human capital,
        formalizing the business activity of small and micro companies, developing
        productive changes, which are indispensable to expand economic opportunities for
        the poor, improving their insertion in the production circuit and thus ensuring the

    -   generation of quality employment.
         Democracy and the Rule of Law, with the purpose of ensuring a climate of political
        stability and cooperation, promoting democratic competition and guaranteeing free
        and transparent elections, pluralism and the alternation in power, i.e. making possible
        the full exercise of citizens' rights and the climate of trust and security the country

    -   needs in moving towards development.
         An Efficient, Transparent and Decentralized State, the ultimate purpose of which is
        to create and maintain an efficient, effective, modern and transparent State to serve
        people and protect their rights, while creating the enabling conditions for citizen
        development and promoting a stronger private sector and civil society.

In particular, it is important to ensure a number of simultaneous developments to ensure
viable and sustainable achievements in the social arena, mainly: enhanced governance in
various levels of government; modernization and rationalization of the State; transparency of
and access to State information; strengthening of spaces for consensus-building between the
State and civil society; and reform of the Judiciary, in particular in the lower instances, and
of the pension system.


 IV.    SOCIAL POLICY PRIORITIES AND COMMITMENTS. 2003-2006

The priorities and commitments, as well as the measures mentioned below are established
taking into account the overall environment which, during this period, i s signed by the
process of decentralization and the need to rationalize and protect social expenditure,
ensuringthat the invested resourceswill effectively reach the target populations.

IV. 1Budgetpriorities
Priorities are expressed in two ways, depending on the source of financial resources: 1)
resources already allocated, and reallocation of budgets within each of the three main areas;


                                               77

and 2) eventual budgetary increases in a scenario of fiscal prosperity. Resources will be
allocated in the following order of priorities. To enforce its priorities, the Government has
outlined a budget policy aimed at gradually increasing the resources allocated to these
activities and investments within a framework of fiscal balance.

This budget policy i s reflected in the following initiatives, all of which are already underway
and will continue to be enforced inthe near future.

        i)Pay preferential attention to the budgets for education, cultured, health,
            sanitation, and social assistance:
            o In 2002, over 95% of the budgeted amounts were executed for each of these
                functions.
            o In2003, an amount at least similar to 2002 will beexecuted.
            o For 2004, an amount higher than in2003 was includedinthe draft law sent to
                Congress on August 30,2003.
        ii)Protectthebudgetfor sixprotectedsocialprograms(initialeducation, primary
            education, collective health and promotion, social and community assistance), in
            particular with respect to non-wage and pension expenditures.
            o In2002, the executed amount was higher thaninitially budgeted.
            o In 2003, the overall budget was higher and amounts for four of the six
                programs were higher than a year before. At least 85% of this global amount
                will be executed.
            o The 2004 draft law has increased the global amount and the budgets for three
                of the programs (the social and community assistanceprogram was substituted
                for the social programs and the poverty struggle program that were devolved
                to local governments).
            o The 2004 draft law includes an article to prevent bidet transfers from these
                items to wage expensesor other programs.
            o The financial equilibrium law establishesthat ordinary resources 2% or higher
                than originally budgeted will be allocated to education and health as a first
                priority.

IV.2 Sector objectives and goals


Basic Health:
Objectives: Ensuring access to quality health care for the people, in particular for the poor,
while preventing and checking the risks of and damage caused by transmissible diseases;
ensuring a public subsidy through a guaranteed health plan for the poorest households.
Priority will be given to executing preventive activities in general and those relating to
mothers and children and families at risk. Ensuringa public subsidy for a Guaranteed health
Plan for the poorest families.




                                               78

Policy initiatives.-
        Creating the Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan (Seguro Integral de Salud or SIS)
        to increase access to priority health services, in particular mother-child health, and
        quickly expand their coverage. (Over 540 000 pregnant mothers and over 2 million
        children under 5 years old were affiliated to December 2002). To promote the SIS's
        efficiency and attain financial sustainability, the 2004 budget will discriminate first
        and second level resources from resources for hospitals, so that more complex level
        of care that i s less equitable and cost-effective will not capture most of the budget.


        Consolidate separate and specialized service supplies through stronger Local
        Community Health Management Committees (CLAS) and the governance role of the
        Ministry of Health through management agreements with regional and local
        govemments.


        Consolidate and move ahead in the exchange (purchase and sale) of health services
        among the Ministry of Health, Essalud social security and the private sector through
        market schemes among subsectors, as appropriate.


Basic Education

Objectives: To improve the quality of learning in the new school system and close the
coverage and equity gaps, in particular in rural areas; set a priority on initial and primary
education-in     particular by improving attendance, actual learning time and educational
material-and     high school, by ensuring eleven years of schooling and universal basic
schooling accomplishment.         To increase student and teacher attendance to reach 1000
effective class time per year. To ensure timely enrolment (according to statutory age) of
boys and girls in first grade primary, and to increase the number of boys and girls who
graduate from six grade primary school according to the statutory age. Pay special attention
to the population not covered, in particular the bilingual, rural, and under-5 segments.
Priority.- Improve the quality of basic education and reduce the coverage gap, principally for
initial and high school education.

Policy initiatives.-

        Developing and introducing flexible mechanisms to create incentives for a system
        that manages human resources and ensures an appropriate number of students for
        every teacher, and guarantees that the poorest boys and girls will be taught by
        qualified teachers. A pilot project for rural areas is underway and an study on
        incentive systems applicable to Peruvian public education has been published.
        Introducing an automated payroll and teaching positions control system to prevent the
        proliferation of "ghost teachers", evaluate teaching loads and rationalization
        processes, and facilitate the introduction of a set of criteria for merit-based payments
        at the regional and local levels.




                                                 79

Social safety net
Objective: to build a social safety net that will protect poor Peruvians from the main
economic cycle and unemployment risks, and from old age.


Policy initiatives:


        Design and implement the "A Trabajar" job creation program in both the cities and
        the countryside in view of the economic crisis underway and acute unemployment.
        These programs ensure the proper targeting of resources by adequately combining
        self-screening through geographic and focalization criteria.     Care was exerted to
        avoid excess overhead expenses and put inplace the corresponding impact evaluation
        schemes.     In future, as a consequence of economic growth and better job
        opportunities, these programs will be phasedout, while drawing lessons learned inthe
        framework of an ongoing policy to preserve community-based labor-intensive
        initiatives.


-       With respect to food programs, the Government will submit to Congress a Proposed
        Law for the transfer of resources linked to social programs to Local Governments.
        The Law proposes that transfers be based on a pro-poor formula preventing these
        resources from being allocated to other ends. It also includes mechanisms to deliver
        resources through management agreements introducing targets and processes subject
        to monitoring.


-       Greater equity will be introduced in the pension system, by correcting the distortions
        introduced by the permanent pension readjustment scheme ("CCdula Viva"), limiting
        benefits and increasing contributions of members. A government agency-the
        General Bureau for Economic and Social Affairs (DGAES) under the Ministry of
        Economy and Finance-       has been created to design and monitor a set of old age
        pension policies.


V. INSTITUTIONAL REFORMSINSCOAILL SECTORS

To reach the above objectives and improve governance, it was considered necessary to
introduce certain reforms, inparticular in social sectors, aimed at improving transparency and
citizen involvement.


Policy initiatives:

        Approving a Public Information Disclosure Act and the corresponding regulations to
        ensure the citizens the right to obtain information from government agencies.




                                                 80

       Developing Consulta Amigable (Friendly Query), under SIAF (Integrated Financial
       Management System) to provide easy Internet access and access to information in
       most provinces of Peru, and include them in the physical and procedure access goals
       for three social programs (PRONAA, SIS and A Trabajar Urbano).


       Developing a pilot "Libretas de Calificaci6n" (Report Cards) program to give citizens
       a voice respecting the quality of five social programs (Glass of Milk, School
       Breakfasts, health services, PRONOEIs and A Trabajar Rural) in several regions
       throughout Peru.


       Improve regulations for government procurement by publishing conformed rules for
       CONSUCODE (the government's procurement and bidding administration) and the
       General Controller's Office.


VI. SHORT TERM GOVERNMENTPOLICIES

To achieve the above goals, the government has prioritized a set of emergency policies for
the next twelve months, including:


    1.    Linking Multiannual Microeconomic PlanningandSocial Policy (including
          pensions) planning, and linking the latter to the Multiannual Sector Strategic Plans
          and annual Institutional Operation Plans.
    2.    Developing a Functional System for Follow up and Evaluation that will allow to
          oversee and publishimpact, results and process indicator figures linkedto the
          accomplishment of Social Policy Goals, including pensions.
    3.    Institutionalizing protectionfor budget expenditures aimed at the priority social
          functions and programs.
   4.     Decentralizing social programs, including nutrition food programs, social
          productive investments, health and education, as a commitment and way to involve
         regional and local stakeholders inenforcing Social Policy Guidelines.
          Strengtheninganddevelopingthe relevant Management Agreements.
    5.   Developing a comprehensive pension strategy with an emphasis on increasing
         coverage for the poor.
    6.   Targetingthe poorest groups and allocating to themgovernment resources from
         social programs aimed at defeating poverty. Individually identifying the program's
         target persons, families, and populations.
   7.    Pursuingthe continued increase in coverage of a Guaranteed Health Insurance
         (including nutrition and psychomotor early training) within the Comprehensive
         Health Care (SIS) insurance for poor under-5s and pregnant mothers, preferably
         through care services of the first and second levels. SIS disbursements should



                                              81

         cover all costs infull, including payrolls, for Local Community HealthManagement
         Committees (CLAS).
   8.    Strengthening a management system for the teacher community, through a single
         nationwide system for payrolls, and cross-referencing teacher positions and
         payrolls, rationalization of teachers under temporary contracts, and validation of an
         incentives pilot project for rural teachers.
    9.   Introducing schemes that will provide for more open use of public resources in
         social programs and include local and regional government management inthe
         disclosure mechanisms for the public sector.
   10. Fostering citizen watch and mechanisms to collect the users' perceptions on the
         quality of public services, with an emphasis on the execution of programs and
         projects related to productive social investments.
   11. Strengthening rules andprocedures for the efficient execution, appropriate control
         and enhanced accountability in State procurement and management of financial
         resources, including regional and local government level management, inparticular
         for social sectors and food programs.

       ratio higher than 12.5 percent, and (ii)increase debt sustainability inthe medium term.
   3. Successful launching of policy and institutional reforms toward growth and policy
       alleviation including actions to reform state institutions, develop decentralization in a
       fiscally sound framework, and promote private sector competitiveness.
  4. Satisfactory portfolio performance measured by a disbursement ratio higher than 20

       performance criteria remain on track after its third review.          There are no major
       imbalances in the economy and vulnerability indicators point toward a stable recovering
       economy: growth and exports remain robust, inflation i s low, the exchange rate i s stable,
       external and fiscal accounts are in good standing and improving, and the country's risk
       has reached historic low spreads.

       Tax revenuecollectionmeets the requiredCAS High Case target and is improving.
       The average tax ratio for the first two quarters of 2003 was 12.7 percent of GDP, and the
       estimated 2003 and 2004 annual tax ratios are at 12.7 percent of GDP and 13.0 percent of
       GDP, in an increasing trend from the 2002 ratio of 12.1 percent of GDP. Such outcomes
       reveal the impact of a set of tax policy and administration measures already approved by
       Congress. Coupled with expenditure cuts, adopted revenue measures should allow Peru
       to follow the path of reduced fiscal vulnerability and, for the first time, meet the fiscal
       deficit target contained in the Law of Fiscal Prudence and Transparency (FPTL) for the
       Non-Financial Public Sector (NFPS), 2.0 percent of GDP for 2003 and 1.5 percent of
       GDP for 2004.

       Implementationof a new management strategy hasstrengtheneddebt sustainability
       in the medium-term. Supported by the Bank and the IMF, the country has issue new
       debt rules and improved debt management capacity. In February 2002, the country
       achieved a successful Brady debt buyback for about US$923 million that improved debt
       service repayment profile and reopened international markets for Peruvian sovereign
       bonds. Last April, the passage of the revised FTRL last April adequately addresses
       medium term debt sustainability, as well as regulates subnational debt management. The
       Law sets a target 40 percent of GDP public debt ratio for 2006. New domestic debt in
       Soles was also issued successfully, improving domestic debt maturity, developing the
       local capital market, and contributing to de-dollarize public debt. As a result of these
       measures, public debt ratios continue to decrease on a sustainable path: the public sector
       debt ratio is estimated to decrease from 46.1 percent of GDP in 2002 to 44.3 percent of

  GDPin2003; and the public external debt service ratio is estimatedto decrease from 31.6
  percent of exports in 2002 to 22.0 percent of exports in 2003.


0 Authorities have developed a comprehensive set of fiscally neutral institutional
  reforms.     These reforms are accompanied by the PSRL I11 and a parallel Bank
  Programmatic operation on Growth, Competitiveness and Decentralization. Actions to
  reform state institutions include the merging and rationalization of social programs
  under the new Ministry of the Women and Social Development, and the approval by
  Congress of pension reform, which increasesworkers' contributions, closes the access by
  new public workers to the expensive regime of Ckdula Viva,and places an upper limit on
  pensions. Both actions contribute to the sustainability of the fiscal accounts in the
  medium term.       Actions to develop a fiscally sound decentralization include a
  regulatory framework approved between 2002 and 2003 that incorporates principles of
  fiscal and debt sustainability at the subnational level: the Framework Law of
  decentralization endorses the principle of fiscal neutrality; the Organic Law of
  Decentralization includes the principles of transparency, accountability and responsibility
  interms of borrowing and establishesfiscal rules for regional and local governments; the
  Law of Regional Governments details the exclusive and shared responsibilities and
  allows the Central Government's oversight over the regional government's finances; the
  draft Law of Intergovernmental Transfers, designed with the support of PSRL 111,
  conditions transfers to local governments in exchange of their assumed responsibility in
  implementing social programs and sector allocations with the support of management
  contracts; and the draft Law on Fiscal Decentralization, supported with the support o f the
  IMF, IDB and the Bank, seeks to ensure that decentralization is fiscally sustainable.
  Finally, actions to ensure private sector competitiveness include export promotion and
  infrastructure development policies being implemented by the Government and including
  a new institutional framework for export development-developing export capacity at the
  enterprise and regional level-and      production chains, new conditions for access to
  foreign markets; new quality control practices; improved access to exports finance;
  reduction of logistic costs by improving infrastructure and trade logistic services such as
  Customs controls and security services at ports and airports.

                             ANNEX 4: ResultsMonitoring inPSRLI11

1. Background. Monitoring and evaluation has historically been an area where the Peruvian
   state has demonstrated serious deficiencies. During the Government of Fujimori, this was
   aggravated due to the manipulation and lack of transparency of official statistics, which led
   to the concealment of information-for      example in the area of education-which   resulted in
   serious criticisms on the part of citizens.
2. PSRL I.Inthe PSRL I, principalemphasis for the reform of the social sectors was placed
                            the
   on transparency of information. The development of an M&E system was initiated, leading
   to the establishment of specific objectives by districts which were publishedon the web. The
   indicators established to monitor the loan itself were not quantified in the majority of the
   cases. The outcomes were defined in general terms, without clearly specifying the indicator
   or the quantitative goal.
3. PSRL 11. This strategy was modified in the PSRL 11, in which the M&E system of the loan
  was framed within the general strategy of the government, which included medium-term
   impact indicators (such as for example percentage of poor and infant mortality), developed
   with technical assistance from the World Bank. Inthis phase, the government for the first
   time specified indicators and established medium-term goals (for 2006), linking them to
   actions of a social reform program, which was included in the Letter of Policy.            The
   emphasis was thus placed on linking actions to medium-term objectives and to establish the
   corresponding indicators. However, in some cases of innovative indicators, such as the ones
   for transparency and perception of the quality of services, the exact definition of the
   indicators and the baseline were left pending. This effort to establish indicators was also part
   of the National Agreement process, which established a number of goals for the 28 approved
   policies.
4. PSRL 111. Inthe process leading up to the PSRL 111, the government has made an effort to
   review the progress made towards the medium-termindicators. The results of this effort are
   presentedin the table below and in the matrix of triggers presented in the main text of the
   Project Document. These results suggest that there has been progress in many key areas
   supported by the loan. They also suggest the need for a greater methodological precision and
   for more realistic targets in a number of areas noted inthe table.

5. The efforts to monitor and evaluate the key social programs have brought to light the need
     for a major institutional reform: A new system of monitoring and evaluation will be needed
     once the social programs become decentralized. Several programs will be implemented by
     sub-national government, regulated by sectoral ministries and financed by the ministry of
     finance. This new set-up will demand higher levels of accountability and no government
     agency i s currently charged with the task of monitoring and evaluating other agencies or sub-
     national governments. The government i s committed to developing a M&E system for the
     social programs under PSRL IV. The Bank will support these efforts with a TAL.




                                                     95

6. Simultaneously to the advances in the general monitoring of the program, in the PSRL
   111,progress has been made on the impact evaluations of the key social programs. Hence,
   impact evaluations of A Trabajar Urbano and A Trabajar Rural have been made and
   discussed publicly and evaluations of various food programs have also been carried out
   (Vaso de Leche, PANFAR, PACFO and PAN-TBC). These evaluations were done by
   independent professionals or institutions. Similarly, the score card methodology which i s
   based on client satisfaction of services was carried out for 5 social programs. Also, the
   analysis of the ENAHO results and the independent budget analysis are studies which
   shed interesting light on the efficiency and management of the programs and will help
   establishing baselines for monitoring. In parallel, other impact evaluations of programs
   such as Rural Roads and School Breakfasts have been done and published by
   independent research institutes. However, the lessons learned from these evaluations and
   the resulting corrections to the programs remain weak.
7. For the PSRL N,two major advances in this area are proposed. On one hand, the matrix
   of triggers in the main text of the PD establishes revised medium-term development
   goals, in order to maintain the focus on results. Second, emphasis has been placed on
   specifying and quantifying monitoring indicators that can be tracked on a yearly basis.
8. Also, the establishment of an M&E system for the six PSPs incorporating elements o f
   social participation and transparency i s defined as a trigger for the PSRL N. This system
   i s aimed at improving decision-making and accountability and support management
  based on results in a decentralized context. It will be developed progressively interms o f

   task, the government has designated a person to be the technical coordinator of this effort

                           ANNEX 5: Participation and Transparency

Background and Issues

         When the transition government of Paniagua came to power in 2000, years of weakened
democratic institutions, lack of government transparency and increased levels of corruption had
led to undermine the basic accountability mechanisms between the state and citizens in Peru.
The scandal unleashed by the exposure of the corruption network of presidential advisor
Montesinos not only precipitated the fall of the Fujimori government, but also helped position
corruption-a     symptom of faltering accountability-at     the heart of the public debate in Peru.
Hence, the 2002 household survey-which            for the first time included questions aimed at
measuring households' perceptions of corruption of public institutions-shows        that corruption i s
perceived to be the third biggest problem in Peru (34 percent), after unemployment and poverty
(74 percent and 61 percent before lack of credibility of the government (13.2 percent),
delinquency (11percent), andthe poor quality of education (11percent).
         The results of the survey show that corruption directly affects people in their daily lives,
often limiting their access to public institutions and their services, generating a profound sense of
distrust of these. According to the survey, the percentage of households of which at least one
member has been a victim of corruption i s 5 percent. If the 15 percent of those that have not had
any contact with public institutions in the last year are excluded, the figure i s 6.1 percent.
Corruption i s shown to have a significant financial cost, the amount paid by households to
corrupt civil servants representing 0.4 percent of their total expenses and 1.1 percent of their
food expenses. The total amount represents approximately a third of government transfers to
households through anti-poverty social programs. However, while the budgetary coefficient of
corruption varies little according to income, corruption weighs more heavily on the poor.
        The lack of accountability of the state and of public institutions i s also demonstrated by
the fact that access to them i s biased towards urban areas, although poverty-and       thus the need
for public services-tends   to be concentrated in rural areas. Hence, one inevery ten residents in
urban areas did not have any contact with the state, while in rural areas this is the case for one
out of five citizens.
        An analysis of the household survey results attributes the lack of differential access to
public services to a combination of factors, including lack of confidence in these on the part of
the population, corruption and organizational limitations resulting in inefficiencies in service
delivery.
        The survey shows that there are serious accountability failures between citizens and
politicians and policy-makers in Peru. First, the possibility for citizens to exercise their voice
seems to be largely determined by the level of income. Hence, whereas 19 percent of the first
income quintile vote, only 9.5 percent for the lowest quintile exercise their right to vote-or   15.2
percent of the non-poor versus 10.9 percent of the poor. This means that many of the poor are
excluded from influencing public action through elections. Moreover, even for those who vote,
the institutions in which households have less confidence in are precisely those that are intended
to represent and protect them, mediate and watch for their interests, administer justice and create
legislation. Hence, political parties (80.6 percent), the congress (72.5 percent), the police (65.7
percent) and the judicial power (56.7 percent) are the public institutions people least trust. More



                                                  97

people distrust the Ombudsman (49.5 percent) than those who do not (49.1 percent). This
indicates a serious lack of institutionalization of formal mechanisms of accountability in Peru.
Similarly, the police and the judiciary are the institutions that are most subject to corruption, as
measuredby the percentage of households having to pay bribes to them.
        Accountability between service providers and clients i s often also weak. Hence, 5.9
percent of households report having had to pay bribes to municipalities, 3.2 percent to
FONCODES, 1.2 percent to PRONAA and 0.7 percent to water services.
        There i s also a serious issue of inefficiency in public institutions, pointing to failures in
accountability mechanisms along the service-provision chain, which involves ministries, national
service providers, sub-national governments, and front-line local service providers. Hence, as
many as 61 percent and 66.1 percent of households considered that the transaction carried out in
PRONAA or FONCODES was not effectively resolved or implied a significant cost (compared
with 65.4 percent for the police). 18.5 percent of households also considered that the service
provided by municipalities was poor, compared with 33 percent and 41.8 percent for the police
and thejudiciary and 11.9 percent and 10.2 percent for FONCODES and PRONAA respectively.
The low performance of municipalities points to the risk that decentralization-if     not adequately
managed - may weaken even further the accountability mechanisms between policymakers and
service providers at the local level.
        In addition to weak accountability between public institutions, their services and
households, citizens have few channels to adequately voice their concerns and complaints about
these. As shown above, formal mechanisms of representation and accountability are weak and
not perceived as trustworthy. Few resort to recourse mechanisms to voice their concerns, with as
many as nine out of ten households not engaging in procedures to denounce acts of corruption,
often for fear of reprisals.

Solutions

        Following the opening of Peru's political environment in 2000, the transition government
of Paniagua and then the Toledo administration announced a strategy to reverse the previous
regime's pattern of corruption and lack of transparency, implementing a strategy to consolidate
transparent and democratic institutions in Peru andbuildinga state aimed at serving the needs of
the people. Efforts were focused on increasing citizens' voice and increase transparency and
efficiency inthe management of state resources.
        This strategy was seen as central for the PSRL's focus on social sector reform, in which
increasing accountability through mechanisms to enhance the voice and access to information of
clients was seen as key to improving service delivery for the poor.
        Within this context, the PSRL objectives in the area of transparency and participation
translated into i)providing access to reliable and credible information for all citizens and clients
on the protected social programs to effectively increase clients voice over the services, express
their demand and effectively monitor the performance of these ii)providing citizens with the
means to plan, budget and oversee the services provided to them and thereby ensure that their
voice i s heard and reflected accurately in government actions: and iii)providing an institutional
framework and recourse mechanisms for citizens to seek resolution in the case of abuse of public
funds.

        Since the approval of the first PSRL in 2001, the GOP has made significant advances in
providing the legislative framework and institutional environment for enhancing accountability
between policy-makers and citizens, organizational providers and the state, and providers and
clients, laying the basis for enhanced service delivery and effective poverty reduction.

Enhancing accountability between politicians, policy-makers, service providers and
citizensklients

        The WDR 2004 emphasizesthe key role that informationplays inproviding citizens with
informed voice and the basis to assess whether actions of the state have promoted their well-
being. This enables them in turn to identify the limitations and gaps to enhancing the
accountability of politicians, policy-makers.     Information not only provides citizens with the
means to hold governments accountable, but also i s key for the state to be able to adequately
monitor service providers.
        The advances of the GOP in making information more easily available to citizenshsers
since the approval of the first PSRLhave been significant and represent a watershed in Peruvian
history, where a culture of secrecy around government actions, programs and resources used to
persist.   The approval of the Law on Transparency and Access to Information and its
corresponding regulation testifies of the commitment of the GOP to enhance access to
information inPeru by providing a legislative framework for citizens and public officials alike to
access information on government actions at all levels and in all spheres. Another important
achievement i s the creation of the government portal ConsultuAmiguble which provides for the
first time ever inPeru, monthly updated information on government budget and expenditures for
all sectors and programs-including     the priority protected social programs PSPs-on      a publicly
available internet site. The portal provides citizens with the means to asses whether the state i s
abiding by its proclaimed commitments, by verifying the effective transfer of resources in
relation to committed outputs. The experience with Consultu has shown the challenges involved
inproviding reliable andaccurate information for citizens to effectively be able to monitor state
actions, with decentralization adding another layer of complexity.            Indeed, publishing the
information i s only the final step of a process that requires an effective information management
system behindit. It requires that national, regional and local governments have Internet access,
the adequate hardware and software and that they institutionalize the practice of recording their
expenditures through the Financial Management System (SIAF).                 In addition, it requires
modifying the budgeting model, to one based on results, so that expenditures can be tracked
according to outputs and results, and institutionalizing a system of internal monitoring to track
these. The GOP has committed to tackle the latter challenges inPSRL IV.
        Another action that the government has taken to enhance the quality of information has
been to identify mechanisms to strengthen the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics
(INEI) to provide reliable and timely information on government programs. The implementation
of these mechanisms during PSRL IV, will be key to the implementation of a transparent,
participatory and result-orientedMonitoring and Evaluation system (M&E system).
        Particularly in cases where formal mechanisms of accountability such as parliaments and
the auditor general are weak, a monitoring system, which combines horizontal and vertical
accountability mechanisms, i s necessary. One of the ways that civil society in Peru has been
involved in supporting social accountability i s through conducting an independent budget



                                                  99

analysis, with financial support from the World Bank. The analysis looks at stated budget
commitments versus expenditures in the different sectors-with      a particular focus on the social
programs. The analysis has generated discussions in civil society and the media, which has
played a key role in disseminating the results of the study to the public. One of the weakest
elements of the budget analysis i s related to the inherent limitations of the budgeting and
expenditure monitoring process, which does not include results and outputs. In addition, the
enforceability aspect has been weak, as the state has not formally responded to some of the gaps
and inconsistencies identified inthe budget analysis.
         Another mechanism to enhance citizens' voice and enhance their capacity to monitor
state actions and performance are the so-called citizens report cards (Libretus de cuZifcaciones).
These enable clients of services to directly assess the performance of government services,
playing the same role as client surveys in the context of private service delivery. The aim being
to assess public service delivery from the point of view of the users, providing them with voice,
which-if    linked to the appropriate incentives-can    be used to enhance performance in public

on the evolving performance of the programs at the national level - can also be used by citizens
sector delivery. The subsequent and aggregated results of the surveys, which provide indications

to encourage the state to take actions to improve the performance of certain programs, according
to the diagnosis made by the users themselves.           In the case of Peru, letters issued by
corresponding agency directors committing to incorporate the feedback into the performance
management agreements of their service providers, materialize the enforceability mechanism to
reward or punish service providers according to conclusions resulting from the application of the
citizen report cards.
         Another way to enhance the voice of citizens, and to identify patterns of exclusion from
service provision-something     the score cards do not do, as they only evaluate the perceptions of
users-is   to conduct national surveys of perceptions of corruption, level of trust in public
institutions, efficiency of services and access. With initial support from the World Bank in
developing a module with that purpose within the national household survey, the GOP has now
made this a permanent component of the monthly household survey. This will enable the state,
citizens as well as donors and the private sector to assess the evolution of these perceptions over
time.
         Finally, the Peruvian Congress has approved a number of other laws which are aimed at
institutionalizing participatory processes in planning and budgeting at all levels of government
(Participatory Budgeting law, Decentralization law, Regional and Municipal Government law),
making Peru one of the countries with most advanced legislative frameworks for the
institutionalization of citizen participation in public policy processes at national, regional local
levels. This will enable to bridge the representation gap of the electoral system and bring
citizens closer to the policymakers in the identification of demands and formulation of
appropriate actions to design them. The legislative framework establishes the creation of Local
and Regional Coordination Councils, which will have a 35 percent and 40 percent civil society
representation respectively, and which will play a key role in the formulation and monitoring of
regional and local government actions. Within this context, participatory budgeting pilots have
beencarried out innine departments.

Enhancing accountability between serviceproviders and the state
        The state generally provides resources and delegates powers to and responsibility for
collective objectives to service providers. The WDR 2004 conceptual framework views this
relationship in the form of a compact or broad agreement about a long-term relationship, in
which the provider agrees to deliver a service, in return for being rewarded or punished
depending on whether performingor not.
        Inthe case of Peru, this accountability relationship has been weak and risks becoming
even weaker in the context of decentralization, if clear compacts are not established between the
new service providers-regional       and local governments-and   the state. The Transference Law
under preparation would have to tackle this issue, by establishing accreditation systems for
regional and local governments as well as performance management agreements to strengthen
both accountability and enforceability mechanisms between the national and sub-national levels.
Both the accreditation systems and the performance management agreements should include
indicators related to participatory M&E mechanisms, to ensure that citizens and clients' voice i s
heard and taken into account in the formulation of policies and management of services. They
will also include indicators related to transparency and access to information to ensure that
regional and local governments also put in place mechanisms and processes to enhance citizens'
access to information.

Enhancing accountability betweenproviders and citizens-clients

        The WDR 2004 framework suggests strengthening the "short route to accountability"-
that between service providers and clients-in    addition to measures to strengthenthe "long route
to accountability", given that the policymaker cannot specify all actions of providers in the
compact. The effective way to achieve this i s to increase the client's power over providers, by
enhancing their voice to reveal their needs and demands and to monitor the provider's provision
of services.
        For clients to effectively be able to monitor the effectiveness and accountability of
service providers, they must first have access to information about these services, what their
eligibility criteria are, conditions of access and geographical coverage. The Consulta has to date
made an attempt to include this kind of information for three social programs (PRONAA, SIS
and A Trabajar Urbano), but it lacks specific information on services offered and eligibility
criteria by executing unit. This information will be expanded to all protected social programs
during PSRL IV. In addition, the PSRL IV will also seek to enhance the outreach capacity of
regional and local governments to effectively provide information on its programs and activities.
Complementary actions of civil society organizations will have to put an emphasis on improving
the poors' access to information through complementary means to the web, such as for example
community radio and local bulletins, as Internet remains within limited reach for many of Peru's
poor, despite the extended network of public Internet hubs.
        Finally, community score cards represent an important tool to link service providers
directly with clients. B y organizing face-to-face meetings between the two groups, the clients
are able to voice their concerns and the providers listen, respond and incorporate the feedback.

             Civil Society Converging Initiatives
          Peruvian Civil Society has deployed a myriad of converging social accountability
 initiatives at the national, regional and local level. The above-described set of actions linked to
 the PSRL, cannot reach sustainability if they do not count with a strong and independent
 engagement of civil society. The attached table provides detail information of those initiatives
 which converge with and complement the PSRL. They show the way that civil society
 organizations have been able to take advantage of the evolving enabling environment for civic
engagement and prepares itself to face the challenges posed by decentralization and poverty
reduction.

                                  ANNEX 6: Decentralization


Contrary to other Latin American countries, Peru is a relative latecomer to
decentralization. It has been one of the most centralized countries in the region, despite its great
fragmentation into 25 departments, 194 provincial municipalities and 1,864 district
municipalities. Initial decentralization attempts from the 1960s onwards were reversed in the
early 1990s, when regional governments were suspended and non-elected Transitional Regional
Authority Councils were established.

Almost ten years later, an unprecedented decentralization process has started. The Toledo
government arrived to power in July 2001 with an ambitious state reform agenda, with a strong
push for democratization, modernization and decentralization. The decision to decentralize is
mainly politically-driven, with great support and highexpectations of the population.

The Decentralization Framework Law, passed in July 2002, constitutes the legal basis for
decentralization, outlining the government's vision on decentralization. It mainly addresses
(i) assignmentofservicesandcompetencies(shared,exclusive anddelegated)todifferent
   the
levels of government; (ii)fiscal rules and transfer mechanisms; (iii)the sequencing of
decentralization, starting with the transfer of social programs, to be followed by sectoral
transfers, with the exception of the health and education sectors, to be decentralized in the last
stage. According to the law, the process i s to be:
    o Permanent: decentralization is legally binding for all government institutions
    o Dynamic: constant andcontinuous process
    o Irreversible: and aiming at the attainment of long-termgoals for the country
    o Democratic:promoting equality of opportunity andbasedonparticipation
    o Integral: encompassing the whole country, the public and private sector
    o Subsidiary: public services assigned to those levels which are closest to the citizen and
        which assure efficient service-delivery
    o Gradual:the process will take place inprogressive and organized steps

Progress has been made inthe elaboration of the legal framework for decentralization.Key
decentralization laws, such as on regional and municipal governments have been approved,
broadly defining their institutions, roles and resources. Other laws relevant to the
decentralization process, such as the framework law on participatory budgeting, the law of
decentralized investment promotion and important sectoral laws have also been passed, such as
the General Education Law. Major laws still pending are the fiscal decentralization law, the
fiscal transfer law and the accreditation law regarding the certification of subnational
governments to receive resources.

The implementation of the institutional framework for decentralization has also
substantially advanced. At the central level, the National Decentralization Council, with
ministerial rank, has been set up to coordinate and monitor the decentralization process. Line
ministries have established transfer commissions to develop sector decentralization strategies.
After the first regional elections were held in November 2002, regional governments were



                                                 105

created in January 2003, replacing the deconcentrated agencies. They have largely completed
their institutional set-up, including the Regional Presidency, Regional Council and Regional
Coordination Councils, composed of mayors and civil society. The latter, a new consultative
body, has generally also been set up at the local level (both provincial and district), as the
corresponding Local Coordination Council, in additional to the traditional municipal bodies.

Progresshas also been made in the elaboration of the fiscal decentralization framework. A
draft fiscal decentralization law, dealing with fiscal rules, taxes and subnational debt, has been
sent to Congress where it i s expected to be approved shortly.

Most relevant for the PSRL are the new earmarked transfers, the so-called programmatic
transfers for social programs to municipalities. The draft fiscal transfer law suggests the
establishment o f a single fund for poverty-reduction within the Ministry of Women and Social
Development (MIMDES), the so-called Fondo de Superacion de la Pobreza. This fund i s based
on a key government framework, the bases for a strategy to overcome poverty, designed by the
PCM and the CIAS and concretizes a Supreme Decree of April 2,2003, announcing the transfer
of social programs for October 2003. Many of the formerly fragmented social programs have
now been merged into the fund, such as the food programs and social infrastructure programs,
accelerated by the fusion of programs as part of the expenditure rationalization taken during
May's state of emergency. The transfer of these social programs merged into the fund will be
dependent on the fulfillment of minimum conditions, such as management capacity and sectoral
criteria, established by the MIMDES and others, regardingthe verification of mechanisms for the
transfers, established by the CND. Transfers are to be started as the first decentralization package
in October 2003, and specifically for food programs in January 2004. The three types of
programmatic transfers of the fund are:


    0    Social Protection Transfers: These transfers mainly regard food programs and would
         transfer resources from the Vas0 de Leche program and PRONAA
    0   Productive Social Znvestment Transfers: These transfers will be constituted largely from
         resources from FONCODES and PRONAMACHCS, and will also include resources
         from PROVIAS RURAL, Electrificacibn Rural, INFES and INADEprojects
    0    Family Assistance Transfers: These transfers will deal with short-term interventions as
         opposed to the longer-term social protection transfer interventions. They include
         INABIF, CONADIS, and the comedorespopulares.

There is no legal framework yet for the decentralization of educationand health. Contrary
to the social programs that are part of the first decentralization package starting this October,
there is no mention yet inthe fiscal transfer law of the transfers for education and health sectors.
This might be explained by the fact that the education and health sectors are de iure
(Decentralization Framework Law) designed to be the last stages of the decentralization process.

However, de facto the decentralization process for these sectors has already begun. More
than 50 percent of education and more than 44 percent of health expenditure has already been
transferred to the regions which are in large part responsible for the wage bill. They also decide,
in close coordination with the Ministry of Education and Health about the designation of the
regional directors responsible for these sectors and who report to both the relevant ministry and



                                                106

the regional government. For Lima and Callao, large part of the functions for the education
sector have also been decentralized, by virtue of a decree on the state of emergency in the
education sector. In the Education and Health Ministries, so-called Transfer Commissions have
been set up to elaborate a plan for the decentralization of the respective sector. Some preliminary
decentralization strategies both for health and education have already been elaborated. At the
same time, there are growing political pressures from regional governments, and to a lesser
extent, also from municipal governments, to acceleratethe transfer of education and health.
The government, however, has so far seen no need to legislate the decentralization of the health
and education sector this year, referring to these sectors being the last stages of the
decentralization process. Given the unclear functional assignment to different levels of
government, the political pressures and the international experience with the decentralization of
health and educatian which has often resulted in a deterioration of service delivery and fiscal
imbalances, for the PSRL team, a clear legal basis for their decentralization remains
indispensable.

Next steps for PSRLI11and IV:
PSRL 111:The fiscal transfer law was presented to Congress in early September. Regardingthe
PSRL, it will regulate the decentralization of food programs, as described above. A special focus
will be put on targeting, based on a simple, transparent andpro-poor formula. Another focus will
be on results-based approach, that emphasizes management by results and specific sectoral
targets, greater focus on monitoring and evaluation and the use of the accreditation system and
performance management contracts to achieve such targets. Finally, civil society and community
participation will be expanded beyond the participation of the Local Coordination Councils and
include Mesas de Lucha contra la Pobreza and community organizations in the design,
management and monitoring of food programs.

PRSL IV: The legal framework for the decentralization of health and education will be created.
The accreditation law i s expected to be approved in early 2004, setting the fiscal, institutional
and sectoral conditions for decentralizing resources to subnational governments and laying the
basis for a continued reporting, monitoring and evaluation system, including in health and
education.

Programmatic Adjustment Loan on Decentralization and Growth: The PSRL i s complemented
by another loan under preparation to support the COP in decentralization and fiscal
consolidation. This loan, focusing on decentralization, economic growth and competitiveness,
reinforces the PSFU objectives by promoting the fiscal and institutional framework for reform,
including inthe social sectors. Its components are:


     0  Tax policy
     0  Intergovernmental fiscal transfer system, including the decentralization of selected social
        programs, such as the social fund
        Subnational borrowing
     0  Asset management
     0  Accreditation and management capacity
     0  Performance management contracts
        Civil Service



                                                107

         Participation and transparency
         Competitiveness, especially regional competitiveness

Inparticular, its components regardingtax reform, subnational debt and competitivenesswill
provide the overall economic and financial background for the PSRL, helping stimulate growth
and reorient pro-poor expenditure, in line with the PSRL macroeconomic objectives on social
reform. The proposed tax reform aims inter alia at expanding the subnational tax base and
administration while the design of the subnational debt framework promotes a hard budget
constraint and strong supply- and demand-driven limits on subnational borrowing. These
objectives and measures ensure that the macroeconomic risks inherent to decentralization will be
minimized and help generate resources and maintaidincrease spending for social expenditure,
includingthe PSPs.

This includes intergovernmental fiscal transfers, which are particularly relevant to the
transformation of food programs into earmarked transfers, such for PRONAA. Thejoint dialogue
currently carried out by both Bank teams on the fiscal transfer system promotes the fiscal
sustainability of the decentralization process, and sectoral objectives, as how to ensure the
quality of decentralized service-delivery of both social infrastructure projects and food projects,
regarding issues as the functional assignments at the provincial and district level, the flow of
resources, the targeting mechanisms and indices, and co-financing modalities. This
comprehensive approach creates further synergies between the SAL and the PSRL, contributing
to a more effective integration of the decentralization of food programs into the fiscal transfer
system.

The institutional framework for decentralization, particularly regarding the functional
assignment rules, the civil service reform component and the accreditation system will provide
the institutionalbasis for decentralization inthe social sectors.

The civil service component of the SAL focuses on selected civil service reforms at the
subnational level. In aiming at registering subnational civil servants, keeping their number at a
fiscally sustainable level, and improving transparency in the management of the civil service, it
will also reinforce the education and health components of the PSRL in the goals of teacher and
health workers' reform. PSRL objectives, such as a reform of the teachers' career system,
including performance monitoring and incentives will be strengthened by a broader reform of
subnational civil servants as part of the SAL, including the census of teachers and the promotion
of a civil service legal framework introducing greater performance management, transparency,
fiscal responsibility and especially hiring limits and new SIAF modules for civil servants at the
subnational level.

Part of the institutional framework that the SAL supports as well as a contribution to the design
of an effective intergovernmental fiscal transfer system i s the accreditation          process, a
mechanism envisaged by the Decentralization Framework Law to certify subnational
governments before they will be able to receive the transfers corresponding to their assigned
functions. The support of the SAL to an adequate design of the accreditation system which i s
objective, simple, transparent, and convertible in a reporting, monitoring and evaluation system
will help the effective decentralization inthe social sectors of the PSRL, startingwith the transfer



                                                 108

of food programs and to be followed by decentralization of health and education. The fiscal and
management capacity requirements are to be complemented by the sectoral requirements for
transfers that are an integral part of the transfer of food programs in the PSRL, particularly
regarding targeting and performance monitoring of the food programs.

Other institutional components of the SAL are performance management contracts. The
design of performance agreements as an instrument to stimulate fiscal responsibility, improve
management capacity and to provide minimumsectoral standards conducive to maintaining and
enhancing the quality of service-delivery will help assure fiscally sustainable transfers and
minimize the risks for a breakdown of service-delivery. As performance agreements are an
important instrument for the PSRL, especially regarding the decentralization of food programs to
ensure access to and the quality of those services, it will thus benefit from their comprehensive
design, encompassing both fiscal and institutional as well as specific objectives for the social
sectors.

Both the PSRL and the SAL have a participationand transparency component, which are
mutually reinforcing. The SAL' focus on participatory budgeting provides a framework to
promote participation in the formulation and priorization of subnational budgets, extending also
to budget monitoring. It thus supports especially the PSRL social vigilance and transparency
mechanisms, for example through the institutionalization of participatory planning linked with
the participatory budgeting, the website "Consultu Amiguble" and the use of scorecards. The
participatory budgetingwas originally part of the PSRL, but has now been shifted to the SAL as
it goes beyond the social programs. The priority given to participatory budgeting and broader
participation and transparency issues relevant for both credits i s also reflected in the support
given to it by the Technical Assistance Loan (TAL). The TAL was originally designed for the
PSRL,but because of its great relevance to the SAL and the interconnectedness between the two
loans, will now strengthen capacity for common areas and components for both loans, such as
participationand transparency.
