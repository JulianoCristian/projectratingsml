program, whose\n            objectives are to improve the anti-poverty focus of public\n            expenditures, the access by the poor, to quality health, and\n            education services, and, the transparency of social\n            programs, while empowering beneficiaries in the design, and\n            implementation of such programs. Component I will improve\n            public expenditures, through support for the Priority Social\n            Programs (PSPs), targeting several key anti-poverty\n            programs. In addition, legislation shall include\n            decentralization of food aid programs, with measures to\n            improve targeting, and performance-management. Component II,\n            aims at improving the access of the poor to health and\n            education programs, through significant, health care\n            coverage, and pro-poor health reform policy being currently\n            mainstreamed. Progress is being made in developing the\n            education sector's human resources management system.\n            Component 3, will improve the transparency, and social\n            oversight of resources allocation, through the\n            implementation of a user-friendly information system, that\n            allows beneficiaries to monitor budgets, and expenditures\n            for all PSPs, while social participation will be\n            strengthened through an established institutional framework,\n            and the approval of new Transparency Legislation."}, "docdt": "2003-10-14T00:00:00Z"}
