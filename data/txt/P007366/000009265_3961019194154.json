The\n            project objectives were: (a) to support industrial private\n            investment through the provision of term credit for\n            medium-scale and small firms; (b) to improve performance of\n            the financial sectorthrough technical assistance to\n            undertake appraisal and supervision of investment projects,\n            and to strengthen the monitoring functions of the super\n            intendancy of Banks; (c) to carry out industrial\n            sector-specific studies, improving the database and analysis\n            of key issues affecting sector development; and (d) to\n            National Industrial Development Fund\u2019s (FONDEI)\n            institutional capacity. The lending program had limited\n            success as less than one-third of the project funds were\n            actually used for industrial credit and as the effective\n            income transfer to industry reduced the social benefits of\n            the project. However, the use of the remaining funds for\n            balance-of-payments support was socially beneficial.  Some\n            lesson learned from this kind of project, careful attention\n            should be paid to the devaluation risks and the effective on\n            lending rates. The issue of flexible interest or dollar\n            denominated loans should have been resolved prior to the\n            loan agreement. An implementation lesson specific to the\n            project is that the Bank should have insisted on using\n            international procurement procedures for the added Central\n            Bank of Honduras (BCH) computer project."}, "docdt": "1996-02-16T00:00:00Z"}
