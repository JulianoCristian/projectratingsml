Hopes for reconciliation and a renewal\n            of government have not materialized despite the Fomboni\n            Agreement reached in February 2001 to end political turmoil\n            and which outlined the path to reunification and\n            democratization of the country. However, new lines of\n            confrontation emerged as the agreements had left room for\n            interpretation and negotiation on the specific\n            responsibilities and prerogatives of the four governments\n            (the Union and three islands pressing for autonomy). Since\n            July 2002 disagreements over budget issues emerged,\n            particularly with respect to modalities of tax collection\n            and customs administration. Disputes over control of\n            revenues and the security forces, and mutual accusations of\n            coup and assassination plots have charged the atmosphere\n            further, and caused indefinite postponement of legislative\n            elections for the Union and the three islands. The tensions\n            between the Union and the islands are further compounded\n            because Anjouan has been operating much like an independent\n            entity, while Moheli and Grande Comore have never been able\n            to fully exercise their autonomous prerogatives. Comoros is\n            not a war-torn, post-conflict country recovering from heavy\n            loss of human or physical capital. But unconventional\n            business practices have flourished in an institutional\n            vacuum and poor governance, as evidenced by the\n            single-source contracting for the country's telephone\n            code, by Anjouan's \"double privatization\" of\n            its port, and by the lack of competitive practices for oil\n            or rice imports. The setting-up of the Union and of the\n            three independent islands was not properly prepared and\n            to-date there is a significant lack of understanding as to\n            the roles and responsibilities of the different spheres of\n            government. This report points out the barriers to project\n            completion as the islands' preoccupation with autonomy\n            and unwillingness to accept Union oversight in any of their\n            development efforts; the failure of the road fund to\n            preserve investments and release resources; and the\n            criticism of the role of the international expert who\n            managed the project unit. The report suggests focusing\n            development assistance on communities and civil society in\n            situations where a functioning government is absent and\n            mutual distrust exists among political leaders."}, "docdt": "2003-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
