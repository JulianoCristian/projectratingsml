Nonetheless, it is expected that environmental\n            adversity will occur as a result of project implementation,\n            namely due to construction, and rehabilitation works.\n            Mitigating measures are: 1) Establishment of waste disposal\n            sites, and retention schemes to drain water flows, under\n            strict bacteriological quality testing of waters, to protect\n            aquatic marine bio-diversity. Sewers should be covered, to\n            facilitate road functionality. 2) Hydro-biological studies\n            should address watershed management, particularly regarding\n            water supply distribution; and, regarding the construction\n            of water supply systems, protection walls should be built to\n            avoid contamination, in addition to including precautionary\n            clauses in the bidding documents. Engineering design will\n            limit deforestation, and loss of agricultural land. However,\n            potential agricultural losses include compensation, or\n            resettlement to new lands of equal agricultural value,\n            including new seedlings for lost fruits, and vegetables,\n            accompanied by compensation for the length of time those\n            seedlings remain unproductive. 3) Roads, and infrastructure\n            works will require limited working hours, to abate noise and\n            air pollution, including spraying to avoid dust pollution.\n            Safety measures include road signaling, and an awareness\n            campaign to inform the communities."}, "docdt": "1999-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
