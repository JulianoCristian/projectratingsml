The primary program\n            objective is to improve living conditions and stimulate\n            economic growth in the Comoros, while protecting the\n            environment through investments in basic infrastructure.\n            There are three project components. The first, the transport\n            component, assists Comoros with improving its road\n            maintenance, safety, and management through three\n            subcomponents: national and regional roads periodic\n            maintenance, roads safety, and institutional strengthening.\n            Specifically, these subcomponents will rehabilitate\n            earthworks, including pothole repair, local reinforcement,\n            resurfacing, and resealing; maintain and repair road\n            shoulders, drainage works, and roadsides; finance the\n            installation of traffic signals and signs and the\n            stabilization of road embankments; and strengthen the\n            capacity of the executing agency and privatize regional road\n            maintenance centers, and provide technical assistance. The\n            urban water supply component will support the rehabilitation\n            and extension of urban water infrastructure, and support\n            technical assistance to strengthen the management and\n            operation of urban water utilities. The third component\n            funds agency coordination and supports training on\n            environmental management for government staff and others who\n            design, implement, maintain, and operate project activities."}, "docdt": "2001-02-02T00:00:00Z"}
