Therefore, the Second\n            National Highway Sector Project consists of an investment\n            component to be financed under the loan, and of a policy\n            reform and institutional development Action Plan.  The\n            investment component consists of a time-slice of the\n            Ministry of Public Works and Transport's (MOPT)\n            1987-1993 highway program including (i) civil works for\n            rehabilitation of paved and gravel roads, for paving of\n            gravel roads, and for periodic maintenance of paved roads;\n            (ii) supervision of the corresponding road rehabilitation\n            and paving works; and (iii) road safety.  It further entails\n            (iv) road maintenance equipment and spares and a\n            communications system; (v) training programs; and (vi)\n            technical assistance.  Under the Action Plan the project\n            aims to (i) strengthen MOPT's highway management\n            capabilities; (ii) adjust sector policies, and (iii) improve\n            the transport budgetary process at the level of MOPT."}, "docdt": "1987-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
