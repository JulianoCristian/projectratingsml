MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$180.3 MILLION
TO THE
FONDO VIAL NACIONAL
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR THE
SECOND NATIONAL HIGHWAYS SECTOR PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the Fondo Vial Nacional
for US$180.3 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be
repayable over 17 years, including four years of grace, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate and charges.
2.        Background.  The Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MOPT) is
directly in charge of the administration of some 26,000 km of roads
comprising the national highwaylsystem. MOPT is also primarily responsible
for transport policy and for overviewing the activity of the autonomous
public agencies running the ports and railways systems. MOPT's role has been
predominantly concerned with the construction of highway infrastructure,
although, under previous Bank loans, increasing emphasis has been given to
maintenance administrat.on and sector management.  During implementation of
the First Highway Sector Project approved in April 1982, the basis for a
cooperative sector development effort covering policy and institutional
issues has been established. Financing under the project covered studies on
road user charges and trucking regulation and services; actions recommended
by these studies have been initiated but still remain to be fully
implemented. Further integration of sector planning with the budgetary
programing and execution processes is also required for a more effective role
of MOPT in multimodal transport management. With regard to transport
expenditure policies, priority has been assigned to quick-yielding
infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance in support of export oriented
activities. Sector financing is largely ensured through cost recovery
mechanisms, with levels consistent with the stabilization policies of the
overall macroeconomic program.
3.        Project Objectives.  The main objectives pursued under the proposed
project cover: (a) improvement of MOPT's internal efficiency, including
productivity increases in road maintenance; (b) adjustments in the system of
cost-recovery from road users; (c) easing of economic regulations affecting
the trucking industry and trade facilitation measures; (d) improvement of
procedures for the preparation and monitoring of the transport expenditure
program; and (e) upgrading the condition of the national highway network and
reduce overall transport costs. The loan would support the implementation of
MOPT's 1987-1993 investment and maintenance program, designed as an integral
part of an economically balanced sector development plan.
4.        Project Description.  The proposed project includes a policy reform
and institutional development Action Plan and an investment component to be
financed under the loan. The Action Plan builds on and broadens the



- 2 -
achievements of the First Highway Sector Project covering planning, financial
control, road safety, personnel training, and effectiveness of road
maintenance operations. It also includes adjustments in road user charges
for improved cost-recovery, as well as in Government intervention in the road
transport market to increase its operational efficiency. Specifically, the
facilitation of transport services is pursued through actions aimed at
streamlining regulation and documentation,and removing other bottlenecks
which have so far prevented a more efficient flow of goods, particularly
exports. The Action Plan also aims at improving the transport sector
budgetary process through the implementation of programirig and monitoring
systems covering the different subsector agencies. The physical investments
would focus primarily on paving, rehabilitation and maintenance of the
existing road infrastructure, road safety improvements, and road maintenance
equipment and spare parts. The total project cost, which is MOPT's 1987-1993
highway investment and maintenance program, net of administration costs, is
estimated at US$1.6 billion, with a foreign exchange component of US$654
million (40%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, together
with the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processi'Z events and the status of Bank Group operations in Colombia
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report
No. 6646-CO of May 13, 1987 is being distributed separately.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has been a traditional
partner in the development of the transport sector in Colombia. The
extensive knowledge and understanding of Colombia's transport situation built
up in the process place the Bank in a position to assist further
implementation of modern sector management techniques within a policy
framework consistent with current macroeconomic priorities, and articulated
with the ongoing efforts for stabilization and diversification of the
economy. Bank participation is also deemed instrumental to help keep the
focus on improving transport efficiency and better exploring opportunities of
intermodal coordination and trade facilitation.
6.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to undertake several
actions under the policy reform and institutional development Action Plan,
as follows: (a) ensure that all vehicle categories be charged for at least
the associated road routine and periodic maintenance costs (1987-1993);
(b) reduce regulation of the road transport market, in particular through a
reassessment of the role of the National Transport Institute (INTRA)
(July 1989); (c) reformulate the Codes of Commerce and Transport for improved
equity ard insurance eoverage in transport contracts (December 1989), and
review domestic truck assembly and import policy (December 1987);
(d) rationalize controls and remove institutional barriers hampering the
wider use of containers and intermodal transport (December 1987); (e) update
the National Transport Plan taking in due consideration the economic role of
the different modes of transport and funding arrangements, and initiate the
preparation of regular sector operating plans in accordance with the strategy
set up in the Plan (December 1988); (f) develop and implement computerized
systems at the transport sector level for monitoring of the subproject
portfolio, for pluriannual rolling expenditure and funding programs, and
monitoring of the financial and operational performance of the sector
agencies (April 1989); (g) implement corrective measures to rationalize
contract cost escalation clauses, including the revision of the construction
cost adjustment formulas(April 1988); (h) improve accounting and internal



control systems (December 1988); (i) increase the participation of
contracted maintenance and reduce force account maintenance expenditures
accordingly (1987-1993); (j) institutionalize a maintenance unit to foster
more effective and comprehensive road maintenance planning and execution, and
improve labor productivity (December 1988); (k) complete the purchase of
equipment required to ensure a more effective vehicle-weight-control system
(December 1988); (1) contract technical assistance to strengthen engineering
studies and update design norms (December 1987); and (m) ensure adequate
technical cooperation in training with external sources, in the context of a
clearly established training policy (1987-1993).
7.        The Government has also agreed to the following: (a) formalization
of a sector development strategy based upon the agreed policy framework as
guideline for implementation of the transport expenditure program; (b) annual
reviews of MOPT's highway expenditures and funding program, in accordance
with policies and economic criteria satisfactory to the Bank, with provision
of additional counterpart funding for the program in any specific fiscal
year, to offset any shortfall that might have ocurred in the previous year;
(c) submission for Bank review of pre-feasibility studies for any additional
investment on new road construction, which, in any event, shall yield
economic returns of at least 12X; (d) selection of rehabilitation,
maintenance and paving subprojects in accordance with a balanced investment
strategy and, in any case, yielding economic returns of at least 12%; and
(e) continued loan disbursements subject to a satisfactory annual review of
progress under the Action Plan and compliance with the program targets.
8.        Justification.  Quantified economic benefits derive from vehicle
operating costs and time savings from improved road conditions. The
evaluation of the pluriannual road improvement and maintenance program (762
of the total project cost) found a consolidated economic rate of return above
35X. Remaining components of the road program would have an economic return
of at least 12%. Additional benefits are expected from productivity
increases in road maintenance operations, highway management improvements and
greater operational efficiency in the trucking industry.
9.        Risks.  Potential risks are those associated with the timeframe
needed to overcome long established institutional rigidities in MOPT's
operational structure. The agreed upon institutional reform has already been
set in motion during project preparation, and compliance with the policy,
institutional and investment targets, to be assessed annually, would be a
requirement for continued loan disbursements.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Artic! s of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
