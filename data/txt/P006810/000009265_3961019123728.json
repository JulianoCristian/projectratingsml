Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Second National Highways Sector Project\n            in Colombia. The main objective of the project was to assist\n            the Borrower in the execution of its 1987-1993 Highways\n            Program by: (a) financing the execution of technically and\n            economically feasible subprojects; and (b) providing\n            technical assistance. The Bank played a key role in shaping\n            the transport sector policy reforms and continues supporting\n            their implementation through technical assistance. Overall,\n            the project's outcome can be considered as marginally\n            satisfactory. The majority of the sector policy objectives\n            were achieved in a satisfactory manner. Lessons learned\n            included: 1) More attention should be given to defining a\n            set of performance indicators and developing a logical\n            framework under which each project component fits and is\n            clearly linked with the stated objectives. 2) The\n            operational aspects (budgeting procedures, flow of funds and\n            accounting) of a project should also receive more attention\n            during project preparation and be candidly discussed with\n            the various governmental agencies involved before starting\n            project implementation. 3) Incomplete and poor engineering\n            studies were one of the most critical factors that delayed\n            and led to cost increases in the execution of the works\n            financed under this project."}, "docdt": "1995-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
