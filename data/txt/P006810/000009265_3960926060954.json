crucial importance\n            to the Colombian economy as a result of its dominance and of\n            the long distances and difficult terrain separating the main\n            production and consumption centers.  Therefore, the Second\n            National Highway Sector Project consists of an investment\n            component to be financed under the loan, and of a policy\n            reform and institutional development Action Plan.  The\n            investment component consists of a time-slice of the\n            Ministry of Public Works and Transport's (MOPT)\n            1987-1993 highway program including (i) civil works for\n            rehabilitation of paved and gravel roads, for paving of\n            gravel roads, and for periodic maintenance of paved roads;\n            (ii) supervision of the corresponding road rehabilitation\n            and paving works; and (iii) road safety.  It further entails\n            (iv) road maintenance equipment and spares and a\n            communications system; (v) training programs; and (vi)\n            technical assistance.  Under the Action Plan the project\n            aims to (i) strengthen MOPT's highway management\n            capabilities; (ii) adjust sector policies, and (iii) improve\n            the transport budgetary process at the level of MOPT."}, "docdt": "1987-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
