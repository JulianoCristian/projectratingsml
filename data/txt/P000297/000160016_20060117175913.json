Among the\n            lessons learned are these: 1) Continuity is key to long term\n            development impact. 2) Reforming and improving local tax\n            systems takes time and requires a long-term commitment that\n            exceeds the lifetime of a project. 3) Privatizing solid\n            waste management systems should be implemented by clearly\n            defined steps and with continuous support. 4) Customer\n            demand  and tariff structure explain the success of the\n            sanitation program. 5) Community-based approaches were\n            efficient in identifying sound investment programs and\n            securing both capital and maintenance funds. 6) Housing\n            finance is a product in high demand and giving imited\n            support at the institutional level yields substantial\n            results. 7) Linking capacity building to investment programs\n            increases the incentive to improve urban management performance."}, "docdt": "2005-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
