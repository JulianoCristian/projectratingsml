The project\n            provides, disseminates and reinforces instructional\n            materials for preschool aged children. The project promotes\n            early childhood development, sensitizes parents to early\n            childhood needs and care, and enhances caregivers'\n            knowledge and competencies. The project creates an\n            institutional and infrastructural framework for quality\n            educational and developmental television programming and\n            introduces replicable modalities of educational and social\n            program development, along with, monitoring and evaluation.\n            The project supports the establishment of a replicable model\n            to manage the production, distribution, reinforcement and\n            evaluation of instructional materials and social messages.\n            The project provides for financing of: (a) the production\n            and acquisition of videos for instruction and social\n            messaging and printed support materials; (b) the\n            distribution of these materials through network\n            transmission, video-on-wheels and local viewing centers; (c)\n            the production of videos to train caregivers; (d) a\n            dedicated television production facility with studio,\n            production equipment, spare parts and maintenance training;\n            (e) overseas and on-the-job training; (f) production,\n            procurement and monitoring and evaluation consultants; and\n            (g) research, monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1993-02-09T00:00:00Z"}
