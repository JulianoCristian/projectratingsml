Given\n            the country's broadcasting reach, the use of television\n            as a medium to provide distance learning, is questionable,\n            for although it may be appropriate for delivery of\n            pre-school education, the plausible audience liable to be\n            reached in Nigeria, is not only very limited, but those\n            children to be reached are certainly not among the poorest.\n            Furthermore, it is unclear how relevant the strategies of\n            television (TV), and audiovisuals are for the poor, and how\n            these programs could be more widely distributed. The\n            alternative broadcasting solutions proposed by the project\n            are very costly, unsustainable, and not likely to reach a\n            sizeable, targeted population of children over a wide\n            geographic area. The substantial investments in\n            building/equipping the studio, and in training staff, would\n            have been better used in developing a medium- to long-term\n            plan for the use of these facilities, including\n            privatization of the studio. Hence, the project should have\n            examined the cost-effectiveness of the proposed\n            interventions, through an analysis of the economies of scale\n            necessary for the cost-effective use of educational TV in Nigeria."}, "docdt": "2001-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
