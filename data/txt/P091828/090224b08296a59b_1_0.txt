               Comments
               Government decided not to proceed with the use of non-concessional lending to fund the procurement of equipment, and proposed to use
               their own resources. Actual procurement was held up by MoFED pending commitment of line agency to reform.

               Comments
               This study was completed, but not funded by the IBRD loan. The Government preferred to use grant money available from AfD than non-
               concessionary borrowing.
