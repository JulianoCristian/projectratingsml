                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the components of the Infrastructure Project is continuing to progress well. The works are now substantially complete on all three of the road sections that are
                         being rehabilitated within the project, and work has commenced on clearing the site for the upgrading of the B6 road between Belle Rive and Quartier Militaire. In addition, a number
                         of the consultancy studies funded through the project are either close to, or have been, completed.

                         However, the implementation of works and services has not been matched by similar progress in disbursement of the loan. Whilst the entire loan amount has been committed, and a
                         number of significant components have either been completed, or are close to completion, as of October 13, 2011, the project has disbursed just over eight (8.4) percent of the loan.

                         The Bank team estimates that a significant amount (#US$ 12 million) could be disbursed promptly, for completed works and services already paid from budget funds, pending both
                         the submission of a suitable withdrawal application (s), and the Land Acquisition Plan for the B6,in the latter case to meet the disbursement condition in the loan agreement.
