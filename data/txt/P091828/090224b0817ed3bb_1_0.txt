                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the Infrastructure Project is continuing to progress well. The works are now complete on all three of the road sections that are being rehabilitated within the
                         project, and work is continuing on the upgrading of the B6 road between Belle Rive and Quartier Militaire. In addition, the majority of consultancy services that can be funded
                         through the project have been completed.
