                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the Infrastructure Project is continuing in a satisfactory manner. The only activities that remain under implementation in the project are: (i) the works on the B6
                         road between Belle Rive and Quartier Militaire, where certified progress stood at 70 percent at the end of January, 2013, and is scheduled for completion in June 2013, although a
                         request for extension of time to completion is currently being considered by Road Development Agency (RDA); and (ii) the Land Drainage Study, which is just commencing.
