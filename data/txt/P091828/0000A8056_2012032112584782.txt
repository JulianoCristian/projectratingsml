                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation Infrastructure Project is continuing to progress well. The works are now complete on all three of the road sections that are being rehabilitated within the project,
                         and work is continuing on the upgrading of the B6 road between Belle Rive and Quartier Militaire. In addition, the majority of the consultancy services that can be funded through the
                         project have been completed.

                         However, progress in disbursements has not yet matched progress in implementation. Whilst the entire loan amount has been committed, and a number of significant components
                         have either been completed, or are close to completion, as of February 27, 2012, the project has disbursed just over US$ 4 million eight (8.4) percent of the loan. The Bank team
                         estimates that a significant amount (≈US$ 22 million as at December 31, 2011) could be disbursed promptly, for completed works and services already paid from budget funds,
