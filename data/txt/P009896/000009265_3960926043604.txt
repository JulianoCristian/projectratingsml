MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTTVE DIRECTORS ON A
PRDPOSED LOAN TO INDIA FOR THE
WESTERN GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
India for US$295 miliion is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would
be at the standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years,
includ.ng a five-year grace period.  The Government of India (GOI) would
relend the loan to ONGC for 15 years including five years of grace at an
effective interest rate of not less than 15X per annumc. GOI will bear the
foreign exchange and interest rate risks.  The proposed loan would help
finance development of offshore and onshore gas fields in Western India in
close coordination with the development of the corresponding gas markets.
2.       Background.  Despite the significant contribution made by domestic
energy resources (in particular, coal) in commercial energy supplv, India's
economy remains heavily dependent on oil imports.  At the same time, India has
been able to reduce its dep-ndence on imported oil over the past ten years --
trom about oO  Lo less; than 30% -- through a massive shift of resources into
sil exptoratinr and development.  The c,ve.lopment of the Bombay High oilfield,
which accounts for about 70% of India's current domestic oil production, was a
direct result of these investments.  Despite the continued effort to expand
domestic o.l production, in particular through the involvemen.t of foreign oil
c3mpanies, India faces again the possibility of a major increase in its oil
imports.  Th.ree factors account for that.  First, production from the Bombay
High oill;eid has now reached a plateau and is likely to decline in the years
ahead.  Second, :he results of exploration efforts in recent years indicate
rhlat these etfor;s w 11 most likely result in the discovery of only small and
medium-sized fields, whic!a wculd yield mostly gas.  Third, despite a major
effort to conserve energy and tc encourage the substitution of oil products
with other fuels, the consumption of oil products continues to grow in India
above the rate of economic growth. In part, this reflects the expansion of
rhe industrial sector, in particular its growing reliance on captive power
generatiorn, as we-i as the rapid growth of the transport sector, wher. the
apt ions for r  lacing oi.l products are quite Limited,
3.       Io avoid a resurgence of oil imports, the Government is placing an
increased emphasis on the search for new oil and gas reserves in partnership
with internationai oil companies, redoubling its efforts to encourage '.ne
efficient use of energy resources, and relying increasingly on its natural gas
resources Lo meet the demand for some of the liquid petroleum products. It is
estimated that Ind'.a s aburdant reserves of natural gas -- estimated at 700
bilii,n cubic meters (eoquivalent ro 570 million tons of oil) -- could replace
abor:t m          Ar.: qlr   ' r01,e.;m products over the next decade.

Hombay High oiifield as well as free gas from the South Bassein gas fields to

markets in ncrth-western India. At the same time, the Covernment has taken
steps to encourage a rapid absorption of gas into the economy. In 1984 it
established the Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) and entrusted it with
the responsitbility for gas planning, marketing and distribution. More
recently, the Government rationalized the pricing policy for gas, took steps
to diversify the use of gas, and -- with support from the Bank -- undertook a
planning exercise that was aimed at identifying consumers that could shift
from the use of other fuels to gas.
4.       The Government had originally decided that the gas supplies chat will
come on stream as a result of the proposed Western Gas Development Project
should be used as feedstock in the production of fertilizer. Subsequent
discoveries of additional gas supplies in the South Bassein gas field, and a
recognition of the potential demand for gas outside the use in the fertilizer
production, led to the identification of additional gas users. As first
steps. the Government decided to construct three gas-based combined cycle
power plants along the HBJ gas pipeline! it also asked GAIL to carry out a
market study tnat would identify potential gas consumers, in particular large
energy users that could be converted to use of gas; and it is seriously
considering to extend the HBJ gas pipeline to Delhi to capture the potential
market for gas that exists in this area. The main bulk consumers already
committed to gas are thus the fertilizer industry and power plants. For the
fu-.ure, an increasing number of consumers in the power sector, in heavy
ndust.y and in fertilizer production is pianned. All these efforts reflect
the Government's concern to contain che growth of petroleum product imports
ana lo meet the country's energy needs through the accelerated use of natural
In the past, gas has been produced in India jointly with crude oi.
Most of this gas has been sold on a cost-plus basis. With the advent of large
qjuantities of non-associated gas reserves in the Western Region, the
CcGernment needed to modify its gas pricing policy. After extensive
deliberations of various gas pricing options, the Government adopted the
lollowing pricing principles for gas resources to be developed in the Western
tegion: (a) the base price of natural gas would be linked to the price of the
fuel or feedstock replaced; (b) the price structure would be simple to
administer; (c) the operator of the HBi gas pipeline, GAIL, should be able to
earn a fair return on costs. These pricing principles have now been
formalized into a set of gas prices, which are above the current import parity
price of fuel oil, but somewhat lower than the domestic pcice for fuel oil.
The approach adopted by the Government with regard to gas pricing is sound.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The main objectives of the Bank's
astistance to the gas sector are (a) to support the accelerated development of
gas resources, (b) to strengthen the institutions in the oil and gas sector
'hat are involved in the development of natural gas resources and the
marketing of natural gas, and (c) to encourage the expansion of gas use, in
particular through appropriate utilization and gas pricing policies. The
pr-oosed project fits well with the Bank's strategy. First, it provides
.,psrt for the least-cost development of gas fields and associated
infrastructure; second, through the inclusion of gas production and gas
1j.ization studies, it contributes to the Government's efforts to assure that
The development of gas markets keeps pace with gas productiou, thus minimizing
the flaring of gas; these studies will also strengthen GAIL's capabilities to



- 3 -
identify new markets for gas; and, finally, by examining the economic benefits
of a wide range of gas uses, these studies would also contri'bute to the
ongoing diversification of gas utilization.
7.       Project Objectives.  The project is designed to support the
development of proven gas reserves and the appraisal of additional reserves
for future production. The project is also designed to assist in the
expansion of domestic gas markets and to strengthen ONGC's and GAIL's
capabiliti's to draw up coordinated plans for the least-cost development of
gas resources and their optimal utilization.
8.       Project Description.  The proposed project would include (a) the
development of the second phase of the offshore South Bassein gas field and
the construction of associated gas treatment facilities, to increase the
fields production from 10 to 20 million cubic meters of gas per day (MMCMD);
(b) construction of the Heera-Uran gas pipeline, which is designed to bring
associated gas that is currently flared to the Bcmbay area; (c) appraisal and
development of the Gandhar gas condensate field; (d) provision for seismic
surveys of the offshore Hazira and Tapti gas field; and (a) studies of the
coordinated least-cost development of gas resources and their optimal
utilization in the Western Region.
9.      IThe project, which will be carried out over six years, provides funds
for a gas processing facility, pipelines, drilling materials, drilling
equipment, well services, seismic surveys as well as engineering and other
consultancy services. The total cost of the project is estrmated at
US$1,353.9 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$770.3
million (57Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and modalities of procurement, and of disbursements, as
wel.l as the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in India
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps and the Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 6503-IN, datei January l1, 1988, are also attached.
10.      Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following actions:
(a) connection of sufficient gas users to utilize the gas produced under the
project, and submission of reports to the Bank annually on the progress of gas
market development; (b) assurance to review gas prices with the Bank
regularly; (c) completion of studies aimed at coordinating gas production
planning and gas utilization and review of their results with the Bank, by
June 30, 1989; and (d) assurance to maintain ONGC's financial viability
through appropriate adjustments in producer prices of crude oil and gas. In
add'iticn, ONGC has agreed to establish project implementation units for each
of the major project components, and appoint an overall coordinator for this
project.
11.      Benefits.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are expected
from (a) the increased production of natural gas, LPG, NGL and condensate, and
(b) the expansion of the domestic market for gas, all of which will reduce the
demand for imported petroleum products. The economic rate of return for the
integrated South Bassein gas development program is 28%. The economic rates
of return for individual components are 82% for the South Bassein (Phase II),
36% for the Heera-Uran gas pipeline, and 66% for the development of the
Gandhar field. Crude oil price assumptions are taken at $18 per barrel (in
constant terms).

12.      Risks.  Possible risks include reservoir and production uncertainties
that are inherent in oil and gas projects, delays in the development of gas
markets, and a sharp drop in international oil prices. To minimize these
risks, only well established fields have been included for development ir. this
project; ^onservative well productivity assumptions have been used, and
extensive market planning and gas utilization studies were included in order
to give a more precise indication of the growth of the gas market. Finally,
sensitivity analyses have shown that returns on the integrated investment
under this project remain satisfactory even with inter.iational oil prices
dropping to a level as low as US$12 per barrel.
13.      Recommendation.  I am satisried that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
