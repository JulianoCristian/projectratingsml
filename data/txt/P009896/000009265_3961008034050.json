"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Western Gas Development\n            Project for Government of India (GOI) were as follows:\n            outcomes were highly satisfactory, project sustainability\n            was likely, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: there is considerable industrial demand for gas.\n            Prior to the Project GOI focused primarily on the potential\n            use of gas as feedstock for fertilizer and petrochemical\n            production. However, the market development work which the\n            Project promoted encouraged GOI to look to demand from other\n            sectors. As it turned out, there is considerable industrial\n            sector demand for gas, especially in heat processing\n            operations. The use of technical assistance for onsite\n            managerial and operational expertise can be extremely\n            beneficial to project performance. Technical assistance\n            helped Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) improve its\n            performance under the Project, especially in the area of\n            onshore operations which had been neglected for some time.\n            In particular, the assistance resulted in the transfer of\n            technology for sophisticated well-completion techniques and\n            Pressure Maintenance Program (PMP) in the Gandhar field.\n            There is a need for greater dialogue on market-based gas\n            development planning. More commercialization of the gas\n            sector and long-term policy dialogue on pricing outside the\n            context of a specific project are necessary to achieve\n            greater efficiency and sustain some initial progress made in\n            the move to market-based resource allocation. The follow-up\n            Gas Flaring Reduction Project contains some covenants to\n            support this transition. In future projects, the Bank and\n            GOI have to work out clear indicators of progress."}, "docdt": "1995-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
