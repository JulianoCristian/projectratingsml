                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project closing date has been extended to June 25, 2014, to ensure the completion of the ongoing activities. The Implementing Agency (CIAMA) is working on the evaluation of
                         the results of each component. Under the Health Component, the priority is the completion of the rehabilitation of the hospital in Tabatinga and the consolidation of the ASAVIDA
                         consortium. A regional hospital waste management plan is under preparation. Under the Water Supply and Sanitation Component, the works are 100% completed in Atalaia do Norte,
                         97% in Tabatinga and 98% in Benjamin Constant (with the exception of the water treatment plant), and the focus is now on the preparation of the budgets and management plans for
                         those municipalities, to ensure the sustainability of the related investments. The State Government is preparing the final evaluation of project implementation. The priority is to ensure
                         that all ongoing activities can be completed on schedule. The State Government has also committed to allocating additional resources, as needed, to finalize the identified priority
                         actions.
