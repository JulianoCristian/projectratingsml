The\n            extension is necessary to complete ongoing civil works in\n            the Water Supply and Health components in the municipalities\n            of Tabatinga, Benjamin-Constant, and Atalia do Norte, as\n            well as ongoing community-based productive sub-projects in\n            the nine municipalities of the Alto-Solimoes region. As of\n            June 21, 2012, the project has disbursed US$19.27 million of\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)\n            resources, i.e. 79 percent of the loan. All remaining\n            resources are committed, mostly for ongoing civil works in\n            the water supply component. Consequently, the\n            Borrower's action plan to complete the project is to\n            complete the civil works and the community-based\n            sub-projects that are already underway. The Procurement and\n            FM ratings for the Project are satisfactory. The Borrower\n            also intends to request an additional financing to continue\n            project activities and consolidate its achievements. The\n            additional financing is currently being discussed in light\n            of the Bank's current lending envelope for Brazil. This\n            will be the first extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2012-07-11T00:00:00Z"}
