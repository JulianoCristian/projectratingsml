                                 RESTRUCTURING PAPER


1.      The Alto-Solimoes Basic Services and Sustainable Development Project is financed by
an IBRD loan in the amount of US$24.25 million (Adaptable Programmatic Loan, Phase 1, Loan
75130). The APL Phase 1 loan was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on February
26, 2008, and became effective on October 16, 2008. The current closing date is June 30, 2012
(see paragraph 5 below).

2.      The Alto-Solimoes Project is a multi-sector regional development operation including:
Health Services, Water Supply and Sanitation, and Natural Resources Management. The Project
Development Objective is to: (i) raise incomes, (ii) increase access to potable water and basic
sanitation; and (iii) improve health outcomes. The Alto-Solimoes region is located in the far
western part of the State of Amazonas bordering Colombia and Peru. It covers nine
municipalities, and is accessible only by air and river, which creates unusual logistical and
implementation challenges

3.       Implementation progress. Overall implementation and progress towards achievement of
the PDO are satisfactory, although implementation is proceeding slower than initially planned
due to the logistical and implementation challenges faced in the region, currency fluctuations
since approval, the high costs of civil works in remote areas, and delays in mobilizing
counterpart funds. Civil works under the Health and Water Supply components are almost
completed in the municipality of Atalaia and well advanced in Tabatinga and Benjamin. Income-
generating sub-projects are in implementation in all nine municipalities, especially fisheries
management, and involve indigenous communities. The inter-municipal Consortia for Health and
for Water Supply were formally established, laying the foundation for a more efficient
institutional framework for the delivery of health and water services in the region. Communities
and municipal governments fully support the project. Discussions are underway to complement
the project with a potential collaboration on disaster risk management given the increasing
occurrence of floods and droughts along the Amazon.

4.     As of April 24, 2012, the project has disbursed US$17.23 million of IBRD resources, i.e.
71% of the loan. All remaining resources are committed, mostly for ongoing civil works in the
Water Supply component. The Procurement and FM ratings for the Project are Satisfactory.

5.      On September 26, 2011, the State of Amazonas requested additional Bank support for the
continuation of the Alto-Solimoes project, considering that logistical challenges and insufficient
project resources will make it difficult to complete all activities within the planned budget and
timeframe. The Bank responded positively on December 4, 2011. The Client and the Bank
agreed that an additional financing would be the most appropriate way to proceed, given the

                                                2
nature of the proposed activities (same region, same components, attending six undeserved
municipalities). The State’s request for additional financing would be in an amount of US$51
million from IBRD, and the State would use the existing Carta Consulta approved in 2008 (total
US$75 million of which US$24 million from Government).. However a decision now needs to
be made whether this additional support requested by the State of Amazonas can be mobilized
under the current lending envelope for Brazil. Pending this decision, it was agreed in April 2012
that the Client would request an 18-month extension of the Closing Date, from June 30, 2012 to
December 31, 2013. This formal request for extension is expected soon.

6.      Proposed reallocation. The proposed reallocation consists in increasing the amount
allocated to Categories 1 (Works) and 2 (Goods) and reducing Categories 3 (Consultants
Services), 4 (Training), 5 (Incremental Operating Costs) and 10 (Unallocated) as presented in
Table 1 below. The total amount proposed for reallocation is US$6,605,890. The reasons for the
reallocation provided by the Borrower are: (i) exchange rate devaluation; (ii) prioritization of
works over consultants' services; and (iii) planned training activities will be now financed by the
Government.

7.     The proposed reallocation was authorized by the Ministry of Finance, Procuradoria-
Geral da Fazenda Nacional, on March 14, 2012, through Parecer PGFN/COF/416/2012 based
on the request submitted by the State of Amazonas on December 14, 2011 through Oficio
245/2011-GE (attached).
