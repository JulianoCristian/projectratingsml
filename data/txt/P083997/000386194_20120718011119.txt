                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

1.     This Restructuring Paper seeks to introduce a change in the referenced Loan
(7513-BR), namely to extend the Project Closing Date from August 1, 2012 to December
31, 2013; which was authorized by the Guarantor pursuant to the Fax dated June 29, 2012
from the Ministry of Finance, Procuradoria da Fazenda Nacional and the COFIEX
Recommendation of June 13, 2012.

2.      Project Development Objective will not change and all key outcome indicators
will also remain unchanged. Project Design and Scope will not change.


B. PROJECT STATUS

3.     The Alto-Solimoes Basic Services and Sustainable Development Project is
financed by an IBRD loan in the amount of US$24.25 million (Adaptable Programmatic
Loan, Phase 1, Loan 7513-BR). The APL Phase 1 loan was approved by the Board of
Executive Directors on February 26, 2008, and became effective on October 16, 2008.
The current closing date is July 31, 2012.

4.      The Alto-Solimoes Project is a multi-sector regional development operation
including: Health Services, Water Supply and Sanitation, and Natural Resources
Management. The Project Development Objective is to: (i) raise incomes, (ii) increase
access to potable water and basic sanitation; and (iii) improve health outcomes. The Alto-
Solimoes region is located in the far western part of the State of Amazonas bordering
Colombia and Peru. It covers nine municipalities, and is accessible only by air and river,
which creates unusual logistical and implementation challenges

5.      Implementation progress. Overall implementation and progress towards
achievement of the PDO are satisfactory, although implementation is proceeding slower
than initially planned due to the logistical and implementation challenges faced in the
region, currency fluctuations since approval, the high costs of civil works in remote areas,
and delays in mobilizing counterpart funds.

6.      Civil works under the Health and Water Supply components are almost completed
in the municipality of Atalaia and well advanced in Tabatinga and Benjamin. Income-
generating sub-projects are in implementation in all nine municipalities, especially
fisheries management, and involve indigenous communities. The inter-municipal

                                             3
Consortia for Health and for Water Supply were formally established, laying the
foundation for a more efficient institutional framework for the delivery of health and
water services in the region. Communities and municipal governments fully support the
project. Discussions are underway to complement the project with a potential
collaboration on disaster risk management given the increasing occurrence of floods and
droughts along the Amazon.

7.      As of June 21, 2012, the project has disbursed US$19.27 million of IBRD
resources, i.e. 79% of the loan. All remaining resources are committed, mostly for
ongoing civil works in the Water Supply component. The Procurement and FM ratings
for the Project are Satisfactory.


C. PROPOSED CHANGE

8.     The proposed change responds to a request from the Borrower, which was
authorized by the Guarantor pursuant to the Fax dated June 29, 2012 from the Ministry of
Finance, Procuradoria da Fazenda Nacional and the COFIEX Recommendation of June
13, 2012.

9.      The closing date for Brazil Alto-Solimoes Basic Services and Sustainable
Development Project, Loan No 7513-BR, P083997, will be extended from August 1,
2012 to December 31, 2013. Project Design, Scope and Project Development Objective
will not change and all key outcome indicators will also remain unchanged.

10.   This is the second extension and the Borrower has in place an action plan to
complete the Project in a timely manner.

                               Extension of Closing Date

       BRAZIL — ALTO SOLIMOES BASIC SERVICES AND SUSTAINABLE
     DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN SUPPORT OF THE ZONA FRANCA VERDE
                              PROGRAM

                                 LOAN 7513 - P083997


1.     The closing date for the Brazil, Alto Solimoes Basic Services and Sustainable
Development Project, Loan No. 7513, P083997 will be extended from August 1, 2012
until December 31, 2013.

2.      Overall project implementation and progress towards achievement of the PDO are
satisfactory. The project objectives continue to be achievable. Project implementation is
proceeding slower than initially planned due to the logistical and implementation
challenges faced in the region, currency fluctuations since approval, the high costs of
civil works in remote areas, and delays in mobilizing counterpart funds.

3.      Civil works under the Health and Water Supply components are almost completed
in the municipality of Atalaia and well advanced in Tabatinga and Benjamin. Income-
generating sub-projects are in implementation in all nine municipalities, especially
fisheries management, and involve indigenous communities. The inter-municipal
Consortia for Health and for Water Supply were formally established, laying the
foundation for a more efficient institutional framework for the delivery of health and
water services in the region. Communities and municipal governments fully support the
project. Discussions are underway to complement the project with a potential
collaboration on disaster risk management given the increasing occurrence of floods and
droughts along the Amazon.

4.      The proposed extension is necessary to complete ongoing civil works in the Water
Supply and Health components in the municipalities of Tabatinga, Benjamin-Constant,
and Atalia do Norte, as well as ongoing community-based productive sub-projects in the
nine municipalities of the Alto-Solimoes region. As of June 21, 2012, the project has
disbursed US$19.27 million of IBRD resources, i.e. 79% of the loan. All remaining
resources are committed, mostly for ongoing civil works in the Water Supply component.
Consequently, the Borrower’s action plan to complete the project is to complete the civil
works and the community-based sub-projects that are already underway. The
Procurement and FM ratings for the Project are Satisfactory. The Borrower also intends
to request an additional financing to continue project activities and consolidate its
achievements. The additional financing is currently being discussed in light of the Bank’s
current lending envelope for Brazil.

5.     This will be the second extension of the project.
