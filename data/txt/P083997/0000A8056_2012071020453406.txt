                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Health and water civil works are almost completed in Atalaia and are ongoing in Tabatinga and Benjamin. When completed, the water and health activities will benefit an estimated
                         16,000 families in the three urban centers. Thirty-eight income-generating sub-projects and micro-projects are in implementation in all nine municipalities, especially fisheries
                         management and Brazil nuts commercialization; and are benefiting a total of 6,300rural families including indigenous peoples. Communities and municipal governments fully support

                         the project. Overall implementation and progress towards achievement of the PDO are satisfactory, although implementation is proceeding slower than initially planned due to
                         logistical challenges faced in the Alto-Solimoes region, increasing floods and droughts along the Amazon, a long election slowdown in 2010-2011, and delays in mobilizing
                         counterpart funds.

                         A reallocation of loan proceeds among categories was requested by the Client and approved by the Bank in May 2012.
