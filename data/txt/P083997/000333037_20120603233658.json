potable water\n            and basic sanitation; and (iii) improve health outcomes. The\n            Alto-Solimoes region is located in the far western part of\n            the State of Amazonas bordering Colombia and Peru. It covers\n            nine municipalities, and is accessible only by air and\n            river, which creates unusual logistical and implementation\n            challenges. The reallocation consists in increasing the\n            amount allocated to categories one (works) and two (goods)\n            and reducing categories three (consultants services), four\n            (training), five (incremental operating costs) and ten\n            (unallocated). The total amount proposed for reallocation is\n            US$6,605,890.  The reasons for the reallocation provided by\n            the borrower are: (a) exchange rate devaluation; (b)\n            prioritization of works over consultants' services; and\n            (c) planned training activities will be now financed by the Government."}, "docdt": "2012-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
