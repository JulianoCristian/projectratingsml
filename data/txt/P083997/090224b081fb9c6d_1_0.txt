                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Under the Sustainable Natural Resources Component, 19 micro-projects have been completed as well as 7 subprojects, and the Implementing Agency (CIAMA) is working on the
                         evaluation of the results of the component. Under the Health Component, civil works are completed in Atalaia do Norte and Benjamin Constant, and well underway in the other
                         municipalities, with the exception of hospital waste treatment. Under the Water Supply and Sanitation Component, the works are 100% completed in Atalaia do Norte, 91% in
                         Tabatinga and 83% in Benjamin Constant. The current project closing date is December 31, 2013, and the priority is to ensure that all activities can be completed on schedule.

                         Government has requested additional financing from the Bank for a second phase of the project. The appraisal of the proposed Additional Financing (Phase 2 of the PRODERAM) is
                         scheduled for October 2013.
