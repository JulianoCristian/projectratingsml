impact substantial. Key lessons\n            address the importance of linking technical assistance (TA)\n            activities to specific policy reform operations, exemplified\n            by the project's readily available funding, and\n            speediness of Bank technical specialists, not only in\n            helping the Government undertake policy reform issues, but\n            in understanding procurement guidelines, thus allowing major\n            contributions to the preparation of up-coming operations.\n            However, the borrower should outline the role of beneficiary\n            agencies for achieving development objectives, and\n            institutional capacity, since the insufficient attention to\n            functional analysis of the beneficiary agencies in the\n            original project design, hindered greater success.\n            Nonetheless, as demonstrated by their positive results,\n            moderate, targeted consultant assignments deliver more\n            effective, and tangible results, and tend to be procured\n            much faster than large assignments which cover large numbers\n            of subject matters. Close supervision of TA loans is a\n            critical element to the success of the project, which should\n            be conducted by high level professional Bank staff, to\n            involve a meaningful dialogue with the Borrower, and provide\n            advice to the Government. The satisfactory supervision\n            results of the environment sub-component is a good example\n            of such assistance."}, "docdt": "2001-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
