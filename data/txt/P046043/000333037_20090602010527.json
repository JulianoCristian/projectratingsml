Some lessons learned\n            included: extension to neighboring districts and a broader\n            selection of options for investment categories and financial\n            products will have aided a wider reach of beneficiaries and\n            would have promoted diversification of lending. Future\n            diversification will help lenders in developing a more\n            balanced lending portfolio and enable them to develop a\n            wider range of skills in assessing types of risk. For\n            borrowers, access to new financial products and an expanded\n            set of investments would enable them to diversify their\n            businesses, manage risks more efficiently and enter into new\n            profitable activities. There was no need to provide two\n            credit schemes within one project. One overall credit scheme\n            should suffice, but with differing credit guidelines and\n            loan appraisal criteria, depending upon the size of the\n            loan. With a standalone credit line, it is difficult to\n            encourage the participation of local banks. The reducing\n            margin on cotton cultivation brings the risk that farmers\n            may lose interest in cotton production, further decreasing\n            investment in inputs and hence reducing yields. This call\n            for corrective measures, including more significant\n            increases in prices paid to farmers and continued efforts to\n            increase further crop yields through investing in Irrigation\n            and Drainage (I&D) improvements, advisory services,\n            improved fertilization, crop rotation, and crop protection\n            as cotton yields remain low by international standards."}, "docdt": "2009-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
