There are four main project components. The\n            first supports providers of business farm advisory services\n            in the rural sector, so that they can better assist\n            participants in the restructuring process become familiar\n            with policies, laws, regulations, and procedures underlying\n            the restructuring process, as well as business planning\n            activities, agro-technical information (traditional farm\n            extension), and perhaps market information. The second\n            component focuses on rehabilitating irrigation and drainage\n            systems. The investments will be chosen by water users\n            groups to be formed under the project. The third component\n            provides lending for both working capital and investment\n            expenditures by private farms and rural businesses. To be\n            eligible for loans, borrowers must have completed legal\n            procedures concerning privatization and restructuring (in\n            the case of farms) or be private or privatized nonfarm\n            enterprises. The fourth component supports credits to\n            establish well-equipped private agro-service centers for\n            machinery services and supply of agricultural inputs, which\n            would create competition with the existing state-owned\n            enteprises in the machinery services and input markets."}, "docdt": "2001-11-28T00:00:00Z"}
