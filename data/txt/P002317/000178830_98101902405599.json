support system\n            directed at village-level primary health care activities.\n            Nationwide in scope, the project would: (a) strengthen basic\n            health services; (b) support the in-service training needs\n            of health personnel; (c) improve the supply and utilization\n            of basic drugs; (d) develop health education services; and\n            (e) strengthen the capability of the Ministry of Public\n            Health (MOPH) to plan, implement, and evaluate the\n            effectiveness of primary health care activities. The project\n            would yield benefits by providing better health care\n            services in general, and maternal and child health in\n            particular, to a large segment of the rural population.\n            Family planning services, would be extended to health\n            centers in rural areas. The project would also support\n            Government's attempt to promote cost recovery in the\n            health sector by offering the rural population better\n            services in return for their financial participation."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
