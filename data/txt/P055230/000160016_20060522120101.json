Bank and Borrower\n            performances were satisfactory. Lessons cited included the\n            following: 1) A sound institutional framework with adequate\n            procurement mechanisms that ensure the selection of good\n            contractors and consultants is able to overcome an adverse\n            environment and is conducive to obtain reasonable costs for\n            high quality outputs. 2) Substantial social impacts and a\n            more inclusive development approach can be achieved by\n            incorporating strategic elements targeting access for the\n            poor. 3) A resourceful project design is fundamental to\n            manage conflicting issues turning them into positive\n            outcomes. Well-conceived and implemented Resettlement Action\n            Plan (RAP), Community Relations Program (CRP), and\n            Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) are effective\n            means for enhancing community participation and ensuring\n            that the project's interventions reach the most\n            vulnerable. 4) Contracting out the implementation of the\n            IPDP and CRP to independent and specialized consulting\n            firms, as opposed to including them as an additional item in\n            the civil works contract, is a good practice. 5) Introducing\n            new maintenance contract schemes requires a gradual\n            implementation approach according to the level of maturity\n            of the road sector, based on an assessment of the\n            willingness and flexibility to adjust to a new setting. 6)\n            Strong and continued political support is fundamental to\n            ensure substantial and sustained institutional development\n            in the road sector."}, "docdt": "2006-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
