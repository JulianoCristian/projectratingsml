    corridor linking the Bolivian departments of Beni, Santa,\n            Cruz, Chuquisaca, and Tarija and continuing to Argentina and\n            Paraguay. By rehabilitating and improving the Abapo-Camiri\n            Highway, the project seeks to lower transport costs, foster\n            the economic development of the project area, improve the\n            income level of the indigenous peoples in the area, and\n            establish economic transport links between the\n            Borrower's territories and neighboring countries. There\n            are four project components. 1) Abapo-Camiri Highway\n            component will finance 80 percent of the civil works and\n            supervision of the reconstruction and paving of the highway.\n            2) Access road to El Espino component will finance 80\n            percent of the civil works and supervision of the\n            reconstruction and paving of an existing dirt road that runs\n            parallel to the rail track to Charagua. 3) Comprehensive\n            maintenance by contract will finance 20 percent of the civil\n            works and 80 percent of the supervision of a comprehensive\n            maintenance program covering about 900 km of the basic\n            highway network of the Departamento de Santa Cruz. 4)\n            Institutional strengthening will provide technical\n            assistance for consulting services, procurement, and\n            implementation of resettlement plan."}, "docdt": "1999-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
