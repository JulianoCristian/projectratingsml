Some\n            negative environmental impacts and their mitigations include\n            the following: During construction, decibel levels will be\n            reduced in the population centers most sensitive to noise;\n            the hours of operation restricted; greenbelts erected; and\n            car velocity and horn-blowing limited. To reduce dust and\n            emissions caused by vehicles and machinery, the roads will\n            be sprayed, oil and other pollutants will not be burned, and\n            insulation will be hung in dwellings. Equipment and\n            machinery will be operated to comply with air quality and\n            noise level standards, including covering transport trucks.\n            Solid waste disposal and basic sanitation measures will\n            prevent soil contamination. To prevent landslides resulting\n            from deforestation and vegetation removal, barricades will\n            be erected. Mulching, bundling wood and revegetation will\n            avoid erosion and minimize sedimentation. A drainage system\n            and protection works will shore up embankments. Compacted\n            topsoil will have its natural permeability restored.\n            Drainage systems will be dug along river banks only after\n            hydraulic analysis. Only minimal quantities of explosives\n            will be used at quarries. To protect area fauna, hunting and\n            fishing will be prohibited."}, "docdt": "1999-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
