Financing Project\n            of Mexico had the following ratings: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned included: 1) The project\n            yields a significant number of lessons learned for future\n            higher education projects involving student loans. The high\n            number of lessons learned is not a result of unsatisfactory\n            design or implementation, but rather a result of two\n            factors: (i) the project design was innovative and\n            experimental; and (ii) implementation has been dynamic and\n            guided by substantial monitoring and evaluation efforts; 2)\n            Overall, this experience confirms the technical and\n            political difficulties of setting up a successful student\n            loan system; 3) Design of responsibilities and incentives\n            are crucial for student loans given its long-term nature; 4)\n            Risk and cost sharing with universities is crucial; 5)\n            Continued public investment in student loans is required; 6)\n            A public-private partnership in student loans is desirable\n            but difficult when financial risks are uncertain; 7)\n            Although student loan is a higher education policy\n            instrument, it is also a financial instrument, and\n            experience from the commercial banking sector is necessary;\n            8) Long term sustainability of the interest rate is\n            important; 9) Long-term financing of student loans is\n            required; 10) Attention to collection cannot be\n            overestimated. Student loan systems in developing countries\n            often fail to grow because of a large implicit subsidy,\n            which in many cases is exaggerated and untargeted due to\n            high defaults; 11) Fear of borrowing is a problem; and 12)\n            Ensure the financial conditions of the assets and\n            liabilities match."}, "docdt": "2007-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
