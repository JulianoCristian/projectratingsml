F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
To assist the Government in promoting greater equity and quality in the preparation of
university graduates.

  Specific goals are to:
  - improve access to higher education, particularly for academically qualified but
financially needy students.


                                              ii

  - develop more effective and financially sustainable student loan institutions.

  To achieve these objectives, the project will support (1) the development of a private
student loan agency (SOFES) and (2) the strengthening of the Sonora Student Loan
Institute.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design


1.1 Context at Appraisal
While Mexico's education system began to receive special attention from its Government during
the 1990s (including higher spending, decentralization and targeted programs for the poor, most
of the concerns were focused on primary and secondary education, and higher education
continued to lag.     Access to primary education was closing in on universality, secondary
enrollment was on the rise, and per capita educational expenditure has been expanded. However,
enrollment in higher education in Mexico continued to be low relative to its income level. In 1998,
the gross enrollment rate in higher education in Mexico was 21 percent as compared to an
average enrollment rate of 31 percent for a country with an income level similar to that of Mexico.
Without a highly skilled labor force, Mexico was finding it difficult to shift its development path
into a more knowledge-based, high productivity economy.

The Mexican higher education system faced four main issues: (i) low participation rates that
were insufficient to meet the country's growing needs for qualified manpower. The higher
education gap was costing the country roughly MX$6.5 billion or more per year in foregone
income, equivalent to 1 percent of GDP; (ii) a scarcity of economic resources, particularly after
the financial crisis of 1994. Public institutions of higher education were highly dependent on
public funds and vulnerable to fiscal restrictions following the 1994 crisis; (iii) deficiencies in the
quality and relevance of higher education, with only a small few offering high quality programs.
For the period 1990 to 1994, only 49 percent of students graduated; and (iv) equity problems,
particularly in light of the growing role of private universities (from 21 percent to 26 percent of
enrollment in the years 1993 to 1996, alone) in meeting the demand for higher education, and the
limited number of grants, scholarships and student loans. In 1998, private universities reported
that 25 percent of the dropouts (of a 45 percent total dropout rate) were attributable to economic
factors.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The broad development objective is to assist the Government in promoting greater equity and
quality in higher education.

The specific objectives are to:

a) Improve access to higher education, particularly for academically qualified but financially
   needy students; and
b) Develop more effective and financially sustainable student loan institutions.

To achieve these objectives, the project supported: (1) the development of a private student loan
agency (Society for the Promotion of Higher Education--SOFES); and (2) strengthening of the
public-sector Sonora Student Loan Institute (ICEES).


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
Neither the Project Development Objectives nor Key Indicators were revised, with the exception
of the coverage target for component B (ICEES) that was reduced from the initial 21,000 students
to 14,000 students in 1999.



                                                 1

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The main beneficiaries were academically qualified but financially needy students enrolled in
higher education institutions. The project benefited 38,695 students (99 percent of target at start
of implementation) of whom 45 percent came from low-income families as measured by the
project's targeting mechanism (93 percent of target at start of implementation). Further, the
project benefited two student loan organizations, SOFES and ICEES, and indirectly benefited
higher education institutions, whose students' education was financed by the project.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The project consisted of two project components divided into several sub-components:

Project Component A ­ Development of the private sector student loan system (US$237.1
million):

Student loans (US$218.6 million). This sub-component supported: (a) sub-loans to students; and
(b) the creation of a reserve fund.

Institutional development (US$18.4 million). This sub-component supported the: (a) training of
staff members, particularly to develop financial, accounting and collection skills; (b) carrying out
of studies to improve management capacity; and (c) acquisition of equipment, including office
furniture and technology.

Project Component B ­ Strengthening of the Sonora student loan system (US$50.8 million):

Student loans (US$ 48.3 million). This sub-component supported the (a) sub-loans to students;
and (b) the creation of a reserve fund.

Institutional development (US$2.5 million). This sub-component supported the: (a) training of
staff members, particularly to develop financial, accounting and collection skills; (b) carrying out
studies to improve management capacity; and (c) acquisition of equipment, including office
furniture and technology.

1.6 Revised Components
None of the components were revised.

1.7 Other significant changes
Prior to implementation of the project, the targeted number of beneficiaries of component B
(ICEES) was adjusted from 21,000 students estimated at appraisal to 14,000 students. At the
onset of the project, but after board approval, ICEES considered that -- despite being capable of
servicing 21,000 students -- it judged as more important concentrating its resources on improving
technical and financial aspects. Performance in this ICR is measured against the original target of
21,000 students.

The loan was extended twice to allow for Component B to be finalized by December 31,
2005 and Component A to be completed by December 31, 2006 (an extension of 34
months from the original closing date). The extensions were justified by: (i) a one year
delay in effectiveness; (ii) overestimation in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) of
the desirable rate of student loan expansion, and (iii) need of time for SOFES to create a
financial track record and thereby increase financial sustainability. Later sections further
discuss these issues.2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes




                                                 2

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The overall quality at entry was satisfactory. The project preparation and design took into
account all relevant experiences in the region, the lessons from past and on-going Bank-funded
student loan programs, and international best practices. In particular, preparations and design
focused on the key weaknesses of student loans in developing countries: low financial
sustainability due to high default rates and inefficient administration (Ziderman and Albrecht,
1991). The PAD correctly identified these as the key challenges, and the design incorporated
several effective mitigating actions. The Project Development Objective (PDO) was clear and
concise (greater equity and quality in the preparation of university graduates). The specific goals
in the PDO (improve access to higher education, particularly for academically qualified and
needy students, and develop more effective and financially sustainable student loan institutions)
were clear, concise and attainable within the implementation period of the project. Further, the
key indicators reflected well the specific goals of the PDO.

All overall project ratings in this report are based on a weighted average of the rating of the two
components with the weight of each component equal to its share of loan proceeds. That is 83
percent (US$150.2 million out of US$180.2 million) for Component A (SOFES) and 17 percent
(US$30 million out of US$180.2 million) for Component B (ICEES).

Component A. The quality at entry of Component A (SOFES) was satisfactory. The design of the
new student loan organization, SOFES, incorporated several important innovations in student
loan systems in the developing world. Notably, the universities were asked to jointly administer
the loan program through a shareholder company, similar to the best practice in the US. Further,
the institutions were financially fully responsible for default of students from their institution, and
shouldered an important part of operational costs. This design gave the university a strong
financial incentive to prudently lend and constantly monitor performance of SOFES. Further,
SOFES was established as a financial intermediary and was subject to regular financial
supervision from the national financial supervisory entity (Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de
Valores). These two design aspects were crucial and innovative features, which to a large extent
led to the good performance of SOFES and mitigated the risk of low financial sustainability. An
important but perhaps necessary challenge of this design was that universities acted as mini-
commercial banks, an unusual step that is not normally within the core competences of an
education institution. Hence, some universities performed this role better than others. This
reduced the economies of scale in loan collections and the professionalization of the collection
process, as discussed in Section 6 (lessons learned).

Component B. The quality at entry was moderately satisfactory. This component supported an
existing public sector student loan system. Relying on an existing institution to deliver the loans
to students allowed for a timely implementation of the component. As it was known at the time of
preparation, such systems tend to suffer from administrative inefficiencies and lack of emphasis
on the financial aspects of the student loan, including student loan collections. These weaknesses
often lead to high implicit subsidies preventing the system from gaining support to scale-up its
operation. To counter this risk, the component included institutional strengthening focused on
revised financial loan conditions ensuring non-zero real interest rates, new loan collection
strategies, better targeting of low- and middle-income students, technological upgrading, and
technical assistance to improve financial and accounting practices. Further, the component
requested a commitment from the government of the State of Sonora to maintain funding in real
terms to ICEES throughout project implementation at the level of 1997. Compared to Component
A, this continued public investment contributed to the institution's financial sustainability.




                                                  3

The overall project design ­ Components A and B ­ had an experimental aspect in the sense that
it supported two different kinds of loan systems within a single national setting. This allowed the
Bank and the government to draw lessons that could be transferred to other projects nationally
and internationally. In particular, the project design and subsequent lessons were highly
instrumental in positioning the Bank as a knowledge institution in the area of student loans.

2.2 Implementation

There was a one year delay in effectiveness. This delay was due to a change in financial
arrangements between the Borrower (BANOBRAS), the Guarantor (Secretariat of Finance and
Public Credit--SHCP), and implementing agencies (SOFES and ICEES).

Disbursement to SOFES was practically stalled in the first six months of 2005. The Guarantor
requested the shareholder universities of SOFES to strengthen their financial commitment to
SOFES, which they were reluctant to do. Disbursements resumed in August 2005 following an
agreement where the universities increased their own capital in SOFES by US$4.3 million (72
percent), strengthened the enforceability of the guarantee of the universities to buy back non-
performing loans from SOFES, and the government requested to the Bank an extension of the
loan closing date to December 31, 2006. The stall in disbursements did not affect students.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The monitoring and evaluation framework was well designed, implemented and actively utilized
in supervision.

The M&E framework was carefully and appropriately designed. All indicators were relevant.
There were 36 key performance indicators that accurately measured inputs, outputs and impacts.
Further, two-thirds of the indicators had baseline values and targets.

During the implementation, there was a strong focus on using the key indicator framework to
measure progress and outcomes. The implementing agencies reported quarterly on the 10
primary key performance indicators reflecting key project outcomes. All supervision reports by
the implementing agencies and all supervision Aide Memoirs included monitoring of these
indicators. As a consequence of the project, ICEES was the first state agency to use performance
indicators in the State of Sonora.

A rigorous impact evaluation, several tracer studies, and user surveys were undertaken to
measure the impact of the project on project objectives. In particular, the evaluation study
examined the impact of student loans on learning outcomes, time needed to awarding of degrees,
drop out, and equity in higher education. This was the first rigorous study on the impact of
student loans for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region (results are reported in Section
3.2). Further, both ICEES and SOFES carried out user surveys among beneficiaries (results are
reported in Section 5).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

On financial management (FM), SOFES and ICEES maintained FM arrangements satisfactory to
the Bank. Annual financial audits were carried out in line with Bank's policy (under Terms of
Reference (TOR) and by auditors acceptable to the Bank). During the review of audits and during
supervision missions neither the auditors nor the Bank identified any major issues that affected



                                                 4

FM performance. Moreover, all audit findings were properly addressed, and all Bank
recommendations were implemented by SOFES and ICEES. Also, BANOBRAS as the financial
agent and lender carried out all its FM-related responsibilities ensuring, for example, the proper
management of the Special Account. An in-depth review of SOFES' financial management
system was carried out in 2004 following doubts of the reliability of the agency's financial data.
The Bank led this review with SOFES' auditors. The review concluded that the system was
acceptable, but it suffered from shortcomings. A new IT-platform was purchased and
implemented in 2006 and 2007.

On procurement, SOFES and ICEES complied with the Bank's procurement guidelines. The Bank
authorized retroactive financing on an exceptional basis for a single source contract with a
consulting firm after verifying that the contract followed procedures that were acceptable to the
Bank.

No Safeguard issues were triggered for the project during preparation and no safeguard issues
emerged during implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The main challenge facing both institutions is to maintain -- or scale-up -- support to financially
needy students. To continue operations, several transition arrangements were undertaken.

The continuation of SOFES is promising -- but difficult. As explained further in Section 4 on risk
to development outcomes, SOFES requires access to new resources in order to continue lending
to students. Substantial efforts have been made by all project partners (SOFES, member
universities, federal government, BANOBRAS and the Bank) since 2002, for finding additional
funding to continue lending. In summary, the following avenues of new funding are being
explored: investment from private national and international investors; credit lines from
commercial banks and national development banks; funding from universities; and federal
government support, among others. The Federal Government's strategy in order to attend SOFES
financial sustainability for the medium and long term is being discussed while the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) and SOFES are exploring investment options1. However, it is unclear
whether current lending terms can be maintained.

ICEES' transition to other sources of funding was facilitated by the support it received from the
government of the State of Sonora. In particular, the state government doubled its yearly
investment in ICEES. This allowed ICEES to continue lending and service the loan repayments to
BANOBRAS and the Bank. Nevertheless, the number of students financed was reduced from
12,889 in 2004 to 11,665 in 2005. This was a result of focusing more on improving repayment
rates and insufficient funds.

The project was instrumental in positioning the World Bank as the key knowledge and financial
institution for higher education student assistance in Mexico. The Mexican government and the




1As an alternative to continuation of SOFES loans, SOFES has negotiated an agreement with a private
bank. The private bank will, through its normal banking system, offer loans to students currently financed
by SOFES. However, the interest rate would increase and the private bank will screen students. Therefore,
a share of the financed students from lower- and middle-income backgrounds is expected not to be eligible
or not to be able to afford the commercial bank loan due to its excessive cost.


                                                     5

Bank agreed on a follow-up project approved in December 2005 (World Bank, 2005a). The
design of the new project built extensively on the experience accrued in the ongoing project and
other projects in the LAC region. Lastly, the project design of the Colombia Higher Education ­
Improving Access project approved in December 2002 (World Bank, 2002c) benefited from the
early lessons learned in this project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The development objectives and design of the project were highly relevant at the country and
global levels, and they were fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and
Bank's sector strategy.

At the country level, the objectives were highly relevant because of their focus on increasing the
pool of higher education graduates, and improving equity in higher education. Enrollment in
higher education in Mexico was 10 percentage points below the expected for a country of
Mexico's income. Several Bank reports have shown that expansion of higher education in Mexico
was -- and still is -- a critical factor to spur economic growth and competitiveness. Further, the
project aimed to improve equity in access to higher education to promote a more equal Mexican
society. Given the high inequality prevailing in Mexico and the role that access of higher
education plays in fostering upward social mobility, the objective was highly relevant. The design
of the project accurately emphasized the need to provide alternative instruments to finance higher
education in Mexico that would enable financing of more education for talented students from
low- and middle-income families. Sufficient public investment to meet rising demand for higher
education was -- and is -- untenable due to insufficient available funds, and the regressive nature
of un-targeting institutional support to higher education (as opposed to targeted funding to
students from poor families).

The objectives were consistent with the 1995 and 1999 Bank's CASs of supporting
macroeconomic stabilization and social development that prevailed at the beginning of the project.
The relevance of the objectives increased even more when the Bank's country priorities changed
to reducing poverty and inequality and increasing competitiveness by focusing on human capital
development as stated in the World Bank's 2002 CAS and the Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) of March 2004.

The project's choice of instrument, student loans, followed the Bank's strategic documents for
higher education (World Bank 1994, and 2002d, and Salmi, 2000). These strategy documents
focused on increasing access for low-and middle-income students and preferably through
financially sustainable investments, such as student loans.

Project timing was opportune. The project was carried out at the same time that the country
increasingly integrated into the global economy, thereby raising the demand for highly skilled
workers on the labor market. The private rates of return to higher education increased from an
already high of 15.7 percent in 1998 to 18 percent in 2000 and 16 percent in 2002 (see Annex 3).
Consequently, it continued to pay off to invest in higher education in terms of the individual
(private) rates of return to education. These high returns increased demand for higher education,
which the project was partly able to accommodate without significant recourse to public funds
(estimation of fiscal impact in the following section and in Annex 3). Equally importantly, the
project supported institutional capacity for further expansion of student loans.




                                                   6

Project objectives were consistent with the federal government's strategy for higher education.
Through the SHCP, the federal government provided indirect support for student loans as a policy
instrument to increase access to higher education for low- and middle-income families, and to
raise investment into higher education. SHCP also indirectly subsidized the interest rate on
students by bearing the exchange rate risk and the financial fees attached to the loan. However,
SEP did not directly support student loans at the time of appraisal.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Overall the project performed satisfactorily in achieving its development objectives considering
that all its major objectives and development results were substantially achieved.

SOFES reached its goals in a highly satisfactorily manner, while ICEES only moderately
satisfactorily reached its targets. Further, the project has substantially strengthened institutional
capacity in Mexico for the expansion of student loans.

Chain of results from output to impact at the national level. This section investigates in part A if
the targets for each of the project's two components' outputs were reached. The project's output
were loans to financially needy students and student loan systems that were more effective and
financially more sustainable. Second, this section reviews in part B the causal link between
outputs and outcome. The project's outcome was a contribution to expansion of higher education
with improved equity. This would lead to a greater pool of graduates of quality higher education.
Third, the report presents in part C how the project affected the objectives, equity and enrollment
into higher education at the national level.

A. Output by component
The overall performance of component A, SOFES, (83 percent of project expenditures) is
considered Satisfactory, because of the increased access to higher education for 27,000 students
(105 percent of goal) and a strong institutional development of SOFES.

Goal (a) Improve access to higher education, particularly for academically qualified but
financially needy students (Achieved): SOFES provided access to higher education to 27,000
students above the targeted 25,000 students (105 percent). Of the students financed, 98 percent
were from low- and middle-income families (see Figures 1 and 2).

Goal (b) Develop more effective and financially sustainable student loan institutions (Achieved):
During the project, SOFES improved substantially its performance. SOFES is yet to experience
its first unfunded default. This is by design, since the institution sells non-performing loans back
to its member universities. Hence, SOFES met its default target of 3 percent. The temporary
default rate, a share of the portfolio being more than 180 days in arrear, improved from a baseline
of 40 percent in 1998 to 7 percent in 2006, although still falling short of meeting the target of 3
percent (Figure 3). SOFES has lower default rates than other Mexican and Latin American
student loan systems. Regarding the efficiency of administration costs, SOFES exceeded the
ambitious target: Administrative costs amounted in 2006 to 1 percent of the value of the portfolio,
and target was 2 percent (Figure 4). On an international scale, SOFES performance is
noteworthy.2



2 SOFES is the most effective large scale student loan system in Mexico and Latin America in terms of
both default and efficiency for which data is available, (Ruiz Devesa and Blom, 2007). It outperforms loan
systems in the States of Sonora (4.4 percent) and ICEET in Tamaulipas (7.9 percent), in Mexico, as well as

By reaching the component's quantitative goals, the project created in SOFES a platform for
future expansion of student loans in Mexico, and one of the best student loan agencies in the
developing world. SOFES has:
                                                           developed good record keeping, collection instruments, and reliable systems, that
                                                           function relatively well. This is a significant asset, since it is the only large delivery
                                                           system of student loans in Mexico that has proven to be able to handle all stages of a
                                                           student loan;
                                                           achieved a good track record, which will enable SOFES to further improve its financial
                                                           sustainability in the future;
                                                           gained political support among participating universities to work together, and this was
                                                           the path followed by a major US student loan provider to achieve economies of scale;
                                                           been flexible to absorb more universities; and
                                                           achieved product identification -- people know what it is.




ICETEX in Colombia (2.1 per cent) and the Peruvian student loan institution, INABEC (12 percent). In a
national and international perspective, the targets for SOFES were highly ambitious.


                                                                                                        8

The overall performance of component B (17 percent of project expenditures) is considered
Moderately Satisfactory because it met expectations in terms of improving access, but fell short
on institutional targets.

Goal a) Improve access to higher education, particularly for academically qualified but
financially needy students (Partially Achieved): Component B (ICEES) financed 12,889 students,
vis-à-vis the 21,000 established in the PAD3 .However, 75 percent of beneficiaries from ICEES
student loans were students from low-income families. This represents a 99.6 percent
achievement of the target of 75.3 percent (Figures 5 and 6).

Goal b) Develop more effective and financially sustainable student loan institutions (Not
Achieved): The financial sustainability of ICEES improved slightly overall. The implicit subsidy
of the agency's loan system decreased marginally from 28.9 percent in 1997 to 25 percent in
2005. The target was 20 percent. The improving factor was ICEES' willingness to establish and
maintain a positive real interest (average of 2.9 percent from 1998 to 2005).

Despite investments in technology and other initiatives, ICEES was not able to reduce
operational costs, nor was it able to lower the default rate to the targets. For administrative
efficiency, the PAD established that administrative costs should be 1.3 percent of the value of the
loan portfolio or lower. At the end of the execution of the component in 2005, administration
costs amounted to 4.4 percent of the portfolio (4.37 percent in 1998). The default rate -- defined
as the share of the portfolio in more than three years of arrear -- was 17 percent, while the target
was 12 percent (Figure 7 and 8). Despite having identified the believed cause of default --
impunity of non-payment -- ICEES and its board did not favor taking stronger actions to address
the impunity (See Section 6 on lessons learned), also because the institute's juridical form did not
allow the use of such instruments as the credit bureau.




3However, it is important to bear in mind that the goal was changed to 14,000 at effectiveness, and that
was the benchmark used by the implementing agency during the life of the project.

B. From output to outcomes
The project reached a high number of its output targets. These outputs impacted project outcomes
-- availability of student loans, increased enrollment, equity and quality of higher education -- in
the following ways:

The project succeeded in raising the availability of student loans in Mexico. The project financed
a substantial expansion of student loans in Mexico. In 1998, there were 8,000 students who
received student loans. At the close of the project in 2006, an estimated 47,600 students benefited
from student loans, of which 38,600 (83 percent) were financed by the institutions supported by
the project. Hence, the project directly increased availability of publicly supported student loans
fourfold.4

Impact of loans on enrolment. A rigorous evaluation study undertaken to assess the impact of
SOFES found that students who received some kind of financial support (loan or grants) have a
24 percent higher probability of enrollment in a university program.5 This finding is corroborated



4This estimation excluded loans offered by non-governmental universities because there is no statistical
information available.
5These results stems from a regression of all relevant observable factors in the Mexican household survey,
ENIGH 2000, on higher education enrollment. The result should be interpreted with caution since the study
cannot control for unobservable variables, principally academic aptitudes, and type of financial aid,
(Canton and Blom, 2004)


                                                                                                10

by a survey of SOFES beneficiaries in which 29 percent of beneficiaries responded that without
the student loan they would not have been able to matriculate.

Impact of loans on retention. In the survey of SOFES beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries,
beneficiaries repeated less than non-beneficiaries (5 percent compared to 4.3 percent). However,
controlling for other factors, the difference is statistically insignificant.6

Impact of loans on equity. Seventy-five percent of ICEES beneficiaries came from a family
classified as low-income as compared to only 63 percent for the total student population. Hence,
ICEES equally facilitated to a large extent access for low students. Twenty percent of students
came from the low-income families category, whereas more than 33 percent of loan beneficiaries
were from low-income families. Consequently, ICEES was more successful in benefiting the
neediest students compared to SOFES. Nevertheless, a survey of 1,800 SOFES beneficiaries and
non-beneficiaries found that beneficiaries tend to come from less favorable backgrounds than
non-SOFES students from the same universities: (a) family income of non-SOFES students
exceed that of SOFES students by 48 percent; (b) parents' education level is higher for non-
SOFES students than for SOFES-beneficiaries; and (c) 51 percent of SOFES beneficiaries
attended public upper secondary education as compared to 37 percent for non-SOFES
beneficiaries. Hence, SOFES opened the doors of non-governmental higher education for a new
group of students and thereby increased enrollment of higher education and made more efficient
public expenditure in public higher education.

Impact of loans on quality of programs. The project principally stimulated quality higher
education through increased enrollment in the highest quality institutions in Mexico. Only
universities that were accredited at the highest level in the Mexican Federation of Private
Universities (FIMPES) were eligible for membership in SOFES. Hence by increasing access to
SOFES universities, the project helped raise the average quality of higher education in Mexico.
Further, student loans empowered students to choose higher quality institutions. For example, the
SOFES user survey indicated that in the absence of the loan, 10 percent would have matriculated
in another institution.

C. Impact at the National level
It is difficult to estimate the full impact of the project on enrollment because of the absence of a
counterfactual. Enrollment in higher education in Mexico increased from 1,838,000 in 1999 to
2,323,000 in 2004, a 26 percent increase (enrollment figures from 2004 are the most recent
available). The project funded a number of students equivalent to 9 percent of the additional
400,000 new enrollees. In particular, the direct impact of the project on enrolment could range
from 0 to 38,800 students (which would represent as much as 9.2 percent of the total increase).
Using the above-mentioned estimate of 24 percent estimated impact from loans to enrollment, the
project resulted in at least an increase of 12,500 additional students enrolling in higher education
or 2.5 percent of the total increase.

Perhaps more importantly for the long term national impact is the SOFES institutional platform
for future delivery of student loans in Mexico, and to a lesser extent, the improved institutional
capacity of ICEES, both of which were strongly stimulated by this project. Enhanced institutional
capacity had a catalytic role in promoting sustainable investments in higher education.


6 An impact evaluation of a similar student loan scheme found that drop-out rates were 30 percent lower
for beneficiaries than for non-beneficiaries with the same observable characteristics, (ICETEX, 2006, and
Cerdan-Infantes and Blom, 2007).

3.3 Efficiency

The PAD enumerated clear justification for public sector involvement with the project: expansion
of higher education requires public-private partnership and a student loan is an important
instrument to expand coverage using the existing supply of higher education. At the time of
approval and now, the credit market provided little credit for education. And government
intervention was -- and is -- necessary to help create a market.

The PAD projected three types of economic benefits:

    A. Cost-effectiveness of student loans vis-à-vis grants;
    B. Financial sustainability (Implicit subsidy); and
    C. Efficiency gains from reduced public expenditures in higher education (Fiscal savings,
         explicit subsidy).

A Cost-effectiveness of student loans vis-à-vis grants
According to the projections of the PAD (Annex 4), both SOFES and ICEES will have prompted
more cost-effectiveness than offering an outright grant, except in the presence of large default
rates.

Central to the argument is the high rate of return to higher education, which increased from 13
percent in 1984 to 21 percent in 1994. The rate of return likely reduced as real wages for all
education groups declined substantially in the wake of the 1994 economic crisis. Estimates show
that the rate of return dropped to around 17 percent in 1997.7 There was general tendency for
wages and rates of returns in education to increase since then, although not to their pre-crisis level.

This analysis showed consistently higher net present values of cash flow for SOFES vis-à-vis a
grant program as long as the default rate was less than 25 percent.8 In practice the default rate
has been in the order of 5 percent, which leads to a cost-benefit ratio of 7:5.9 Even with the
reduction in the rate of return, the project had a high cost-benefit ratio in an absolute sense. The
lower returns to higher education would have affected both the cost-benefit for grants and loans,
so the relative impact would have been the same. From this standpoint, SOFES has been cost-
effective as predicted by the PAD.

In the case of ICEES, the default rate has been higher than the 14 percent forecasted by the PAD
as a worst case scenario. Current estimates are that the default rate is approximately 17 percent,
which would lead to a cost benefit ratio of 1.5. The PAD does not clarify what the cost-benefit
ratio would be for subsidies (the number reported is 0.01, which seems to be incorrect), so it is
not possible to report how this compares with the option of providing subsidies. These estimates
also do not include the large number of loans (33 percent) that are not in default but have some
arrears. This would lower the cost benefit ratio, as would the lower rates of return to education.
Taking into account loans in arrears and lower returns to education, the cost benefit ratio for this



7World Bank (2005a)

9 Given that SOFES technically has a zero default rate since bad loans are sold back to universities, this
figure is indeed the percent of loans sold back to the higher education institutions when in arrears for more
than six months (SOFES, 2007). The economic estimation is based on linear interpolation from the
economic analysis in Annex 4 of the PAD. The original data used for calculation is not available.


                                                     12

component will be substantially lower than estimated in the PAD and may even be less than 1.0.
This needs to be tempered by the significant social benefit (not captured in the estimates of
private returns) to higher education and the benefits to strengthening ICEES.

B. Implicit subsidy

The implicit subsidy measures the subsidy involved in a loan expressed as a percentage of the
cost of the average loan (disbursed loan amount and administrative costs). The subsidy can come
from three sources: interest rate; administrative costs; and default. To build financial
sustainability, the project promoted a lower subsidy to reduce the system's dependence upon
recurrent budgetary funds from the State of Sonora or other sources.

The implicit subsidy of an ICEES loan in 1997 is estimated to 28.9 percent and 25 percent in
2005. The PAD sets a target of 21.1 percent in 2003. The reduction in the subsidy is a combined
effect of a change to a positive real interest rate reducing the subsidy, and an increase in the
default rate, which increased the subsidy. Although, financial sustainability improved slightly,
target was not met resulting in ICEES financing fewer students in the future and a greater reliance
on budget funds from the State of Sonora.

The implicit subsidy was not calculated for SOFES in the PAD and no target was envisioned.

C. Efficiency gains (Fiscal Savings or explicit subsidies)

SOFES might lead to fiscal savings if students enrolled in SOFES universities had attended
public universities, generating costs there. The actual fiscal savings depends on the number of
students who, due to the availability of the SOFES student loan, substitute almost free education
from the public sector with fee-based non-governmental education, and the marginal cost of each
of these students in public universities.

The efficiency gains could be in the order of $2.5 million to $7.5 million per year, or a cumulative
total between $17.5 million and $55 million. This estimate assumes that the substitution is not
perfect and assuming that a significant proportion of SOFES beneficiaries would have attended
public universities (as opposed to attended SOFES universities without the benefit of the loan). In
the SOFES survey, 16 percent of SOFES beneficiaries indicated that they had been accepted at a
public institution. If this is the assumed substitution, then the project led to a fiscal saving of 17.5
million. The estimates do not make a distinction between marginal cost and average cost and
seem to assume that the students attending SOFES universities due to the program would not
have been replaced by other students in the public sector, who may not have attended higher
education at all. Further, the estimate of fiscal savings does not take into account the future
increased tax-revenue from the additional graduates of higher education10 (see Annex 3, Section
C, for assumptions and data sources).

In addition, the project is likely to have an increased efficiency on lower repetition and therefore
additional fiscal gains. An impact study showed that students benefiting from SOFES loans were
10 percent less likely to repeat courses, while their grades were 2 percent higher than those of a
comparable student.



10It is important to note that the goal of the project is to expand overall higher education coverage, not to
substitute public enrollment with private enrolment.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory.

The satisfactory rating is justified on the relevance and timeliness of the objectives and the
substantial achievements of the objectives in an efficient manner.

The objectives were highly relevant and timely. Further, the quality-at-entry was satisfactory. In
particular, the design of the SOFES loan system involved significant adaptation of new
innovative and effective mechanisms that mitigated previous shortcomings.

The project achieved its objectives in providing access to higher education to a significant
number of low- and middle-income students. It directly expanded availability of publicly
supported student loans in Mexico by an estimated 400 percent. Further, there is evidence
suggesting that this expansion led to increased expansion of quality higher education. Further, the
project succeeded in creating an effective and more financially sustainable student loan agency in
SOFES, which represents a solid platform for expansion of student loans in Mexico, while ICEES
increased its coverage of financially needy students.

The objectives were achieved in a cost-effective and efficient manner. First, the student loans
proved significantly more cost-effective than a grant program. The economic analysis indicates a
fiscal saving from the SOFES component between US$17 million and 55 million over the life of
the project. Secondly, comparatively speaking, project implementation was carried out in a highly
efficient manner in the case of SOFES that accounts for 83 percent of loan proceeds. However,
further improvements are possible and SOFES has turned out to be the most efficiently run large-
scale student loan system in Latin America.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The project had a direct impact on poverty reduction and inequality by allowing needy students
to have access to higher education. The design and implementation of the targeting mechanism
allowed both ICEES and SOFES to identify and finance low-and middle income students11.

The project contributed significantly to increase acceptance in Mexico of student loans as a way
of financing higher education. As demonstrated by the increase in State-based student loan
systems, a larger share of students and their families now consider borrowing for education
acceptable. Further, there is an increased awareness in the public and private sectors about the
feasibility of sharing the costs of higher education through student loans.

In the State of Sonora, the project supported a higher share of female students, 55 percent, than
the average enrollment of female students in Sonora, 53 percent. Thus, the project contributed to
a higher access for girls to higher education. Forty-seven percent of SOFES loans were awarded
to females. Although being a complementary performance indicator, the project did not explicitly
seek to increase female enrollment in higher education in Mexico. At the time of appraisal, the
share of female students was 48.6 percent and on track to close the small gender gap in
enrollment. In 2005, the share of female students was slightly higher than that of males.


11SOFES defined low income as those with income up to 7.5 times the minimum wage; middle income is
defined as those between 7.5 and 20 times the minimum income.


                                                  14

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

This project has had substantial institutional impact. Both SOFES and ICEES are now
consolidated as student loans institutions, in terms of visibility, management and personnel.
SOFES constitutes the most attractive and likely platform for scaling up the supply of student
loans, leading to: (i) improved equity in non-governmental higher education, and (ii) increased
sustainable private investment into tertiary education. This could contribute to a gradually long-
term shift in financing of higher education and to fostering an understanding of the need and
potential of cost-recovery and borrowing for tertiary education.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
The project has provided momentum for the development of new student loans systems in Mexico.
Other Mexican states have followed in Sonora's footsteps and established student loan
institutions during the time of the project, such as Aguascalientes, Campeche, Chihuahua,
Hidalgo, Tamaulipas and Quintana Roo.

Several non-governmental universities that are members of SOFES improved their management
of loan programs concurrently with the retail management of SOFES loans. For example,
UNITEC (Universidad Tecnológica de México) created an independent collection company to
manage its student loan system.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Beneficiary surveys and focus group were conducted at regular intervals during implementation
to measure user satisfaction and identify opportunities for improvements. SOFES surveyed 1,800
students in 2003. Besides findings previously mentioned, the survey gives a picture of a balanced
student loan program where the vast majority of borrowers are satisfied with the loan product and
the SOFES service: (i) 90 percent characterize SOFES' overall performance as good and 6
percent as normal; (ii) 80 percent think the requirements for obtaining a loan are reasonable; (iii)
94 percent accept the repayment conditions; (iv) 73 percent consider the interest rate acceptable;
and (v) 85 percent believe the share of costs financed by the student loan is sufficient. The survey
also indicates that SOFES could do more to inform borrowers, especially on deadlines. Another
survey of SOFES students carried out in 2002 indicated two demand constraints: the variable
interest rate and the need for collateral and guarantors. Four out of ten cited the latter as a major
difficulty in loan application.

ICEES equally undertook regular user surveys. Eighty-five percent of beneficiaries expressed
overall satisfaction. Annex 5 contains more information regarding the findings of the surveys.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate.

The main risk to the development outcome is the continuation of the SOFES program. Although
SOFES has performed exceptionally well, it lacks a medium term track record. Therefore, it faces
difficulties attracting private investment to replace the World Bank funding.

Even though SOFES has remarkably increased the number of loans in higher education, it still
has to face some financial problems in the short term in order to continue providing loans to
current and new beneficiaries. In particular, it is the only large-scale well-functioning student
loan system in Mexico. It is a well-known brand, which reduces fear among potential borrowers.


                                                  15

The system incorporates the majority of the large high-quality higher education institutions in
Mexico, allowing it to attract the best students who have good labor market prospects and reap
large economies of scale in provision of student loans. The scale could be crucial for success to
lower administration and collection costs, and for a later securitization of the portfolio.
Furthermore, non-governmental higher education is poised to grow further, given the high
demand for skills on the Mexican labor market.

SOFES lacks a medium-term track record. It has four years of credibility in regard to its
repayment track record. A student loan operation is a long term intervention where the standard
loan has a lifetime of 13 years (four years of disbursement, one year of grace and eight years of
repayment). Therefore, the true cost of the current SOFES loans will only be known after 13
years; that is around 2011-2013 for the first three cohorts of SOFES loans. Therefore, despite the
large potential of SOFES, at this time, no private investor is willing to assume part of this
unknown risk, in particular when the interest of the portfolio is below market rates.

A continued public investment into student loans is necessary, in particular, when the system
targets low- and middle-income students, see Section 6 (Lessons Learned). Although the costs of
default can be shared with the non-governmental universities, it is questionable whether the
universities are willing to increase their investment into SOFES and still assume all the risk.12

The continued financing of student loans in the State of Sonora is secured, since the government
of the State of Sonora has increased investment into ICEES. Hence, the risk to development
outcome is marginal. Nevertheless, the scale of operation has decreased, which is partially due to
the failure of ICEES to reduce the level of implicit subsidy in its lending.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance: Satisfactory
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank quickly responded to a request from the Mexican government and helped design an
innovative, results-oriented, and effective project. It brought the relevant knowledge in the form
of consultants, and drew heavily from existing analytical and operational experiences, in
particular the CAS (World Bank, 1995b), the Higher Education Strategy (1994), and above all,
the careful review of previous unsatisfactory projects to avoid pitfalls like those encountered by
Jamaica and Venezuela, whose governments directly operate student loan systems.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory




12As of June 2007, the SOFES universities together guaranteed a portfolio of US$100 million, which the
government in turn guarantees to the Borrower (BANOBRAS). To maintain lending at the same level,
investors would have to extend a credit line to SOFES that would gradually attend the same amount.




                                                   16

The Bank's supervision efforts are rated as satisfactory based on six reasons: (i) the results-
oriented supervision involving a consistent focus on main project output and the use of the M&E
framework, as well as the rigorous impact study undertaken during the project; (ii) The
supervisory team was able to create a strong and close relationship with the Borrower and
implementing agencies, which has allowed an effective monitoring and an efficient learning and
sharing of best practices in the field of student loans; (iii) the Bank ensured a continuity in the
supervision team, and participation of high-level consultants who had extensive experience with
student loans; (iv) the team provided analytical support, in particular to ICEES, in diagnostic
reasons for the medium-high default rates; (v) Bank supervision took steps to ensure fiduciary
responsibility when necessary, for example with an in-depth review of SOFES' financial
management system; and (vi) the team assisted SOFES in the transition from relying on Bank
funding to new sources of funding, for example by organizing meetings with potential investors,
such as IFC and US student loan companies, liaison with the federal government, and assistance
in drafting an investor prospectus.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank performance in quality-at-entry and supervision are both satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.

Despite the indirect financial support to SOFES, the federal government's performance is
considered satisfactory due to its close monitoring in the preparation and implementation phase
of the project. The key federal entity involved in project preparation and supervision has been the
SHCP which guaranteed the Bank loan to BANOBRAS and the loans from BANOBRAS to
SOFES and ICEES. As mentioned, both SEP and CONACYT did not have significant
involvement. SHCP exercised close supervision. In particular, the Secretariat strongly encouraged
Universities to increase their commitment to the project. Although, this intervention temporarily
stalled disbursements, it increased the sustainability of SOFES.

the Bank loan and continue lending

on the Board of ICEES ­ could have supported more actively stronger measures to reward good
repayment, and sanction well-off non-paying borrowers.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.



                                                                    17

SOFES' performance was highly satisfactory given the innovative nature of the entity and its
good management, although commitment and internal collaboration among member universities
could have been better. A key driver behind SOFES' performance was the continuous and
detailed supervision from its Board and presidents. In contrast to ICEES, SOFES hired managers
with experience from the banking sector and also included external advisors to the Board that had
extensive experience from the financial sector. This also is best practice. In short, SOFES is the
best student loan institution in the region, something that has been accomplished in only eight
years. SOFES is now currently improving the:

    · Centralization of collections;
    · Increase of training for loan administrators in SOFES units in the universities.
        Performance in terms of allocation, administration and collections varied significantly
        between universities, and best practices evolved. These could have been shared better
        across universities; and
    · Increase commitment of all shareholder universities to increase credibility and economies
        of scale of SOFES. In a few instances, the opinion of shareholder universities differed in
        the decision making for SOFES. Although, this can be considered part of standard Board
        discussions, the difference of opinions voiced outside of Board meetings could have led
        to reduced credibility of SOFES. Further, a number of member universities did not use
        the credit line or chose to buy back all loans from SOFES.

ICEES performance was moderately unsatisfactory due to minimally reaching institutional
targets, particularly on absolute coverage and technical aspects. On the positive side, ICEES
outperformed the relative coverage of needy students while it retained a strong commitment from
the State government and adapted some new practices and new technologies. Nevertheless,
actions that could have improved performance toward the institutional targets were identified and
within the power of decision-makers. For example, ICEES could have changed loan contracts to
include the right to report loan status to credit bureaus.

BANOBRAS, the Borrower, performed satisfactorily. Although, BANOBRAS was the Borrower,
it did not assume credit risk, since the federal government guaranteed the repayments from the
implementing agencies. Hence, its role was more that of a financial agent, which it carried out
well in handling reserve and guarantee funds, ensuring quarterly performance reports from
SOFES and ICEES, assisting the implementing agencies in procurement and financial
management, and organizing supervision missions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Overall, the performance of the Borrower, the federal government, and particularly the
implementing agencies are satisfactory since they succeeded in achieving the majority of the
development goals of the project. The satisfactory performance of the agency implementing the
largest component, SOFES, compensates for the moderately unsatisfactory performance of the
implementing agency of the smaller component. Further, all 10 loan covenants reached
compliance with effectiveness and onward. In addition, the Borrower and implementing agencies
have been consistent in providing the Bank with information on performance in a complete and
timely fashion.

6. Lessons Learned
The project yields a significant number of lessons learned for future higher education projects
involving student loans. The high number of lessons learned is not a result of unsatisfactory
design or implementation, but rather a result of two factors: (i) the project design was innovative
and experimental; and (ii) implementation has been dynamic and guided by substantial
monitoring and evaluation efforts.

Overall, this experience confirms the technical and political difficulties of setting up a successful
student loan system. As identified at the onset of the project, the main challenge is financial
sustainability, which is the precondition for scaling-up availability of loans. Efficient operation,
effective collections and continued public support with strong accountability are the key
instruments. However, the results are encouraging. This is the first student loan project that the
Bank has financed in Latin America and the Caribbean that has been evaluated as Satisfactory.
The previous two student loan projects in the region were all rated as unsatisfactory; those were
in Jamaica (World Bank 1987a, 1987b, 1995a, 1996a, 1996b, 1997a, 1997b and 2002a) and
Venezuela (World Bank 1992a, 1992b, and 2000).

Design of responsibilities and incentives are crucial for student loans given its long-term nature.
The typical student loan contract between the lender, student and education institution lasts 13
years. Hence, unfortunate division of responsibilities and incentives takes considerable time to
correct and often carries high costs. A careful design is therefore warranted.

Risk and cost sharing with universities is crucial. The SOFES model put the financial risk to a
large extent on the universities and endowed the task of supervision to the same universities. This
ensured a strong incentive for careful and continuous supervision of SOFES, which was lacking
in the ICEES model (and many other public student loan systems). This risk and supervision
sharing is good practice. Non-governmental universities have a strong incentive to develop a loan
system, and they are willing to assume part of the financial risks of a loan system. This potential
source of funds needs to be tapped to improve financial sustainability. Involving the universities
in the loan delivery to the students equally allows: (i) cost-sharing in the sense that the university
through its financial aid office bears part of the costs;13 (ii) data-sharing between the lender and
the universities, which is necessary to ensure reliable and early information regarding academic
progress and drop out; and (iii) better contact and higher service to the student. Nevertheless, as
discussed below, adjustments to the SOFES model are recommendable to allow for efficiencies in
collections and scaling-up. For example, universities are not banks. Therefore, they are not
experienced managers of financial risk. Universities could be unwilling to partially or fully
guarantee the student loans without retaining control over the lending and recovery processes.
Therefore, arguing that the financial risk should not be managed by the universities is a valid
one.14


13 In contrast to SOFES, ICEES does not involve the universities in loan delivery and management, which
implies a substantially higher need for manpower and attention to students, as well as substantially higher
transaction costs for the student in order to go to the ICEES service points, which are outside campus.

14 Default stem from at least five risks: low quality and relevance of education; insufficient academic
preparation leading to drop; ineffective collections; weak labor market; and personal and family reasons.
Universities control the first risk and should evaluate the second risk while the third risk, in the case of
SOFES, was in their hands. The fourth and fifth risks are outside universities' control. Risk sharing with
universities could be made within risks influenced by the universities, such as in the Chilean student loan
system (World Bank, 1998 and 2005b).



                                                       19

Continued public investment in student loans is required. The ICEES system benefited
substantially from the state government's investment. Through the financial guarantee, SOFES
benefited from support from the federal government. However, SEP, the federal government's
responsible agency for higher education, could have played a role in the project. This could
possibly have facilitated additional public-sector support to SOFES to ensure financial
sustainability since in the Bank's experience no large student loan system has been developed in
the world without public support. For instance, the student loan system in New Zealand has a 21
percent implicit subsidy. The US-government yearly subsidizes US$5,000 million to cover
defaults, administrative costs and subsidized interest rates in its so-called direct student loan
program.

A public-private partnership in student loans is desirable but difficult when financial risks are
uncertain. The project experience indicates that non-governmental involvement in a student loan
system, such as the SOFES model, leads to better performance than a purely public model, such
as the ICEES model. However, the non-governmental involvement can lead to a discussion of the
necessary (and appropriate) level of public subsidy/financial risk taking. This level of subsidy is
inherently difficult to assess given that the actual loss (default) of a student loan is only known
after 10 to 15 years. In the absence of a market solution, where non-governmental entities
compete on the basis of the lowest required public subsidy, which was not the case in the SOFES
model, a negotiated agreement between the non-governmental entities (in this case SOFES
universities) and the government is necessary. Negotiating such as an agreement requires a long-
term focus on the common interest in a large-scale sustainable student loan system.

Although student loan is a higher education policy instrument, it is also a financial instrument,
and experience from the commercial banking sector is necessary. An important difference
between SOFES and ICEES was the involvement in SOFES of experience personal from the
private commercial financial sector. At both the director level and at the board level, SOFES
benefited from transfer of best practices, technology, and knowledge from the private financial
sector.

Long term sustainability of the interest rate is important. The financial development of a student
loan agency requires a sophisticated and long-term analysis of a sustainable interest rate on loans
offered to students. The rate should be low enough for students to be able to repay, and high
enough for the student loan agency to acquire new financing. The extent of an interest rate
subsidy must match the commitment of the government to subsidize the system -- as in the State
of Sonora where high levels of subsidy were supported by the State government.

Long-term financing of student loans is required. Despite a record performance and a 34-month
extension of the project, SOFES faces difficulties obtaining new financing. The time span needed
to achieve a track-record and financial predictability of a student loan system exceeds six to eight
years. This limits the system's ability to access the capital market without substantial backing
from government guarantees. Therefore, Bank support to new student loans should therefore be
longer term; for example, adaptable program lending or alternative financing sources should be
identified. For example, as the volume of student loans increase and the program develops, there
is need for more sophisticated financial instruments, notably securitization. A long-term financial
vision could include the development of a secondary student loan market.

Attention to collection cannot be overestimated. Student loan systems in developing countries
often fail to grow because of a large implicit subsidy, which in many cases is exaggerated and
untargeted due to high defaults. Collection of student loans is to a degree different from consumer


                                                 20

loans, because the borrower is young, often inexperienced, has an unstable income in the first
years of repayment, has no collateral or other goods that can be re-assessed. Frequent information
and contact to the borrower is therefore even more critical. Collections need to be resolute,
efficient, fair and humane. To build such a collection mechanism, it is recommendable to:

(i) Ensure up-front political commitment to enforce collections. For ICEES, the planned actions
     to improve collections were instrumental in improving the performance of ICEES, but
     nevertheless insufficient to meet the component's objective of financial sustainability. The
     design could have specified in more detail effective measures to improve collections and
     ensured a commitment of the institution and the state government to take such measures.

(ii) Report loan status to national credit bureaus. This is one of the strongest collection
     instruments. It rewards good payment behavior and sanctions bad behavior. Importantly,
     borrowers should have the option of a deferment in repayments during economic hardship. A
     significant share of borrowers will experience difficulties repaying the loan at some time
     during the repayment phase.

(iii)Rely upon a large-scale professional collection mechanism. In this project, there were large
     differences in the performance of the universities as collectors. Many specific collection
     policies, training, technology, and management strategies exist for efficient and effective
     collections. Universities should probably not be in charge of collection. Although, the
     university has a "social" relationship with the borrowing student that can increase repayment,
     a professionalized collection is now recommended by SOFES. A professional collection
     mechanism could be achieved by either partially or fully outsourced collections to a
     collection agency (with due supervision), or develop a professional centralized collection
     capacity within SOFES.

Fear of borrowing is a problem. Students, in particular from low-and middle-income families,
have limited experience with borrowing, and can fear borrowing leads to personal bankruptcy.
This potential problem can gradually be reduced as the student loan agency becomes well-known
and borrowing for education is better understood and accepted. The student loan product should
be designed to help these students. This can involve combining scholarships, tuition discounts
and loans, as was in the case of many SOFES institutions. Student surveys identified a variable
interest rate as a factor of increased uncertainty causing fear of borrowing among SOFES
borrowers.

Ensure the financial conditions of the assets and liabilities match. In this project, the student loan
agencies were responsible for repaying the loans. In other Bank loans, the state assumed the
repayment responsibility. When the loan institution is in charge of repayment, asset and liability
management becomes crucial. In this project, unforeseen factors delayed loan origination to
students, which delayed repayments from students to SOFES. However, the amortization
schedule to BANOBRAS and the Bank remained unchanged. SOFES therefore, a relatively
simple timing mismatch resulted in a temporary liquidity gap that could have jeopardized the
financial stability of SOFES. This was solved by capital augmentation underwritten by SOFES
shareholders and a limited sell back of loans to member universities. More attention should be
devoted in the future to adjust World Bank disbursements, student repayments and the
Borrower's repayments when financing student loan programs. For example, the amortization
schedule could be made dependent upon disbursement.15


15 During the period of implementation, the Bank developed an adequate loan product, where amortizations
are linked to disbursements. However, this loan product was not available at the time of project preparation.

                        under a series of institutional restrictions that no longer apply.
                        The World Bank has substantially improved its products for better
                        coverage of various risks associated with time lags in the
                        placement of subloans and the financial markets, among other
                        variables.

                        In addition, important advances have taken place at the world
                        level with regard to corporate government practices, control of
                        operations, and information technologies, that today would imply
                        an institutional design different from the one originally proposed.
                        Specifically, there is greater acceptance of the importance of
                        creating executive boards, the application of methodologies to
                        control operational risks, and information technologies for
                        improved decision-making.

                        In order to facilitate the implementation of these changes in future
                        operations, it is important to take stock of the problems
                        encountered during project execution and the currently available
                        solutions. Please refer to the box at the end of this document.

                        disbursement of the loan. The delays led to the extension of the
                        project, which closed on December 31, 2006.

                        By category, the disbursed amounts were:

                        Student loans: US$178.70 million; procurement of goods:
                        US$0.08 million; consultant fees: US$1.42 million. The total

                        equals the amount of the loan, which was US$180.20 million. It
                        should be noted that a transfer of US$1.79 million from the
                        categories of goods and consultants was made to the student
                        loans category.

                        In two cases, the Disbursement Department did not disburse the
                        proceeds according to the applications submitted. Although the
                        difference in the amounts is insignificant (35 US$ cents were not
                        disbursed to ICEES whereas in the SOFES case they were
                        reimbursed without being requested to do so), it shows the
                        possibility of World Bank procedures forcing the breach of
                        contracts by the fiscal agent with the accredited entities.

                        Comments and lessons learned: Good coordination among all
                        the participants made it possible to reach agreements and
                        arrange the timely delivery of the corresponding paperwork to
                        avoid cancellations and take advantage of both the proceeds and
                        the technical assistance of the loan.

                        At the Federal level, during portfolio reviews, the decentralization
                        of services to the country offices of the World Bank has been
                        requested    to  expedite    processes    such   as   disbursement
                        applications. Likewise, the transmittal of loan documents to the

                        continue to affect special account operations.

                        On the other hand, the policies of the World Bank regarding the
                        exchange rate differ with national legislation because it allows the
                        Bank to use the market exchange rate while national legislation
                        allows only the rate of exchange published by the Bank of
                        Mexico.

                        At the end of loan execution, the World Bank used the market
                        exchange rate and caused a lag between the passive
                        disbursements (between World Bank and BANOBRAS) and
                        active disbursements (between BANOBRAS and the execution
                        agency).

                        Comments and lessons learned: The World Bank should be
                        familiar with the Mexican budgeting process in order to improve
                        the implementation of new operations, because it is difficult to
                        change the disbursement of resources from one fiscal year to
                        another.

Conclusions             The project was unique because of its executing agencies (the
                        State on the one hand and a development Society of limited
                        partnership on the other) and for the support to the education
                        sector from the Federal Government as demonstrated by the
                        contracting of foreign borrowing, payment of the effectiveness
                        commission, and the commitment commissions so that low and

                        education.

                        Coordination within the project team made it possible to share
                        experiences     during  project implementation     such   as   the
                        methodology of socioeconomic evaluation for the selection of
                        students developed by SOFES and shared with ICEES; the
                        learning of the SOFES operating system through one-stop
                        windows established in the partner universities for the granting of
                        credits; and, the control measures of ICEES for the recovery of
                        credits (such as the creation of client centers for borrowers of
                        educational credits, information system, extension of repayment
                        terms, incentives for timely payment, interest payments during the
                        course of studies, payroll withholdings, family accountability,

1The contribution of the Federal Government depends to a large extent upon future changes in the interest
rate and exchange rate, and can therefore not be meaningfully estimated. The appraisal estimate is
therefore repeated.
2Yearly budget contribution from the State Government to ICEES from 2000 to 2003.
3Sum of: (i) SOFES yearly operation costs from 2000 to 2006 where the operational, consulting and
training costs financed by the Bank have been deducted. These costs are financed either directly or
indirectly by SOFES universities (US$ 7.8 million), and (ii) Investments in SOFES's own capital as of
October 31, 2006 (US$ 16.8 million).
4Estimated based upon share of household payment of tuition in SOFES universities only. The student
loans financed on average 44 percent of tuition, according to SOFES management information system. An
estimated further 10 percent of tuition was financed by grants. Hence, the remaining 46 percent of tuition is
financed by student/household contributions.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Economic Analysis

1. Implicit subsidy (ICEES)

The implicit subsidy measures the subsidy involved in a loan expressed as a percentage of the
cost of the average loan (disbursed loan amount and administrative costs). The subsidy can come
from three sources: interest rate, administrative costs, and default. The calculation of the implicit
subsidy follows the methodology of (Albrecht and Ziderman, 1991).

Assumptions
1. Students receive equal real value loans over a four year disbursement period in lump sums at
   the beginning of each year.
2. Administrative costs are spread out evenly during the life of the loan and equal the average unit
   cost of administrating a loan (total administration costs divided by number of loans).16
3. Default is the frequency of loans that fail to repay. It is expressed as a probability for each year
   of repayment
4. Grace periods have been rounded to the nearest year.
5. Repayments are in equal nominal amounts in yearly installments, at the beginning of each
   payment period.
6. Inflation is constant throughout the life of the loan.
7. Defaulted loans carry an administrative cost equal to good loans.

2. Efficiency Gains (Fiscal Savings, SOFES) (Million US Dollars)




16 This is the only difference from the methodology of (Albrecht and Ziderman, 1991) that assumes
administration cost is a fixed percentage of outstanding loan amount. The adjusted cost methodology is
believed to better reflect the actual costs, since collections costs depend less upon outstanding amount.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Beneficiary surveys and focus group were conducted at regular intervals during project
implementation to ensure borrower satisfaction and identify opportunities for improvements. The
following is a summary only.

In the summer of 2003, SOFES conducted a large-scale survey among 1818 students in Mexico.
The survey was designed for this impact study. Four groups were surveyed: students with a
SOFES credit, students without a SOFES credit, graduates with a SOFES credit, and graduates
without a SOFES credit. Three universities participated in the survey: Universidad Tecnológica
de México, Instituto Tecnológico de Educación Superior de Monterrey, and Centro Universitario
Grupo Sol. These three universities form a small but fairly representative sub-sample of the more
than 40 universities offering SOFES loans, and the outcomes must therefore be treated with care.
The Table below summarizes the information collected from the survey. Besides findings
previously mentioned, the survey gives a picture of a balanced student loan where the vast
majority of borrowers are satisfied with the loan product and the SOFES service: (i) 90 percent
characterizes the SOFES overall performance as good; (ii) 80 percent think the requirements for
obtaining a loan are reasonable; (iii) 94 percent accepts the repayment conditions, (iv) 73 percent
rates the interest rate as acceptable, and (v) 85 percent believe the share of costs financed by the
student loan suffice. The survey equal indicates that SOFES could do more to inform borrowers,
especially on deadlines. Box 1 provides some representative examples of who were financed
under the project.

Another survey of SOFES students carried out in 2002 among 368 students indicated two major
constraints for demand: the variable interest rate and the need for collateral and guarantors. 4 out
of 10 cited the latter as a major difficulty in loan application. This echoes findings from
Colombia.

Box 1 Five examples of SOFES beneficiaries
The SOFES component benefited 27,033 students. This box presents five beneficiaries from Centro
Universitario Grupo Sol as examples of who borrowed, for what reasons and what impact the loan had:
· Edgar, bachelor in computer science. Edgar borrowed to access higher education and complete his
    degree. He now owes an internet café that enables him to repay his loan.
· Verónica, bachelor in business administration. Veronica asked SOFES for a loan to cover tuition and
    living costs in order to move closer to the campus. Without the loan, she daily spent up 6 hours to
    come to class. Thanks to the loan, she graduated and found a job that allows her to repay the loan.
· José, bachelor in computer science. The SOFES loan was the only option for José to finance his
    studies, since he or his family did not have sufficient recourse to pay the tuition. José sought the higher
    education as means to reach his goals in life. He is currently a manager of an IT Support group.
· Beatriz, bachelor. As a single mother to three children, the SOFES loan was necessary for Beatriz to
    finance her career. She now studies at the graduate school.
· Jorge, bachelor in computer science. Jorge borrowed in order to complete his semester. Jose chose to
    borrower and enroll in order to improve his living conditions and find a job that could provide a salary
    sufficient to support his family, which he was not able to without a degree.

ICEES equally undertook regular user surveys from 1998 to 2003. 83 percent of beneficiaries
expressed satisfaction, although the trend declined slightly from a high of 85 in 1998 and to 80
percent in 2002. The decline in satisfaction could be caused by an increase in the real interest rate
and initiatives to increase collections.

A focus group study carried out in 2004 among studying and repaying beneficiaries found that it
was common knowledge that ICEES did not punish non-repayment. The focus groups supported
tougher actions to penalize graduates that dispose of means to repay as long as ICEES
meticulously assured that penalties would not fall upon graduates without means to repay.
