Dear Mr. Minister:
We refer to the Guarantee Agreement (the Guarantee Agreement) between us for the

above-mentioned Project.
In consideration of the foregoing, we hereby agree that the Guarantee Agreement 
be amended as follows:
-
Section 1.02 is amended to read:
“Unless the context otherwise requires, the several terms defined in the General 
Conditions, 
in the Preamble to this Agreement and in the Preamble and Section 1.02 of 
the Loan 
Agreement, as amended, have the respective meanings therein set 
forth.” 
-
Section 2.01 is amended to read:
“The Guarantor declares its commitment to the objectives of the Project as set 
forth in 
Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement, and, to this end, without 
limitation or restriction upon 
any of its other obligations under the Guarantee 
Agreement, the Guarantor hereby 
unconditionally guarantees, as primary 
obligor and not as surety merely, the due and 
punctual payment of the principal 
of, and interest and other charges on, the Loan, and the 
premium, if any, on the 
prepayment of the Loan, and the punctual performance of all the 
other 
obligations of the Borrower and each Project Entity, all as set forth in the Loan 
Agreement and, respectively, each Project Agreement.”
-
Section 3.01 is amended to read:
“The Guarantor shall take or cause to be taken all measures as may be required 
on its part,  including the provisions of funds, facilities, services and other 
resources, necessary or 
appropriate to enable the Borrower to carry out the Project 
and to comply with its other 
obligations under the Loan Agreement, as well 
as each Project Entity to comply with its 
obligations under the respective 
Project Agreement, and shall not take or permit to be taken 
any action which 
would prevent or interfere with such performance and compliance.”
-
Section 3.02 is amended to read:
“ (a) Not later than June 30 of each year, the Guarantor shall exchange views 
with the Bank 
and the Borrower with regard to the implementation of the CFR 
Performance Contract, and with 
the Bank and CFR Passengers with regard to the 
implementation of the CFR Passengers 
Performance Contract, the performance of 
the Guarantor's obligations thereunder, and the 
resource requirements and 
other actions necessary for the subsequent year in order to 
achieve the 
objectives stated in the CFR Performance Contract and the CFR Passengers 
Performance Contract; and
(b)
except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Guarantor shall not amend 
or otherwise  alter the CFR Performance Contract and the CFR Passengers Performance 
Contract or any 
provision thereof.”
