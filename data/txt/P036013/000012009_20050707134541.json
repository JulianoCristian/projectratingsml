Some insights, rather\n            than lessons are offered from the success experience of this\n            operation. It is first emphasized that policy changes are\n            more likely to be implemented successfully when Bank support\n            is provided right at the time when public entities have\n            committed to the process of commercialization, and,\n            supportive sector-wide reforms are being put in place.\n            However, whenever railway companies are moving toward\n            commercial operations, their long-term financial health\n            needs to be assured by rationalizing subsidy support, and\n            introducing an appropriate costing model. In addition, a\n            critical success factor in a complex task, such as the\n            installation of an integrated management system, is that\n            sufficient technical supervision and support must be\n            available to assist with problem solving as may arise.\n            Further lessons point at maximizing the benefits of a\n            complex information system, which require that middle and\n            upper level management foresee, and understand the benefits\n            of using the system; and, at the Public Service Obligation\n            Subsidy, which should be for specific services that the\n            Government considers socially necessary; such services\n            should be transparent, explicitly defined, and fully\n            compensated as part of a Contract Plan."}, "docdt": "2005-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
