"loan_no": "3976", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The outcome of the project is highly\n            satisfactory, sustainability highly likely, and\n            institutional development impacts are high, with a highly\n            satisfactory borrower performance, and satisfactory Bank\n            performance. Regardless of the highly satisfactory outcomes,\n            lessons of experience suggest the following. The partnership\n            in the loan - in this case between the Government, the\n            Railways, and the Bank - bestows upon the Bank a greater\n            responsibility than simply monitoring progress of the\n            lending program, and progress on each of its components.\n            Through the interaction with the Ministry of Transport and\n            the Executive Management of the Railway, the Bank staff\n            needs to understand the changing (Railway) environment, and\n            share in the development of strategies to ensure the overall\n            success of the Railway reform. In projects with significant\n            institutional development, or restructuring objectives,\n            supervision missions should review, and conduct consultation\n            meetings beyond the project components framework, to guide\n            the process towards the shared objectives between the client\n            and the Bank, with encouragement by the Bank, and management\n            assistance (Railway in this case) towards decisions that\n            continue the reform programs, an in turn, building support\n            for such actions at the Government level. The project's\n            partnership, upon restructuring, needs to address details of\n            a project's components only when needed, but when\n            necessary, do so exceptionally. This was recognized by the\n            Bank early in the review and supervision process, in\n            connection with the Integrated Railway Information System,\n            and increased consultations and reviews on this component,\n            and its supporting telecommunications component, in order to\n            provide the required expertise, and achieve success. General\n            lessons further suggest that while lender/donor coordination\n            is best managed by the borrower, discussions should take\n            place with the Bank on the content of project interventions,\n            prior to these being undertaken, and, given restructuring\n            needs, appropriate importance should be given to the Mission\n            Statement and Mandate, being Supervision the adequate phase\n            for the details of the project's policy and\n            institutional components, not during preparation which may\n            be out of context."}, "docdt": "2004-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
