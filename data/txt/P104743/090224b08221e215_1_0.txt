                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Agreement was reached with the Government with respect to Project Restructuring (as officially requested by the Government on September 18, 2013). The restructuring entails
                         some revisions of indicator targets and a revision of targets under disbursement-linked indicators (DLI) #1 and #3. Specifically, one target is being added under DLI#1 for January
                         2014 and the remaining two DLI targets under DLI#3 will be replaced with four new targets.

                         In addition, it was agreed that the project will not provide additional support to the GoM‚Äôs effort in strengthening the national identification system and build and implement the
                         individual identification mechanisms as the Government has decided to build the new national ID system with its own resources.
