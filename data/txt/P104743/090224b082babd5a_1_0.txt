Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The overall project implementation has continued to make progress since last September. Under Components A & B, the Maldives Pension
 Administration Office (MPAO) has stepped up the public information activities for participation of self employed workers into Maldives Retirement
 Pension Scheme and is drafting the regulation for disability insurance after the Board has approved its introduction. Under Component C, the Public
 Accounting System consultant has completed or nearly completed the upgrading/updating all relevant SAP modules except the BPC module due to
 various delays. An amendment to the contract is being negotiated in order to extend the service duration and possibly the scope. Under Component D,
 the system development work for the Social Protection Information System (SPIS) has completed the first stage and the prototype system has been
 provided to National Social Protection Agency for testing. More importantly, the reform on electricity and food subsidies has gained momentum and the
 targeting system to ensure the social protection benefits reaching the poor is now being implemented.
 Because the Government has not taken appropriate actions to resolve the "double pensions" and the sustainability of universal social pension to senior
 citizens, the IDA will consider cancelling the disbursement related to the Project Component "Pension Payouts", which has been under suspension
 since July 18, 2014.
 A project restructuring will be carried out to better support the Government's new effort in re-registering electricity subsidy beneficiaries under the
 Project Component D.

 Overall Comments
 There have been some progress made in the PDO indicators. The MPAO is preparing the regulation related to supplemental disability insurance
 for MRPS members after its board has approved the Strategy for roll-out plan of disability insurance. The public information campaign activities
 has been focusing on the self-employed workers' participation to MRPS. The roll-out for generating pay-roll data for pension contribution by public
 employees is continuing. The Social Protection Information System prototype has been delivered to the NSPA for testing.The disability
 certification and determination process has been finalized and the documents were sent to Ministry of Law and Gender for gazette and
 communicated with the Attorney General. The further development of Health Insurance information system is being done in-house by the
 Asandha, though it may not be completed given the institutional change related to Asandha.
