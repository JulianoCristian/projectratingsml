Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 This is a final Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) for this project which is closing on June 30, 2015. The project has achieved all of its
 intended original and revised objectives and the majority of its planned activities over the course of implementation, under the original Credit financing
 (approved in April 2009) and under the Additional Financing Grant (approved in May 2011). In line with the 2009 National Pension Act, a new pension
 authority in Maldives, namely the Maldives Pensions Administration Office (MPAO), and the Pension Supervision Department in the Capital Market
 Development Authority (CMDA) have been established and have been operating successfully, the legal and regulatory framework for pension reform
 has been put in place, and the capacity of MPAO and CMDA to effectively implement, regulate and supervise the new pension system has been
 strengthened. All formal sector workers have opened an individual retirement account under Maldives Retirement Pension Scheme (MRPS) and all
 citizens 65 years and above are receiving the Old Age Benefit Pension (OABP). To achieve this, the project has supported extensive public awareness
 and communication campaigns, explaining workers and senior citizens about the objectives of the new pension system, their rights, obligations and
 mechanisms for contributing and receiving their benefits. The project has also strengthened the capacity of the National Social Protection Agency
 (NSPA) to develop the required processes and systems for the delivery of the disability benefit program and for targeted social assistance benefits.
 Progress was also made to assess the existing health insurance system and the requirements of an integrated health information system. Lastly, the
 project supported the Ministry of Finance and Treasury's Treasury and Public Accounting Division to implement and strenghthen a Public Accounting
 System based on SAP software (HR/payroll module rolled out to all agencies to ensure a payroll system for all public employees, including tracking
 pension contributions).
 Indeed, given project achievements, the outcome rating of the project could be fully Satisfactory. However, this rating is downgraded to Moderately
 Satisfactory by this final ISR to reflect the challenges faced by the project over the last years of implementation, which resulted in the suspension of
 project disbursements under Component E (Pay-out of Pension Liabilities) since July 18, 2014. Prior to that, 13 of the 15 Disbursement Linked
 Indicators (DLIs) targets have been met and the project has financed the accrued rights of the public sector retirees under this component for a total of
 US$6.2 million out of the original estimated total of US$8 million. Regrettably, further disbursement against the remaining 2 DLI targets was deemed to
 be inappropriate given the lack of progress by Government to take measures to harmonize the "double pensions" for public employees (MRPS and
 retirement benefits provided by Civil Service Commission and other institutions) and the introduction of a new Senior Citizen Allowance (SCA) in March
 2014 which effectively doubled the Old Age Benefit Pension and put into question the relevance and the sustainability of the entire pension system.
 Since then, some progress has been made by Government with respect to these two issues. The “double pension” issue has been discussed in the
 Government and a technical paper prepared by the MPAO outlining options for harmonization. A final decision by the President’s office is required. With
 regards to the SCA, the Ministry of Finance and Treasury has been instructed on February 3, 2015 to develop a strategy for income-testing the
 recipients of the SCA. The Bank remains committed to assisting the Government to resolve these issues in a way which will ensure the full viability of
 the pension system after the project closure through technical support.

         All qualitative milestones have been achieved. As originally envisioned, MPAO has became financially self-sustained beginning in 2015. It
         has also reduced its administration fee collected from the MRPS members while has managed to add disability insurance benefit free of
         cost to the MRPS members.

         All qualitative milestones have been achieved. Since the inception of the project 476 targeted information sessions have been conducted
         and 30,844 people have attended the sessions. The information sessions have been conducted in atolls, resorts, schools and colleges etc.
         In addition to information sessions, the project has leveraged mass media such as TV and Radio talk shows (217 times since the inception)
         and other channels such as newspaper articles, leaflets and sponsorship of events to raise public awareness were also carried out. Its
         website regularly publishes key indicators of the pension program () and the MRPS members can access to their Retirement Saving
         Account online.

         Mechanisms for payroll generation from PAS were defined by end of 2010. The HR/payroll modules have been gradually rolled out to Male-
         based agencies. In September 2012, there were only about 110 separate agencies in Male. But over the course of the project a number of
         new Male-based agencies have been created. As of April 30, 2015 there are 124 separate Male' based agencies and the HR/payroll
         module roll out was 95% completed. The remaining six business areas are to be rolled out by May 31, 2015. In addition to Male-based
         agencies, 4 non-Male based agencies have been covered.

         All qualitative milestones have been achieved, including: (1) by end of 2012 System analysis for MIS carried out and standard operating
         procedures developed; (2) by end of 2013 Pilot of the target mechanism to Single Parent Allowance to new applicants initiated; (3) by June
         of 2015 New MIS systems and processes fully implemented & Relevant staff trained & Strategy for an integrated national social protection
         system developed. The strategy for an integrated national social protection system is largely reflected in the Social Protection Act (2014),
         though the regulations for implementing all relevant social protection programs are still in the process of finalization.

               MPAO has developed in-house phased withdrawal provisions for MRPS pensioners. The options on annuitization have been explored and
               discussed by the MPAO Board. However after evaluating various annuitization options against the benefit and the cost to MRPS members
               as well as the regulatory environment, the MPAO Board has decided not to change to annuitization in the short run and the policy will be re-
               evaluated every two years.

 Overall Comments
 Of the 9 Intermediate Outcome indicators, the project has achieved 8 and partially achieved 1. For Intermediate Outcome Indicator #1 "Key
 policies developed and adopted to facilitate MRPS implementation", all milestones except the last one have been achieved. While draft
 amendments to relevant laws in order to unify parallel pension system and rationalize benefits have been proposed by Maldives Pension
 Administration Office, a decision is yet to be made by the Government.
