Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The overall project implementation has seen encouraging progress made since last May. The particularly noteworthy progress is made
 under Components C and D, namely, (i) the commencement of services by the contracted SAP consultant for the Public Accounting System (PAS)
 under Component C, and (ii) the commencement of the system development work for the Social Protection Information System (SPIS) under
 Component D. The strong progress in these two critical activities has put the project implementation back on the right track. The PAS team in the
 Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MoFT) and the National Social Protection Agency (NSPA) must be commended for their efforts.
 The Government has decided to harmonize the pensions of public servants. However, there is currently no intention by the President's office to modify
 the high level of the Senior Citizen Allowance (SCA). At the request of the President’s Office, a technical paper was prepared by the Maldives Pension
 Administration Office (MPAO), which has proposed detailed measures on how to harmonize various defined benefit type of pensions with the Maldives
 Retirement Pension Scheme (MRPS). The consultation was under way at the Economic and Youth Council of the Cabinet. The MoFT would address
 the "double pensions" issue in the FY15 budget currently under discussion.
 As of end-August 2014, about 66% of the total project funds has been disbursed. Another 14% and 7% have been committed or planned respectively
 for the remaining 9 months of the project. There is a clear need for the NSPA to review and strengthen the implementation plan under Component D in
 the context of the recent Social Protection Act (SPA) so that the Project can support it to fulfil its enlarged responsibilities.
