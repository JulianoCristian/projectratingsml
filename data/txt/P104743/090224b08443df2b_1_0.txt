2. Project Objectives and Components

a. Objectives
    Objective in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and the original legal agreement have the same wording:
    The objective of the project is "to support the establishment of a new pension authority and strengthening capacity at existing institutions of
    the Recipient in order to effectively implement a new pension system and to provide a platform for additional social protection programs."
    The revised project objective (from the financing agreement of June 2011): "to support the implementation of the National Pension Act, to
    strengthen institutional capacity of key agencies responsible for implementing the National Pension Act, and to develop the processes and
    platforms required for the delivery of social protection programs."
    Because of the revision of objectives and scope at the June 2011 restructuring, this Review will perform a split rating. At the time of that
    restructuring, 14.4% of Bank financing had been disbursed. A February 2014 restructuring further revised several qualitative outcome

     targets, but as this revision increased the project's ambition, an additional split rating is not triggered by these new targets.

     Did the Board approve the revised objectives/key associated outcome targets?

c.   Components
     Component A: Strengthening Capacity for Implementing the New Pension Program (US$1.5 million at design, US$1.7 million
     added at additional financing, US$3.2 million actual). This component was to provide technical assistance and finance the start-up
     costs of the new Pension Authority, building capacity of its staff and developing necessary administrative infrastructure, including
     information technology and a public accounting system.
     Component B: Public Awareness Campaign (US$0.5 million at design, US$0.1 million added at additional financing, US$0.41
     million actual). This component was to finance a public awareness and education campaign to explain the new agency and the new
     pension system to the general public, distinguishing between employers, workers, and senior citizens.
     Component C: Public Accounting System (US$1.8 million at design as a subcomponent of Component A, no additional
     financing, US$1.97 million actual). This activity was originally a subcomponent under Component A and was made into a new
     component at the June 2011 restructuring, to be implemented by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury.
     Component D: Administration of Health Insurance, Disability, and Targeted Assistance (not a part of original design, US$2.0
     million added at additional financing, US$1.72 million actual). This component was to support system design, capacity building,
     and information technology (IT) infrastructure for a targeting system for non-contributory transfers, disability coding, and benefit
     administration. It was to support the implementation of the Disability Act, a new targeting system, and development of health insurance
     systems.
     Component E: Payout of Pension Liabilities (not a part of original design, US$8.0 million added at additional financing, US$6.4
     million actual). This component was to finance some of the government’s transition costs that arose from switching from a defined benefit
     to a defined contribution system. In the old pension system there had been an implicit contingent liability for government employees; in the
     new system these became explicit through “Recognition Bonds." When employees reach retirement age, the government was now to be
     obligated to transfer the value of the “Recognition Bonds" to workers’ individual retirement savings accounts. In the short run, these
     payments posed a fiscal challenge to the government, and the project was to support the government by defraying the costs for public
     employees retiring between January 2011 and March 2014, subject to the satisfactory achievement of three disbursement-linked
     indicators directly tied to project activities.




d. Comments on Project Cost, Financing, Borrower Contribution, and Dates
     Costs
     Total appraised costs were US$ 3.8 million. A June 2011 additional financing added US$12 million, for a total estimated cost of US$15.8
     million. The project disbursed US$13.4 million, 85% of the total allocated. The scope of the project grew at Additional Financing, requiring
     financing for pension payouts (Component E) and for new targeting, disability and health insurance systems (Component D). A
     suspension of disbursements under Component E caused the project to underspend.
     Financing
     The project was entirely financed by IDA (24% in the form of a credit, the rest as grant). No Borrower contribution was planned.

     Dates
     The project was restructured four times and extended from an original closing date of 12/31/2012 to 06/30/2015.
     •        06/02/2011 was the date for the additional financing, where the project's objectives and scope were changed. The additional
     financing was in part to assist the Maldives with its fiscal consolidation stemming from the need to cope with the consequences of the
     global financial crisis in 2008-09.

3. Relevance of Objectives & Design

a. Relevance of Objectives


      a Relevance of Objectives


    Relevance of original objectives: The relevance of the project objectives was initially very high. The country had an archaic pension system
    in which government workers received a pension after 20 years of service, even if they were still working and drawing a salary. A few were
    receiving two pensions and a salary. Many elderly without past government service did not receive any pension at all. Coverage with other
    social safety nets was patchy. The original objectives supported the establishment of a two-pillar pension system with a non-contributory
    social pension and a fully funded Defined Contribution (DC) pension scheme. It also supported the development of the institutional platform
    needed to implement these pensions. All of this in line with international good practice. The project's original objectives were also highly
    relevant to the Country Strategy in place at entry and to the Bank's Interim Strategy Note for FY14-16, which among other things aims to
    improve the institutional framework for social protection. The Interim Strategy Note also emphasizes macro-fiscal issues, something that the
    project as designed supported through pension rationalization.

    Relevance of revised objectives: The government introduced several laws on social protection during the lifetime of the project and, with the
    revised objectives, the project was able to support the implementation of these new laws. In this way, the objectives of the
    restructured project (revised objectives) enabled support to build a platform that could support the implementation of a range of social
    protection policies related to disability allowance, targeting of benefits, and health insurance in addition to pensions. However, as explained
    in the ICR, the government's failure to phase out the previous pension given to all civil servants with 20 years of service led to a situation
    of double pensions for some civil servants. Subsequently, the government introduced a new senior citizens allowance that duplicates the
    old-age allowance under the Pension Act. Both changes occurred outside the framework of the laws whose implementation the project was
    to support. These changes undermined the project's rationale and the government's already difficult fiscal position. The rational and efficient
    pension architecture created by the Pension Act and supported by the project was therefore undermined because of the government's
    introduction in 2013 of new allowances. The revised objectives were therefore significantly less relevant to country conditions and Bank
    strategy.

    In sum, the project's original objectives were highly relevant, but their rationale became undermined in practice as the project was
    restructured. These changes occurred for political reasons outside the control of the project and the Bank.

b. Relevance of Design

   Relevance of design under the original objectives: The project was well designed, with activities aimed at assisting the country in creating a
   modern pension and social protection institutional architecture and implementing benefit payments. Project activities were well structured to set
   up the pension agency and build its capacity to implement the new pension system. The project components reflect a clear and logical
   structure, with components focused on capacity building for pension administration; creation of necessary public awareness; an accounting
   system; and administration of other social protection benefits, namely health insurance, disability, and targeted assistance. These are the
   elements needed to administer and operate a modern pension and social protection system.

   Relevance of design under the revised objectives: The revised project design broadened the scope to include temporary support for financing
   the payout of "Recognition Bonds." This need arose from the transition from the previous unfunded pension system to the new funded defined
   contribution (DC) system for civil servants, which created a gap for civil servants retiring after the change but before they had time to

       accumulate sufficient savings. The ICR argues that financing the payout of these "Recognition Bonds" was justified originally because it helped
       finance the transitional cost of a pension reform that would help the country achieve fiscal savings in the long run. The ICR also argues, rightly,
       that the rationale for IDA financing to the "Recognition Bonds" was lost when the government introduced double pensions and notes that
       disbursement for these bonds under Component E was suspended at that time.

    Objective 1

    Objective
     Support the establishment of a new pension authority and strengthen capacity at existing institutions of the Recipient in order to effectively
     implement a new pension system

    Rationale
    Outputs:
    • The project directly supported the creation of a new pension authority, the Maldives Pension Administration Office (MPAO), along with the
    Pension Supervision Department. This included appointment of governing board members and an Executive Director, hiring of an asset
    manager, and building related capacity and processes.
    • The project supported the generation of payroll data needed to assess mandated pension contributions.
    • All of the original indicator targets were either fully or materially achieved: individual accounts were established for 99% of public sector
    workers; a management information system was put in place; a complaints redressal mechanism was implemented.
    Outcomes:
    • A new pension system was implemented (in accordance with the National Pension Act).
    • The project helped to create public awareness of the new pension system and achieve high enrollment.
    • The administrative and human capacity developed by the project did not exist in the country before the project and is critical to the
    operation, administration, and oversight of the new pension system. Thanks to this system, Maldives was able to dramatically increase its old
    age pension coverage and therefore old age income security. As such, the attribution of the outcomes to the inputs and outputs financed by
    the project is not in doubt.
    Discussion:
    Overall, the project assisted the government to set up an inclusive and efficient system and platforms for achieving universal old age income
    security via a two-pillar system along with a platform for efficiently administering and targeting other social protection support. Project support
    effectively reformed the previous inefficient system whereby all government workers started earning a pension after 20 years of service
    regardless of whether they still worked. It also established a portable Defined Contribution system that enables workers to move between the
    public and the private sector. The MPAO has become financially sustainable, and (based on the UN Population estimate) over 96% of elderly
    Maldivians received some public old age security benefit in 2014, compared with less than 30% in 2007. Thus, the project has contributed to
    enhanced old age income security in the country.

    Support the implementation of the National Pension Act and strengthen institutional capacity of key agencies responsible for implementing
    the National Pension Act

    Revised Rationale
    The revised objective and indicators expanded on and clarified the original objective in light of the passing of the Pension Act (which
    embodied the new system) but did not materially change them. That said, the scope was expanded at the time of the Additional Financing
    with the addition of payout of accrued pension rights (so-called "Recognition Bonds") for past service for to public sector workers retiring
    during the project period. This section focuses only on this expanded scope.

    Outputs:

        • Payout of accrued pension rights to public sector workers retiring during the project period.


    Outcomes:

        • This target was partially achieved: payouts occurred for those who retired between January 2011 and January 2014, but were suspended and did
        therefore not occur for those who retired between January 2014 and project close in June 2015.



    The rationale and efficiency of IDA financing for the payout of accrued pension rights to retired government workers is complex to analyze.
    This provision had been explicitly considered but rejected by the PAD but was introduced with the additional financing in 2011. The ICR does
    not present much analysis of the efficiency and rationale of financing the transitional "Recognition Bonds." The PAD had rejected this
    activity on what appears to be solid grounds: "While this kind of arrangement might be justified as a one-off payment to help finance the
    transition from an unfunded to a funded arrangement, there does not appear to be justification for it given that the alternative would have
    been to continue paying full salaries to these same individuals. In other words, the introduction of the retirement scheme should, under
    normal circumstances, produce savings. In any case, lending of this type would appear to be budget support rather than project lending." The
    ICR claims that the payments reduce the government's pension obligations and thereby improve its fiscal position, but it does not provide
    information to substantiate this claim. The fiscal impact to the government of the changes would seem to depend on levels of salary and
    pension before and after the reform, something that the ICR does not analyze.
    But, as clearly noted in the ICR, the double pensions and the additional old age allowance introduced in 2013 undermined the government's
    fiscal position, created inequities among different groups of beneficiaries, and eroded the rationale for IDA support. Therefore, a rating of
    modest for this revised objective/targets is given.

5. Efficiency

The internal efficiency of a pension project is hard to assess in the best of situations, and in this case, little information is available. The PAD
correctly argues that this type of project does not lend itself to cost-benefit analysis, but it presents a solid economic rationale -- based in part on
the Bank's extensive prior economic and sectoral work and technical assistance -- for the project's design as a cost-effective way to achieve old-
age income security and administer pension policy. The ICR describes the significant capacity to administer pensions and social assistance that
has been created at a modest cost, including several new agencies and new targeting and accounting systems. The cost of creating this type of
capacity in other projects and countries, would likely be far higher. This ICR Review concurs that the project as designed likely represents a
least-cost way to achieve its objectives.
The ICR presents little analysis of the internal efficiency of the project; instead, it discusses how the project helped improve the efficiency of the
Maldives' social protection system, which is part of the outcome supported by the project and therefore not part of the analysis of project
efficiency.
Assessing -- and even defining -- the "efficiency" of financing "Recognition Bonds" for past service for retired government workers is particularly
complicated from a methodological perspective. The ICR does not present analysis of the ex-ante efficiency of financing the transitional
"Recognition Bonds." These payments are similar to budget support in that they provide support to the government’s fiscal costs of paying out
the Recognition Bonds. Under the harmonized IEG-OPCS guidelines, the efficiency of development policy loans is not rated, and therefore no
rating is provided here for this component.
Implementation efficiency appears to have been substantial, with no issues arising related to financial management or procurement (See
Section 9b and 11b).

6. Outcome

The undermining of the project objective by the government's introduction of double pensions for retired civil servants and many other elderly
complicates the assessment of ratings for this project. This decision affects negatively and substantially the relevance of the project's objectives
and design. As mentioned, the decision was outside the control of the project and the Bank and could not have been foreseen. It is reversible,
meaning that the long-term success of the project remains within reach.

The country has increased its old age income security with the assistance of this project, which created the capacity, processes and platforms for
the administration and delivery of pension and other social protection programs. The project's initially high relevance of objectives and design
were undermined at restructuring by the government's change in policy, reducing revised relevance of objectives and design to modest.
Achievement of the objective to support the country's new pension system was initially high, but reduced to modest under the revised
objectives/scope when payouts for the transitional "Recognition Bonds" were suspended. Support for processes and platforms was highly
achieved across the project's lifetime. Efficiency across the project's lifetime was substantial.

The table below presents the rating calculation resulting in an overall outcome rating of moderately satisfactory.

   Weight                                    14%                                            86%

Applying the split rating formula, the weighting is (.14)(6 = HS) + (.86)(4 = MS) = .84 + 3.44 = 4.28, which rounds to 4. This corresponds to an
overall Outcome rating of Moderately Satisfactory, indicating moderate shortcomings in the project's preparation and implementation.

7. Rationale for Risk to Development Outcome Rating


     A solid infrastructure for pension and social protection administration has been set up and has run well until now. As such, key
     accomplishments of the project are not at high risk, and the increased old age income security achieved by the project will likely remain.

          MV: Pension and Social Protection Admin.(P104743)



     Yet as emphasized in the ICR, the viability and fiscal sustainability of the overall pension system is at significant risk from the parallel
     pension provision by the government that jeopardizes the rationale for the pension Act. However, this decision is reversible. The full
     benefits of this project could still be realized if the government resolves the double pension issue.




a.      Risk to Development Outcome Rating
        Modest


8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Quality-at-Entry
     The project was well prepared. Its design built on international good practice, prior Economic and Sector Work and technical assistance,
     and consultations with all relevant stakeholders. Its structure and indicators were logical with a relevant monitoring and
     evaluation framework. Country-specific issues such as low capacity and human resource constraints were considered. The government’s
     move to parallel pension provision was not reasonably foreseeable.



     Quality-at-Entry Rating
     Satisfactory


b. Quality of supervision
     The Bank provided mostly effective and frequent implementation support. Issues were resolved in a timely manner, and the four
     restructurings were responsive to client needs and demand. Team skills were adequate and included specialized pension systems experts.
     There is no sign that the Maldives as a small country in any way received inferior attention from the Bank.

     The double pension issue was detected and resulted in the eventual decision to partially suspend disbursements. The issue appears to
     have come to the Bank's attention around July 2012, and the Bank team discussed it with their manager and the Country Director. The
     Bank decided to continue the project and maintain dialogue given the recognition among some of the government counterparts that the
     issue needed to be resolved.

     Given the complexity of the political situation at the time it is not obvious that the Bank could have done anything different. It seems to have
     considered (but rejected) suspension of disbursements sooner.



     Quality of Supervision Rating
     Satisfactory

     Overall Bank Performance Rating
      Satisfactory


9. Assessment of Borrower Performance

a. Government Performance
     The government performed well during project design and in the project's early stages, providing an enabling environment for a successful
     project. Over time, its support became less effective, and some decisions, such as the introduction of the double pensions in 2013 for
     political reasons amidst a complex election cycle, undermined the earlier pension law and had adverse consequences for the government's
     fiscal position and workers' incentives. On balance, given the magnitude of the impact of this policy shift, government performance is rated
     moderately unsatisfactory.

       MV: Pension and Social Protection Admin.(P104743)




   Government Performance Rating
   Moderately Unsatisfactory


b. Implementing Agency Performance


    All agreed project activities were concluded, and there was continuity in leadership and competent stewardship of a complicated
    project. The Maldives Pensions Administration Office established policy, set up all the relevant systems needed for
    implementation, and oversaw all aspects of the project implementation. The Project Management Unit hired qualified staff and put in
    place adequate financial management arrangements including accounting, reporting, budgeting and planning, internal controls, funds
    flows, and staffing.




   Implementing Agency Performance Rating
   Satisfactory

   Overall Borrower Performance Rating
    Moderately Satisfactory



10. M&E Design, Implementation, & Utilization

a. M&E Design
   As mentioned, the indicators were clear and reflected well the objectives both before and after restructuring. Institutional responsibility
   and structure for M&E were well established. The introduction of a number of detailed disbursement-linked indicators during restructuring
   appears to have supported project implementation and given impetus to continued policy advance. However, they could not prevent the
   government’s policy reversal on double pensions because magnitude of the incentive that results from the disbursement-linked indicators
   was inadequate.




b. M&E Implementation
   The M&E framework was implemented as envisaged, with data collected and reported in a timely manner.




c. M&E Utilization
   The M&E indicators were used by the Bank's teams during supervision to identify implementation bottlenecks, and the disbursement-linked
   indicators played a key role for project disbursements.




   M&E Quality Rating
   Substantial

             MV: Pension and Social Protection Admin.(P104743)



a. Safeguards
   The original project and additional financing were rated environmental category C. No safeguard policies were triggered and no issues came
   to light. Safeguards issues are often minimal in social protection projects with no physical construction.




b. Fiduciary Compliance
   Financial management (FM) and procurement were handled effectively. FM was rated Satisfactory throughout the life of the project, with
   adequate arrangements for accounting, reporting, budgeting and planning, internal controls, funds flows, and staffing. Quarterly interim
   financial reports were delivered in a timely manner, and external audits were on time (with the exception of the first one) and unqualified.
   Procurement was also rated Satisfactory throughout the project's lifetime. There was a strong Project Management Unit whose staff
   included procurement and financial management specialists and adequate oversight from the Bank to these aspects.

When insufficient information is provided by the Bank for IEG to arrive at a clear rating, IEG will downgrade the relevant ratings as warranted
beginning July 1, 2006.

13. Lessons

The ICR (pp. 24-26) lists five “lessons” or insights that emerge from the experiences of this project. Two of these are echoed here, and a third is
added.

   • Support for complex policy reform, when carefully prepared, can ensure that counterparts are on board once projects become effective. In this case,
   in-depth prior analytical work and technical assistance helped the Bank team prepare a solid project and hit the ground running.

          MV: Pension and Social Protection Admin.(P104743)



     • Disbursement linked indicators may be useful to advance specific regulations, but they provide insufficient leverage to tilt the balance on major policy
     decisions.
     • Given reversals of pension reforms, the Bank would gain from investments in its understanding of the frequency of pension policy reform reversals and
     the factors driving them.




14. Assessment Recommended?

No


15. Comments on Quality of ICR

The ICR is clear and candid. It lucidly articulates complex issues around pension and social protection policy, design, and implementation in
an accessible language with limited use of jargon. Evidence is of adequate quality and is clearly used. The ICR could perhaps have
presented more data on the fiscal implications of the project.
