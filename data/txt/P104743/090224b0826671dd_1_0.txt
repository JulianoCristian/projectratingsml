                         Revised PDO: to support the implementation of the National Pension Act, to strengthen institutional capacity of key agencies responsible for implementing the National
                         Pension Act, and to develop the processes and platforms required for the delivery of social protection programs.

                         under Component C. Lack of progress in these areas are particularly concerning given the critical contribution of the two consultancies to the final deliverables of the project. The
                         delay significantly raises the risk that by the project closing date of June 30, 2015, the two main project outputs might not be fully delivered. The slow progress is also reflected in the
                         project disbursements. By the end of April 2014, about 60% of the total project funds was disbursed, only 4 percentage points higher than six months ago and much lower than the

                         remaining activities and a joint monthly “virtual” review meeting shall be organized between the Bank task team and the implementation teams to closely monitor the implementation

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
Public Disclosure Copy




                         The rating on Project Development Objectives (PDO) is being downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory. Because the PDO is to support the implementation of the MPA, two issues
                         of great concern to the Bank have put the achievement of the PDO in jeopardy. One concern is the continued payment of “double pensions” to civil servants who retired after
                         establishment of the contributory Maldives Retirement Pension Scheme (MRPS) as mandated by the Maldives Pension Act (MPA) 2009. The Bank has raised this issue repeatedly
                         over the past several years as these payments run counter to the spirit of pension reform that this project is supporting. The continuation of the “double pensions” has negative fiscal
                         implications, costing approximately 20 million Rufiyaa additional per month or US$15.65 million per year. The second concern is with the Senior Citizen Allowance (SCA), which was
                         recently introduced and significantly disrupts the Maldives pension system, as established under the MPA 2009. The SCA provides a top-up benefit in addition to the existing Old Age
                         Basic Pension (the non-contributory pension pillar) and undermines the objective of providing only an income floor for old citizens aged 65 and above under that pillar. The SCA also
                         impinges on the pension system’s fiscal sustainability, adding a cost of approximately 41 million Rufiyaa per month or US$26.6 million per year.
