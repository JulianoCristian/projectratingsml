I. Disbursement Profile
1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.      Maldives had made tremendous progress in social, economic, and political
development during the past decades. It had achieved huge success in economic growth
between 1978, when the country was one of the world’s 20 poorest nations, and 2008 when
it almost reached an upper-middle-income status with a per capita income of about
US$5,4301. Furthermore, there had been good progress in human development. The decade
preceding the Project in particular had seen increased literacy, reduced maternal and child
mortality, declining poverty levels, and improvements in access to basic services. The
country also started a complex political transition to a multi-party democracy with a new
constitution. A wide range of reforms were initiated to modernize its governance structure
and to increase and improve service delivery in response to rapid rising demands by
citizens.

2.      While poverty had declined as average incomes had risen, pockets of poverty
remained and a large share of the population was still vulnerable to aggregate and
individual shocks. Challenges posed by shocks could suddenly reduce household income
and consumption. The 2004 tsunami demonstrated the very real possibility of large-scale
loss of incomes and assets, and yet the potential future environmental risks due to global
warming were expected to rise further. The 2007–08 food and fuel crisis was another
external shock that had strong impact. Furthermore, Maldives had begun a demographic
transition as its population was aging. Hence, the government increasingly recognized the
need to build a comprehensive and effective social protection (SP) system to provide
resilience and protect the poor.

3.       Two major deficiencies identified in Maldives’ SP programs were recommended
for priority policy attention 2 . The first one was limited old age security. The existing
pension system was not only limited in its coverage to public sector employees, but also
had several design flaws that could result in sub-optimal retirement income. Both the Civil
Service Pension (CSP) scheme and the Government Provident Fund (GPF) had failed to
cover the vast majority of workers who did not work for the government. Under the CSP,
civil servants received a pension equivalent to 50 percent of base salary after every 20 years
of service regardless of whether they were retired or not. Because there was no requirement
to retire, government employees could continue to work for another 20 years and earn a
second pension, and in a few cases, even a third. Pension benefits were not indexed to
inflation, hence their real purchasing power would decrease over time. The defined benefit
(DB) Pay-As-You-Go design of the CSP scheme made it fiscally unsustainable and
deferred the burden of pension debt of the current generation on future generations.

4.      The second deficiency was inadequate protection provided by the existing social
safety net programs against poverty and vulnerability. Not only did these programs have
extremely low coverage and omit critical vulnerable groups, they also did not appear pro-
poor due to large inclusion and exclusion errors. Only 0.3 percent of the population and
1.6 percent of the poor were covered by recurrent transfers; and total safety net spending
(outside of the tsunami benefit) was 0.2 percent of GDP in 2004, much lower than what
other countries with a similar level of income spent. Therefore, the key objective of
protecting the poor was not being met.

5.      The Government of Maldives (GoM) recognized the urgent need to reform its SP
system and identified multiple strategies and goals to particularly improve the life of the
poor, the disadvantaged and the vulnerable groups in its development agenda3. The Bank
team had been providing technical assistance (TA) in the area of pension reform to a GoM
inter-ministerial task force, which submitted a pension reform proposal in 2005. The
proposal was approved by the Cabinet in late 2006. The final pension reform plan, which
received full support of the new government 4 after 2008 and was later codified in the
National Pension Act, which was eventually passed by the Parliament in June 2009,
separates the redistributive and savings functions in two distinct pillars:
     A new defined contribution (DC) pension scheme would replace current rules under
        the CSP, with the introduction of a retirement age and pension credit for past years
        of service for government employees. Contributions from workers and employers
        would finance this retirement savings scheme. It would, in the long run, be fully
        funded and so avoid the creation of any new liabilities.
     A non-contributory pension scheme (often referred to as a “demogrant”) would pay
        all elderly citizens a basic income support, financed by the general government
        budget. This flat pension benefit would be reduced partially when there is other
        pension income through a mechanism often called a “pension test”.
     While the real value of this non-contributory pension was to remain constant over
        time due to indexation against inflation, continued wage growth would result in a
        higher contributory pension over time. Hence in the long run, most Maldivians
        would rely on the contributory scheme.

6.      Concomitant to the pension reform, the GoM also initiated a program to modernize
its public financial management (FM) and enhance public sector governance. In October
2006, the Government received a grant from the European Union, channeled through the
World Bank as trustee, to partially fund the implementation of an integrated Public
Accounting System (PAS) across the entire government. The PAS includes a human
resource (HR) and payroll module for the entire public service and would enable tracking
of pension contributions for government employees. Payroll data generated through the
PAS would greatly facilitate the contribution collection function of the new DC pension
scheme.

7.      It was in this context that the GoM requested the Bank’s financial assistance to
support the implementation of the pension reform. The intention was to build a robust and
efficient administrative platform for the new pension system and facilitate the
rationalization of the public administration by contributing to a sustainable retirement
scheme for civil servants.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.     The original PDO was to support the establishment of a new pension authority
and the strengthening of capacity at existing institutions of the Recipient to effectively
implement a new pension system and to provide a platform for additional SP
programs.

9.     Key indicators, according to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) main text and
the Financing Agreement were:
    1) Progress in establishing the Maldives Pension Administration Office (MPAO),
       including appointment of the governing board members and the executive director
       and hiring external asset manager(s)
    2) Progress in implementing a new contributory retirement program, measured by the
       number of individual accounts opened and maintained by the MPAO
    3) Progress in implementing a new basic pension scheme, measured by the number of
       new applications processed and payments made as share of the total population over
       the eligible age
    4) Creating public awareness about the new pension system through a public
       education campaign; establishment of public web site of the new pension system,
       and key indicators of the system publicly available
    5) Progress in establishing the supervisory unit for pensions to review reports prepared
       by the MPAO
    6) Generation of payroll data for public employees required for assessing mandated
       contributions for the new pension system

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification

10.      Maldives experienced an economic contraction in 2009, mainly driven by a large
drop in the revenue from its tourism sector. In response to an unsustainable fiscal deficit
of 19.4 percent of GDP in 2009, the GoM embarked on a significant fiscal consolidation
effort supported by external financing from the Bank, the IMF, and the Asian Development
Bank. The government took a series of expenditure-cutting and revenue-boosting measures.
In this context, the GoM requested additional financing (AF) from the Bank to complement
its medium-term fiscal consolidation effort by helping: (a) rationalize social assistance
programs to better target the poor; and (b) partially reduce the transition cost related to
moving from the old unfunded DB scheme to the new fully funded DC scheme. The AF of
US$ 12 million in grant funding was approved on June 2, 2011. It introduced the following
changes: the PDO and the Results Framework (RF) were revised, the scope of the Project



                                             3
was expanded, the implementation arrangements were updated, and the closing date was
also extended to June 30, 2015.

11.     The revised PDO was to support the implementation of the National Pension
Act, to strengthen institutional capacity of key agencies responsible for implementing
the National Pension Act, and to develop the processes and platforms required for the
delivery of SP programs. The National Pension Act (NPA), passed shortly after the
original IDA Credit was approved, provides a comprehensive policy and operation
framework for the country’s new pension system, including the two pension pillars (Old
Age Basic Pension or OABP and Maldives Retirement Pension Scheme or MRPS) and
their key features, the roles and responsibilities of the MPAO, the Capital Marked
Development Authority (CMDA), and the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MoFT), the
governance of the MPAO as well as the rules for administering the MRPS related to
formulating and supervising pension fund investment, collecting contributions, paying
pension benefits, outsourcing asset management and custodian services, and calculating
accrued pension rights of public employees for the instrument called Recognition Bond
(RB). The explicit reference of the NPA in the revised PDO reflects the expanded scope of
the Project after the AF, in particular the financing of pension pay-outs. In addition, the
second part of the revised PDO recognized important new GoM initiatives toward
reforming its health insurance program and putting in place appropriate mechanisms for
determining eligibility for different social assistance programs.

12.     The RF was revised in accordance with the revised PDO and the expanded scope
of the Project. Three original PDO indicators (#2, #3, and #5) were moved to be
Intermediate Outcome (IO) indicators as they reflected more progress in output or IO than
that of PDO. Two new PDO indicators were added to reflect the two new elements of the
increased scope of the AF. The table in Annex 10 provides the details of the changes for
both PDO and IO indicators. The revised PDO indicators were:
    1) New systems under MPAO operational, including the establishment of new office
        of the MPAO, governance structures, Management Information System (MIS), and
        provisions for outsourcing
    2) Increased public awareness about the new pension system
    3) Generation of payroll data for public service personnel used for assessing mandated
        contributions for the new pension system
    4) Development and implementation of information systems and processes for
        targeting, disability administration and health insurance
    5) Payout of accrued pension rights to public sector workers retiring during the project
        period

1.4    Main Beneficiaries

13.    Direct beneficiaries of the project investments were to be: (a) institutions such as
the MPAO, CMDA, MoFT, and the National Social Protection Agency (NSPA), which
would significantly benefit from the technical support, the equipment, and the systems
provided by the Project. The implementation and management capacity of these institutions
was also to be strengthened through trainings for their staff organized and supported by the



                                             4
Project; and (b) the public sector employees retired between January 2011 and January
2014. Their accrued pension rights in the form of RBs were paid in accordance with the
NPA by the GoM, which in turn was reimbursed by the Project. In addition, the current
and future beneficiaries of the pension and social assistance programs indirectly benefit
from the strengthened administration systems built by the Project.

1.5    Original Components

14.     Component A: Strengthening Capacity for Implementing the New Pension
Program (US$3.3 million). This component was to provide TA on policy analysis and
legal/regulatory drafting related to the new pension program and finance the start-up costs
of the new MPAO, including both building capacity of the MPAO staff and developing
administration infrastructure such as the equipment and information systems required for
payroll contribution collection and pension processing. The component had three Sub-
components:
     A.1 - Policy Analysis/Legal Framework. The Project was to provide TA, goods and
        training to the Ministry of Health and Family (MoHF), the nodal ministry for SP
        policies, for the development of: (a) a new pension system, including strategic
        reform planning, fiscal impact analysis, transitional provisions, policy toward
        survivors, disability provisions, and annuities or other forms of benefit withdrawal;
        and (b) a new pension legal framework, including drafting laws, rules, regulations,
        institutional by-laws for the MPAO and other related documents.
     A.2 - Institution and Capacity Building. The Project was to provide TA, goods and
        training to the MoHF to: (a) set up the MPAO, including preparation of the
        MPAO’s departmental and staffing structures, their terms of reference (TOR),
        annual operational budget, and operational instructions; (b) strengthen the capacity
        of new staff; (c) contract external service providers for asset management,
        insurance, and accounting; and (d) provide basic infrastructure, including office
        equipment, furniture, air-conditioning and office hardware. Similar support was to
        be provided to other entities of the Project Technical Committee (PTC) to
        strengthen their capacity to fulfil their responsibilities related to the new pension
        system. The MoFT was to be responsible to phase out existing systems of
        administering pensions and the GPF; the Civil Service Commission (CSC) and
        other public sector institutions were to be responsible for data consolidation to be
        used for the purpose of calculation of individual pension liabilities; and the CMDA
        was to be responsible to establish a supervisory unit for pensions.
     A.3 - PAS. The Project was to provide TA, goods, and training to support the MoFT
        to: (a) implement the PAS within all government agencies; (b) develop and
        implement accounting standards, policies and instructions related to the Public
        Finance Law; (c) strengthen capacity of the staff of the MoFT, line agencies, and
        local government bodies in the use, operation and maintenance of the PAS; and (d)
        develop and implement a HR/payroll system for public employees, including a
        mechanism to track pension contributions.

15.    Component B: Public Awareness Campaign (US$0.5 million). This component
was to finance a public awareness and education campaign to explain the new agency and


                                             5
the new pension system to the general public. TA, goods and training were to be provided
to the MoHF for the design and the implementation of a holistic public information
campaign to improve awareness of the objectives and mechanisms of the new system, in
particular focusing on: (a) employers about their contributory obligations; (b) workers
about their rights and benefits; and (c) senior citizens about the mechanisms for claiming
their basic pension.
1.6       Revised Components

16.   The AF added two new components (D and E) to the Project, in addition to
expanding support for the two original project components (A and B). Also the original
Sub-component A.3 on the PAS was made into a separate component (C).

17.     Component A: Technical Assistance and Capacity Building for Maldives’ New
Pension Program (US$3.4 million). An additional US$ 1.7 million was allocated from
the AF to support additional TA activities in two areas identified based on the first two
years of implementation experience: (a) assisting the CMDA in the establishment of a
supervisory unit for pensions, including drafting rules and regulations pertaining to the
supervision of the pension sector, and the formulation of a strategy and regulations for
developing new and longer-term instruments the pension investments; and (b) defining and
implementing the process of annuitization of pension balances. The other major change
was to shift the responsibilities of a number of operational tasks under the Sub-components
A.1 and A.2 from the MoHF and CSC to the MPAO.

18.   Component B: Public Awareness Campaign (US$0.6 million). An additional
US$0.1 million was allocated from the AF, and there was no other change made.

19.   Component C: Public Accounting System (US$1.8 million). It was made into a
new component because the PAS was administered exclusively by the MoFT and required
renewed focus given its lagging performance of the first two years of the Project.

20.    Component D: Administration of Health Insurance, Disability, and Targeted
Assistance (US$2.0 million). This new component was to address three areas that gained
importance under the new government, and they all were to involve system design, capacity
building, and IT infrastructure. Furthermore, the system development in all the three areas
would be coordinated with improvements in the population registry operated by the
Department of National Registration (DNR) to cross-verify beneficiary identity.
         D.1 - A targeting system. This sub-component was in response to the Government’s
          demand to focus their limited resources on the poor in various government
          programs. The Project was to provide training and capacity building to support (a)
          initial piloting of a new targeting method; (b) development of database management
          specifications and a MIS for targeting; (c) establishment of a system for data
          collection; (d) development of standard operating procedures, manuals and training
          plans for the scale-up of the targeting system; (e) carrying out of outreach
          campaigns, training and capacity building; and (f) development of monitoring and
          evaluation (M&E) systems for the targeting system.



                                              6
         D.2 - Disability coding and benefit administration. This sub-component was to
          provide TA to support the implementation of the Disability Act of 2010 by
          developing disability coding, standard operating procedures, designing a disability
          registry, and administration of cash benefits.
         D.3 - Systems to deliver health insurance. This sub-component was in response to
          the Government’s request for assistance to develop more efficient systems to
          deliver its new health insurance scheme. The Project was to provide support to
          facilitate claims processing, transaction monitoring, fraud control, general MIS,
          and to build capacity at the MoHF.

21.      Component E: Payout of Pension Liabilities (US$8.0 million). This new
component was to finance partially the transition cost that arose when the previously
implicit contingent liability for government employees became explicit through the RBs.
By the time of the AF, the value of the RBs had been calculated for each government
employee and formed part of their individual retirement saving account (RSA) balances.
Under this arrangement, when employees reach retirement age, the GoM is obligated to
transfer the value of the RBs to the workers’ individual RSAs. While the value of the RBs
would decline to zero over time, these payments in the short run posed an additional
challenge to the GoM’s already tight fiscal situation. The Project was to help the
Government partially reduce this cost with grant funding by reimbursing the payment of
the RBs into individual RSAs of those public employees retiring between January 2011
and March 2014. Furthermore, the disbursement was contingent on the satisfactory
achievement of three disbursement linked indicators (DLIs) directly linked with the Project
activities. The three DLIs were: (1) enrollment of workers into the MRPS; (2) electronic
reporting of contributions; and (3) the implementation of key administrative arrangements
for the reform to the pension and SP systems. Thirteen targets were set for the three DLIs
and they are provided in the Annex 11 table. The introduction of the DLIs helped ensure
full and timely implementation of the measures supported by the Project through concrete
and verifiable indicators.

1.7       Other significant changes

22.     The implementation arrangements for the Project were also modified at the AF. The
MPAO took over the role of Project Implementation Agency from the MoHF. The Project
Management Unit (PMU), initially established under the MoHF, was also moved to the
MPAO to facilitate project implementation. While the PMU continued to be responsible
for the FM and procurement activities under all components as well as for coordinating
project implementation with the MPAO, MoHF, and MoFT, both the MoFT and MoHF
each nominated one Project co-Director to manage activities under Components C and D
respectively. Also the Project Steering Committee (PSC), which was originally chaired by
the Minister of the MoHF and included ministerial level representation from the MoFT,
CSC, and CMDA, was restructured to be chaired by a senior representative of the MoFT
and include a representative from the External Resource Management Division of the
MoFT, the Project Director, and two Project co-Directors. Furthermore, the PTC was
regarded as no longer required and its technical coordination role was consolidated under
the PSC.


                                               7
23.     Subsequent to the AF, three Level 2 restructurings were carried out to the Project
in response to the evolving needs of the GoM:

         The 1st restructuring, approved in June 2012, was to expand TA support to the
          strengthening of the national identification system and developing of a biometric-
          based identity authentication mechanism to be used across various governmental
          programs. The responsibility for implementation of Component D activities was
          shifted from the MoHF to the NSPA, which was in charge of administration of the
          national health insurance scheme and most social assistance programs. Lastly, the
          definition of incremental operating costs was revised to allow incentive allowances
          to a small group of civil servants working on core activities of PAS implementation.
         The 2nd restructuring was initiated following the Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the
          Project in March 2013 and approved in February 2014. A number of targets in the
          RF were revised or updated to reflect the progress made as well as the revised
          implementation plan for the remainder of the Project. The DLI matrix was also
          revised to remove two targets for DLI #3 and to add five new targets (one for DLI
          #1 and four for DLI #3). The remaining DLI targets were re-costed and one extra
          payment period (September 30, 2014) was added for the new target associated with
          development policy on unifying the “double pensions” for government employees.
          Lastly, at the request of the GoM, the TA support for the development of a
          biometrics-based identity management system was removed from the Project.
         The 3rd restructuring, approved in May 2015, was to support the development of a
          registry of electricity subsidy beneficiaries, which would enable the Government to
          reform the electricity subsidy program without hurting the poor. A new DLI was
          introduced to finance the development of the registry contingent to the quality of
          the registry being developed.

2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1       Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

24.     Project preparation was built on prior extensive analytical work and policy
dialogues with key government counterparts. The Bank had engaged with the GoM through
a Social Security TA since 2003 and one output was the report titled “Social Protection in
the Maldives: Options for Reforming Pensions and Safety Nets”. The sound and in-depth
analytical work undertaken preceding the Project laid a solid foundation for project
preparation, which was evident from the rather comprehensive information provided in the
Project Concept Note (PCN) and the PAD. Furthermore, project preparation was supported
by a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) 5 , which financed the operations of a core
implementation unit and additional TA needed for the detailed design of the project
components as well as the legal and technical support for drafting of the NPA to ensure


5
 PPF No. Q592 was in the amount of US$1.11 million with an original refinancing date of December 31,
2008. The refinancing date was extended to July 31, 2009.


                                                  8
that its provisions were consistent with international best practices. The Government also
showed its commitment to the reform plan by applying mandatory retirement for the first
time in the country and retiring 1800 public employees in May 2008. The subsequent new
Government had also reaffirmed its commitment to pension reform and had been
shepherding the NPA through Parliament during Project preparation.

25.     Project design took into account a number of lessons learned from Bank operations
in the Maldives as well as from operations supporting pension reform in other countries.
One lesson incorporated into the project design was the need for special attention on local
capacity issues. Hence, the Project was to devote a significant share of financing on TA
and capacity building to strengthen technical expertise within the counterpart agencies.
Many DC schemes in other countries had been implemented without sufficient thought
being given to the efficiency of the collection and record-keeping system resulting in losses
for some members of the scheme and/or higher costs of administration of the system. Also,
this kind of a mandated savings scheme was subject to governance problems when
inadequate attention was given to investment policy formulation. Both issues were
considered highly relevant for Maldives because of its lack of economy of scale and
potential problems in insulating pension fund investment from political pressures. The TA
and system design activities under Component A were carefully planned to address both
concerns. Two other problems often encountered in other countries were with pension
program members: (a) unlike DB schemes, the risks of longevity and investment returns in
such a DC scheme were borne by the members, who need to understand the new system
and readily access information about their pension saving accounts; and (b) the transition
from one type of scheme to another may be difficult to understand and could give rise to
resentment or loss of support for the reform. Component B was designed to ensure basic
understanding of the new system among the general public, communicate to potential
members proactively, and make pension-related information available online as much as
possible.

26.     The project design correctly rejected one component of the Government’s original
request, which was subsequently supported by component E under the AF. It was rejected
by the Bank team because the basic administrative infrastructure and legal framework for
individual RSAs did not exist, which limited justification. By the time of the AF, the
MPAO had established an interim record-keeping and accounting system for individual
RSAs with the rules of the RBs clearly defined and the value of the RBs calculated. So the
Project’s reimbursement of the GoM’s payments made to individual RSAs in redemption
of the RBs would indeed effectively reduce the transition cost over FY11–14. Furthermore,
the DLI approach was introduced into the Bank’s operations only around the time of the
AF. Both the financing of pension benefits and the disbursing of pension pay-outs
contingent on the achievement of a number of implementation performance targets and
reform measures were innovative.

27.     Risks were properly identified and assessed by the project team. Reasonably
specific mitigation measures were proposed and the majority had worked to reduce the
associated risk level. The combination of dedicated procurement and FM officers hired by
the Project, adequate training, and regular oversight by the MPAO and the Bank team were



                                             9
expected to lower the risks from High and Substantial respectively to Moderate. During
the project implementation, neither area ever became a major challenge. Similarly, by
adopting a modern Statement of Investment Policy (SoIP), mandatory use of custodian
service, independent audit, monthly reporting online, and independent pension supervision
by the CMDA, the governance risk related to fund investment indeed appeared to be
reduced. The actual experience of project implementation also validated the original
Substantial risk rating on capacity sustainability due to lack of qualified staff to implement
the reforms in the time frame envisioned under the Project. While the MPAO managed to
retain its qualified and well trained staff, it was very challenging for the MoFT to retain its
core technical staff whose SAP software skills were in high demand in the private sector.
The incentive allowance introduced since 2012 did help, but only partially.

28.     The political risk with regard to change of policy on pension reform turned out to
be more substantial than the initial rating of moderate. While the GoM did proceed with
the proposed pension reform such as establishment of the MRPS and OABP despite its
tightened fiscal space, two unexpected deviations had compromised the new pension
system as per the NPA (more discussion is provided the section below). The mitigation
strategy of active engagement with all the constituencies involved in the policy formulation
process and continued policy dialogue in order to introduce best practices had been
followed by the Bank team, but failed to resolve or prevent either policy change on pension
reform. Because both measures taken by the Government were in direct conflict with the
PDO, the Bank decided to partially suspend the Project in July 2014. In retrospect, the
political risk that the pension reform would not be carried out in its entirety should have
been rated as Substantial.

2.2    Implementation

29.     The Project had a good start with regard to the establishment of the pension legal
and regulatory framework, the new institution (MPAO), and the communication of the new
pension system to potential beneficiaries. By the time of the AF, more than two thirds of
the original Credit had been disbursed. The MPAO was fully staffed and functioning under
a chief executive officer (CEO) and the Governing Board. More than 35,000 public sector
employees had registered individual RSAs and the MPAO could trace and report the
pension contributions and transactions at the individual RSA level. Around 14,000 elderly
65 years old or more were identified and received payment of OABP benefit through their
bank accounts. The CMDA had established a Pension Supervision Department and had
started to draft regulations on pension investment reporting. The PAS modules had been
rolled out to a good number of public sector entities.

30.    The implementation was also supplemented by two Trust Fund supported TAs. The
FIRST initiative, a donor-financed TA fund, had engaged the CMDA parallel to the Project
between 2010 and 2012. Led by the Bank’s Finance & Markets team, the TA had provided
support to the drafting of amendments to the existing legislative framework on capital
market and investment and provided training to the CMDA related to the risk-based
supervision approach. Its recommendations directly fed into the design of the AF, including
formulation of a strategy for new and longer term instruments in the country that would



                                              10
better match the objectives of diversification and the time horizon of pension fund
investments. The Bank team also secured a Rapid Social Response TF grant in 2010 to
support development of a new targeting method. The analytical work produced a two-stage
targeting method, which was adopted by the NSPA and became the foundation for the
targeting system to be implemented under the AF component D.

31.      The AF and three subsequent restructurings responded well to the evolving needs
of the GoM and were used discretely by the Bank team to either address implementation
challenges or fine-tune the project design as better knowledge was gained from project
implementation. For example, to mitigate the risk of longevity (i.e. retirees may outlive
their MRPS pension incomes that would exhaust after a fixed period), the AF supported
the MPAO to define and implement annuitization of the pension balances of individual
RSAs. During the MTR, The Bank team joined the MPAO Board to review the technical
assessment over annuity options, available annuity products and their costs in the country,
and the required regulatory framework. It was agreed that annuitization was costly and
risky, provided by either the MPAO or any life insurance company contracted by the
MPAO, and therefore it was not wise to replace the current phased withdrawal approach
with an annuity product. It was further agreed that the practical feasibility of annuitization
should be re-evaluated every two years by the MPAO Board. Based on this MTR finding,
four targets in the RF (two PDO and two IO indicators) and one target for DLI#3 had to be
revised subsequently because they were set under the initial assumption that annuity
provision was optimal. In a similar manner, several other targets in the RF were updated to
reflect the progress made by the time of the MTR.

32.     Another example is the 3rd restructuring, approved not long before the closing date,
to support the development of a registry for electricity subsidy beneficiary households,
which would enable the GoM to reform its expensive electricity subsidy program. When
the policy reform was conceptualized at the end of 2014, it was clear that the NSPA needed
to re-register every beneficiary who had been receiving electricity subsidies in order to
identify the poor and shield them from any subsidy reform impact. As the Project was to
support the development of a new targeting system, this registry once developed could
become the foundation for the new targeting system. Given the time constraint, the DLI
approach was selected to enable the NSPA to effectively and quickly initiate the
registration drive. By the Project closing, the first two of the three DLI targets had been
achieved. In total, 42,386 registration forms had been received by the NSPA during the
three-month re-registration period, representing 46,392 subsidized domestic meters, and
95 percent of the beneficiary information had been digitized.

33.     One issue that had been challenging to project implementation since the MRPS
became operational is the failure of the GoM to phase out a temporary pension arrangement
in parallel to the MRPS. When mandatory retirement of civil servants was introduced in
2008 according to the Civil Service Act, in anticipation that it would take time to build the
system for the administration of the MRPS under the upcoming Pension Law, the CSC
introduced a transitional pension benefit approximating in nature the old DB provisions.
This temporary arrangement was supposed to be phased out once the MRPS was
operational. However, it continued after May 2010 when the MRPS was fully



                                             11
operationalized, and as a result, civil servant retirees since then have been receiving double
pensions. The Bank team had tried to work out a solution with the involved agencies
including the MoFT and the CSC since then. The 2nd restructuring following the MTR
revised the DLI matrix for component E to explicitly create a new target on development
policy to unify parallel pension schemes to highlight the issue. While the GoM overall did
not take action to unify the schemes even when harmonization options were proposed by
the MPAO, several other institution specific pension schemes were established following
the example of the CSC retirement benefits. According to the Auditor General’s Office,
these parallel pension schemes by various government institutions cost about MVR 270
million per year, equivalent of 0.58 of GDP in 2014, and if left to continue, compromise a
main objective of the pension reform.

34.     Another issue was the Senior Citizens Allowance (SCA) which was introduced in
March 2014 by the incoming President. The SCA was introduced on top of the OBAP and
raised the combined benefit level to MVR 5,000, more than doubling what was stipulated
in the NPA. Maldives ranks No. 1 among all countries in terms of benefit level of non-
contributory pension relative to GDP per capita. Not only does it cost about 1.1% of GDP
when the GoM’s fiscal deficit was already high, but it is expected to affect long term
savings and to discourage workers from participating and making contribution to the
MRPS. Both lack of progress in resolving the “double pensions” issue and the new SCA
indicated a much weakened commitment by the Government to the earlier pension reform
which served as a key rationale for the project; therefore the Bank suspended the
disbursement under Component E in July 2014.

35.     While Components C and D were largely successfully implemented by Project
closing, delays often beleaguered the two components. Component C suffered a stalemate
of over a year after the exit of the vendor which was initially responsible for the HR module.
Multiple changes in leadership at the Treasury and Public Accounting Division, ineffective
communication with stakeholders outside of the MoFT, staff exodus due to the GoM salary
constraints, weak project management structure, and software and hardware issues
associated with operating the SAP system all contributed to delays from time to time. The
implementation of Component D activities only began to accelerate when the new
leadership came on board in 2014. An institutional assessment carried out under the Project
found that the lack of adequate internal capacity to meet the needs of both the
administration of the NSPA programs and of the development activities under the Project
was one main factor contributing to the delays. Subsequently, the NSPA strengthened its
HR capacity considerably during the last year of project implementation and also increased
its capacity-building efforts.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design, implementation, and utilization of M&E are rated as Substantial for reasons
elaborated below.

36.  Design. The original PAD included six PDO indicators and five IO indicators. The
RF was amended at the time of the AF to include five PDO indicators and nine IO



                                             12
indicators (see Table 1). The amended RF was appropriate given the expanded scope of
activities and in reflecting the PDO. Importantly, the AF also included a DLI matrix which
served to track performance against 13 targets across the 3 DLI areas. Therefore, these
indicators should also be recognized as part of the M&E system created to monitor progress
against the reform agenda.

37.     Implementation. Although the number of indicators was extensive, particularly
when taken together with the monitoring of DLI targets, the MPAO did an excellent job in
monitoring and reporting on progress systematically. The MPAO was successful in
establishing a system to collect information that was useful to monitor progress in
achieving Project objectives and outcomes. The monitoring efforts benefited from the
regular updates by the MPAO on their website of the various aspects of the pension
operation. Information on indicators was issued regularly, and reported through progress
reports and reflected in the Bank’s internal Implementation Status and Results Reports
(ISRs).

38.     Utilization. The M&E system under the Project was used not only to measure the
Project’s results in relation to its PDOs but as a management tool to evaluate the overall
progress in reform implementation. The implementation agencies (the MPAO, the NSPA,
and the MoFT) all developed more detailed M&E frameworks to support management
decisions related to their operations.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

39.   The original Project and the AF were rated appropriately as environmental
Category C with no adverse impacts expected.

40.     FM has been rated as Satisfactory throughout the life of the Project, with one
exception at the beginning of project implementation when the first audited financial
statement was not submitted by the PMU in time. The FM arrangements at the PMU,
including accounting, reporting, budgeting and planning, internal controls, funds flows,
and staffing, were considered to be strong throughout implementation. Quarterly Interim
Unaudited Financial Reports were prepared and submitted in a timely manner. External
audits were prepared and audit opinions were issued in a timely manner (except the first
one) and have all been unqualified. The arrangement was also made with regard to the audit
report for 2015 for transactions carried out during the 10 months, including the grace period
of four months.

41.     Procurement was managed effectively by the PMU and has been rated as
Satisfactory throughout the life of the Project. The procurement plan was updated regularly
and when required. Procurement under the Project included goods such as equipment and
consultancy services, both firms and individuals. All procurement tasks, including
preparing procurement documents such as ToR and Request For Proposal, updating the
procurement plan, organizing evaluation committees, and preparing bid evaluation reports,
were carried out diligently. All procurement was completed effectively prior to the closing
date, including delivery and installation of the equipment that was procured.



                                             13
2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

42.     The government is expected to continue the operation of the pension and SP
systems developed under the Project and leverage these systems to make gradual but
important improvements in administration and service delivery in these areas. The
participating institutions strengthened under the Project (the MPAO, the NSPA and the
CMDA) are also committed to making further progress building on significant
achievements made. In addition, the GoM is keen to ensure the sustainability of the
investments made by the Project, including maintenance of equipment and goods. An Asset
Registry was developed by the MPAO and the GoM is making appropriate arrangements
to ensure that equipment is secured and maintained by the relevant institutions. These
arrangements were confirmed in the GoM’s contribution to the ICR in Annex 7.

43.     Additional public finance management reforms, including additional enhancements
to the PAS, are being implemented through a new Bank-financed Public Finance
Management System Strengthening (PFMSS) project, approved in June 2014. The business
planning and consolidation module, which could not be implemented under this Project,
has been taken up by the PFMSS. The activities relate to budgeting reforms to be carried
out through an interactive process working incrementally to improve the process and
budget classification. This work will include program-based budgeting, while working in
parallel to enhance the policy and legislative framework, and capacity building for a more
credible budget.

44.     The President’s Office has recently instructed the MPAO to harmonize the parallel
pension schemes created by various government institutions with the MRPS. Earlier, the
cabinet instructed the MoFT to apply an “income test” to the SCA. In both cases, the Bank
team was invited to provide technical inputs and the Bank team is committed to
continuation of policy dialogue in the overall sustainability of the pension system. The new
registry of electricity subsidy beneficiaries was also reviewed by the cabinet; however the
decision with regard to the application of the targeting system using this registry is yet to
be made.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

45.      Relevance of Objectives. The original and revised PDOs were highly relevant to
the country’s development priorities as it embarked on the: (a) establishment of a new two-
pillar pension system (with both a non-contributory social pension and a funded DC
pension scheme); and (b) development of the required processes and platforms to deliver
various safety net programs. The NPA of 2009 outlined the key features of both pension
schemes (that is, the OABP and the MRPS) and the administration and supervision
institutional structure to implement the two schemes, which the Project was designed to
support. In addition to the NPA, the GoM introduced three other laws during the project
implementation period related to the SP programs: (a) the Disability Act of 2010 to guide
disability related programs such the disability allowance; (b) the National Social Health



                                             14
Insurance Act of 2011 to guide the administration of the universal health insurance
program; and (c) the Social Protection Act of 2014 to guide the administration of all SP
benefits and services except for pension, health insurance, and disability. The Project’s
support to the development of systems for disability administration, targeting in social
assistance programs, and health insurance administration and monitoring made significant
contributions to the operationalization of those laws. The Project’s objectives were aligned
with a central part of the Country Assistance Strategy for 2008-2012 and the Interim
Strategy Note for FY2014-16 to ensure an effective and efficient SP system as a key
element of public service reform.

46.     Relevance of Design. The Project’s original design tracked with its objectives
through its components and the RF. The main goal was to set up the pension authority and
to provide capacity building to its staff to implement the new pension system. The revised
Project design at the 2011 AF essentially added two components: (i) Component D
reflected the GoM’s request to develop systems for targeted social assistance benefits,
disability administration, and health insurance administration; and (ii) Component E was
to finance the payment of the RBs in the individual RSAs of the cohorts of the public
employees retiring during FY2011-2014 under the MRPS. There was adequate justification
for financing the RBs because it helped to reduce the transitional cost of the pension reform,
which arose as those cohorts would not have accumulated balances sufficient to achieve
the target pension levels when moving from the previous unfunded DB scheme to the new
DC scheme (that is, the MRPS) and allowed the former CSP to be shut down. In addition
to being relevant to the overall reform effort, the design of this component further
reinforced the reform by requiring the disbursements were to be made against agreed
benchmarks (that is, the DLIs), which aimed to further advance implementation of the new
pension system.

47.      However, while the Project’s relevance of the revised objective and of the design
remained high in terms of supporting the NPA, both have been weakened by changes in
policy towards pensions, specifically the “double pensions” issue and the SCA which were
inconsistent with the new pension system stipulated by the NPA and contradicted the
pension reform which the Project was proposed to support. While there has been broad
agreement with the MoTF on the need to harmonize the double pension with the MRPS,
by the project closing date (i.e. June 30, 2015), no action had been taken in this area. The
SCA also puts into question the Maldives’ pension system design as legislated in the NPA
and jeopardizes the stability of MRPS. The high benefit level of the social pensions likely
discourages self-employed worker from participating in the MRPS and formal sector
workers from making contributions to the MRPS. Therefore, while the Project objectives
are still relevant in the long-term, their relevance is diminished by the two deviations.
Likewise, the notion of financing RBs given the current circumstances became unjustified.
As a result, the disbursement under Component E of the Project was suspended. The fiscal
implications of the “double pensions” and the SCA are large. Balancing the importance of
building administrative systems against the centrality that these two issues play in the
overall design of the new pension system and their fiscal impact at the time of project
closure, the relevance of the Project during the last two years has to be downgraded to




                                             15
Modest. It should be noted that both issues were pension policy changes outside of the
control of this Project.

48.     Relevance of Implementation. The implementation approach under the Project was
Substantial. Much needed TA was provided to develop the key legislative and regulatory
framework, to help train staff, and to develop operational supporting systems for the
pension administration and supervision authorities. Likewise, the NSPA also received
technical support to strengthen its institutional capacity and develop the necessary
processes and systems to strengthen its implementation capacity to carry out disability
administration, national health insurance, and targeted social assistance programs. The
MoFT, through the PAS component, also benefited from the capacity building and the roll-
out of a HR/payroll module for public employees (among others), including a mechanism
to track pension contributions.

3.2        Achievement of Project Development Objectives

49.     Maldives has dramatically increased its old age security from 2007 to the present.
In 2007, less than 30% of elderly Maldivians had access to any kind of publicly provided
old age security. By 2014, more than 96%6 of the elderly were receiving some public
benefit. As of 2014, 54% of the working age population, population between the ages of
15 and 64, were contributing to the new pension system, much higher than countries like
Korea and Malaysia where only about a third of the working age population is making
contributions. The high rate of participation indicates a high degree of confidence from the
population and represents a far cry from the previous system where only civil servants and
a few formal sector workers were covered in fragmented systems. The new pension system,
for which the project provided implementation support and institution building, combines
all contributors in a single national system which is designed to be fiscally sustainable in
the long run. A third achievement, also partially attributable to the project is relative
efficiency which has allowed the new system to keep administrative costs low, allowing
Maldives to rank among the lowest third of countries in terms of administrative costs in
defined contribution systems. While the project did not directly address policy issues, it
helped the country develop the institutional capacity to implement the policy reforms that
the country adopted.

50.    The achievement of the PDOs (both original and revised) is assessed in Table 1,
which shows that the majority of targets were achieved (86 percent either achieved or
overachieved) against original and revised targets. Only PDO indicator #5 and IO indicator
#1 were partially achieved, which both relate to the failure by the GoM to effectively
harmonize the parallel pensions with the MRPS by the time of project closure. One part of
IO indicator #1 required that amendments be made to relevant laws to unify parallel
pension systems and rationalize benefits. It was added in the 2nd restructuring following
the MTR’s recommendation that the Government take appropriate steps to resolve the
“double pensions” issue. When the combination of the lack of progress in the “double
pensions” issue and the introduction of SCA triggered the partial suspension of

    The ratio is estimated using the UN Population estimate for 65+ population in the Maldives.


                                                      16
disbursements, which prevented the completion of the payout of accrued pension rights
(PDO indicator #5), the payouts against the last 2 DLI targets for the public employees
retiring between March and September 2014 were not made. However, the payout was
completed for all earlier periods, with 13 of the 15 DLI targets met, and the Government
has continued paying the RBs without disruption.

51.     Although project objectives were formally revised, the revised PDO only expanded
upon the original, clarifying the intent of the Project to continue to support the introduction
and roll-out of the new pension scheme and to provide additional support for the
development and delivery of other SP programs. Likewise, the targets under the revised
indicators subsumed those of the original. Hence, in this particular case, the analysis of
achievement of PDOs relies on the revised objectives, as follows:

         PDO 1: Support the implementation of the National Pension Act to strengthen
          institutional capacity of key agencies responsible for implementing the National
          Pension Act. The Project successfully supported the implementation of the NPA
          through: (a) the establishment of a new pension system with two pillars – the OABP
          and the MRPS; (b) the expansion of coverages – the OABP having covered all
          elderly aged 65 and over and the MRPS having covered all formal sector workers
          and started to expand to self-employed workers on a voluntary basis; (c) the
          establishment of the MPAO as the nodal institution to administer the MRPS and
          the OABP, develop standards, regulations, and guidelines related to the schemes,
          and manage pension funds; (d) the establishment of the Pension Supervision
          Department in the CMDA to supervise the MRPS pension fund investments and
          the custodian service; (e) capacity building for the MPAO, the CMDA, and the
          MoTF by developing/modernizing their information systems and training their
          staff; and (f) continuous public information campaigns that have improved the
          awareness of the new pension system among general public. The MPAO’s excellent
          performance has enhanced public confidence in the new pension system through a
          strong governance framework, a transparent reporting and complaint redressal
          mechanism, a client-centered service model, and a skilled and motivated staff. It is
          important to underline that the MPAO became financially sustainable by the end of
          2014, ahead of schedule, and has planned to develop innovative mechanisms to
          bring additional value to the members of the MRPS.
         PDO 2: Develop the processes and platforms required for the delivery of SP
          programs. The Project successfully supported: (a) the establishment of a targeting



                                               17
       system, the development of disability administration standards and processes, and
       the formulation of the Integrated Health Information System requirements and the
       corresponding Unified Data Framework; (b) the development of the Social
       Protection Information System (SPIS), the Registry of electricity subsidy
       beneficiaries, and a health insurance monitoring system; (c) the strengthening of
       the IT infrastructure for the NSPA to manage all its programs on one platform and
       to cross-verify beneficiary identity with the DNR, and equipping all level one
       government hospitals for better administration of health insurance; and (d) capacity
       building for the NSPA, including setting up a training facility. Before the closing
       date, the NSPA carried out systematic physical verifications of the existing
       beneficiaries of the Single Parent Allowance and the Disability Allowance schemes
       in Malé and found about 40 percent of them very likely not eligible any more.
       Hence the NSPA has started to discontinue benefit payments to these beneficiaries
       unless they reapply and prove their situation. The Registry of electricity subsidy
       beneficiaries has been developed with adequate information to enable better
       targeting of the limited resources to the poor for all social assistance programs.

52.     On the basis of overwhelming achievement of targets against the PDO and IO
indicators (as demonstrated above and detailed in the analysis of the project RF in the
datasheet), the overall efficacy is rated as Substantial. In addition, it should be noted that
the majority of the DLI targets were also achieved (total of 16 out of 18 DLIs targets). The
five quantitative targets for DLI #1 measuring the enrollment of workers into MRPS were
achieved. So were the four quantitative targets for DLI #2 measuring the percentage of
employers reporting contributions electronically. As for DLI #3 on implementation of key
administrative arrangements for the reform to the pension and SP systems, five milestones
were achieved, including regulations on participation of foreign workers, regulations on
participation of self-employed in the MRPS, online access of individual RSAs, the MPAO
MIS fully operational, and the strategy for disability insurance provision under the MRPS.
The only milestone unachieved was development of policy on unifying parallel pensions
for public employees. The last Project restructuring introduced DLI #4 with three targets
to support the government’s initiative in developing a registry of electricity subsidy
beneficiary households. The three DLI targets measured the extent of the re-registration
process and digitization of beneficiary information. Two of the three targets were met
before the closing date.

3.3    Efficiency

53.     The Project’s efficiency is considered as Substantial. As established in the original
PAD, it is imprudent to estimate the net present value or the economic rate of return for the
impact of introducing a new pension system. Rather the contributions of the Project are
derived from improving cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the Maldives pension and
other SP programs through developing or upgrading administration processes and systems
for better use of public resources. As the GoM has been re-distributing a large share of
government revenues for equity and inclusion purposes, the potential gain from an
efficiently and effectively operated SP system is likely significant.




                                             18
54.     Compared to the pre-reform pension system (that is, the CSP and the GPF), the new
pension system that this Project has supported to establish has brought at least four direct
benefits. For the first time, workers outside of government employees are covered by the
MRPS. The effective coverage has quadrupled from about 28,000 under the CSP in 2004
to 118,000 under the MRPS in 2015. Furthermore, as a uniform and portable scheme, the
MRPS is expected to facilitate labor mobility between the public sector and the private
sector and between formal and informal sectors. It is also more cost-effective for the GoM
as a mechanism to pay government employees a pension than the previous CPS. By design,
the MRPS is a fully funded DC scheme and the government’s liability is clearly defined
by its contribution rate like any private employer and there is no hidden unfunded liability,
which will help the GoM’s long term fiscal sustainability. The investment needs of the
MRPS pension funds can greatly support the country’s financing needs for its economic
development as long as the capital market can be further developed through innovation in
product structuring and financial intermediation. The universal OABP benefit has
effectively set an inflation-proof income floor for Maldives’ elderly aged 65 or above to
ensure a modest living standards. The “claw back” mechanism related to other pension
incomes has also helped to reduce the financial cost of the OABP program. The new
targeting system developed for NSPA can potentially save the GoM significant amount of
government spending as it was evident from the results of the physical verification drive
carried out in Malé on two social assistance programs.

55.     The Project has also supported the development of institutional and administrative
capacity of the MPAO, the MoFT and the NSPA to efficiently carry out their
responsibilities. The information systems developed for the MPAO’s pension
administration, for the government-wide PAS, and for the NSPA’s targeted social
assistance programs have fundamentally changed how those administration tasks are
carried out and both government officials and clients have benefited from easier access to
accurate information. The Project’s financing of TA and the implementation of viable
systems (pension and social protection) were critical to supporting the related legislations
and new Government mandates. Therefore, the use of Bank financing to advance these
goals was efficient from both technical and operational points of view. The decision to
finance recognition bonds was also deemed to be productive and sustainable as these
payments were meant to improve the overall Government fiscal position by reducing its
pension obligations. However, as discussed in the earlier section, the continuing payment
of “double pensions” and top-up of the SCA, poses a danger to the fiscal position of the
Government, and undermined the benefits of the Bank’s financing.

56.     The Project was also efficient with regard to its implementation. The original
Project was well on its way to completion by the time the AF was approved in 2011. The
implementation of the AF was equally efficient, adding three years to the original period.
The Project, since the AF, was implemented in accordance with that original timetable,
with a few delays related to the implementation of Components C and D. But these were
eventually overcome, particularly in the last year of implementation through effective steps
taken by the NSPA and the MoFT and supported by the Bank team. Considering that the
Project supported the establishment of entirely new systems in response to the new
legislations, the Project was particularly effective in achieving its objectives. The original



                                             19
Credit was fully disbursed, and the AF Grant was 87% disbursed7, when including the
suspended funds under component E. If excluding the suspended amount of about US$ 1.45
million, which accounts for close to 14% of the Grant fund, the Grant disbursement rate
would be 95%. Therefore, efficiency of implementation is considered as substantial.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

59.     While the Project was not explicitly classified as a poverty-targeted intervention,
some aspects of the Project have had a positive impact on the poor. The Project contributed
to positive impacts for the poor, particularly through the support for the establishment of
the OABP to eliminate the elderly poverty and support for targeting the provision of social
assistance allowance for single parents, foster parents, and disability programs, as well as
the electricity subsidies. The Project supported the development of targeting options and
processes, which included both cross verification of income and a proxy means test (PMT)
poverty score calculation.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

60.     The Project has strengthened significantly the institutional capacity of the MPAO,
CMDA, NSPA, and MoFT as well as the capacity of management and staff to carry out
their responsibilities. Each institution is much better equipped to carry out its functions,
and the MPAO and NSPA are able to provide better services to their clients. The MPAO
MIS, the SPIS, and various PAS modules have greatly modernized the operation of the
MPAO, NSPA, and MoFT, respectively. Training provided under the Project has also
strengthened the knowledge and skill of key staff of these institutions to perform better in
their jobs at their respective positions.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

n.a.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

n.a.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

61.     The risk to development outcome is considered to be Substantial. While there is
negligible risk to some elements of the new pension system, for example, the MPAO and
CMDA’s pension supervision role as well as the MRPS, the risk to the pension system as
a whole is substantial. The Auditor General’s special Audit Report on parallel pensions,
issued in February 2015, concluded that “should the current pensions and benefit
arrangements of the State be left to continue as practiced, it defeats the very aim of pension
reform, a fully funded defined contribution pension system where the State’s liability is
defined and funded as envisaged in the Pension Act”. The Project’s achievements,
therefore, may be jeopardized.

62.    However, there is also a reason for conservative optimism. The MoFT has been
very cognizant of the detrimental effect that both the double pension issue and the SCA are



                                             21
having on the fiscal space, and actions will be taken to resolve them. For example, an
income-testing eligibility condition for receiving the SCA was proposed in May 2015. With
respect to the “double pensions” issue, the President’s Office has instructed the MPAO to
harmonize the parallel pensions with the MRPS. The Bank team will closely monitor the
development in this area and is committed to assist the Government in the resolution of
this issue.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance
(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

63.      The Project preparation team ensured that the Project design was built on the
previous extensive analytical and advisory work provided by the Bank to Maldives’
pension reform agenda and closely aligned with the Maldives’ own 7th National
Development Plan and the Bank’s FY08–12 Country Assistance Strategy. The design: (a)
was appropriate to address the major deficiencies identified; (b) selected a set of relevant
activities that were clearly linked to objectives that the Project intended to achieve and
applied lessons drawn from the implementation of similar pension reforms in other
countries; and (c) was based on a highly consultative preparation process with a wide range
of stakeholders, which helped the pension agenda keep the momentum even after the new
government took office. Anticipating the needs to build capacity and to provide technical
support to ensure that the provisions of the new pension were consistent with international
best practices, a PPF of US$1.1 million was created before the Project became effective.
The preparation team also identified appropriate risks and incorporated design and
implementation measures to mitigate them to the extent possible. For example, one
political risk highlighted in the PAD was indeed the temptation to increase the basic
pension level. When the SCA was introduced as one key presidential campaign promise,
there was little that the Project could do to prevent it.

(b)    Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

64.     Overall, the Bank team provided sound supervision throughout implementation and
actively engaged with the project counterparts in identifying issues related to project
implementation as well as effective solutions and providing needed support to the GoM.
There were twelve Bank implementation support and supervision missions, including a
MTR. The same Bank team (under joint team leadership) since the early preparation stage
also prepared the AF. A new task team leader took over before preparing the MTR and
stayed until the project closing. The team skills mix was appropriate, comprising of Bank
staff based in Washington D.C., Colombo, and New Delhi. The proximity of some key
team members allowed for quick on-demand discussions particularly useful for operational
issues. In addition to formal implementation supervision missions, several technical
missions and numerous informal meetings and exchanges were carried out to keep the Bank
team closely involved and to monitor implementation progress on the ground.



                                            22
65.      As demonstrated by the AF in 2011 and the three subsequent restructurings, the
Bank team was highly responsive to client needs and showed flexibility in adapting to
evolving priorities to meet the PDO and to best assist the GoM counterparts. Equally, the
team was diligent in their communication with the MPAO, NSPA, and other participating
institutions as well as with the Bank management. The team provided up-to-date
information and analysis on the status and impact of project activities, issues encountered,
and options to address issues as they arose. Following the introduction of the SCA in early
2014, the team concluded that it represented a significant reversal of the pension reform
policy that the Project was designed to support and recommended that the Bank suspend
the disbursement under Component E. It was a difficult, but correct decision, with which
the Bank sent a strong indication of its concern on the direction of Maldives’ pension
reform. Even under the circumstance, the team still offered technical inputs on potential
options that may reduce the negative impact of the increase in benefit level. During the
ICR discussions, the MPAO acknowledged that the Bank team was proactive in supporting
the MPAO to identify options related to project implementation challenges. The GoM
eventually made the decision to harmonize the parallel pension schemes with the MRPS
four months after the project closing.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

66.    Based on the analysis above, the overall Bank performance is rated Satisfactory.

5.2    Borrower Performance

   (a)    Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67.     While the Government’s performance during project preparation and early
implementation was satisfactory, its performance during the second half of project
implementation was not. Initially, the government clearly committed to the pension reform
agenda and made strong efforts to create an enabling environment for the Project to take
off. In addition to the passage of the NPA, both the high level PSC and the operational
level PTC were functioning well with regard to making project implementation related
decisions and coordination. Indeed impressive progress had been made on implementation
of the new Pension Law by the time of the AF. However, coordination and decision-making
became less effective over time, particularly when there were different opinions between
key stakeholders, including the MoFT, CSC, MPAO, and President’s Office, on the two
issues. Also both the NSPA and the Treasury and Public Accounting Division of the MoFT
underwent multiple leadership changes during project implementation, which resulted in
slower-than-expected progress. More importantly, the change in government yielded
decisions on policy in the last two years which were often inconsistent with the rationale
for pension reforms that underpinned the project. On balance, considering the history of
the Government’s commitment and support to the Project during the life of the project, the
overall rating for Government performance is Moderately Satisfactory.




                                            23
(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

68.     The performance of the MPAO since its establishment in 2010 was Highly
Satisfactory. Management and staff of the MPAO were deeply committed to the goals of
the pension reform and were vigilant in implementing the provisions of the NPA. The
MPAO has had one CEO since its establishment, which was crucial to developing policy,
establishing systems and operations and in general to guiding the implementation of the
project. The MPAO Board has functioned effectively, as did all the MPAO’s departments.
The MIS is fully operational and its website has provided individual members online access
to their own PSA and public pension scheme operation information. Since the beginning
of 2015, the MPAO has managed to become financially independent even after reducing
its management fee. To advance the resolution of the pension issues discussed above, the
MPAO took proactive steps and prepared a technical paper outlining options to resolve the
“double pensions” issue.

69.     The MPAO also maintained the PMU throughout the project implementation period.
The achievements by the Project reflect the strong efforts by the PMU to coordinate among
all related institutions. The PMU Director and co-Directors built and maintained productive
relationships among the different institutions involved in this project and continually
briefed the Bank team on progress in implementation. The PMU produced regular semi-
annual reports and submitted financial reports on time. As a result, project management
and coordination was consistently rated as Satisfactory during the entire project duration
in the Bank’s ISRs. The PMU’s continuing and strong commitment was demonstrated in
that all agreed activities were completed, including the preparation of the Government’s
own ICR.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

70.    This evaluation rates the overall Borrower’s performance as Moderately
Satisfactory for reasons elaborated above.

6.     Lessons Learned

71.     A TA project designed to assist a country in implementing pensions and SP policy
performs best when it follows in-depth analytical work. In this case, the project followed
substantial technical assistance provided to the Government since 2003 which led to a
pension reform proposal in 2005 from an inter-ministerial task force and full Cabinet
approval in late 2006. Despite a change in Government, the NPA was passed in June 2009.
By the time the project was ready to begin, the groundwork was clear, and the project had
relatively clear implementation goals. Of course, new challenges emerge in the course of a
project which require adjustment, but having an initial strategy allowed the project to hit
the ground running.

72.    A second lesson learned is that an investment project, like this one, cannot be
expected to prevent adverse policy decisions from being taken, even when they ultimately



                                            24
affect the objectives of the project. Despite the best intentions of the Bank team and
counterparts, Governments can change priorities in the course of project implementation.
In this particular case, the Government has remained generally committed to the pension
reform and SP priorities that it had originally set, but it also added additional benefits like
the SCA as a result of promises made during the election campaign. The additional costs
threaten to undermine the overall fiscal sustainability of the pension program, which now
includes this SCA. Similarly, despite the original intention of phasing out the temporary
pension arrangement after the MRPS became operational, the Government chose to
provide for MRPS while continuing the parallel pension schemes for government
employees. Both of these actions were not based on technical analysis. An investment
project needs to consider political risks and be prepared to make adjustments as early as
possible in response to policy changes.

73.      A third lesson relates to the innovations in the program and its ambitiousness. This
was the first operation in the Bank supporting pension reform, using DLIs. The operation
attempted to use the DLI methodology to encourage the Government to pass the necessary
regulation or legislation that would unify the parallel pensions with MRPS for public
employees. As noted above, the Government did not follow through on these measures
before the Project Closing. The lesson is that the individual disbursements in a DLI based
operation may not be large enough to provide enough leverage to encourage the
Government to undertake what may be politically difficult policy changes. Pension policy
itself is often so politically charged that even large Development Policy Loans sometimes
do not provide sufficient leverage to promote policy change, so it is unsurprising that the
smaller amounts associated with this DLI were insufficient to change decision-making that
reversed aspects of the country’s pension reform. At the same time, the team’s sustained
engagement, including through use of DLIs, over time has proven likely to bring about
positive policy changes, though these will occur after Project Closing.

74.      This Project’s DLI experience provided additional practical lessons to be
considered when setting DLIs: (a) DLI targets are most effective for supporting the
implementation of policies and strategies; (b) due dates for DLI targets should be “floating”,
i.e. targets can be met anytime during implementation, for projects, as this one, whose
targets are more qualitative in nature; (c) the DLI matrix should be constructed carefully
to reflect the implementation timetable, with each successive DLI target building on
previous progress; (d) a strong M&E system is particularly critical for the success of
operations with DLIs; and (e) the use of DLIs can be an excellent approach for AF, as was
in this case, financing critical program expenditures administered through new systems and
arrangements built under the original TA project.

75.     Lastly, suspension, while seldom used, can be an effective instrument, even in DLI-
based operations, in highlighting the critical importance of abiding by the mutually agreed
set of actions and principles as reflected in the negotiated Financing Agreement between
the Bank and Governments. In this case, the suspension of disbursements against two
remaining DLI targets was the appropriate response to the two deviations by the
Government from the overall pension reform agenda supported by the Bank. This decision
was effective in that the Bank remained committed and flexible to enable the Government



                                              25
to take corrective steps. The Bank team provided an extension of the suspension period
without a cancellation which was a novel and ultimately effective approach as evidenced
by the recent Government decision to address the “double pensions” issue.

7.     Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)    Borrower/implementing agencies

76.     Management and staff contacted by the ICR mission commented positively on the
role the Project has played in helping implement the new pension system as well as the SP
schemes. The GoM has provided its contribution to the ICR (annex 7) and will review and
provide comments on the draft ICR.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component A: Technical Assistance and Capacity Building for Maldives’ New Pension
Program (total actual cost of US$ 3.2 million)

1.      This component was designed to support mainly two areas - policy analysis and
legal framework for Maldives’ new pension system and build institutional capacity to
operationalize the new pension system.

2.      Technical advisory services and training were provided under the Project (initially
through a PPF) to support the development of a new pension system, including strategic
reform planning, fiscal impact analysis, and a new pension legal framework, including final
draft of the NPA. A significant amount of TA was provided to assess fiscal implications of
various design options and governance issues, taking into account international best
practices. It was also critical to explain the technical nuances to all stakeholders, including
the parliament members and private sector employers, to build consensus on the overall
shape of the new pension system. Two amendments to the NPA were also made to
strengthen the governance of the MRPS and clarify requirements of participation of foreign
employees.

3.      Following the enactment of the NPA in 2009, TA, goods, and training were
provided to the MoHF for the establishment of the MPAO and subsequently to the MPAO
to build its capacity and operational framework to administrate both the MRPS and OABP,
including institutional by-laws, regulations, policies toward survivors, disability, and
annuities, and operation procedures and manuals. The specific outputs include the
following:
     The MPAO had been established as an autonomous organization according to the
        NPA, operating under a CEO and the Governing Board.
     The MPAO has been fully staffed with its staff well trained to serve the operations
        needs of the MRPS and OABP.
     The MPAO is fully functional with all the required rules, regulations, business
        processes, and operation manuals related its responsibilities, including contribution
        collection, reconciliation of payments and reports, inspection on compliance
        enforcement, tracking and allocating investment income, strategy for application of
        unique identifier, producing management reports, and IT system procurement and
        implementation.
     The MPAO has developed a robust record-keeping information system that is
        capable of supporting all MRPS administrative processes, including unitization,
        digital declaration of contributions by employers, and online reporting to members.
     With assistance from other government institutions, the MPAO has registered all
        public employees, consolidated the historic employment data, and set up their
        individual RSAs with accurate accrued rights in the form of RBs.
     The MPAO has managed to open 118,691 unique individual RSAs by the project
        closure, representing about 57 percent of the population aged 20 to 64 years in the
        Maldives, and has reached full coverage of formal sector workers.




                                              28
      Jointly with the MoFT, the MPAO has drafted and implemented the regulations for
       voluntary participation of the MRPS by self-employed workers (with matching
       contribution by the GoM) and foreign workers.
      The MPAO has put in place a phased withdrawal approach for pension payments
       for retirees under the MRPS and has been exploring annuitization options.
      The MPAO has managed to identify and pay 16,125 elderly aged 65 and older under
       the OABP scheme by the project closing and also applied the “claw-back”
       mechanism whenever any recipient also received the MRPS pension income.
      In addition to the MRPS and OABP, the MPAO has managed the payment of all
       other government-funded pension schemes.
      The MPAO’s website (http://www.pension.gov.mv/) has been extensively used for
       member services (for example, online access to individual RSA) and public
       information disclosure (for example, pension scheme statistics).
      The MPAO has so far managed the MRPS investment portfolios in-house
       according to the SoIP adopted by its Governing Board and put in place guidelines
       and procedures, measurable investment objectives, performance appraisal of asset
       managers, custodians and reporting mechanisms, and evaluation of performance
       benchmarks on asset classes and portfolios.
      The MPAO has carried out both on-site and risk-based employer contribution
       compliance inspections.
      The MPAO has become financially independent in 2015 and has reduced its
       management fee to 0.9 percent while adding provision of disability insurance to the
       MRPS members at no cost.

4.     This component also provided TA support to assist the CMDA in building capacity
to supervise the MRPS. The specific outputs include the following:
      The CMDA has established a new Pension Supervision Department
        (http://www.cmda.gov.mv/pension/about-pension-supervision/), established the
        regulation with regard to custodial services and the reporting requirements for the
        MRPS funds, and routinely carried out on-site inspection of the custodial
        operations for the MRPS funds and assessment of the performance of the MRPS
        investment assets.
      The CMDA has drafted the Central Depository Bill and the Securities Act
        Amendment Bill, identified a number of inconsistencies among the existing laws
        and regulations related to Maldives’ capital market, formulated a strategy for
        developing new and longer-term instruments in the country to expand the volume
        and the diversity of quality investment instruments available on the Maldives
        capital market, and drafted guidelines with respect to new product development
        such as venture capital fund.
      The CMDA has sponsored an assessment of Maldives Stock Exchange’s business
        processes and recommendations for system modernization.
      The CMDA has sponsored a system readiness audit on the MPAO’s IT
        infrastructure and MIS and found the MPAO’ system to be at an acceptable level
        with regard to its integrity and security.
      The CMDA has conducted a financial capacity study to gauge the Maldivians’
        knowledge and behavior related financial dealings.


                                            29
Component B – Public Awareness Campaign (total actual cost of US$0.4 million)

5.      This component was designed to support the MPAO to design and implement a public
information campaign to improve awareness of the new pension system among three targeted
groups –employers (focusing on their contributory obligations), workers (focusing on their rights
and benefits), and senior citizens (focusing on the processes of applying for basic pension and
receiving payment).

6.       During project implementation, the MPAO had conducted 486 targeted information
sessions, which were attended by 32,999 people. These information sessions were carried out in all
atolls and in locations, where large number of people congregated such as resorts and colleges. In
addition, the MPAO had leveraged mass media such as TV, radio, and media briefing sessions (320
times) as well as newspaper articles and news websites (267 pieces) and sponsorship of public
events to raise awareness. Also two pension awareness surveys were carried out, first one at
inception in 2010 and the second at the end of project implementation.

Component C: Public Accounting System (total actual cost of US$ 1.97 million)

7.       This component was designed to modernize the GoM’s PAS across government agencies
by strengthening capacity of the staff of the MoFT, line agencies, and local government bodies in
the use, operation, and maintenance of the PAS, and supporting the MoFT in the development and
implementation of a payroll system for public employees, including a mechanism to track the
pension contributions. The specific outputs include the following:
     The MoFT has installed and operationalized a PAS application software, and associated
         hardware, networking, and related supporting services.
     The MoFT has upgraded its SAP system from version ECC 6.0 to the latest version EHP
         7.0, required to generate an International Public Sector Accounting Standards cash-
         compliant financial statement, and for the first time such a statement was produced for
         FY14.
     The MoFT has established a reliable record-keeping system for budget execution
         monitoring, and as a result, daily budget availability could be generated by the system
         automatically.
     The HR/payroll module has been rolled out to 95 percent Malé based public agencies as
         well as four non-Malé based agencies.
     The Materials Management module has been rolled out to nearly 70 percent of Malé based
         agencies.
     The core PAS team in the MoFT has been trained to operate and maintain the SAP system.

Component D: Administration of Health Insurance, Disability, and Targeted Assistance
(actual cost of US$1.72 million)

8.       This component was designed to support the NSPA in developing a targeting system,
developing a disability benefit administration system, and developing systems to deliver health
insurance through the Project financed TA for system design, capacity building and IT
infrastructure. The specific outputs include the following:

       The NSPA has adopted a targeting system that combines both the income-test and a PMT
        method and has field-tested in two atolls and Malé.




                                               30
      The NSPA has developed the SPIS, which serves multiple NSPA social assistance
       programs, including single parent and foster parent allowances, disability benefits,
       electricity subsidy, and medical welfare programs.
      The NSPA has built a reliable IT infrastructure to host the SPIS and its own website
       (http://nspa.gov.mv/) and it has developed a cross-verification protocol with the DNR’s
       national ID database.
      The NSPA has re-registered more than 50,000 electricity subsidy beneficiary households
       and has planned to make this registry into a unified social registry for all SP programs;
      The NSPA has strengthened its HR level and developed a staff skills development plan
       based on the findings of an institutional assessment.
      The NSPA has completed disability benefit provision standards, including disability
       coding, standard operating procedures, design of registry of disability, and administration
       of cash benefits.
      The NSPA has built an on-site training facility with video-conference capacity for
       disability benefit administration and trained relevant officials both locally and remotely.
      The NSPA has equipped all level one government hospitals with computers and related
       networking to ensure their health care service delivery data flow in a timely manner to the
       Aasandha and the NSPA for claim management and monitoring purposes.
      Jointly with the MoHF, the NSPA has developed a Uniform Data Framework for an
       integrated health information system that serves all health care services in Maldives.
      The NSPA has developed a data warehousing system and monitoring dashboard for the
       National Health Insurance scheme.
      The NSPA has set up a call center to serve as a new client interface for all its programs

Component E – Pay-out of pension liabilities (actual cost of US$6.1 million)

9.     This component was designed to finance the payment of the RBs into individual
RSAs of public sector employees who retired between January 2011 and March 2014. After
having disbursed US$6.1 million out of the total US$8 million, this component was
suspended.




                                              31
Annex 3.         Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      As noted in the PAD, the impact of introducing a new pension system is complex
and difficult to measure comprehensively, particularly when the overall Maldives economy
would be affected for decades to come through the impact of the new pension system on
saving rates and the labor market. Hence, this report does not attempt to estimate the net
present value or the economic rate of return, which was not estimated in the PAD. Rather
this section focuses on assessing the Project’s contribution with respect to improving cost-
effectiveness and efficiency of Maldives pension and other SP programs.

2.       There are four direct benefits that arise from the new pension system that this
project has supported to establish. First, for the first time, workers outside of civil services
are covered by the MRPS and as a result can ensure a reasonable level of income after
retirement at age 65. During the project period, the coverage of the MRPS has expanded
beyond civil servants to cover 100 percent of the formal private sector workers and has
begun to enroll self-employed workers on a voluntary basis since 2014. A uniform and
portable pension system is expected to facilitate labor mobility between government jobs
and private sector jobs and between the formal sector and self-employed enterprises.
Second, the MRPS is more cost-effective for the GoM as a mechanism for paying
government employees’ pension than the previous CSP. By design, the MRPS is a fully
funded DC scheme, so the government’s liability is clearly defined by its contribution of 7
percent of employees’ base salary as an employer. Hence, there is no hidden unfunded
liability to the government, which directl y contributes to Maldives’ long-term fiscal
sustainability. Third, investment needs of the MRPS funds have stimulated further
development of the Maldives’ capital market, which was very limited in both size and depth
before the MRPS. With a MVR 6.5 billion fund size as of end 2014, the MRPS has become
the most important institutional investor in the Maldives and can greatly support financing
needs for its economic development if the capital market can be further developed through
innovation in product structuring and financial intermediation. Lastly, while the universal
OABP has effectively set an inflation-proof “income floor” for its population aged 65 or
above to ensure a modest living standard for its elderly population 8 , a “claw back”
mechanism related to the recipient’s other pension income has helped to reduce the
scheme’s financial cost and strengthen its redistribution role.

3.      The Project has supported the development of institutional and administration
capacity to efficiently implement Maldives’ pension programs. The MPAO as an
autonomous entity has built a professional staff team and has been providing good services
to the MRPS members and recipients of the OABP and other government-funded pension
programs. With the support of the Project, it has developed a robust pension MIS, which
has been in full operation since 2014 and supports all business processes, including



8
  Though there is no recent household survey data to offer any estimate of the effect of OABP on poverty
level, it is reasonable to believe that households with elderly members who receive OABP benefit are much
less likely to be poor.



                                                   32
maintaining and updating individual RSAs. Through its website, the MPAO provides
online member services and publishes various pension related information, including
monthly contribution, disbursement and investment statistics, as well as operation
procedures, regulations, and compliance status to ensure transparency and reduce fiduciary
risks. Since the beginning of 2015, it has become financially independent and has managed
to reduce its investment management fee charge from percent to 0.9 percent, which is one
of the lowest across the world. Furthermore, it has managed to achieve good returns for its
MRPS members. The 2014 annual returns of the two largest MRPS portfolios are 8.01
percent and 9 percent, respectively, while the annual inflation as measured by the consumer
price index is only 2 percent.

4.      In addition, the Project has strengthened the institutional capacity of the NSPA and
MoFT through information system development/upgrading and training. The development
of the SPIS has not only automated the administration tasks related to a number of social
safety net programs, but has also integrated all these programs into one platform, which
enables the NSPA to manage benefit and service delivery in a holistic manner. The registry
of electricity subsidy beneficiary households developed through a re-registration process
supported by the Project can potentially become the uniform social registry for all SP
programs. Because it has collected information on both income and other socio-economic
characteristics of beneficiary households, it can be used for targeting purpose should the
government decide to change program eligibility criteria. Similarly, the Project’s PAS
Component has greatly improved the functioning of the accounting practices followed by
government agencies and the capacity of the MoFT to manage government expenditure
more effectively. Given the urgent need to reduce its large fiscal deficit, the benefit of a
stronger expenditure management capability cannot be emphasized more.

5.      However, the economic benefit of the Project could have been greater if the
Government had harmonized “double pensions” for public employees and if it had not
introduced the expensive SCA outside the ambit of the NPA. Both have significantly offset
the positive fiscal impact of the new pension system. The “double pensions” benefit itself
could cost the government an additional US$17.6 million per year for the next 15 years
according to the recent estimate by the Maldives Auditor General’s Office. Furthermore,
the overgenerous non-contributory pension as a result of the sum of the OABP and SCA is
expected to negatively affect long-term saving. Notwithstanding the substantial progress,
the “double pensions” issue suggests a certain fragility to the pension reform agenda at the
political level. Only after the project closing, a decision was made to harmonize the parallel
pension schemes with the MRPS.

Annex 5.       Beneficiary Survey Results

1.     The second pension awareness survey was conducted in 2015 to assess: (a) the level
of understanding of pension schemes among Maldivians, and (b) the extent to which the
population has taken the opportunity to make use of the pension schemes as instruments to
plan for retirement. This survey provided a comparison analysis between the baseline
survey conducted in 2010, which assessed the attitudes, awareness and perceptions toward
retirement and toward pensions among the population. As pensions was a new concept for
most Maldivians, the baseline survey was useful to identify what retirement means to
Maldivians, how they plan for retirement, what their motivators would be to join a
retirement plan, and what benefits they thought a retirement plan would have. The results
from the baseline survey were used to formulate the MPAO’s pension implementation,
communications and planning. It also served as an initial assessment marker for subsequent
surveys.

2.      The comparison analysis (2010 survey vs. 2015 survey) was based on 19 basic
indicators. Out of the 19 indicators, 12 showed an improvement from the 2010 baseline
results. Among those which showed improvement, there were indicators which have
increased by more than 10 percentage points. Three additional indicators showed a
significant improvement.

3.      In general, the 2015 survey showed increased knowledge and perception of the
general public on the pension schemes. However, there were areas that showed
unsatisfactory performance, which need to be addressed by the MPAO. The areas where
the MPAO performed well, or where the MPAO succeeded in reaching the public included
the following:

        The MRPS is a DC pension scheme and it is the individual’s role and not the
         government’s to plan for retirement
        Awareness of the NPA;
        Awareness of the role of the MPAO
        Awareness on the retirement pension scheme

4.       Areas where the MPAO needs to work on are:

        Benefits of the MRSP and retirement in generalInformation on who manages the
         MRPS and who is eligible for MRPS

Project Background

1.      The development objective of the Pension and Social Protection Administration
Project, approved on May 12, 2009, was to support the establishment of a new pension
authority and strengthen capacity at existing institutions of the GoM to effectively
implement a new pension system and to provide a platform for additional SP programs.
With the project’s support, the GoM established the MPAO as well as a Pension
Supervision unit under the CMDA. The MPAO further developed the capacity to track and
report pension contributions and transactions on individual accounts for all employees and
implemented a new basic pension scheme for the entire population over the eligible age.

2.       The AF and restructuring of the project (August 7, 2011) revised the PDO as
follows: to support the implementation of the National Pension Act, to strengthen
institutional capacity of key agencies responsible for implementing the National Pension
Act, and to develop the processes and platforms required for the delivery of SP programs.
The AF and restructuring provided support to (a) help finance additional TA to the original
activities (including strengthening the CMDA in its role as pension supervisor, defining
the process of annuitization of the MPAO pension benefits, and so on; (b) support a set of
new activities (including the development of a targeting system, disability coding and
benefit administration, and the systems to deliver health insurance); and (c) support the
reduction of unfunded pension liabilities via redemption of the RBs for the cohorts of civil
servants retiring within the life time of the project.

3.      Subsequently, the project was further restructured (2nd), effective from June 27,
2012, which involved (a) clarification of roles and responsibilities to appoint the NSPA
rather than the MoHF to be responsible for implementation and management of the
National Social Health Insurance Scheme Act as well as the disability program and targeted
assistance scheme; (b) clarification of scope of TA to develop a strategy for an integrated
SP system and strengthen identification systems to operate the programs supported under
the project and to ensure administrative synergies across them; and (c) allowing incentive
allowances to a small group of civil servants working on core activities of PAS
implementation.

4.     The 3rd restructuring took place on February 10, 2014 where at the request of the
GoM, activities to strengthen the national identification system and build and implement
the individual identification mechanisms were removed from the project as the GoM
decided to undertake those activities on its own. The restructuring also provided TA for
the development of a strategy for an integrated SP system. It also amended the DLI targets
for Component E of the project.

5.      The 4th project restructuring was approved on May 20, 2015 by the Bank
management to (a) reallocate unutilized balance of Category 2 of the original IDA credit
to categories 1 and 4, (b) introduce a DLI to support the development of a registry of
electricity subsidy beneficiaries to move to a targeted assistance design, and (c) introduce
the Least-Cost Selection method for the engagement of consultants.


                                            38
6.     The project as restructured had the following five components.

Component A: Technical Assistance and Capacity Building for Implementation of the
New Pension Program

7.     This component supported the establishment of the legal and regulatory framework
for pension reform and developed institutional capacity and systems at the MPAO and
CMDA.

Component B: Public Awareness Campaign

8.      This component aimed at provision of technical advisory services, goods, and
training to design and implement an overall public information campaign to educate
members of the new pension system on the objectives and mechanisms of the system,
including improving awareness of (a) employers on their contributory obligations; (b)
workers on their rights and benefits; and (c) senior citizens about the mechanism for
claiming basic pension.

Component C: Public Accounting System

9.      The objective of this component was provision of technical advisory services,
goods, and training to (a) support the MoFT in the implementation of the PAS within the
MoFT, line agencies, and local government bodies; (b) support the MoFT in the
development and implementation of accounting standards, policies, and instructions
related to the recipient’s Public Finance Law; (c) strengthen capacity of the staff of the
MoFT, line agencies, and local government bodies in the use, operation, and maintenance
of the PAS; and (d) support the MoFT in the development and implementation of a payroll
system for the public employees of the recipient, including a mechanism to track the
pension contributions.

Component D: Administration of Health Insurance, Disability, and Targeted
Assistance

10.    The component had three subcomponents.

         D.1 Development of a National Targeting System in Maldives: The main objective
of this subcomponent was to operationalize the newly designed PMT targeting mechanism
for targeting benefits administered by the NSPA. It also focused on (a) strengthening the
capacity of the NSPA in the administration and provision of the financial assistance under
the SP programs; (b) development of an MIS for targeting; (c) establishment of a system
for data collection; (d) development of standard operating procedures, manuals, and
training plans for the scale-up of the targeting system; (e) carrying out of outreach
campaigns, training, and capacity building; and (f) development of M&E systems for the
targeting system.

       D.2 TA to support the implementation of the Disability Act: The subcomponent
aimed to provide much needed guidance on developing a standardized disability
determination and certification process. The current practice is such that medical


                                           39
     professionals write a letter which only states the type of disability and suggest the patient
     to apply for assistance. However, some beneficiaries require further testing and details and
     they need to get letters from the doctors numerous times. The disability determination and
     certification process once engineered provides the necessary standardized forms and
     certification guides for medical professionals to use when patients need to apply for state
     assistance.

            D.3 Development of systems to deliver health insurance: The subcomponent aimed
     to develop the M&E capacity at the NSPA via a Health Insurance MIS. This new MIS
     would allow the NSPA to rely on useful data for the supervision and planning of the Social
     Health Insurance Scheme as mandated by the Social Health Insurance Act.

     Component E: Payout of Pension Liabilities

     11.    This component supported the pension scheme through the provision of pension
     payouts to public sector employees retiring during the period of project implementation,
     who have been credited with the RBs in accordance with the laws of the GoM.

     Rating of Key Performance Indicators

     12.     The development objective of the Pension and Social Protection Administration
     Project (PSPAP) has been to support the implementation of the National Pension Act, to
     strengthen institutional capacity of the key agencies responsible for implementation of the
     National Pensions Act, and to develop the process and platform required for the
     development of SP programs. The project had the following five PDO indicators and nine
     intermediate indicators.

                                                certification process has been piloted and amendments to the process
                                                have been brought about. The identification format was finalized and
                                                shared with the MoLG for their perusal and they are utilizing it for
                                                identification purposes.
9. Development of options and piloting of new   Comments - Achieved
approach to targeting of social benefits        New targeting method was piloted in two atolls and a reverification
                                                exercise for all beneficiaries in the Malé region was conducted under
                                                the project. The reregistration of the electricity subsidy was designed
                                                around the new targeting method. The Economic and Youth Council
                                                of the cabinet was presented the method and they endorsed to utilize
                                                it in the electricity reregistration and also has been adopted by the
                                                NSPA as the method for revision of other social benefits as well.

     Achievements of the PSPAP

     Component A: Technical Assistance and Capacity Building for Implementation of the
     New Pension Program

     13.   During the project preparation stage, the PSPAP provided TA in preparation of the
     Maldives Pension Law which was presented to the parliament, and passed.

     14.    Implantation of the Pension Act. The project provided TA in implementing the
     Pension Act. Assistance was provided in meeting the timelines given in the law in
     appointing the Board members and staff of the MPAO. TA was provided in developing
     various regulations needed for the timely implementation of the Pension Act.

     15.     Development of the MIS. The PSPAP was responsible for the development and
     installation of the MIS for automation of pension contribution collection, pension payments,
     and maintenance of the detailed records of the individual RSAs. The MIS is an automated
     workflow-based system.

     16.      The main modules of the software include:

                   Employer registration

                                                       42
            Accounting and invoicing
            Grievances
            Enforcement
            Access Control

17.    Training of IT staff. Various IT staff of the MPAO received training during the
development of the system, which included on-the-job training for which some of the staff
were placed with the company developing the system and worked closely with the
developing team.

18.     Statement of Pension Contribution. All the employers can submit the Statement
of Pension Contribution file online. A vigorous verification process is carried out and if all
the information is correct, a receipt notice with a payment voucher is generated through the
Koshaaru. Employers pay the exact amount on the payment voucher to the bank and the
amount is reconciled automatically, next day morning.

19.     RSA balance. Members can check the details of their RSA by registering at the
member’s portal. Mobile number and ID card or passport is required for the registration.
Password is sent to the mobile after manual verification. All members with an RSA can
access their accounts using the member’s portal.

20.     Training of Pension Office personnel. As the contributory pension system was
rather new, various Board members and staff of the MPAO were given training, which
included participation of the Board and staff members in the Pension Core Course at the
Bank, and the World Pension Summit. Training was also provided in other essential fields
like PR, management, asset management, and IT for the staff of the Pension Office.

21.    Investment policy expert. With the assistance of an investment policy expert, the
SOIP of the Pension Office was revised and consolidated investment rules were prepared.
Investment challenges for the MPAO were identified, and a risk framework was developed.

22.    Investment management capacity building expert. The PSPAP facilitated the
MPAO in getting the assistance of an international expert in investment capacity building,
and reports on strategic asset allocations and investment training have been prepared.

23.      Disability insurance. The MPAO is in the process of introducing disability
insurance to its beneficiaries. The services of a disability expert were sought for the initial
research and policy guidelines, the regulations on the disability insurance have been
completed and are expected to be introduced during the last quarter of 2015. The PSPAP
facilitated this by getting inputs from an international expert on the subject.

24.     Maldives Finance Forum. With the assistance of the PSPAP, the Maldives
Finance Forum was launched successfully to bring together leaders from business,
financial, political, academic, and SP sectors to deliberate on issues, promote views, and
share experiences for the development of the Maldivian financial sector. The forum was
well received and became a highly acclaimed event with overwhelmingly positive response
from the stakeholder community.


                                              43
25.     Pension Supervision Department. The Pension Supervision Department was
established in the CMDA and regular on-site and off-site inspection of the MPAO is carried
out by the Supervision Department. The MPAO provides quarterly investment reports to
the Supervision Department to ensure compliance with the statement of investment
principles and regulations. The PSPAP assisted the department by providing local and
international consultants and providing various training for the staff of the CMDA.
Assistance was provided to the CMDA in enhancing the CMDA website and developing
information packs on access to finance through capital market.

26.      Financial literacy survey. A financial literacy survey was carried out by the
CMDA as a financial literacy initiative to obtain and analyze nationwide data on financial
capability. The survey indicated that financial knowledge and planning among the
population is very low, and the awareness on different financial products is also very
limited. This survey will help the CMDA in planning how to carry out financial literacy
initiatives and identify the target groups.

27.     System readiness audit. A system readiness audit of the Koshaaru system was
carried out by the supervision department to assess the IT system, internal controls of the
system, compliance with the requirements, and evaluate the governance structure of the IT
system. The conclusions of the system audit have identified various areas of weakness and
recommendations on improvements.

Component B: Public Awareness Campaign

28.     Baseline survey. In 2010, the MPAO conducted its first national telephone survey
among 4,100 people to identify the level of awareness of the population in the area of
Pension Law and the functions of the MPAO. Immediately after that, a nationwide PR
campaign was carried out to increase awareness of the population on the essence, principles,
and advantages of the new Pension Law. In the framework of the PR campaign, booklets
were prepared and distributed, posters placed in prime locations in Malé and other islands,
audio and TV commercials were prepared and put on the air. A number of articles were
published, talk shows and roundtables organized. The MPAO team also conducted various
information sessions to targeted audience and general audience. The MPAO teams
travelled to all the provinces of Maldives and conducted information sessions in over 31
islands with over 390 participants.

29.     Follow-up survey. A follow-up survey, financed in the framework of the PSPAP,
was conducted in June 2015. The objective was to assess the effectiveness of the PR
campaign and increase the level of information among the population. According to the
survey report, the savings habit among the respondents had increased and there was also
an increase in the number of people aware of the existence of the Pension Law, the MPAO,
and the Retirement Pension Scheme.

Component C: Public Accounting System

30.  SAP maintenance fees. The PSPAP supported the government in covering the
SAP maintenance fee from 2012 to 2014.



                                            44
31.     SAP upgrade. SAP consultants were contracted to upgrade the system from
version ECC 6.0 to the latest SAP version, EHP 7.0 (including Oracle database from
10.2.0.2.0 to 11.2.0.5) and addressed all the technical issues identified. As a result, an
International Public Sector Accounting Standards-cash-compliant financial statement for
the FY14 was produced, for the first time from the system. Also, a reliable record-keeping
system for budget execution monitoring has been established, and daily reports on the
budget availability for budget execution monitoring are generated from the system. The
key users of the Treasury and Public Accounting Division received on-the-job training
from the SAP consultants.

32.    Incentive payments. The project provided incentive payments to key users and the
backup users of SAP. This has helped in retaining some of the users within the MoFT and
successful implementation of the SAP upgrade activities.

33.    SAP modules rollout. As of June 30, 2015, the HR module has been rolled out to
96 percent of Malé-based government agencies and it is planned to be rolled out to the
remaining agencies in the coming weeks. In addition to Malé-based agencies, four non-
Malé-based agencies have been covered. SAP rollout will continue to and will be
incorporated into the operations of Treasury and Public Accounting Division.

Component D: Administration of Health Insurance, Disability, and Targeted
Assistance

Subcomponent D.1: Development of a National Targeting System in the Maldives

34.    Operationalization of the PMT targeting mechanism. The targeting method was
discussed with the stakeholders in the testing trips to two atolls. The PMT method was
adopted and utilized for testing even within the NSPA as a reference tool in medical welfare
and the electricity subsidies reregistration exercise as a guiding tool on targeting.

35.     SPIS. The central system to administer all existing programs at the NSPA was
designed and developed under assistance from the project and is operational for the NSPA
to begin utilizing. The system will allow better data management, and reporting on the
different programs at the NSPA.

36.    Strengthening the IT infrastructure at the NSPA. The IT infrastructure at the
NSPA was not sufficient to operationalize the SPIS. Hence, a new network was set up that
was reliable and manageable. Firewalls and servers were installed and necessary IT
development support via IT consultants was also provided for the NSPA to fast track the
operationalization process.

Subcomponent D.2: Technical Assistance to Support the Implementation of the Disability
Act

37.     Development of the disability definition guide (supplement to the disability
regulation). The guideline on defining disability for purposes of providing financial
assistance was drafted and circulated for comments among stakeholders. A stakeholder
meeting was held to finalize the document and propose a course of action for the


                                            45
implementation of the document. According to consensus, the finalized document was
forwarded to the MoLG for publication.

38.     Development of the disability identification format and guide. The
identification guide and format was drafted and shared with stakeholders and amended
after comments and finalized.

39.    Development of the disability certification format and guideline. The guide has
been finalized after incorporation of comments from stakeholders and specialists. A
working session was arranged with key policy stakeholders to discuss details on proposing
the amendment to the disability regulation and act. A disability certification process has
been designed and documents have been translated as well.

40.    Pilot exercises and training sessions for new disability certification guide. Pilot
exercises were completed in six atolls and all relevant entities were briefed on their roles
and details of their participation. The overall process has been agreed by all stakeholders
and detailed role-based assignments have been identified.

41.     Training facility at the NSPA. All necessary equipment and setup required for
training of stakeholders in the atolls via video calls and also a training room to train the
stakeholders in Malé and atolls were also developed under the project. Ten training stations
were set up and equipped, while all necessary equipment for video calls were also set up
at the NSPA.

Subcomponent D.3: Development of Systems to Deliver Health Insurance

42.     MIS for health insurance monitoring at the NSPA. With the assistance of an
international consultant, the health insurance MIS has been developed and tested and the
NSPA now has the capacity to easily analyze data from Aasandha using this tool.

43.     Hardware to nodal level one health facilities. Hardware was procured and
delivered to facilities selected by the MoHF under this subcomponent to incentivize the
health facilities in the atolls to share data to the Aasandha and General Practices portal
through which the NSPA can get their data. These hardware included computers and
printers for the doctors' rooms so that e-prescription and Aasandha Doctors portal can be
used at the facilities.

Component E: Payout of Pension Liabilities

44.    The MPAO established individual RSAs for the employees on its MIS to track
auditable individual balances and transection in the accounts. The Bank reimbursed
accrued rights up to US$6,138,474.63. However, the balance of the component was
cancelled because of the government’s continued payment of double pensions to public
servants (retirement benefits provided by various public institutions on top of the MRPS),
and the introduction of the SCA providing a top-up to the existing OABP.

Borrower and Bank Performance



                                            46
45.     The GoM has since the initiation of the PSPAP, remained committed to the project
objectives. The PMU was very active in coordinating the project. It had highly motivated
staff. This aspect, along with the increased cooperation from the different implementing
agencies, led to the successful implementation of the project and achievement of project
objectives.

46.     During the initial project, continuous assistance was provided by the Bank in
drafting the bill and other technical knowhow. Meetings were held with different
stakeholders like the Public Services Division, the CSC, and other relevant agencies to
make sure that all the requirements were met through the bill. The Bank worked closely
with the borrower to support its efforts to successfully implement the project. The dialogue
during the implementation process was smooth and both parties sought and found solutions
to implementation bottlenecks. The Bank supervised the project regularly and this intensive
supervision was one of the major contributing factors in achieving the targets.

Lessons Learned

47.     The PSPAP demonstrated the significance of international assistance in
implementing of the pension reform in Maldives. The MPAO team has grasped the
expertise from the international consultancies provided and is in a position to move forward
with the implementation and sustainable development in the pension reform.

48.       The major lessons learned from the PSPAP are the following:

         Detailed design and planning of the project is a key factor for its successful
          implementation.
         For complex programs, such as public pensions and social assistance, it is important
          to build a broad consensus for change. Experience from other countries underlines
          the critical importance of public information and training campaigns in building
          support. An important element of the project was aimed at creating public
          awareness of benefits.
         Government ownership and active involvement in project implementation is crucial
          for project success and sustainability.
         Good level of public information is critically important.
         Collaboration and data exchange between the state agencies is crucial.
         Formal performance appraisal linked to appropriate incentives is needed to
          motivate and reward personnel.
         Implementation timetables need to be realistic and flexible to allow for limited
          agency experience in project implementation. Timetables were reviewed carefully
          during appraisal and found acceptable, and the pace of implementation needs to be
          monitored during implementation.
         The frequent restructuring due to the government’s changing priorities led to a lot
          of time and effort of the project focused and spent on endeavors that were later
          either halted or discontinued. For instance, Subcomponent D.3 was initially
          allocated for strengthening the national ID systems to facilitate administration of
          the Social Health Insurance and SP programs. All necessary tender documentations
          for the upgrade required for the DNR system was completed according to consensus


                                              47
       from all key stakeholders including relevant ministries, departments, security
       forces, and statutory bodies. It was restructured right before the tendering stage.
       Hence, all necessary materials for tendering for the DNR to add the biometric data
       collection and de-duplication requirements were all developed under the project
       with consultants and numerous consensus-building sessions. It was later
       restructured with the aim of the development of the uniform health information
       system (Maldives Integrated Health Information System) to integrate all health
       facilities under one system. Work was undertaken on modeling this system and
       designing it, and stakeholder consensus sessions were held to agree on the way
       forward; however, commitment from stakeholder agencies was minimal. The
       priorities were not consistent on integrating health service providers; hence, a
       restructuring was done once more. These processes took about two years that could
       have been utilized more productively.


Plans for Sustainability of PSPAP Achievements

49.    Sustainability of the achievements obtained in the framework of the PSPAP will be
ensured as the MPAO was established as a statutory organization under the Pension Law
and has reached financial independence.

50.    The sustainability of the PAS will be ensured by the implementation of the new
Public Finance Management Project also financed by the Bank. The Public Finance
Management Project will assist the MoFT in further developing the PAS.

51.    The NSPA has contracted some of the staff financed under the project to work as
consultants. This will help to retain the knowledge within the organization and for further
development. The NSPA has budgeted for the additional funding required for further
development and maintenance of the SPIS.

Conclusion

52.    The project was well designed and implemented. A number of challenges were
faced due to the changes in government policies. However, most of these challenges were
overcome through dialogue and implementation was carried out smoothly.
