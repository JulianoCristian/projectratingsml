                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project development objectives are to: (1) improve the management and operation of the conditional cash transfer program to enhance its effectiveness in reaching
                         the poorest and indigenous groups, (2) provide beneficiaries with an incentive framework to increase their participation in the CCT program, which would boost their
                         demand for education and maternal and infant health services, (3) strengthen the supply of nutrition and child growth promotion interventions in the indigenous areas of
                         the RO (comarcas); and (4) enhance government capacity to develop coherent and efficient social sector policies and interventions on the basis of evidence.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the final ISR for the Social Protection Project based on findings during the Supervision Mission between July 8 and 15, 2014 and further discussions during August, 2014. A
                         new administration was installed in office on July 1, 2014, and during the mission the team met the new MIDES and Red de Oportunidades (RdO) officials and briefed them on the

                         mission found sustained implementation progress in critical areas and planned the completion of key activities before the Project closing date. The progress made in supporting the
                         efficient coverage and targeting of the RdO (first PDO), and the successful implementation of the health care extension to indigenous areas (second and third PDOs) suggest a
                         moderately satisfactory rating despite the limitations in implementing an information system for verification of co-responsibilities.

                         The first and most important PDO aimed at improving the management and operation of the conditional cash transfer program to enhance its effectiveness in reaching the poorest
                         and indigenous groups. This PDO stressed the capacity of RdO to cover and target the poorest in Panama. By July 2014, RdO covered about 72,000 households in extreme poverty,
                         with strong emphasis on indigenous areas (comarcas). The coverage of RdO has been slightly declining over time due in part to improving economic conditions in the country,
                         despite the fact that poverty reduction was more modest in comarcas compared to urban areas. The gradual reduction in coverage did not affect targeting efficiency. The Encuesta de
                         Propositos Multiples 2013 (household survey) showed that the poorest two quintiles of the Panamanian population absorb 74.4 and 18.6 percent of the RdO transfers. In the original
                         version of the Results Framework, a PDO indicator set a target of 80 percent that would have been largely achieved. Another PDO indicator in the original Results Framework was
                         the share of households in indigenous areas that were covered by RdO. Administrative data also shows that 67 percent of households in comarcas are covered by RdO, slightly
                         below the 70 percent target. The gradual reduction in RdO beneficiaries mentioned before might explain this partial achievement. The only PDO indicator left from the original Results
                         Framework that corresponds to this first Component is the share of RdO beneficiary children aged 4-17 that attend school as their education co-responsibility. This indicator showed
                         sustained progress during Project implementation, as more children were included in the education information system and this data was also shared with RdO. This increasing
                         coverage of education information on RdO beneficiaries reflects the gradual capacity building effort supported by the Project, especially on cross-sectoral issues that demand
                         additional coordination agreements. By April 2014, 59 percent of RdO children could be verified as attending school through the existing information systems, below the expected 90
                         percent. This number is misleading as it mainly reflects the limited coverage of information systems (there is a total of 133,852 children). Other data sources, such as the impact
                         evaluation report that surveyed current beneficiaries, shows that RdO children have enrolment rates of 96 percent in urban areas, 94 percent in rural and 92.6 percent in indigenous
                         areas.

                         Another PDO indicator that measured the quality of RdO by the share of beneficiaries who know their rights and responsibilities to access services and their co-responsibilities set a
                         target of 70% of households. This was supported by the social worker (promotores) network in Component 2 of the Project. The Project planned for 400 promotores financed by
                         external funds (IDB and World Bank loans) but due to fiscal cuts and uncertain budgetary prospects in MIDES, the number of promotores in July 2014 was only 219. This network of
                         promotores was responsible for orientation to beneficiary families, including the discussion on co-responsibilities and rights. By April 2014, an estimated 56,712 households had been
                         visited by promotores and had received information about Program rules. As the number of promotores had been reduced from the original plan, the number of families that were in
                         locations covered by promotores was 64,194 and not the more than 72,000 in the Program. The promotores’ coverage exceeded the 70% target, actually reaching out to 88 percent
                         of households (56,712/64,194).

                         The limited network, however, left many corregimientos without promotores. The intermediate indicator measuring RdO corregimientoswith promotores’ support (share of jurisdictions
                         with technical support for the accompaniment of families) included 328 corregimientos out of the 568 (56%) well below the 100% target. The reduced number of promotores forced
                         the RdO Program to allocate promotores to areas with the largest number of RdO beneficiaries. The corregimientos without promotores have an average of 33 beneficiary
                         households in each corregimiento, compared to the average 195 households in covered corregimientos.

                         The role of promotores went beyond the regular tasks following up on households participation in the program, from supporting payment processes to following up on non-compliant

                         households. Given the coverage limitations in the information systems already mentioned, the linkage between co-responsibilities that were actually verified and RdO payments could
                         not be implemented. The intermediate indicator “share of payments supported by complete verification of co-responsibilities” was not measured, even though non-compliance was
                         identified through a number of methods for some groups of households. Through the promotores network, non-compliant households received warning letters informing them of their
                         failure to meet RdO responsibilities. At the same time, RdO promotores facilitated the participation of more than 3,000 beneficiaries in training activities on productive development
                         issues, especially on rural production issues. The role of promotores as linkages to productive development activities is the basis for the new direction of RdO and MIDES. The new
                         administration aims to enhance the role of social protection beyond cash transfers to enhance economic autonomy of households.

                         The second PDO was to provide beneficiaries with an incentive framework to increase their participation in the CCT program, which would boost their demand for education and
                         maternal and infant health services. This demand-side cash incentive would be observed only when it met the supply of services, but the role of promotores was also important in
                         conveying information about the importance of accessing education and health services. The evidence collected in the impact evaluation study, shows that school enrolment among
                         children in households that receive RdO is higher than in comparable households in the same location, but that this difference weakens in secondary level (drop out). When

                         examining school attendance, the evaluation survey shows that attendance is higher among RdO participants, especially in rural and indigenous areas. This suggests that the
                         incentive framework supported by the Project had an associated improvement in school participation, but might need refinements at the secondary level.

                         The third PDO was to strengthen the supply of nutrition and child growth promotion interventions in the indigenous areas of the RO (comarcas). This PDO was supported through the

                         financing of additional health services in Component 3, implemented by the Ministry of Health. The delivery of health services followed the successful model of results based
                         financing where non-governmental organization (Organismos Ejecutores, OEs) were contracted to deliver a package of services in specific catchment areas. Each catchment areas
                         had a target population based on the 2003 Census, but these figures were quickly revised given the larger than estimated population in the comarcas. This increased demand also
                         motivated the reallocation of Project resources toward Component 3. The results are reflected in intermediate indicators of coverage of health services like the fraction of children
                         under 2 receiving the strengthened health care package (achieved target of 90%), and the fraction of pregnant women receiving at least 3 prenatal controls. The latter only achieved
                         69% compared to a target of 85%, partly due to some reductions in coverage in 2013. Evidence from the impact evaluation survey complements the findings in the administrative
                         program data. Children’s growth monitoring, for example, increased from 52.4% in the baseline in indigenous areas to 72.9% in 2014. The mon itoring of women for cervical cancer
                         also shows important progress in indigenous areas, where 51% of women in RdO between 15 and 49 years had a pap smear compared to 38% among indigenous women not in
                         RdO.

                         An outcome PDO indicator of health care services was the reduction in 4 percentage point of chronic malnutrition rates among children under 2 years. The measurement of this
                         indicator has been affected by statistical problems weakening the accuracy of the estimate. The main problem found in fieldwork was the lower than expected number of households
                         with children under 2 years of age. The case is similar for children under 5 years. The Impact Evaluation design was based on the expectation that there would be about 0.85 children
                         under 5 years of age per household in the RdO sample. When the field work took place, it was found that there were only 0.47 children per household, a number that was
                         corroborated by the National Household Survey 2008 (0.42 children under five). This implied that a larger number of households would need to be surveyed in order to obtain
                         estimates of chronic malnutrition that satisfied statistical considerations (potency) multiplying the field work costs. Other methodological issues also affected the number of available
                         observations for these estimates. The use of regression discontinuity techniques implied the use of only those households that were around the eligibility cutoff threshold, limiting
                         even more the number of observations. The fewer usable observations found in the survey limit reduction weakened the accuracy of malnutrition indicators.

                         Ancillary evidence from the 2008 living conditions survey household survey shows national chronic malnutrition rates of 23.6% for children under 5, compared to 22.6% in 2014 in the
                         evaluation survey. Examining chronic malnutrition in indigenous areas, after an increasing trend between 1997 and 2008, it shows a decline between 33.6% in 2008 and the Impact
                         Evaluation survey in 2014 (28.9%). These trends among children under 5 are corroborated by the impact evaluation estimates instrumental variables showing a reduction in 0.053
                         points but with insufficient accuracy (insignificance). These preliminary results for children under 5 are still under revision and should be treated with caution, but the lack of potency
                         for estimating malnutrition for children under 2 will limit any estimates for this group.

                         The fourth PDO was aimed at enhancing government capacity to develop coherent and efficient social sector policies and interventions on the basis of evidence. Activities in
                         Component 4 supported the functioning of the Technical Secretariat of the Social Cabinet (STGS), including consultancies to develop national strategies and policies for youth and
                         elderly. The Project also supported the preparation and revision of the Bill of Law on the Protection for the Elderly. Component 4 supported the engagement with other MIDES
                         programs like the non-contributory pension program 120 a los 65 and Angel Guardian, and with programs out of MIDES like Beca Universal managed by IFARHU. The dialogue with
                         other social programs has been critical in supporting the new vision of MIDES in aiming to increase economic autonomy of beneficiaries by linking to other programs. One specific
                         request by the new administration was the technical support on introducing social program payments through the banking system and additional support to evaluate the program.
