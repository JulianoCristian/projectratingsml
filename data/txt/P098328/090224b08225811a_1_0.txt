                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project development objectives are to: (1) improve the management and operation of the conditional cash transfer program to enhance its effectiveness in reaching
                         the poorest and indigenous groups, (2) provide beneficiaries with an incentive framework to increase their participation in the CCT program, which would boost their
                         demand for education and maternal and infant health services, (3) strengthen the supply of nutrition and child growth promotion interventions in the indigenous areas of
                         the RO (comarcas); and (4) enhance government capacity to develop coherent and efficient social sector policies and interventions on the basis of evidence.

                         The supervision of implementation found sustained progress in critical areas. First, the RdO Program (Component 1) hired an international consultant responsible for preparing and
                         piloting an action plan to strengthen the verification of co-responsibilities. This would ensure the Program has a comprehensive strategy for verification of co-responsibilities that

                         includes both the exchange of data amongst sectoral Ministries (Education, Health, MIDES), and the use of RdO Participant Report Cards (a paper-based record of verification).
                         Second, the preparation and testing of the impact evaluation instruments continued making progress. The joint IDB-World Bank team supervised the testing of the fieldwork process
                         and the survey instrument.
