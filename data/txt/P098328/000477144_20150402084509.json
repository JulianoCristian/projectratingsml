Social Protection Project for Panama\n            received a moderately satisfactory outcome rating with\n            moderate risk to development outcome. Both the Bank and the\n            Borrower received moderately satisfactory ratings for their\n            parts in the project. The project was restructured four\n            different times. The loan agreement was first amended to\n            provide the counterpart with additional time for the\n            selection of independent agencies to carry out the impact\n            evaluation of community-based interventions to prevent\n            chronic malnutrition and the impact evaluation of the Red de\n            Oportunidades (Network of Opportunities) or RO. The project\n            was restructured for a second time to: (a) reallocate\n            resources from components with low execution to components\n            with high execution; in particular, resources were\n            reallocated from components 2 and 4, to components 1 and 3,\n            which had disbursed 24 percent and 96 percent respectively;\n            (b) extend the project\u0092s closing date by 18 months. In\n            addition, in November 2013 the closing date was extended for\n            a second time until May 31, 2014 and then a final extension\n            to September 30, 2014, was approved. These extensions were\n            needed to allow enough time to complete the data collection\n            and evaluation of the RO. There were several lessons learned\n            from this project including the following: (1) in situations\n            of Bank re-engagement with a client, simple and scalable\n            operations may be preferable, (2) se of tested hiring\n            mechanisms, such as performance-based payments, can boost\n            the achievement of objectives, (3) more attention should be\n            given to the requirements for MIS for enabling easier\n            operation by implementing agencies, (4) project indicators\n            need to consider the availability of data and feasibility to\n            obtain unavailable data, (5) cash transfer programs may have\n            positive impacts at the local level when deployed in\n            close-knit communities, and (6) ensuring the offerings of\n            social assistance programs are culturally adapted and\n            tailored to specific beneficiary groups should ensure better\n            compliance with co-responsibilities of these programs."}, "docdt": "2015-03-18T00:00:00Z"}
