                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project development objectives are to: (1) improve the management and operation of the conditional cash transfer program toenhance its effectiveness in reaching
                         the poorest and indigenous groups, (2) provide beneficiaries with an incentive framework toincrease their participation in the CCT program, which would boost their
                         demand for education and maternal and infant healthservices, (3) strengthen the supply of nutrition and child growth promotion interventions in the indigenous areas of
                         the RO(comarcas); and (4) enhance government capacity to develop coherent and efficient social sector policies and interventions on thebasis of evidence.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project was amended in April 2012 when three critical changes were introduced. First, resources were reallocated acrosscomponents from those with slower execution
                         (Component 2 and 4) to those closely associated with the operational implementation ofthe conditional cash transfer Red de Oportunidades (RdO) (Component 1) and the provision

                         1 (Category 1 b) and the inclusion of eligible operating cost under Component 2 and 4. The second change was to extendthe Closing Date for 18 months from the original closing
                         date of June 30, 2012 to December 31, 2013, to allow for the completion ofthe impact evaluation of RdO and the Basic Health and Nutrition Services Coverage Expansion Strategy
                         (Estrategia de Extension deCobertura y de Servicios Basicos de Salud y Nutricion, PAISS+N). The third change was to revise the Results Framework andMonitoring Indicators.

                         The Conditional Cash Transfer Program Red de Oportunidades - CCT RdO -, executed by the Ministry of SocialDevelopment (MIDES), has made further progress towards reaching
                         the Project Development Objectives (PDO): the CCT RdO provides fullcoverage of the eligible population and has good targeting among the extremely poor households. The
                         problems related toimplementation of technical aspects of the CCT RdO program (e.g. verification of co-responsibilities in education and health) havenot changed, but the
                         Government has started exploring mixed strategies to ensure that those technical aspects are satisfactorilyimplemented. After restructuring, the direct support to families strategy
                         has moved rapidly in the contracting of close to 200family counselors and the impact evaluation of the CCT RdO has been redesigned to account for project execution delays
                         andtechnical reliability of results. The faster implementation of those technical aspects is critical for fulfillment of the PDOsrelated to the CCT RdO.

                         After some delays in disbursements during the past year, the fourth quarter of FY2012 has shown anacceleration of disbursements that reflects a positive trend. After the
                         reallocation, the Ministry of Health (MINSA) has anadditional US$5.8 million to disburse in this category. By the end of June 2012, MINSA had already disbursed US$1.4 million
                         ofthose additional resources.
