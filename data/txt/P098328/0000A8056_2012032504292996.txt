                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project development objectives are to: (1) improve the management and operation of the conditional cash transfer program to enhance its effectiveness in reaching
                         the poorest and indigenous groups, (2) provide beneficiaries with an incentive framework to increase their participation in the CCT program, which would boost their
                         demand for education and maternal and infant health services, (3) strengthen the supply of nutrition and child growth promotion interventions in the indigenous areas of
                         the RO (comarcas); and (4) enhance government capacity to develop coherent and efficient social sector policies and interventions on the basis of evidence.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Conditional Cash Transfer Program Red de Oportunidades - CCT RdO-, executed by the MInistry of Social Development (MIDES), is making progress towards part of the Project
                         Development Objectives (PDO): the CCT RdO provides full coverage of the eligible population and has good targeting among the extremely poor households. However,


                                                                                                                                                                                                            Page 1 of 4

                         implementation of the CCT RdO program did not translate into satisfactory project execution of Components 1 and 2 of the project (support of the CCT RdO) since technical aspects
                         of the program are still being poorly implemented (verification of co-responsibilities in education and health) or implemented with significant delays (the direct support to families
                         strategy and the impact evaluation of the CCT RdO were launched at end of 2011 after a delay of two years). The consolidation of those technical aspects in the near future is critical
                         for fulfillment of the rest of the Project Development Objectives related to the CCT RdO.
