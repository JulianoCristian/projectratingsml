Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The Project development objectives are to: (1) improve the management and operation of the conditional

supply of nutrition and child growth promotion interventions in the indigenous areas of the RO
(comarcas); and (4) enhance government capacity to develop coherent and efficient social sector policies
and interventions on the basis of evidence.
