                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project development objectives are to: (1) improve the management and operation of the conditional cash transfer program to enhance its effectiveness in reaching
                         the poorest and indigenous groups, (2) provide beneficiaries with an incentive framework to increase their participation in the CCT program, which would boost their
                         demand for education and maternal and infant health services, (3) strengthen the supply of nutrition and child growth promotion interventions in the indigenous areas of
                         the RO (comarcas); and (4) enhance government capacity to develop coherent and efficient social sector policies and interventions on the basis of evidence.

                         After the amendment in April 2012, and supervision mission in May and December 2012, the Project has improved implementation and disbursements resulting in substantial
                         progress towards achievements of the PDO. This progress in implementation, however, has been jeopardized with the approval of the Budget Law 2013 that allocated insufficient

                         resources for the remainder of the Project.

                         The Conditional Cash Transfer Program Red de Oportunidades - CCT RdO (Component 1), executed by the Ministry of Social Development (MIDES), has made some progress
                         towards reaching the Project Development Objectives (PDO). First, the CCT RdO provides full coverage of the eligible population and has good targeting among the extremely poor

                         households, reaching more than 94 percent of the extreme poor in rural areas as of December 2012) Coverage of the RdO in the November-December 2012 payment reached
                         72,485 beneficiaries. This coverage has been effective in reaching out to the poorest and indigenous groups, reflected in that more than 46% of beneficiaries are indigenous people.
                         Moreover, in the rural "comarcas" and in the province of Bocas del Toro, RdO covers more than 90% of the indigenous population (see document Red de Oportunidades y Poblacion
                         Indigena). In 2012, the MIDES received the Americas Award from CIFAL and United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) for its role in eradicating extreme poverty
                         and hunger.

                         Still, the challenges related to implementation of technical aspects of the CCT RdO program (e.g. verification of co-responsibilities in education and health, recertification), are being
                         addressed at a more gradual pace. First, the government started the contracting process for a software developer to complete the Management Information System which should
                         support steady progress in this area. Second, verification of co-responsibilities in education for the 107,000 school aged children has achieved 44%, both by crossing quarterly data
                         with the education information system, SIASE (about 40% of cases), and by attendance forms provided by teachers (60% of cases). About 56% of children remain with their co-
                         responsibilities unverified. Third, the ‘direct support to families strategy’ (Component 2) has made good progress in 2012 as MIDES contracted and trained 278 family counselors
                         (promotores) who have visited 69% of new beneficiaries in 2012 and supported 983 families who were not complying with co-responsibilities. They have also delivered group training
                         to 33,000 people regarding co-responsibilities and 32,000 people regarding their rights in the program. These family counselors have been critical in the registration of new
                         beneficiary households, addressing compliance to co-responsibilities, and facilitating payment processes at the local level. The recertification process has been put on hold due to
                         insufficient budgetary allocations discussed below. Finally, the impact evaluation of the CCT RdO faced several delays due to the time to revise the methodological design of the
                         evaluation. This first wave of data collection is expected to take place in September 2013.

                         This implementation progress sped up disbursements during the fourth quarter of FY2012 (after Amendment) and this has been sustained during FY 2013. By late 2012, the
                         Congress approved the Budget Law which included financial allocations to implementing agencies below their expected levels. This issue may jeopardize effective Project
                         implementation and is being addressed by the Authorities.
