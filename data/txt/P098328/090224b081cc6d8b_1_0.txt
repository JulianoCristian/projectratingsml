                         Implementation Status Overview
                           This is an update of the existing ISR based on the Supervision Mission between May 21 and 24, 2013. The critical change in the assessment is that the Ministry of Finance had
                         transferred US$1,348,098 to MIDES corresponding to the amount requested in the Extraordinary Credit. Although the Government did not use the Extraordinary Credit mechanism,
                         this additional financing would allow MIDES to complete essential activities to achieve satisfactory outcomes. This implementation pace is also reflected in the use of resources that

                         has triggered a restructuring request from MIDES (attached) to reallocate resources from subcomponent 1A to 1B, to increase funding for the Provincial and Comarcal network. This
                         restructuring will be processed once the formal request from the Ministry of Finance is received.

                         In addition, the Program Red de Oportunidades (Component 1) has carried out a revision of the eligibility instrument (proxy-means test) and these revisions will be implemented

                         through the revision of the Operational Manual. A supervision of the Indigenous Peoples Policy also took place during the mission and a set of actions were identified to strengthen
                         the explicit objective of the Program to cover the poorest rural and indigenous areas (comarcas). Procurement and Financial management specialists also assessed their
                         corresponding areas confirming some progress with respect to previous supervisions. The progress on implementation and the associated disbursements during the current Q4-
                         FY13 quarter (the highest disbursement quarter in the project history), support the assessment that Project management is improving in a sustained basis.
