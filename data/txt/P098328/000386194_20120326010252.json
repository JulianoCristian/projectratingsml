operation of the conditional cash transfer\n            program to enhance its effectiveness in reaching the poorest\n            and indigenous groups; (2) provide beneficiaries with an\n            incentive framework to increase their participation in the\n            conditional cash transfers (CCT) program, which would boost\n            their demand for education and maternal and infant health\n            services; (3) strengthen the supply of nutrition and child\n            growth promotion interventions in the indigenous areas of\n            the Red de Oportunidades Program (RO); and (4) enhance\n            government capacity to develop coherent and efficient social\n            sector policies and interventions on the basis of evidence.\n            This restructuring paper seeks the approval of the Country\n            Director for Panama to introduce the changes described below\n            to the project. Three changes are there for the project. The\n            first change is to reallocate resources across components\n            from those with slower execution due to institutional\n            constraints to those closely associated with the operational\n            implementation of the conditional cash transfer RO. This\n            will allow sufficient resources for the management,\n            monitoring and evaluation of the RO and for support to\n            health care promotion interventions in indigenous areas.\n            Changes in the category of expenses also include the\n            elimination of counterpart contribution requirement in\n            Operating Costs and the inclusion of eligible operating\n            cost. The elimination of the counterpart contribution will\n            be effective retroactively to January 1, 2011. The second\n            change is to extend the closing date for 18 months from the\n            original closing date of June 30, 2012 to December 31, 2013,\n            to allow for the completion of the impact evaluation of RO\n            and the basic health and nutrition services coverage\n            expansion strategy. The third change is to revise the\n            results framework and monitoring/indicators, including the\n            revision of one of the outcome indicators targets for the\n            Project Development Objective (PDO) due to more accurate\n            estimates obtained during supervision. The PDOs are not\n            affected by these changes. The delays in implementation have\n            resulted in the need to change some of the results\n            indicators and to drop others. The results framework and\n            monitoring matrix has detailed information about these\n            changes. Reallocation of the loan proceeds is necessary to\n            align the financial resources to the revisions to project\n            activities. In this restructuring, some of the funds allocated."}, "docdt": "2012-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
