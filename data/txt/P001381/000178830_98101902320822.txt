CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower    :  Kingdom of Lesotho
Amount      :  US$9.0 million (IDA); and US$2.2 million (EEC Special Action
Credit)
Terms       :  Standard IDA (for both Credits)
Project
Description:   The proposed project would include:
(i) Paving 24 km of the St. Michaels-Molimo Nthuse road;
(ii) consultant services for supervising (i) above;
(iii) improving road maintenance; (iv) technical assistance;
(v) fellowships; and (vi) feasibility study for the Oxbow-
Mokhotlong road (120 km). The Project would improve Lesotho's
national road network, and improve the road maintenance
capability of the Roads Branch of the Ministry of Works. The
project does not face any unusual risks. However, the main-
tenance program could be affected by inadequate and irregular
budgetary allocations to the Roads Branch. This risk has been
addressed by the Government's undertaking to give adequate
budgetary allocations to RB on the first day of each quarter in
the fiscal year.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON PROPOSED
CREDITS TO THE KINGDOM OF LESOTHO FOR
A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on two proposed
credits to the Kingdom of Lesotho for the equivalent of US$11.2 million on
standard IDA terms for a Third Highway Project. One credit of US$9.0 million
would be made from IDA resources; a second credit of about US$2.2 million
equivalent would be made from the EEC Special Action Account administered by
the Association in accordance with the terms of the agreement of May 2, 1978,
between the Association and the European Economic Community.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Economic Memorandum on
Lesotho"(No. 2251-LSO) was distributed to the Executive Directors in
February 1979. A report (No. 1688-EA) which examined migration in southern
Africa, and in particular, the migrant labor situation in Lesotho, was dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors in February 1978. Country data are shown
in Annex I.
3.        Lesotho is one of the UN-designated 'least developed' countries.
GNP per capita in 1977 was estimated at US$230. 1/ Completely landlocked by
the Republic of South Africa (RSA), the country is mountainous, soil erosion
is extensive, and less than 15 percent of its land area is suitable for crop
cultivation. Population pressure on land resources is intense. In 1977 the
population was estimated at 1.3 million, growing at 2.2 percent a year.
4.        The economy is dominated by subsistence agriculture and by temporary
migration for employment, mainly in South African mines. Subsistence agricul-
ture and livestock rearing are the main economic activities of about 90 per-
cent of the resident population and account for about 40 percent of domestic
product. The economy is also characterized by a critical dependence on South
Africa which accounts for (i) about 90 percent of Lesotho's merchandise trade
and tourist traffic; (ii) employment of about one-half of its male labor
force; (iii) migrant workers' remittances equivalent to about 60 percent of
the domestic product in 1977; and (iv) customs receipts from the Southern Africa
1/ GDP per capita was about US$125 in 1977. GNP substantially exceeds GDP
because of migrant workers' remittances.



- 2 -
Customs Union 1/ which account for almost 60 percent of total Government revenues.
The country's integtation with the South African economy has also been bolstered
by its membership in the Rand Monetary Area and by the country's use of the South
African rand as its currency.
5.        While Lesotho's lack of natural resources is a major constraint to its
development, its unique migrant labor situation remains the Government's most
formidable problem. About 165,000 Basotho are estimated to be employed as
migrant workers in South Africa; this contrasts sharply with only about 32,000
in wage employment in the domestic economy. Since there are few opportunities
for domestic earnings in Lesotho comparable to those in South African mines,
rapidly rising mine wages in recent years have spurred even greater migration.
Between 1970 and 1977, the number of Basotho workers in the mines increased by
40,000 while domestic wage employment is estimated to have grown by less than
10,000.
6.        Migration has provided substantial remittances which have become
critical to maintaining the living standards of a large segment of the popu-
lation; recent studies have shown that crop production now accounts for less
than 20 percent of rural household income. But continuing absence of such a
large proportion of the country's able-bodied male population has contributed
to (i) a domestic shortage of skilled and semi-skilled manpower; and (ii) a
decline in agricultural production, both of which compound the problem of long-
term economic development. Furthermore, the country is vulnerable to develop-
ments affecting migration in South Africa over which the Lescitho Government
has no control. For example, increasing mechanization in South African mines
and recruitment trends from other supplying countries and within South Africa
itself (the proportion of black South African workers in mining has increased
from 24 percent in 1973 to 50 percent in 1977) are expected to reduce future
demand for Basotho labor. With South Africa's policy of releasing migrants
back into the Lesotho labor market the pressure on domestic employment may
rapidly increase. Despite intensive research, the opportunities for creating
additional employment in the agricultural sector seem to be too limited to meet
a rapidly growing demand for domestic employment. In searching for alternatives,
the Lesotho Government, in 1977 with IDA support under the Second Highway
Project, established a labor-intensive construction unit within the Ministry
of Works, to explore the economic and technical feasibility of labor-intensive
public works as a means of substantially increasing domestic employment (para.28).
7.        Government development policy and programs as outlined in the Second
National Development Plan (1975/76-1979/80) are aimed at: (i) restoring the
viability of the agricultural sector; (ii) improving infrastructure, particu-
larly roads and communications between the mountain regions and the economically
1/ The Southern Africa Customs Union was established in 1910 (and revised in
1969 and 1976) among Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa and Swaziland. The
Agreement provides for free movement of goods among member countries, and
for revenue-sharing from a common pool of customs, excise and sales duties.

more developed lowlands; (iii) reiormwing the educational system to meet the
co,,rtry's developmennt neds; (iv) exp?-lirAing tre industrial base by strengthen-
ing the Lesotho Niational Developmnerit Corpora,ior., the country's main channel
for industrial inv,:-,ient; and (v) generally reducing the country's economic
dependence orn South Africa. The enmphasis of the Plan is well directed to the
country's main development problems, and the investment pattern, giving priority
to agriculture, infrastructure and education, reflects the basic needs of an
economy still at a very early stage of development.
8.        Recent economic growth has been satisfactory, despite sharp fluctua-
tions in agricultural output mainly because of unfavorable weather. Over the
1974/75-1977/78 period, output tripled in the Government and tourism sectors,
and increased tenfold in construction. Overall GDP is estimated to have
increased about seven percent a year in real terms. The expenditure pattern
highlights the countryts severe external dependence; the average level of
consumption exceeded the domestic product by about 75 percent, a situation
made possible by a substantial inflow of migrants' remittances (para. 4).
Total investment averaged 23 percent of GDP, compared to 14 percent in 1974/75,
reflecting a sustained rise in government construction activity, and private
investment in diamond mining.
9.        On the fiscal side, government revenue stagnated between 1974/75-
1976/77 at about R 30 million, as customs receipts declined, but jumped to
R 54 million in 1977/78 as customs receipts doubled after the 1976 revision
of the revenue-sharing formula of the Customs Agreement. Over the same period,
recurrent expenditure increased from R 19 million to R 45 million, implying a
growth rate of 34 percent a year in current prices, as a result of: (i) revisions
of public service wages and salaries in 1975 and again in 1977 partly to stem
the outflow of skilled workers to South Africa; (ii) continuing expansion of the
Government administration; and (iii) growing recurrent budgetary demands of an
expanding de'.,elopment 7rogr2m. Following a R 2 million deficit in 1976/77, the
recurrent budget realized a R 8 million surplus in 1977/78 which resulted mainly
from the sharp rise in customs receipts as well as in grants following Lesotho's
appeal in 1976 for additional assistance to strengthen its economy and reduce
its external dependence. In 1977/78, capital expenditure increased almost
fourfold over the 1974/75 level, as a result of improved implementation capacity,
stemming from a gradual buildup of local skilled manpower and operation of a
substantial technical assistance program.
10.       Lesotho's balance of payments is characterized by a chronic imbalance
in merchandise trade which is funded largely by migrants' remittances and
official transfers. Between 1974 and 1977, total merchandise imports increased
from R 74 million to about R 169 million, reflecting:  (i) the capital  goods
requirements of an expanding development program, (ii) a 20 percent increase
in the number of migrants in South Africa, and (iii) the import demand for
manufactured goods from rising household incomes due to increased migrants'
remittances. Over the same period, exports increased slightly from R 10 million
to R 12 million reflecting a stagnation in recorded exports of wool and mohair,
the main traditional export commodities. On the services account, net earnings



- 4 -
of migrants in 1977 were 2.5 times the 1974 level mainly as a result of rapidly
rising mine wages and increased migration, while net transfers doubled with the
surge in customs receipts. The overall balance of payments showed an average
deficit of R 5 million a year. However, this only partly reflects the country's
foreign reserves position, given the integration of the monetary system with
that of South Africa, and the substantial under-recording of external trans-
actions.
11.       Until 1975, the United Kingdom was the major source of financial
assistance, but during the last few years, a growing number of bilateral and
multilateral agencies have provided grants or concessionary credits for project
financing. At the end of December 1977, Lesotho's external debt (disbursed and
outstanding) was estimated at US$23 million; service obligations were US$0.5
million representing less than two percent of recurrent revenue (given Lesotho's
special monetary arrangements with South Africa, relating debt service payments
to recurrent revenue rather than to foreign exchange earnings is a more meaning-
ful concept of the country's debt service capacity). Over the next several
years, most of Lesotho's capital assistance is likely to continue as grants or
concessionary credits, and servicing of external public debt is expected to re-
main at about two percent of government recurrent revenue.
12.       Lesotho's medium-term economic outlook will be largely influenced by
the terms of its continuing economic arrangements with South Africa, parti-
cularly its membership in the Customs UJnion, and the level of future migration.
These uncertainties, including its delicate geopolitical situation, coupled
with the country's scarcity of natural resources, underline the difficult task
of development. While current revenue will continue to critically depend on
the Customs Union, the country's growing absorptive capacity and the recurrent
budgetary commitments of an expanding public investment program call for a more
rapid increase in revenue and greater diversification of revenue sources.
Although the Government is examining ways to increase internal revenue follow-
ing a recent IMF review of the fiscal system, given the country's narrow tax
base, these objectives can only be realized in the long term In the meantime,
donor agencies should consider financing in most projects not only all foreign
costs, but also a substantial part of local costs. If Lesotho is to sustain
its rate of economic development, it will need continuing external assistance
on grant and IDA terms.
PART II - BASK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       To date Lesotho has received seven IDA credits totalling US$35.2
million for seven projects. Two credits (US$11.6 million) in the agricultural
sector have helped to finance the Thaba Bosiu Rural Development project (1973)
and the first phase of the Basic Agricultural Services Program (1978). Both
projects aim to expand the availability of agricultural inputs and services to
small farmers in the traditional sector. Two credits (US$11.5 million) in the



educational sector have helped to expand Lesotho's vocational, technical and
commercial training capability as well as increase the availability of second-
ary education in the rural areas. Two credits (US$9.6 million) have helped
finance two roads projects which improved sections of Lesotho's major road
network and supported the initial operations of a labor-intensive construction
unit. Finally, one credit (US$2.5 million) has assisted Lesotho's industrial
development by providing financial assistance to the Lesotho National Develop-
ment Corporation (LNDC) and its subsidiary, the Basotho Enterprise Development
Corporation (BEDCO). As of December 31, 1978, IDA credits outstanding and
disbursed amounted to US$17 million, representing an estimated share of
Lesotho's total external debt (disbursed) of some 65 percent. Due to the fact
-hat most external aid in the past has been provided on grant terms, servicing
of IDA credits is estimated to have increased to about 20 percent of total
debt service at the end of 1977. Annex II contains a summary statement of TFC
investments and IDA credits and notes on the execution of the ongoing projects.
The country's capacity for project implementation has improved considerably
over the last few years. Consequently, the quality of implementation of Bank
Group assisted projects is reasonable.
14.       Future operations will continue to support the Government's develop-
ment objectives. A Water Supply project which is expected to be presented to
the Executive Directors later this month, would improve water services in
seven towns (Leribe, Mafeteng, Mohale's Hoek, Mokhotlong, Quthing, Roma and
Teyateyaneng). Preliminary discussions have been held on a possible third
rural development project, which may focus on land use, livestock and/or soil
conservation. The Bank Group also expects to continue its assistance to the
two financial intermediaries, LNDC and BEDCO and preparatory work is under
way for an urban development project. In addition, the Bank Group is review-
ing with the Government the need for a technical assistance project which
would focus on strengthening the Government's planning capability and manage-
ment of its parastatal organizations.
III. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
The Transport System
15.       Lesotho depends almost exclusively on road and air services for
internal transport. The country has no navigable rivers and no railway
except for a short (1 km) rail link operated by South African Railways to
connect Maseru to South Africa's rail system. For external transport, Lesotho
depends entirely on South Africa's well developed transport system, particu-
larly its road and rail networks.
Air Transport
16.       Apart from animal transport, domestic air transport provides the
only access to many isolated mountain areas. The country has 31 airfields,
two of which are paved. Only the airfield at Maseru has navigation and



- 6 --
communication equipment and terminal facilities, but because of the surround-
ing terrain it cannot accommodate large aircraft suitable for international
flights. To reduce its reliance on South African facilities for international
traffic, the Government plans to construct an international airport at Mazenod,
about 20 km from Maseru; however, the cost of construction and the financing
source are not yet known. Lesotho Airways Corporation, a government-owned
company, provides most of the country's internal air services. Two South
African-owned companies provide transport to and from South Africa mainly for
migrant workers, and South African Airways operates between Maseru and
Johannesburg on behalf of Lesotho Airways.
Road Transport
17.       The road network totals about 3,500 km, of which about 230 km are
paved, 1,200 km are gravel roads, and the remainder are dry-weather earth
roads and tracks. The network is inadequate both in length and condition.
This is particularly true in the eastern mountain region which is served by
only one engineered road, now being constructed with IDA assistance under the
Second Highway Project, and by tracks negotiable only by four-wheel drive
vehicles. Throughout the country, the network is poorly maintained due to a
shortage of qualified staff, inadequate funds, high costs for equipment rental
and a poorly organized equipment repair and maintenance system.
18.       Transport and traffic regulations are generally satisfactory but
are not strictly enforced. Single axle loads are limited by law to 18,000
lbs or about 8 tons and are in general observed. The vehicle fleet consisted
of about 9,300 units in 1975 and has been growing at an annual average rate
of 13 percent, with the fastest growth occurring in private car registration.
Transport Policy and Coordination
19.       Although in the past the transport policy was directed almost ex-
clusively to serving the main population and production centers along the
north-south lowland corridor on the western border, at present the policy,
as expressed in the second National Development Plan (1975/76-1979/80),
correctly emphasizes provision of all-weather links to the country's eastern
mountain areas, in order to develop their full social and economic potential
and to ensure their political and administrative integration. The plan also
stresses the importance of maintaining the existing economic infrastructure.
Furthermore, the Government aims at reducing its transport dependence on
South Africa as is indicated by the intention to construct its own inter-
national airport (para. 16).
20.       The Central Planning and Development Office (CPDO) of the Ministry
of Finance, Planning and Statistics is responsible for reviewing the transport
policy and planning proposals put forward by the Ministry of Works (MW) and
the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC). A transportation study,
carried out in 1974 with financing from the British Ministry of Overseas
Development (ODM), assessed the transport needs of the country and outlined



- 7 -
a ten-year road investment program which formed the basis for the road invest-
ments proposed in the current development plan. However, because the study's
recommendations and conclusions were largely confined to the roads sector, MTC
has recently requested financing from the Federal Republic of Germany to update
the findings of the 1974 study and to include an examination of rail and ferry
needs, freight and passenger transport requirements and rational fare structures
for these services.
Road Administration, Training and Financing
21.       The Roads Branch (RB) within MW is responsible for approximately
1,800 km of the road network while the Ministry of Rural Development and some
traders and missionaries carry out some minor works on part of the remaining
1,700 km. In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture and National Resources
has undertaken responsibility for the construction of about 670 km of feeder
roads under the Basic Agricultural Services Project (Credit 795-LSO). The
Central Mechanical Workshop and Plant Pool (CMW&PP) in the MW is in charge
of equipment maintenance and repair and provides equipment for hire to Govern-
ment agencies (including the Roads Branch).
22.       Both the Roads Branch and CMW&PP's operations are constrained by
the scarcity of trained Basotho and the departure of skilled personnel to
South Africa which pays substantially higher salaries. The shortage of
qualified engineers in RB is particularly severe and foreign expertise will
be relied upon for some time to come. CMW&PP's management is weak, making
its operations inefficient and costly. In addition, mechanics and equipment
operators are in short supply. Facilities in Lesotho are adequate to provide
training for mechanics and technicians, although further practical on-the-job
training is usually necessary. The number of locally trained technicians
would be adequate to satisfy the needs of RB and CMW&PP if the staff so trained
were willing to remain in Lesotho. During negotiations the delegation ex-
plained the measures the Government is taking to reduce the number of skilled
Basotho going to South Africa. While this number, as a result, is reported to
be declining, the Government would continue to take appropriate measures to
retain key personnel for implementing the project (Section 3.01(b) of the
draft Credit Agreement). In addition, the ODM is expected to provide assist-
ance for strengthening CMW&PP operations at its head office and central
mechanical workshop in Maseru. Since the ODM assistance although not part
of the project, is essential, its availability to the borrower would be a
condition for effectiveness of the IDA Credit Agreement (para. 48).
23.       Investments in the highway subsector have increased dramatically
from R 0.3 million in FY74/75 to an estimated R 2.1 million in FY77/78.
Over 90 percent of these funds were provided by external donors. Recurrent
expenditures amounted to R 1.7 million in 1977/78 and have increased at an
annual average rate of about 21 percent in the past five years, comprising
almost four percent of the total Government recurrent budget. However,
allocations are still inadequate to maintain the network and the release of
funds, which is supposed to be on a quarterly basis, is often significantly



- 8 -
delayed because of cumbersome administrative procedures. To overcome this
problem the Government will provide R 3 million for RB's road maintenance in
FY79, and for subsequent years, during project implementation, the Govern-
ment will discuss RB's budget requirements for road maintenance with IDA
before December 31 each year. Adequate budgetary allocation would be made
available to RB on a quarterly basis on the first day of each quarter of each
fiscal year (Section 4.02(c) of the draft IDA Credit Agreement).
24.       Road users contribute to Government revenues through vehicle regis-
tration and licensing and through customs duties and fees and taxes on fuel,
lubricants, motor vehicles and components. Due to Lesotho's participation
in the Southern Africa Customs Union, customs and sales duties on goods
produced within the area are paid into a central revenue pool. Total trans-
port-related revenues attributable to road users cannot be calculated
precisely, but for the last few years it is estimated that revenues have
substantially exceeded road administration and maintenance expenditures.
Maintenance
25.       The Roads Branch's regional district offices are responsible for
maintaining all roads under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Works.  RB
rents maintenance equipment from the CMW&PP. The CMW&PP, however, suffers
from a poor equipment management system, lack of adequate workshops, shortages
of spare parts, and inadequate preventive equipment maintenance. As a result
of these factors and RB's somewhat haphazard demand for equipment because of
discontinuities in budget releases, equipment utilization rates have only been
50 percent of possible levels. Rental rates are consequently high since they
include high overhead costs, and these rates in turn make RB's maintenance
operations costly. However, with the introduction of a continuous road main-
tenance program under the project, CMW&PP's equipment will henceforth be used
continuously which should result in lower rental rates than those currently
charged by CMW&PP. The Government will review CMW&PP's equipment rental rates
based on a continuous annual utilization rate and will communicate its findings
to the Association by the end of May 1979.
26.       As noted above, road maintenance has been neglected; however, the
Government is trying to improve the situation and with financing from the
African Development Fund engaged constultants (Brian Colquhoun and Partners
of the UK) to assess the organizational, personnel, workshop, equipment and
financial requirements for adequate maintenance of the road network.
Consultants Hugh O'Donnell and Partners (UK) were engaged to make proposals
to improve CMW&PP operations. Both studies have now been completed. However,
the Government lacks the capacity and funds to carry out the consultants' re-
commendations for improvement of RB and CMW&PP operations and to reduce the
backlog of regravelling work. The proposed project is aimed at resolving this
problem (paras. 33 and 34).

Bank Group Assistance
27.       The Bank seeks to assist the Government in expanding the road net-
work in order to make economically important areas more accessible, and in
improving road maintenance over the entire road network. In addition, to
help increase employment opportunities in Lesotho, labor-intensive methods
of road improvement and maintenance are being employed when these are com-
petitive with equipment-intensive methods.
28.       There have been two Bank Group road transportation projects in
Lesotho. The First Highway Project (Credit 82-BL, US$4.1 million), executed
between 1967-69, included the construction of part of the main north-south
road and a gravel feeder road. The work was completed satisfactorily for
less than the estimated cost, and the savings were used to pave an additional
section of the main road. The Second Highway Project (Credit 619-LSO, US$5.5
million, 1976) provides for construction to all-weather gravel standard of a
147 km section of the main west-east road linking St. Michaels to Thaba Tseka
in the eastern mountain area. The project also includes establishment of a
Labor-Intensive Construction Unit on a pilot basis, primarily to explore this
potential for using labor-intensive techniques and to lay a framework for deal-
ing with any sudden return of Basotho workers from South Africa. The unit,
which presently employs a labor force of about 450 people, has already completed
some air strip construction and road improvement works, and in the future it
will carry out further road improvement work under the proposed project (see
para. 33), as well as some fishpond construction and land terracing. Work is
progressing satisfactorily and an inventory of projects suitable for labor-
intensive work methods has been identified. This is a modest beginning.
Nevertheless, important lessons are being learned and on-the-job training is
being provided for local staff who would form the nucleus of the organization
for expanding these operations in the future.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       The project was prepared by the Government with the assistance of
consultants and Bank Group staff. The Government's request for IDA assist-
ance was received in April 1978, and the project was appraised in the field
in June 1978. Negotiations were held in Washington from January 15 to 18,
1979. The Lesotho delegation was led by the late Mr. Mapetla, then Permanent
Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
30.       A report entiled "Staff Appraisal Report, Third Highway Project,
Kingdom of Lesotho" (No. 2200a-LSO, dated February 2, 1979) is being dis-
tributed separately.

Project Description and Objectives
31.       The objective of the project is to assist the Govermnent in improv-
ing the country's road infrastructure and related administrative institutions,
through: (i) upgrading the main road network; (ii) improving highway main-
tenance; (iii) technical assistance; (iv) equipment, spare parts, and
materials; and (v) preparing future highway projects. Specifically the
project would comprise:
(a) paving (including supervision) the St. Michaels--Molimo Nthuse
road (about 24 km);
(b)  establishing and operating three regravelling brigades for road
maintenance;
(c) constructing and equipping workshops and offices and providing
housing for staff;
(d) technical assistance for: (i) setting up an appropriate
administrative structure for road maintenance; (ii) estab-
lishing and implementing a road improvement and maintenance
program; and (iii) on-the-job training of local staff;
(e) fellowships; and
(f) feasibility study and, if justified, detailed engineering of
the Oxbow-Mokhotlong road (120 km).
Detailed Features
32.       Road Pavement.  The project would provide for paving of about 24 km
of the St. Michaels-Molimo Nthuse section of the St. Michaels-Mantsonyane-Thaba
Tseka Road now being improved to gravel standard under the Second Highway
Project. However, it is now apparent that heavy rains and the rugged terrain,
are causing serious deterioration of the gravel surface and necessitating costly
repair work after each rainy season. Paving (a double bituminous treatment over
a 5 m width) now appears to be the most economic method of handling the problem.
Consultants would supervise the work.
33.       Improvement of Road Maintenance.  To assist the Government in im-
proving the condition of its road network by reducing its backlog of re-
gravelling operations, the project would provide for the establishment and
operation over the three-year period of one equipment-intensive and two labor-
intensive road regravelling brigades. The work would consist of the earthwork
for improving the road alignment, spreading a gravel layer and constructing
drainage facilities and ditches for about 600 km of the country's most important



- 11 -
gravel roads. The proposed project would finance some equipment purchases,
equipment rental, spare parts, fuel and imported materials, technical assist-
ance for a central administrative unit to plan and supervise operations and
wages for laborers for the labor-intensive brigades.
34.       The project also would strengthen the Government's routine main-
tenance by reorganizing and improving the administrative units responsible.
The present organization, which consists of two regional offices, would be
restructured and a third regional office would be established. About 30
maintenance crews would be set up to carry out daily maintenance operations
for gravel roads, such as patching road surfaces, repairing shoulders, and
clearing and repairing ditches. The project would provide equipment and
technical assistance to set up these crews and to strengthen RB's staff in
planning, organizing and supervising regional operations. The Government has
prepared detials, which are satisfactory to the Association, of the new organiza-
tional structure of RB's regional offices; office and housing requirements for
RB staff; the number and type of maintenance crews to be established; length of
roads to be maintained by them; and staff, equipment and budgetary requirements
for regional operations.
35.       Workshops and Office Buildings.  The project would provide for con-
structing of offices and housing for staff for the three regional mechanical
workshops and for staff of RB's regional maintenance units in Leribe, Thaba Tseka
and Mohale's Hoek. The project also would provide for the required office equip-
ment, workshop equipment and tools. Details of requirements for workshops, staff
housing, workshop tools and equipment, local staff and training have been prepared
by the Government and are satisfactory to the Association.
36.       Technical Assistance and Fellowships. The proposed project would
finance about 324 man-months of technical assistance to help overcome RB
and CMW&PP's shortage of qualified staff by filling senior positions in RB's
new maintenance structure, organizing and supervising CMW&PP's equipment
maintenance and repair operations at the regional workshops, and by providing
training to Basotho staff. Terms and conditions of employment, qualifications
and experience of personnel to be employed would be satisfactory to IDA
(Section 3.02 of the draft IDA Credit Agreement). The project also would
provide fellowships to train abroad suitably qualified Basotho in civil and
mechanical engineering and in specialized aspects of highway maintenance
and equipment repair. The number and specialties of these fellowships would
be identified in agreement with the Association (Section 3.03 of the draft
IDA Credit Agreement). The Government will appoint suitable local staff and
counterparts to work with technical assistance personnel (Section 3.01(b) of
the draft IDA Credit Agreement).
37.       Studies.  The project would include financing of a feasibility
study, and if construction is economically justified, detailed engineering,
of the Oxbow-Mokhotlong Road (120 km). This road, which links the western
lowlands and foothills with the eastern mountain district center at Mokhotlong,
is at present a track passable only by four-wheel drive vehicles. Construction



- 12 -
of the road to all-weather standards which would integrate much of the
mountain area with the rest of the counatry is one of the Government's
highest priorities.
Cost Estimates and Financing
38.       The total project cost is estimated at US$12.6 million equivalent
(excluding taxes of US$0.5 million), of which the foreign expenditure is
about US$7.8 million. Physical contingencies of 10 percent have been allowed
for all items; price contingencies for civil works have been calculated at
7.5 percent for 1979, and 7 percent per year thereafter through 1982, and
for equipment 6.5 percent for 1979 and 6 percent per year thereafter through
1982. The Government would contribute US$1.4 million equivalent (11 percent
of total project costs). The proposed US$9.0 million IDA Credit would finance
71 percent of costs, and a Credit of about US$2.2 million from the EEC Special
Action Account, about 17 percent. IDA and EEC Special Action Account financing
will be provided on parallel basis. The main items to be financed by IDA and
the EEC are indicated in para. 42.
Organization and Implementation
39.       The Ministry of Works, assisted by consultants, would be respon-
sible overall for project execution. Work on the paving of St. Michaels-
Molimo Nthuse road would be by contractor. It is expected to start in July
1979 and take about one month to complete. Regravelling operations will be
carried out by force account. A three-year road improvement program out-
lined by the Government is expected to start in October 1979. This program
will be updated annually and be submitted to the Association for approval
three months before the beginning of each year's work program (Section 3.07
of the draft IDA Credit Agreement). RB's three regional offices will be
responsible for preparing an annual maintenance work program and budgetary
requirements on the basis of a road inventory and traffic counts before the
beginning of each fiscal year; they will also be required to mlaintain detailed
records of the scope of maintenance operations and the costs in their regions
(Sections 4.01 and 4.02(b) of the draft IDA Credit Agreement).
40.       Completion of the project is expected by September 30, 1982.  Within
six months of the Closing Date the Government will prepare a project comple-
tion report (Section 3.05(c) of the draft IDA Credit Agreement and Section
3.04(c) of the draft EEC Special Action Credit Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
41.       The contract for paving the St. Michaels-Molimo Nthuse road will be
awarded on the basis of ICB. Materials and supplies will be bulked as far as
possible and procured through international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group guidelines.  Equipment and tools financed under the EEC Special



- 13 -
Action Credit also will be bulked as far as possible and procured in accord-
ance with Schedule III of the EEC Special Action Credit Agreement which
limits bidding to EEC member countries and IDA member countries which are
eligible to receive Special Action Credits. Contracts for groups of equip-
ment, tools, materials and supplies costing less than US$50,000 but not
exceeding a total of US$200,000 under each of the IDA and EEC credits, will
be awarded on the basis of quotations from at least three suppliers.  Con-
struction of workshops, housing for staff and office buildings will be carried
out by contractors following local competitive bidding, and technical assist-
ance and consultants will be recruited on terms and conditions acceptable to
IDA (Section 2.03 of the draft IDA Credit and EEC Special Action Credit
Agreements).
42.       IDA funds will be disbursed as follows:  (i) 85 percent of total costs
for civil works; (ii) 85 percent of total costs for spare parts, fuel for one
equipment-intensive regravelling brigade, and materials for two such brigades;
(iii) 85 percent of total costs for spare parts, fuel, materials, transport of
materials, and laborers' wages for two labor-intensive regravelling brigades;
(iv) 85 percent of total costs for workshops, offices and staff housing; and
(v) 100 percent of total costs for technical assistance. EEC funds will be
disbursed as follows: (a) 95 percent of total costs for equipment and tools;
and (b) 85 percent of total costs for engineering and feasibility studies.
Disbursements against(i), (iv), (v), (a) and (b) above would be fully documented.
Disbursements against (ii) and (iii) above would be made against certificates
of expenditure, the documentation of which would be retained for inspection by
IDA supervision missions.
Justification, Benefits and Risks
43.       The project will provide significant benefits to a large proportion
of the population of Lesotho. The road maintenance and technical assistance
program, which accounts for about 86 percent of the total project costs, would
improve road maintenance operations along the entire gazetted road network
(about 1,800 km). It would directly benefit the great majority of the people
by reducing the cost of transport, increasing the reliability of the network
by ensuring that roads remain passable throughout the year and providing
better access to administrative and social facilities. Benefits from paving
the road section from St. Michaels to Molimo Nthuse (which accounts for about
nine percent of the total project cost) would accrue principally in the form
of reduced vehicle operating costs and reduced maintenance costs. The popula-
tion in the St. Michaels-Molimo Nthuse area estimated to number about 16,000
will benefit most directly.
44.       The economic rate of return from the equipment-intensive road re-
gravelling component constituting about 30 percent of the total project costs
is estimated at 58 percent; the labor-intensive regravelling works to be
carried out on routes with less traffic than the equipment-intensive routes



- 14 -
and constituting about 24 percent of total project costs would yield an eco-
nomic rate of return of 32 percent; the road paving component of the project
yields an economic rate of return of 15 percent. Sensitivity analysis on the
returns to paving the road from St. Michaels to Molimo Nthuse indicates that
a 10 percent increase in cost or a 10 percent decrease in benefits would re-
duce the rate of return to 11 percent or 13 percent, respectively.  The
aggregate economic rate of return for road regravelling and road paving com-
ponents, which comprise 63 percent of the total project costs, is 42 percent.
45.       The main project risks are:  (i) a slower than planned rate of
implementation, should the Government be unable to employ, train and retain
qualified staff; and (ii) inadequate or late releases of funds for road
maintenance, which could hamper timely project implementation. To reduce
the first risk, the project includes substantial technical assistance. More-
over the Government would continue to take appropriate measures to enable
the Roads Branch and Central Mechanical Workshop and Plait Pool to retain key
personnel (Section 3.01(b) of the draft IDA Credit Agreement). Regarding the
problems of road maintenance funding which in the past generally has been
inadequate and irregular, the Government will in the future provide an
adequate and timely budget allocation to the Roads Branch at the beginning
of each quarter of the fiscal year (Section 4.02(c) of the draft IDA Credit
Agreement).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUJMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of
Lesotho and the Association, the draft EEC Special Action Credit Agreement
between the Kingdom of Lesotho and the International Development Association
as administrator of the EEC Special Action Account established with funds
contributed by the member states of the EEC, and the Recommendation of the
Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
47.       Features of special interest are referred to in Section III of
Anrnex III of this report.
48.       Special conditions for effectiveness of the IDA Credit Agreement
would be: (i) availability to the borrower of ODM assistance to strengthen
CMW&PP; and (ii) all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the EEC
Special Action Credit Agreement have been met other than the effectiveness
of the IDA Credit Agreement. A special condition of effectiveness of the
Special Action Credit Agreement would be that all conditions precedent to
the effectiveness of the IDA Credit Agreement have been met other than the
effectiveness of the EEC Special Action Credit Agreement.
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed IDA Credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and that the EEC Special



- 15 -
Action Credit would comply with the criteria established by the Agreement of
May 2, 1978 between the Association and the European Economic Community.
PART VI - RECOMHENDATION
50.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credits.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 497-LSO   Education I Project; US$4.0 million; July 25, 1974;
Effectiveness Date: January 23, 1975; Closing
Date: March 31, 1979.
The project is proceeding satisfactorily and is expected to be com-
pleted shortly and accounts and withdrawals finalized by the March 31, 1979
credit closing date. Educational objectives are expected to be realized when
the physical facilities are completed and put into use. Costs are within the
original appraisal estimates.
Credit No. 619-LSO   Second Highway Project; US$5.5 million; March 10, 1976;
Effectiveness Date: July 28, 1976; Closing
Date: December 31, 1980.
The project is proceeding satisfactorily. The civil works contract
is progressing in accordance with the implementation schedule agreed at nego-
tiations. The Labor-Intensive Construction Unit (LCU) component which started
about four months behind schedule, mainly due to delay in selection of consul-
tants, is now operational. Practically all the funds earmarked for the LCU
have been committed.
Credit No. 702-LSO   Development Finance Company Project (DFC); US$2.5 million;
May 20, 1977; Effectiveness Date: August 23, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
So far US$900,000 have been committed. Because of management changes
and delays in recruiting key staff, LEDC has made slow progress in improving
its organization, staffing, procedures, and portfolio. LNDC's financial situa-
tion has not yet improved, but it will continue to get financial support from
the Government as expected.
1/  These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

Credit No. 748-LSO   Second Education Project:  US$7.5 million; November 30,
1977; Effectiveness Date:  March 30, 1978; Closing
Date: December 31, 1981.
The project was declared effective March 30, 1978, about one month
beyond the originally specified date, February 28, 1978. Delays in project
execution are directly related to staffing of the architectural team which
has affected the credit's effectiveness and also implementation. Since the
project architect has been hired the progress has been good. Plans for the
National Curriculum Development Center at Leribe are well advanced, and
design work is progressing well for all the other project components. Procure-
ment preparations for furniture and equipment have been initiated. The
Project Unit established to administer Credit 497-LSO is also responsible for
implementing the second project.
Credit No. 795-LSO   Basic Agricultural Services Project:  US$6.0 million;
May 25, 1978; Effectiveness Date: August 3, 1978;
Closing Date: March 31, 1985.
The project continues to make good progress with its recruitment and
building program. The training of agricultural staff has now been started at
a newly developed center at Leribe. There appears to be an increasing aware-
ness on the part of the Ministry of Agriculture of the need to provide an agreed
set of guidelines to agricultural extension staff, but action has not yet been
taken to withdraw the widely conflicting official recommendations now being
given. BASP is slowly being drawn into a more central role in the Ministry but
is not yet in a position to decisively influence agricultural strategy. The
marketing component of the project is being reviewed by BASP Management in the
light of the declining volume of produce being handled by the Produce Marketing
Corporation and its consequent financial difficulties.
