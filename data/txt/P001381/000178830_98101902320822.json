km of the St. Michaels-Molimo Nthuse road; (ii)\n            consultant services for supervising above; (iii) improving\n            road maintenance; (iv) technical assistance; (v)\n            fellowships; and (vi) feasibility study for the\n            Oxbow-Mokhotlong road (120 km). The Project would improve\n            Lesotho's national road network, and improve the road\n            maintenance capability of the Roads Branch of the Ministry\n            of Works. The project does not face any unusual risks.\n            However, the maintenance program could be affected by\n            inadequate and irregular budgetary allocations to the Roads\n            Branch. This risk has been addressed by the\n            Government's undertaking to give adequate budgetary\n            allocations to RB on the first day of each quarter in the\n            fiscal year."}, "docdt": "1979-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
