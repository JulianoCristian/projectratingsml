The ETP has three\n            objectives: stabilization, structural reform towards the\n            establishment of a market economy to improve resource\n            allocation and restore growth, and the progressive\n            restoration of creditworthiness. The ETP represents a\n            program combining stabilization and structural change,\n            including a radical liberalization of the trade regime as\n            well as pricing. The ETP also includes a medium-term\n            macroeconomic framework and external financing strategy. The\n            microeconomic core program comprises three main components:\n            (a) enterprise restructuring, privatization, private sector\n            development, with appropriate legislation to impose\n            financial discipline and establish an adequate institutional\n            framework for enterprise restructuring, including stricter\n            environmental standards; (b) financial sector reform, with\n            emphasis on improved banking regulation and supervision,\n            introduction of adequate accounting and auditing standards,\n            and strengthening and phase re-structuring of the banking\n            system; and (c) social safety net, with emphasis on adequate\n            unemployment benefits, employment services, training, a\n            program of minimum social assistance, and improvement of\n            health policy."}, "docdt": "1990-07-10T00:00:00Z"}
