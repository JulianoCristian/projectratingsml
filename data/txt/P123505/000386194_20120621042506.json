management policies so as\n            to foster the efficient and effective implementation of\n            public sector expenditure programs. This will be achieved by\n            (i) supporting Mexico's integrated risk management\n            approach, (ii) promoting the institutionalization of risk\n            mitigation policies, and, (iii) highlighting critical\n            elements of Mexico's risk management framework. The\n            operation contains three policy areas. (1) Budget stability\n            and transparency will improve fiscal and public debt\n            management practices and enhance budget stability and\n            transparency; (2) Natural disaster risk management will\n            improve the Government's ability to respond to natural\n            disasters and mitigate the impact of natural disaster costs\n            on the budget; and (3) Subnational debt management will\n            enhance fiscal and debt sustainability of state and\n            municipal governments."}, "docdt": "2012-02-09T00:00:00Z"}
