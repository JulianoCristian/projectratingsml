for the Fiscal Risk Management\n            Development Policy Loan (DPL) Project for Mexico were as\n            follows: outcomes were not applicable, risk to development\n            outcome was not applicable, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit\n            (SHCP) did not sign the loan on the grounds that it was\n            unable to enter into a contrato de mandato with the\n            financial agent National Savings and Financial Services Bank\n            (BANSEFI) (required for loan effectiveness) without\n            previously assigning the responsibility of loan\n            implementation to an entity within SHCP or the federal\n            public administration. The policy and institutional actions\n            supported under the fiscal risk management DPL were also\n            maintained and eventually expanded by the new administration\n            that took office in December 2012, though the change of\n            administration (and staffing of several government offices)\n            did not facilitate the assignment of the responsibility of\n            loan implementation. The Mexican public administration\n            requires that responsibility for program coordination is\n            assigned to a single, specific department or unit within the\n            administration, even though support provided through DPL to\n            a program of policy and institutional actions is often\n            implemented by different areas of government."}, "docdt": "2014-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
