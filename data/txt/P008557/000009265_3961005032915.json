inputs and health care supplies; (iii) support foreign\n            exchange markets and allow the private sector access to\n            foreign exchange; and (iv) catalyze the provision of\n            technical assistance and balance of payments support by\n            other donors. The loan consists of: (i) a direct imports\n            component which is expected to finance mainly imports in the\n            energy, agriculture, industry, and health sectors; (ii) a\n            foreign exchange component to support the access of\n            enterprises to the foreign exchange market; and (iii)\n            technical assistance for the implementation of the reform\n            program and of the project itself, insofar as such funding\n            is not available on a timely basis from concessional sources."}, "docdt": "1993-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
