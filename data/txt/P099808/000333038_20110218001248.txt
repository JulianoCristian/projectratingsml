7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The overall development objective of the project is to minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry
industry in Georgia by HPAI and other zoonoses in domestic poultry, and to prepare for, control, and
respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans. To achieve this, three
areas would be supported by the project: (i) prevention; (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response
and containment.



7b. Revised Project Development Objectives/Outcomes [if applicable]
                GEORGIA AVIAN INFLUENZA CONTROL & HUMAN PANDEMIC
                     PREPAREDNESS & RESPONSE PROJECT, P099808

          IDA CREDIT 4179-GE; IDA GRANT H228-GE; JAPANESE GRANT TF056631


                                         RESTRUCTURING PAPER


1.         The closing date for the Georgia Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic
           Preparedness and Response Project (IDA Credit 4179 GE; IDA Grant H228 GE; Japanese
           Grant TF056631) (P099808) will be extended from February 28, 2011 until June 30, 2011.


2.         The Project Development Objective continues to be attainable, with noteworthy results and
           positive outcomes already achieved. Project implementation is progressing well, reflected in
           a moderately satisfactory rating for implementation progress. $4.58 million or 50% of total
           project financing (IDA credit, IDA grant and Japanese grant) have been disbursed. Financial
           management performance is satisfactory with good internal controls and there are no overdue
           audits. Financial covenants have been complied with.
3.         The proposed extensioni is necessary to allow additional time for remaining project activities
           to be completed. The project implementation has been slow due to some implementation
           delays, in part caused by recent staff turnover in the implementation units and procurement
           delays. During the last mission, the team agreed with the implementation units on a detailed
           action plan for the project. The Government has revised the Project Action Plan to reflect an
           updated implementation schedule to complete Project activities by June 30, 2011. The
           project team fully supports the request as the proposed extension would provide the time
           needed to fully achieve Project objectives.
4.         This will be the second extension of the project and would bring the total extension period to
           22 months.
