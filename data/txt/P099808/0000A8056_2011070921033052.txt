                         The overall development objective of the project is to minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry industry in Georgia by HPAI and other zoonoses in
                         domestic poultry, and to prepare for, control, and respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans. To achieve this, three
                         areas would be supported by the project: (i) prevention; (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project became effective on August 8, 2006. Currently the project has disbursed US$ 1.91 million (47.9% of total funds) under the IDA credit, US$ 2.43 million (60.9% of total
                         funds) under the IDA grant, and US$ 0.82 million (58.7% of total funds) under the PHRD implementation grant. The AHI grant of US$ 1.6 million was fully disbursed and closed on
                         January 29, 2010. Out of the total credit and grant amount provided, the Project disbursed 61.6% as of May 31, 2011. Given the current commitments and envisaged further

                         US$ 1.6 equivalent (XDR 500,000 under each of the IDA credit and IDA grant) was reserved under the compensation fund and it will not be disbursed. The Government has

                         previously indicated its preference to retain this amount as uncommitted, and use it only in the event of an outbreak. The project was extended the second time for four months, from
                         February 28, 2011 to June 30, 2011, with a total extension period of 22 months. The project ratings for both Implementation Progress (IP) and achieving the Development Objective
                         (DO) remain Moderately Satisfactory (MS). The overall development objective of the project has been achieved and this is best demonstrated by the exemplary Georgian response to
                         the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. The reasons for the MS ratings are the slow implementation pace (due to factors explained below), the lack of approval of the compensation fund and
                         legislation, and the fact that some few minor activities were not fully completed. The project funds were not fully utilized mainly due to project savings and because other donors
                         picked up and financed project activities with additional grant funds.
