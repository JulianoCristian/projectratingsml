Project aims to\n            minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry industry\n            in Georgia by the \"Avian flu\" and other\n            communicable diseases that are transferable between humans\n            and domestic poultry, and to prepare for, control, and\n            respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease\n            emergencies in humans. To achieve this, project support is\n            in three areas: (1) prevention; (2) preparedness and\n            planning; and (3) response and containment. There are three\n            project components. Component 1 has three subcomponents that\n            1) strengthen the regulatory and institutional environment;\n            develop detailed implementation guidelines and manuals as\n            part of a national action and contingency plan; and\n            establish a national compensation policy and fund; and\n            strengthen disease monitoring and containment, diagnostic\n            capacity and disease surveillance, and animal disease\n            information systems; 2) enhance public health program\n            planning and coordination, the national public health\n            surveillance systems, and the health system response\n            capacity; and 3) promote awareness and improve coordination\n            to implement the contingency plans and the National\n            \"Avian flu\" strategy."}, "docdt": "2006-05-04T00:00:00Z"}
