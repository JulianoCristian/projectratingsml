Project development objective Re$ PAD B.2, TechnicalAnnex 3
The overall development objective ofthe project is to minimize the threat posedto humans andthe
poultry industryin Georgia by HPAIand other zoonoses indomestic poultry, and to prepare for, control,
and respondto influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies inhumans. To achieve this,
three areas would be supported bythe project: (i)   prevention; (ii)preparednessand planning; and (iii)
responseandcontainment.

Project description[one-sentence summary of each component] Re$ PAD B.3.a, TechnicalAnnex 4

Component 1-Animal Health.

(A)       StrengtheningNational HPIA PreparednessandPrevention Capability

A1:Strengtheningthe Regulatory andInstitutional Environment sub-component will support activities
aimedat aligning and strengtheningthe legal andregulatory framework that governs the national
 capability to implement the recommended diseasedetection, control, prevention, containment and
 eradication measuresina uniform and effective way and inaccordancewith OIE standards and
 guidelines.

 A2: NationalAction and ContingencyPlan sub-component will provide support to detailrequired
 activities on all levels and to develop the necessarydetailedimplementation guidelines and manuals for
 all relevant agencies and services.

 A3: Establishment of a National Compensation Policy and Fundsub-component would support the
 development o f implementation arrangements (financing, fiduciary aspects, eligibility criteria, payment
 arrangements, flow of funds, etc.) for a compensation fund and ensurethat all key players are sufficiently
 trained inconductingthe compensation payments on the local level.

 (B) Strengthening DiseaseSurveillance, Diagnostic, and Containment Capacity

 B1:Strengthening the DiseaseMonitoringand Containment System. Targeted support will beprovided
 to strengthenthe public veterinary services as to bringthem inline with OLE standards.

 B2: Strengthening Diagnostic Capacity and a Disease Surveillance Network sub-component would be
 targeted to strengthening the diagnostic capacity that needs to feed into the laboratory system.

 B3: Strengthening Animal Disease Information Systems. Project assistancewill be provided to improve
 the reportingo f animalhealthinformation from the field and the flow of information among relevant

igencies.

Component 2 HumanHealth Component
               -
:A)EnhancingPublic HealthProgramPlanningand Coordination.

The project would provide support to detail requiredsections onthe context andepidemiological
inderpinningso f an eventual influenza pandemic, the current legislative andregulatory basis for
intervention, vigilance through routine surveillance and its implementation arrangements, case finding
mdascertainment through serological testing and virological subtyping, preventionthrough
immunization, symptomatic case management with anti-viral drugs.

(B)Strengtheningo fNational Public HealthSurveillance Systems

B1:Improvemento f LaboratoryNetworks. The project support wouldbe targeted primarilyto strengthen
the diagnostic capacity. Under this sub-component, financing will be available to upgrade existing
national reference laboratory inTbilisi (NRL), including design, renovation and upgrade to Bio-Safety
Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory with concomitant physical containment requirements (P3), required for virus
isolation and sub-typingto determine various strains.

B2: Improvemento f Health Information Systems sub-component will support technical assistanceand
complementary investments neededto strengthen the areas o f surveillance, communications, and
information technology at the different levels of the healthcare systemneededto support country's
preparednessand capacity to respond to avian influenza and other infectious disease outbreaks and to
fast-track available treatments for the disease.

(C)Strengthening Health SystemResponseCapacity

C1: Social DistancingMeasures. The project would support the implementation o f immediate term
responses the classic "social distancing measures"--such as school closings, backedupby a well-
           --
designed communication strategy.

C2: Vaccination and DrugTherapy. Vaccinationremains the most effective measure to prevent and
control apandemic. Support would be provided for expanding regular seasonal fluvaccination as a vital
step to preventan outbreak among humans. Also, support would be provided for the purchase and
distribution of anti-viral drugs inaccordance withWHO guidelines and arrangements, determine the
susceptibility of the pandemic strain to existing influenza antiviral drugs and target use of available
supplies; adoption of measuresto avoid inappropriate use to limit the development o f antiviral resistance
and ensure that this limitedresource i s used effectively.

C3:Medical Services. Support would be provided for the development o fplans to establish specialized
unitsinselectedhospitals and increasebedavailability incase ofapandemicthrough more stringent
triage for admission and earlier discharge with follow-up by home health care personnel, development
and/or updating o f treatment guidelines and hospitalinfection control guidelines and measures, including
antibiotic stocks, mobilization of additional healthpersonnel, training o f healthpersonnel, provision of
equipment,drugs, vaccines, and other medical inputs, diagnostic reagents, includingkits.

Component 3 - Strategic Communications.

This component is designed to promote awarenessandimproved coordinationofthe execution of the
contingency plans and the National HPAI strategy. It i s designedto safeguardhumanhealthand to

facilitate surveillance andmonitoring for outbreaks by improvingpublic awarenessand information.
Under this component, support wouldbeprovided for the development of strategiesto promote public
awarenessand improved coordination ofthe execution of the national HPAIresponses strategiesand
plans.

1.       Georgia i s a small country with a population o f 4.6 million people, bordered by the Black Sea to
the west, Russia to the north, Turkey and Armenia to the south and Azerbaijan to the east. Georgia's
location places it at extreme risk for the spread o f HighlyPathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). Georgia's
border with Turkey i s near the regions in eastern Turkey with a highnumber o f reported outbreaks (13
separate outbreaks indomestic poultry as o f the end o f January). A major migratory bird flyway crosses
from this direction over Georgia. Another flyway from the north crosses over Georgia's long border with
Russia, where outbreaks in seven regions have been reported, with recent outbreaks in three regions
bordering Georgia. The length o f that border, the fact that it traverses difficult mountainous terrain and
two conflict zones, complicates surveillance efforts for the disease. Finally, the recent outbreak in wild
fowl and domestic birds and the five human deaths from HPAI in Azerbaijan show the tragic and critical
nature o f the threat facing Georgia and its neighbors.

2,       Agriculture plays a key role inGeorgia's economy contributing about 20 percent o f GDP in 2005
and accounting for about 50 percent o f employment. Agriculture production i s predominately small
holder, though commercial farming i s growing in importance. One growth area in agriculture i s poultry
production, both in terms o f egg and meat production, though its contribution to the GDP i s still quite
small at about 1.6% o f GDP in 2004. About 90 percent o f poultry are owned by households, and
contribute significantly to the income o f rural, often poor families. Commercial production has grown by
over ten times in the last five years, with some 20 large to medium commercial poultry farms producing
both eggs and meat. Inall an estimated, 10,000 people are employed in commercial poultry production
and trade.

 3.      Georgia reported its first case o f Avian Flu on February 21, 2006 when a dead swan found at a
 lake in the Ajara region tested positive to a test using a real time PCR test. A second migratory bird
 tested positive the following day, and the Government declared a State o f Emergency in Ajara. It
 implemented culling in a three.kilometer radius around the site where the dead birds were found, killing
 all domestic poultry (about 1800 chickens) in 12 villages within the 3km. radius. Testing at the Central
 Reference inWeybridge UK later confirmed that the virus was indeedInfluenza A (H5N1).

 4.      Responsibility for the ongoing surveillance and monitoring for HPAI in poultry and migratory
 fowl and for response in case o f an outbreak rests with the Ministry o f Agriculture (MOA).Up untilthe
 positive result, over 1,000 samples had been taken from suspicious birds identified during passive
 surveillance. Also, regular testing o f water fowl has been initiated at lakes along major migratory routes.

 5.      UntilJanuary thisyear, state veterinarians were under the Ministry'sVeterinary Department, with
 branch offices ineach o f Georgia's 65 Rayons. Some 560 Veterinarians were employed by the Ministry.
 The MOAin late 2005 undertook a major review o f its structure, and developed restructuring plans which
 are to be introduced over the first half o f CY 2006. The restructuringi s intended to contract out much of
 the services provided by the Ministry to private contractors who, it i s hoped, would be much more
 effective in providing the services. The Ministry under this plan would then revert to a largely policy
 making role. As part of the restructuring, the Veterinary Department will be absorbed into a newly
 created Food Safety Agency and the number o f public veterinarians will be reduced to about 200. While
 state veterinarians will still be assigned to Rayon offices, the intention i s to evolve much o f the previous
 state veterinary functions that are o f a more private nature to the private sector. The reform i s intendedto
 forge a smaller more effective public veterinary service that would oversee the delivery o f services by
 contract veterinarians.



                                                      - 1 -

6.       Inresponseto the threat ofHPAIoutbreak, the Government has established local crisis centers in
each o f the 65 Rayons based on the former structure o f the Rayon Veterinary Units. Weekly meetings o f
a committee including representatives o f the veterinary administration, health care department, local
government, the Ministry o f Education and the Ministry o f the Environment are taking place to oversee
the work o fthe monitoring centers. Hotlinesto the centers have beenestablished to report suspicious bird
deaths. These centers provide the first line intervention when bird deaths are reported and investigate
each report. They are backstopped by eight regional centers that aim to respond within two hours o f a
reported outbreak to assist in taking samples and with disinfection. Finally, there i s a national Crisis
center in Tbilisi that i s staffed 24 hours a day and which coordinates monitoring, testing, and response
activities inthe field.

7.       Two Bank-financed projects are under implementation in the agricultural sector: (i)the
Agricultural Extension, Research and Training Project (ARET) funded by an IDA Credit and a GEF
                                                                   -
grant; and (ii) Rural Development Project (RDP) which i s funded by IDA, the International Fund for
               the
Agricultural Development (FAD), and a Japanese PHRD implementation grant.               Funds from both
projects have been usedto meet immediate needs for the Avian Fluresponse.

8.       Responsibility for preparing for the threat of HPAI to human health rests with the Ministry o f
Labor, Health and Social Affairs (MoLHSA).          Health sector reforms, initiated in 1995, supported a
purchaser/provider split, where MoLHSA maintains only a stewardship role. The Ministry, as steward o f
the system, i s responsible for policy formulation, financing and regulatory action for controlling the
quality, safety and effectiveness o f health services, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.         The
infectiousdisease surveillance system, sanitary inspection control and health promotion are carried out by
Public Health Department o f MoLHSA. The National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) i s a public
entity subordinated to the Public Health Department which serves as a National Referral Laboratory
(NRL) for the control o f communicable and non-communicable diseases. The NRL is further supported
by two regional laboratories, one inKutaisi and another inAjara and a public health laboratory network
o f smaller laboratories.

9.        The institutional arrangements for disease control are well established in Georgia, though the
effectiveness o f the national disease surveillance system varies depending upon the disease at issue, and
whether or not there i s a special disease-specific vertical program in place. For human influenza proper,
the surveillance system has been in place since 2003, and has been fully operational since 2004.
Accordingly, each PHC center reports on a weekly basis the number o f influenza cases to Regional Public
Health Centers. In addition, specialists working in various inpatient care facilities report influenza-like
illness (ILI)cases within 24 hours o f admission. Cases are ascertained on the bases on mucosal (nasal or
pharyngeal) swab samples taken and shipped to the NRL. Monthly reporting to the NCDC i s made by
RegionalPublic Health Departmentsusing the ILIForm which then issues a monthly national report.

 10.      Two IDA-financed projects are under implementation in the health sector. The Primary Health
Care Project (PHC) aims at helping the Government develop and implement a primary health care
 strategy, and the Hospital Restructuring component o f the Structural Reform Support Project (SRS) i s
helping to rehabilitate key hospital infrastructure in the context o f ongoing Government efforts to
restructure the sector.     Some funds from both these projects have been allocated to finance urgently
needed equipment to prepare for a human outbreak o f HPAI. The equipment includes respirators,
monitors, and personal protection gear for health care workers.




                                                    - 2 -

2. Country overall damage assessment

11.      Evenbefore the recent outbreak, Georgia had not escapedthe negative impact of the disease on
its economy. Sales o f poultry products dropped by as much as 90 percent in January 2006 following
intensive coverage o f the outbreaks inTurkey and speculation about its spreadto Georgia. The decline in
sales not only affected the commercial producers but smallholder farmers who own the vast majority of
poultry in the country. Numerous reports of spontaneous culling have also been received.             Three
commercial producers have culled their flocks and stopped production in response to the downturn in
demand and fears about AI. Since the outbreak, there have been further reports o f spontaneous culling
and sales of poultry products remain depressed.

3. Country strategy in the context of GPAI

 12.     Georgia's strategy for addressing the threat of HPAI is based on the Strategic Action plan
prepared by WHO for responding to the Avian Influenza Pandemic Threat. The objectives of Georgia's
strategy can be structured in three phases - pre-pandemic, emergence of a pandemic, and pandemic
declared and spreading internationally. In the current pre-pandemic phase, the focus i s on monitoring,
surveillance, and testing of both domestic and migratory birds coupled with tightened border controls. As
already demonstrated with the outbreak in Ajara, in the event of a confirmed outbreak in birds, the
Government will rely on rapid reaction to contain the spread of the virus, including culling. Inaddition,
collaboration between animal and human health services has been strengthened through weekly
coordination meetings between MOAand MoLHSA staff, and efforts are also underway to strengthen
 capacity to respond to a spread of the virus to the human population. If a pandemic shows signs of
 emerging, the focus of the strategy will be on containingor delaying the spread at the source through such
 measures as social distancing and quarantine. If a full-blown pandemic emerges, the strategy will focus
 on reducing morbidity, mortality and social disruption. At all three stages, a key element o f the strategy
 i s a comprehensive communication program, to inform the population o f the risks, enlist its help in
 surveillance and reporting, to ease the implementation o f social distancing measures and to minimize
 panic and social disruption.

 4. Country response to the AI emergency

 13.     The GeorgianGovernmenthasmoved quickly to respondto the threat of HPAI. InJanuary 2006
 a Government Steering Commission on Avian InfluenzainGeorgia (GSCAIG) was established under the
 chairmanship o f the Prime Minister and consisting o f the State Minister for European Integration and the
 Ministers o f Finance, Labor, Health and Social Affairs, Environment, and Agriculture. Responsibility for
 day-to-day coordination across Government rests with an inter-ministerial working group headed by the
 Deputy Minister for MoLHSA and the Senior Veterinary Officer in the MOA, and including
 representatives of the other ministers. The inter-ministerial working group meets weekly to review the
 current status o f preparednessand coordinate activities. Under the coordination o f GSCAIG, the working
 group developed a draft National AI Preparedness Plan (NALPP). This plan provides a good basis for
 further preparatory work with a particular focus on development o f contingency plans in both MOAand
 MoLHSA and creation o f a conducive legal framework, that will enable the Government to implement
 recommended disease detection, control, prevention, containment, and eradication measures in a uniform
 and effective way. Inaddition, immediate preventative measures have been implemented with particular
 emphasis on surveillance and monitoring, and testing of poultry and migratory water fowl, strict border
 controls, including disinfection of entering vehicles, and the launching o f a public education campaign,
 both inthe schools and inthe media. Also, for human health, medical equipment i s being mobilized, and
 medical personnel trained to respond to an outbreak.



                                                    - 5 -

14.      In developing the NAIPP, the Government prepared a proposal in January for donor support for
the prevention and control o f avian influenza inGeorgia. The objective of the proposal is to provide the
necessary equipment, materials, and training to monitor for outbreaks and respond when they occur, both
in poultry and humans.         The proposal also provides for contingency funds to be used in case
compensation for culling becomes necessary and in case effective vaccines are developed. At the same
time, the Prime Minister wrote to the Bank on January 17, 2006 to request assistance inputtingtogether a
coordinated donor responseto the Government's proposal.

5. Countryeligibilityunder GPAI

15.      Georgia qualifies as a country at risk, at an early stage of an outbreak. It has fulfilled the
eligibility criteria including demonstrating Government commitment. This commitment i s apparent inthe
establishment of the GSCAIG chaired by the Prime Minister,and the Government's approach to the Bank
to help it secure and coordinate donor assistance for the Government's program for the Prevention of
Distribution and the Control of Avian Influenza in Georgia. This program supports Georgia's capacity
for the early detection of HPAI, and rapid response to an outbreak.

  B. BANK RESPONSEAND STRATEGY

1. Internationalsupport to the Avian Influenzaemergency in the country

 16.      Several donors are currently supporting the Government's HPAI strategy. For testing for the
presence of the virus inboth humans and poultry and wild birds, Georgia i s fortunate to have a program
of U S assistanceto upgrade labs for human testing at the NCDC, and at KutaisiHospital, as well as three
labs for veterinary testing. The upgrade was initiated prior to the emergence o f the HPAI threat and is
intended to equip Georgia with laboratory capacity for a wide range of testing needs, fortunately
including the capacity to test for HPAI. The rehabilitation of the labs provides Georgia with adequate
testing facilities that are fully equipped to test for HPAI on the human side. The veterinary labs are now
equipped to test for the virus with real time PCR and three lab technicians have been trained in
 administering the test. Further training i s planned to ensure that the labs are fully capable of testing for
 the virus in birds. Included in the assistance, besides equipment and civil works, i s training for lab
 technicians and consumables and reagents needed for the virological tests. As part o f this assistance,
 construction i s underway on a Bio-Safety Level 3 lab inTbilisi with separate lab facilities for animal and
 human testing, though the constructionwill take two years before the lab can be commissioned.

 17.      WHO and FA0 are providing rapid assessments of the situation in Georgia, and are providing
 technical backstopping in the preparation of contingency plans for AI and for the preparation of a
 coordinated program o f donor assistance.         Moreover, FA0 is providing support for: (i)regional
 workshops for 11 countries for Avian Influenza on such topics as surveillance in wild birds, diagnosis
 procedures and outreach management; (ii)limited equipment and supplies; (iii)a multi-country
 emergency reaction fund (USS45,OOO) for priorities           identified by each recipient country; (iv)
 establishment in Georgia o f an Emergency Center for Transboundary Animal Diseases. The center will
 focus on monitoring and reporting on transboundary decease threat for Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan.
 UNICEF i s preparing learning materials focusing on information for elementary school children for
 dissemination inschools across the country. USAID i s providing Georgia with US$O.8 million assistance
 as part of the U S Government's global US$131million program o f support for HPAI. The funding will
 provide technical assistance and some equipment for MoLHSA and MOA,as well as support for a
 communications campaign. Finally, the EUhas allocated 5.0 million Euro for the response to the threat


                                                      - 4 -

o f HPAI in three Caucasus countries, Moldova, Uhaine and Belarus. This funding i s being provided
through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Avian flu and will be administered by the World Bank. The
allocation between the eligible countries and the trust fund mechanism are currently under discussion,
with a June target date to have the trust fundoperational.

2. Response gaps and Bank's assistance

18.       On the animal health side, financing needs include strengthening o f disease monitoring and
surveillance, border controls and on containment measures in event o f an outbreak, including preparation
o f plans for compensation for culling and for disposal o f culled birds. Immediate inputsrequired include
cars, fuel, protective gear, disinfectant material, sprayers and rapid testing kits. Training, particularly for
regional staff is required, along with technical assistance to help develop contingency plans, review the
legal and regulatory framework for response to an outbreak, and develop a mechanism to compensate
poultry owners when culling becomes necessary and to dispose o f culled birds ina safe manner.

19.       On the human health side, financing i s needed for equipment and materials to enable the health
system to respond both in the pre-pandemic stage where limited human cases might occur, and in the
pandemic case where the focus would be on slowing the spread o f the disease and reducing morbidity and
mortality. Training also needs to be intensified for health care workers at all levels on monitoring for the
disease and on how to handle cases safely should they occur. Moreover, technical assistance i s required
to help develop contingency plans and reviewing the legal and regulatory environment. A final financing
requirement i s for the development and implementationo f a communications strategy.

20.       All potential needs for a broad-based Avian Influenza Preparedness program have been roughly
estimated at about US$ 17.0 million (see table below). Immediate assistance o f about US$ 1.2 million for
urgently needed equipment and materials to enable the Government to implement monitoring and
 surveillance and to help prepare initially for an outbreak both in poultry and humans i s being provided
 from four existing projects -Rural Development Project, Agricultural Research Extension and Training
Project, Primary Health Care Development Project, and Structural Reform Support Project. The proposed
project provides for US$ 7.0 million in IDA financing and i s designed to meet priority medium term
 investment needs aimed at strengthening the capacity o f both the animal health and human health
 agencies to respond to the threat o f an HPAI outbreak and to support a communications strategy. Also
 included in the proposed project i s co-financing through a PHRD co-financing grant for US$ 1.4 million
 to help meet the technical assistance gaps outlined above, complemented by an US$ 0.8 million grant
 from USAID.

 21.      While project financing is adequate to meet the project objectives, additional program financing
 o f about US$ 4.4 million would enable the Government further strengthen its capacity to respond to the
 H P A I threat. Of this amount, about US$ 1.6 million would be used for additional compensation in the
 event o f multiple outbreaks requiring extensive culling. The remaining financing needs for animal health
 are for additional goods for surveillance and response capacity. Additional financing for human health
 are for additional goods, mostly ventilators, monitors and personal protection equipment, while the
 additional financing for communication would allow for an expansion o f public awareness raising
 activities.

 22.      Government i s considering further reallocations f?om the ARET and PHC projects to cover part
 o f these additionalprogram financing needs. Moreover, a possible allocation for Georgia from the Multi-
 donor trust fund would help to meet the additional program requirements. Finally, Government will
 continue to consult with donor partners inan effort to find additional financing.

  3. Rationalefor Bankinvolvement

  23.      The justification for the Bank involvement i s the Global Public Goods aspect of the HPAI, one of
  many emerging and re-emerging zoonoses, and its strong link to poverty reduction. HPAI control
  programs require a multi-disciplinary approach to integrate technical, social, economic, political, policy,
  and regulatory issues in addressing a complex problem. The Bank i s well-placed to build upon its
  knowledge of multi-disciplinary approachesneededinthe proposedProject, which draws on evidence and
  lessons learned inthe various regions regardingemergency preparednessresponses and multi-disciplinary
  approaches. The Bank's experience with multi-sectoral emergency response and risk-mitigation projects
  gives it considerable qualifications inbringingtogether the relevant ministries, government agencies, and
  the donor community, in understanding and addressing the social and economic impact, and in assuring
  highlevelpolitical coordination.

  24.      Given the Bank's work with FAO, WHO, OIE, the US Assistance Program, EU and other
  partners in country and at the international level to address bothpreparednessand outbreaks and to assist
  with institutional assessments, the Bank can assist Georgia in leveraging additional resources from other
  international and bilateral agencies. In addition to its financial role, the technical assistance provided by
  the Bank has been important in similar global or regional emergency situations such as SARS, Tsunami
  relief, and HIV/AIDS. The Bank's national and regional support will be closely linked with the activities
  of FAO, WHO, OIE, and the EUand the proposed project i s fully consistent with, and draws heavily on,
  the global strategiesproposed by FA0 and WHO.

  4. Lessonslearned

   25.     Relevant lessons for the design of the proposed operation have been drawn from implementation
   o f projects in the agricultural and health sectors in Georgia and from the design of previous World
   BanWlDA and FAO-supported emergency recovery projects. Included i s the Vietnam Avian Influenza
   Emergency Recovery Project, which i s the only Bank project on this matter that i s already being
   implemented. Three projects have been approved by the Bank in response to the Avian Influenza so far
   (Vietnam, Kyrgyz Republic, andNigeria).

   26.     The lessons learned indicate that project success depends largely on the speed of the response
   provided and, particularly when dealing with smallholders' production systems, a speedy, efficient and
   transparent distribution o f suitable key inputs i s clearly a major factor in limitingthe impact of a crisis
   and hastening recovery. A performance audit of some of the emergency projects supported by the Bank
   in various regions drew the following general lessons: (i)        emergency projects should avoid policy
   conditionality; (ii)project design must be simple and take into account a realistic assessment of the



                                                        - 6 -

existing Borrower's capacity and other stakeholders capacity, i.e. NGOs; (iii) speedy appraisal and
                                                                                      a
approval are crucial to provide a prompt response and a substantial contribution to project success;
(iv) procurement arrangements needto be flexible and should be finalized at an early stage; (v) mitigation
and prevention measures should be included inthe design to minimize impacts o f a possiblerecurrence o f
the disaster; and (vi) realistic assessments should be made o f counterparts absorption capacity, as well as
o f the effective communications and coordination mechanisms among all relevant stakeholders.

27.      Even though the Vietnam Avian Influenza Emergency Recovery Project has been in
implementation for only about one year (effective on November 9, 2004), the main recommendations
arising fi-om its implementation are:

     m    Preparedness is a key factor. While Vietnam had a national strategy document to control avian
          influenza in the domestic poultry population, it was not clearly understood and shared by all
          relevant stakeholders and some aspects o f the response have lagged.
     m    A two-pronged strategy is recommended, including: (i) control of HPAI at the source in
                                                                       the
          high-risk regions (through aggressive measures including culling and movement control); and
          (ii) simultaneously prepared short and medium-term measures to minimize the risks to humans
          and prepare for an eventual pandemic.
          For implementation arrangements, a coordination structure i s needed which i s empowered with
          multi-sectoral responsibilities, for instance at the Prime Minister's Office level, and to have full
          time project coordinators to implement activities in a "crisis situation".  Coordination should not
          only involve the Government, but include the donor community, the private sector and the civil
          society.
          A "compensation framework" is essential to obtain cooperation from affected farmers and to
          ensure the efficacy o f the surveillance and diagnosis mechanisms.
          Strengthening the technical, scientific and operational capacity o f relevant participating agencies
          i s important. The HPAI crisis highlighted several weaknesses in the existing animal health and
          public health services systems, including: poor surveillance at the local level, weak diagnostic
          capacity, lack o f epidemiological expertise and information system, and inadequate operating
          budget to bear the additional physical and human cost to containthe disease.
          An effective national response i s imperative in case o f a human epidemic, including all technical
          ministries in charge o f agriculture/animal health and human health, as well as other relevant
          sectors, at the national and sub-national level.
          Raising awareness inthe public and private sectors is important from the initial moments.
          Support should be given for the integration o f each country to a regional and global framework
          for the control of HPAI, and more broadly o f all trans-boundary animal diseases and other
          emerging infectious diseases, to increase cost-effectiveness and ensure the harmonization of
          activities and responses.

 28.       Some important lessons learned from the response to the HIVlAIDS epidemic' are incorporated
 inthe design o ftheproposed project. They include:

      Highlevelpoliticalcommitment andleadership is key.
      A comprehensive multi-sectoral approachisneedfor prevention, treatment, care and support services.
 m    Monitoring and evaluation i s critical inthe scaling-up o f a national response.

  C. DETAILED PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Projectdevelopmentobjectivesandkey indicators

29.      The overall development objective o f the project i s to minimize the threat posed to humans and
the poultry industry in Georgia by HPAI and other zoonoses in domestic poultry, and to prepare for,
control, and respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans. To
achieve this, three areas would be supported by the project: (i)  prevention; (ii)preparedness and planning;
and (iii)response and containment.

30.      Key indicators include: (i) evidence o f an effective and inter-sectoral surveillance system inplace
for both animals and humans for HPAI and other zoonoses; (ii)       evidence o f institutional mechanisms in
place for effective implementation o f an integrated and multi-sectoral contingency plan for endemic
preparedness; and (iii) contained outbreaks in poultry with no demonstrated transmission from birds to
humans.

2. Projectcomponents

31.      The project consists o f three components: (i)    animal health; (ii) health; and (iii)
                                                                             human                   strategic
communication.

Component1: ANIMAL HEALTH
Total component cost i s estimated at US$ 5.18 million. Bank financing i s US$ 3.86 million, co-financing
through the Japanese PHRD co-financing grant i s US$0.57 million and Government contribution i s
US$0.75 million.

(A)StrengtheningNationalHPAIPreparednessandPreventionCapability

A1   - Strengthening the Regulatory and Institutional Environment. This component will provide
technical assistance to MOAfor a legal, regulatory and institutional review. The technical assistance will
help ensure that the legal and regulatory framework for disease prevention, detection, containment and
eradication i s effective and in accordance with OIE standards and guidelines. The project includes a
review the current legislative framework to assure its alignment with the public veterinary services that
are currently being reorganized. The component will assist in drafting o f legal amendments, regulations
and implementation guidelines and manuals.           On the institutional side, technical assistance will be
provided to review the restructured veterinary services and the arrangements in place for surveillance,
monitoring, sampling and outbreak response and make recommendations as necessary to ensure that they
provide adequate and timely coverage.           To meet international standards set by the OIE and the
recommendations developed by FAO, the veterinary services need to develop and document appropriate
procedures and standards for the implementation and management o f animal health measures and
 international veterinary certification activities. The OIE has developed instruments that allow national
 veterinary services to carry out a self-evaluation and establish their current level o f performance, form a
 shared vision with service providers and clients in the private sector, establish priorities, and facilitate
 strategic planning. The current reorganizationo f responsibilities and functions o f the veterinary services
 into the Food Safety Agency will be examined against these instruments and further adjustments might be
 warranted for the veterinary sector to ensure it is capable o f meeting international requirements.

 A2 National Action and Contingency Plan. While the Government has taken appropriate measures
     -
 for short term surveillance activities, a comprehensive contingency plan i s lacking. The project will


                                                      - 8 -

provide technical assistance and training to help develop contingency plans that detail required activities
at all levels and to develop the necessary implementation guidelines and manuals for all relevant agencies
and services. The focus o f the work will be on planning for an outbreak, and detailing how a response to
an outbreak would be managed, including organization of culling programs, isolating the area o f
outbreak, and testing procedures to determine the spread o f the virus. The experts assigned to this work
will needto work with the MOA,customs, laboratories, private veterinarians and other agencies involved
inHPAIpreventionand control. Support will also be provided for the participation o f veterinary experts
in regional information exchanges on avian influenza as well as for working visits to other countries
implementing similar activities.      The project will also facilitate the organization o f regular regional
workshops for information exchange and cooperation agreements. Finally, the project will provide for
simulation exercises to test the plan and to familiarize plan participants at all levels with their
responsibilities inthe event o f an outbreak o f HPAI.

A3 Establishment of a NationalCompensationPolicy and Funding. Early detection and reporting,
    -
as well as rapid response, depend critically on the incentives for poultry owners to report very quickly any
sick or dead poultry to veterinary staff. For this to happen, adequate compensation arrangements have
proven absolutely essential. The veterinary law, amended in 2004, provides for the establishment o f
compensation mechanisms, but does not detail the required implementation arrangements - including
financing, fiduciary aspects, eligibility criteria, the level o f compensation, payment arrangements, and
flow o f funds. The project will support the development o f these implementation arrangements. The
project will also provide US$ 1.4million for compensation funding.

(B) StrengtheningDisease Surveillance, Diagnostic and Containment Capacity
     -

B1 Strengthening the Disease Monitoring and Containment System. Support will be provided to
    -
strengthen the public veterinary services to bring them in line with OIE standards. This will include
training o f staff and provision o f priority infrastructure and equipment (limited works, equipment,
materials and supplies). It will also include improvement o f the selected border inspection posts operated
by the Customs Service through training and equipment and facilities as well as improving the mobility o f
the veterinary services. Staff training will be targeted at the personnel o f the State Veterinary Unit in the
Food Safety Agency in MOAas well as public and private veterinary practitioners operating in the rural
 areas. Specifically, training will be provided to the staff o f the 65 Rayon monitoring units and the eight
regional rapid response centers. Priority early in the project will be given to the centers in Regions and
Rayons designated as high risk for HPAI outbreaks. The focus o f the training will be on awareness
raising, monitoring, investigating, sampling and testing procedures to be applied incase o f an outbreak, as
 well as on analyzing epidemiological data and performing risk assessments. The training will also focus
 on outbreak containment, including arrangements for culling, disposal and compensation. The project
 will also link the local level into the surveillance and monitoring system so that a feedback system for
notifiable animal diseases reaches to farmers, farm workers, and veterinarians at the local level. The sub-
 component will support (i)training for veterinarians on treatment o f infected animals, reporting
procedures and immediate local response measures; (ii)        hands-on training for farmers in detection of
 clinical signs o f notifiable diseases; and (iii)
                                                training on bio-security measures at the farm level, Funding
 will also be provided for essential first response equipment.        This will include personal protection
 equipment, disinfectant equipment, vehicles, mobile incinerators, and materials and equipment for
 sampling and culling. Also, selected major border crossing points will be supported through improved
 facilities for inspection of suspect consignments including separate inspection rooms, disinfectants
 sprayers, wash basins, specimen containers and bags.

 B2   -  Strengthening Diagnostic Capacity. Georgia's laboratory capacity has been substantially
 strengthened over the past two years and it i s largely equipped to diagnose all notifiable diseases



                                                      - 9 -

including HPAI. Therefore, project support will be targeted primarily to strengthening the diagnostic
capacity that needs to feed into the laboratory system.       This will comprise strengthening through
equipment, training and technical assistance regional laboratories and inspectors and veterinarians
working on the local level in sample collection and submission, prescreening, reporting and follow-up o f
reported AI cases.    Surveillance activities and rapid assessments for serological tests and screening
surveys will also be supported. Essential equipment, consumables and reagents, rapid test kits, staff
training and technical assistance will be provided to complete the chain o f response for disease
surveillance.

B3 Strengthening AnimalDiseaseInformationSystems.Equipment, software, training, and technical
    -
assistance will be provided to improve the reporting o f animal health information from the field and the
flow of information among relevant agencies. The emphasis will be on developing an efficient disease
information system, to enable Georgia to participate in global disease information sharing, in full
compliance with the obligations o f membership inthe OIE. Emphasis will be placed on human resources
development in the establishment and use o f database programs (including GIs) and the analysis o f data
to deliver the necessary support to decision makers charged with prevention and control o f animal
diseases.   The system will be linked with rapid and standardized methods o f routine analysis o f
surveillance data, which will demonstrate important changes in the H5N1 situation, and this information
will be promptly supplied to field staff. It will also support the upgrading o f Georgia's participation in
the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) to strengthen the country's ability to participate
inglobal disease information sharing. The applicability o f graphical information system technology will
be fully exploited.

(C) ComponentImplementationSupport, MonitoringandEvaluation

Financing will be provided for limited consultant services to ensure effective implementation o f the
project in accordance with Bank fiduciary and procurement guidelines. Implementation support for this
 component will be provided through the existing PCC in the MOAwhich i s supporting ongoing Bank-
 financed in the sector. Fundingwill be provided for additional procurement and financial management
 support as required, and for monitoring and evaluation, as well as possible assistance to the component
 manager.

 Component2: HUMANHEALTH
 Total Component Cost is estimated at US$4.32 million.          Bank financing i s US$2.88 million, co-
 financing through the proposed Japanese PHRD co-financing grant is US$0.52 million and Government
 contribution i s US$0.92 million.

 32.     Building an effective national public health response to the threat o f HPAI will require an
 enabling environment and the necessary resources to bring proven interventions quickly up to a
 nationwide scale. Thus, the Project will help to expand quickly certain elements o f the global strategic
 plan. As it i s unlikely that the global spread o f a pandemic influenza virus could be prevented once it
 emerges, the emphasis i s on reducing its impact. Several tools will help achieve this aim: (i)year-round
 surveillance; (ii)effective and accurate methods o f diagnosis; (iii)social distance interventions; (iv)
 vaccinations and anti-viral drugs; and (v) strengthened medical services. The interventions supported
 under the Project are based on a careful analysis o f Georgia's epidemiological and programmatic needs.
 The interventions are grouped into three broad categories: Enhancing Public Health Planning and
 Programming; Strengthening National Public Health Surveillance Systems; and Strengthening o f Health
 System Response Capacity.




                                                     -10-

(A)       EnhancingPublicHealthProgramPlanningandCoordination

While MoLHSA and MOArecently prepared a draft NAIPP, the development by MoLHSA o f a national
pandemic influenza action plan (NPIAP) i s equally important. The project will provide technical
assistance to complete required sections, including: (i)  the context and epidemiologcal underpinnings o f
an eventual influenza pandemic in humans; (ii)the current legislative and regulatory basis for
interventions, especially social distancing; (iii)surveillance arrangements; (iv) verification o f suspected
cases through serological testing and virological subtyping; (v) prevention through immunization; and
(vi) symptomatic case management with antiviral drugs. Also, the plan will detail the coordinationo f the
emergency response, the logistics involved, the protocols and algorithms to be followed for surveillance,
diagnosis, immunization and anti-viral therapy during inter-pandemic, pandemic alert and pandemic
periods, and the means o f communication and public information. It will also estimate resource and
training requirements for effective implementation and make the necessary arrangements that they are in
place.

The Project will provide training to MoLHSA to buildits institutional capacity to command and control
in a coordinated fashion the implementation of the plan and to members o f the working level AI inter-
ministerial committee to become a truly functioning coordinating agency.

(B)       Strengtheningof NationalPublicHealthSurveillanceSystems

The detection o f novel influenza strains i s done through clinical and virological surveillance of human
and animal influenza disease. More specifically this surveillance will include:, (i)  active surveillance for
influenza-like illnesses (ILI) nationwide; (ii)   collection of specimens for diagnostic testing and virus
subtypingo f suspected cases; (iii)  confirmation o f positive and a certain proportion o f negative results in
a reference laboratory; and (iv) outbreak investigationin areas with confirmed human cases. Surveillance
systems should be enhanced prior to the start o f a pandemic to ensure that the high demand for timely
information that can be anticipated in a pandemic can be met. T o this end, the proposed Project will
suppol?:

B1- Improvementof LaboratoryNetworks. InGeorgia there is one National Reference Public Health
Laboratory (NRL) for virology at the NCDC which acts as the National Influenza Center (NIC). The
N l U ' s capacity has been substantially strengthened over the past year with U S assistance and it i s largely
 equipped to diagnose all notifiable diseases including HPAI. Two other laboratories in Kutaisi and
Batumi are also being upgraded with U S assistance which will form the main core o f laboratory capacity
 for a human pandemic. While laboratory capacity has been greatly enhanced, it still i s unlikely to cope
with the increased demands in times o f pandemic. Therefore, the project will provide financing for
targeted interventions aimed at supplementing existing capacity. Specifically, the sub-component will
 finance the upgrading o f the NRL in Tbilisi to Bio-Safety Level 3 (BSL-3) with physical containment
requirements for virus isolation and sub-typingto determine various strains. Inaddition, the public health
 laboratory system at the regional level, which would be needed for sample collection in a pandemic will
be supportedthrough procurement o f basic supplies, and training o f personnel

 B2 Improvementof HealthInformationand Telecommunication Systems. Incoordinationwith the
    -
 bank-financed Primary Health Care Project and other ongoing interventions financed by donor agencies,
 this sub-component will finance technical assistance and training to strengthen surveillance,
 communications, and information technology at the different levels o f the health care system. The focus
 will be on supporting the country's preparedness and capacity to respond to avian influenza and other
 infectious disease outbreaks and to fast-track available treatments for the disease.




                                                     - 11-

(C)      Strengthening Health System Response Capacity

Aggressive containment measures such as patient isolation and prophylactic use o f antiviral drugs may
slow the spread o f a pandemic and allow time for response measures. Although mass vaccination i s the
preferredintervention, an efficacious vaccine may not be ready or available for use as part o f a large-scale
vaccination campaign soon enough to contain the pandemic. Anti-viral supply and production capacity
are also limited. Therefore, the project will support through the implementation o f the NAIPP, "social
distancing measures" -- such as simulation exercises, quarantine, bans on mass gatherings, and travel
restrictions, backedup by a well-designedcommunication strategy. The project will support a programof
vaccination for regular seasonal influenza, particularly aimed at highrisk groups. Inaddition, support for
the procurement o f antiviral drugs will be provided. Additional preventive actions such as personal
hygiene promotion and distribution of masks will be supported, along with increased awareness and
promotion of community participation in slowing the spread of the pandemic. Inthis area, the project
will support:

C1 - Social DistancingMeasures. One possible measure to prevent contracting avian influenza is to
limit, as muchas possible, contact of suspectcases or people from infectedareas with the general public.
Therefore, the project will support through technical assistanceand training the implementation of classic
"social distancing measures"--such as school closings, backed by a well-designed communication
strategy. Financing will be made available for developing guidelines on social distancing measures
based on existing or new laws and regulations, for supporting coordination with other sectoral agencies,
and for supporting the MoLHSA on protecting health personnel and other sectoral staff involved in
pandemic response activities. Additional preventive actions to complement social distancing such as
personal hygiene promotion including hand washing and proper cooking, and use o f masks would be
supported, along with increased awareness and promotion o f community participation in slowing the
spread of the pandemic.

C2 - Vaccination Support and Antiviral Therapy. Support will be provided for expanding regular
seasonal flu vaccination as one step to help prevent an outbreak among humans. Under this sub-
component, funding will be made available for implementation o f expanded influenza vaccination
program to administer rapidly vaccine to high risk groups and to monitor effectiveness and safety. In
addition, financing will be provided for procurement of Tamiflu for stockpiling.

C3- Medical Services. Incoordination with the PHC Project and other ongoing interventions financed
by donor agencies, equipment, supplies, technical assistance and training will be provided to the health
 care system for preparednessplanning to provide optimal medical care and maintain essential community
 services in the event o f a pandemic. To this end, financing will be provided for establishment of
 specialized unitsin selected hospitals. Equipment for these unitswould include ventilators, monitors, and
respirators, and personal protection equipment. Guidelines will also be developed for increasing bed
 availability in case of a pandemic through more stringenttriage for admission and earlier discharge with
 follow-up by home health care personnel. Assistance will also be provided for the development and/or
 updating of treatment guidelines and hospital infection control guidelines and measures, including
 building antibiotic stocks, mobilizing additional health personnel, training of health personnel, and
 providing equipment, drugs, vaccines, and other medical inputs.

 (D) Component Implementation Support, Monitoring andEvaluation

 Financing will be provided for limited consultant services to ensure effective implementation of the
 project in accordance with Bank fiduciary and procurement guidelines. Implementation support for this
 component will be provided through the existing PlU for the Primary Health Care Project in the



                                                    - 12-

MoLHSA, the Georgia Health and Social Projects ImplementationCenter (GHSPIC), which is supporting
ongoing Bank-financedinthe sector. Fundingwould beprovided for additionalprocurement and financial
management support as required, for monitoring and evaluation

Component3: PUBLICAWARENESS AND COMMUNICATIONS
Total component cost i s US$0.90 million. Bank financing i s US$0.36 million, co-financing from the
proposed Japanese PHRD co-financing grant i s US$ 0.31 million and Government contribution is
US$0.23 million.

33.      This component is intended to promote awareness and improved coordinationof the execution of
the NAIPP and related contingency plans in MOAand MoLHSA. It i s designed to help protect the
poultry industry and safeguard human health and to facilitate surveillance and monitoring for outbreaks
by improving public awareness and information. Under this component, support will be provided for
information and communication activities to increase the attention and commitment of government,
private sector, and civil society organizations, and to raise awareness, knowledge and understanding
among the general population about the risk and potential impact of the pandemic. Information and
communication activities will be designed to deliver a variety of messages that would change as the threat
of HPAI evolves. The messages will also be directed at a wide range of audiences such small farmers,
commercial producers and processors, traders, veterinarians, participants in monitoring and control
activities, health care workers, and the public at large. Finally, communications and information will be
tailored to needs of ethnic minority communities, where language is an issue.

34.      To design and coordinate these activities, a communication unit will be established to work with
the Project Implementation Team (PIT), with an immediate input into: the design o f an integrated and
comprehensive communications strategy and action plan; selection and sub-contracting o f services to
implement the communication interventions; training of spoke-persons from priority sectors inmanaging
the media; partnering with the electronic and print media to highlight the national response and ensure
accurate reporting. To help undertake these functions a communication professional will be assigned for
day to day support to the PIT. Inaddition, communication specialists and goods, training and consultant
services would be provided for both, MOA and MoLHSA, to subcontract rapid-research around
knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP studies) of vulnerable at-risk populations; to design and produce
awareness-raisingand prevention campaigns; and promote fast reporting through innovative technologies.
The Ministry of Education and relevant partners will participate in the development of educational
materials to be used in schools, community and faith-based organizations, to access groups that are
marginalizedor hard-to-reach.

 D.       IMPLEMENTATIONARRANGEMENTS

1. Overallprojectorganizationandmanagement

35.      The project will be implementedjointly by MOAand the MoLHSA. The Minister o f Agriculture
will designate a senior veterinary official as the component manager for the Animal Health Component
and the Minister o f Health will designate a deputy minister to be in charge of the Human Health and
Communications Components. Both component managers will be responsible for the implementation of
their respective components.         Under the communications component, the project will finance
communication assistants to the managers to meet the day to day communications requirements o f the
project and to provide overall assistance inproject implementation.

2. Institutionalarrangements for implementation

36.       Governmental Steering Commissionon Avian Influenzain Georgia (GSCAIG). This multi-
sectoral task force was formed in January 2006 to respond to the threat of HPAI. It i s chaired by the
Prime Minister and includes the ministers of finance, health, education, agriculture, environment and
defense.    It sets overall policy on HPAI prevention and control and oversees the efforts of the
Government in monitoring and surveillance, prevention measures, and inpreparing responses to contain
outbreaks. The task force will also serve as the overall coordinating and oversight body for the proposed
project and it will review at least twice annually progress with project implementation.

37.       Inter-ministerial Task Force (IMTF).        This Task force chaired by the Deputy Minister of
Labor, Health and Social Affairs and representedby Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Education and
Science, Ministry o f Finance, Ministry o f Defense, Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural
Resources, Customs Department, Public Health Department, National Center for Decease Control, Drug
Agency and Infectious Disease Hospital, WHO, WB, UNICEF, and USAID. It i s charged with the
responsibility of ensuring that the policy and operational directions of the Commission are carried out.
This task Force meets weekly to oversee and coordinate Avian Fluactivities across the Government and
reports regularly onthe progress to the GSCAIG.

38.       Project Implementation Team (PIT). Giventhe multi-sector nature ofthe project and the need
to coordinate across the sectors particularly in overall information sharing and in the implementation of
the communications strategy, a project implementation team will be established to coordinate project
 activities. Participants inthe team would include the two component managers, a representative from the
 customs department, and the communications assistantshiredby the project. The team will be chairedby
 a designated official from the Prime Minister's Office.         It will meet regularly to review project
 implementation, identify outstanding issues, and coordinate activities. The project would provide funds
 for one consultant to provide support to the PIT and the component managers in the day-to-day
 management of the project.


 39.      Animal Health Component. The implementing agency for this component will be MOA. A
 senior Veterinary official inthe ministry, designated by the Minister, will be the component manager for
 this component. Since procurement and financial management skills required by IDA and necessary for
 Project implementation are lachng within the Ministry, assistance inthese areas will be provided by the
 existing Agricultural Development Project Coordinating Center (PCC) which has been established to
 support implementation of the ongoing IDA projects in the agricultural sector. The PCC i s an entity
 under Public Law reporting to MOA. The entity is well-experienced in managing IDA-financed projects
 and inassuring that procurementand financial management i s carriedout inaccordance with World Bank



                                                     - 1 5 -

guidelines.   The activities o f the PCC under this component will be under direct oversight o f the
component manager.

40.      Human Health Component. The Human Health Component will be implemented by the
MoLHSA. The Deputy Minister who i s responsible for Avian Flu in the Ministry will be designated by
the Minister to be in charge o f the Project. Financial management and procurement services for the
component will be provided by GHSPIC, which is experienced in implementing IDA projects including
the PHC project. The activities o f GHSPIC under this Project will be under direct oversight o f the
Component Manager. The Ministry will be responsible for all other functions related to implementation
of this component, including inter alia decisions relating to the terms o f references for consultants, and
substantive supervision o f their work.

41.      Public Awareness and Communications Component.                     The Strategic Communications
Component will also be managed by the MoLHSA, specifically by the Component Manager for the
Health Component, and the GHSPIC in the Ministry will also handle procurement and financial
management arrangements for this component.             Substantive management of the component will,
however, need to take into account that the communication strategy for HPAI has to encompass both the
animal and human aspects o f the HPAIthreat. Thus, while the day-to-day management o f the Component
will rest within the MoLHSA, for substantive decisions on the communications strategy, and specific
messages arising from that strategy, the component would receive guidance from the GSCAIG at the level
o f strategy formulation, and from the PIT on, inter alia, the content o f specific messages, choice o f media,
and design o f training activities.    The project will provide for technical assistance to assist with
communications component at both the level o fthe PIT and at the MOAand MoLHSA.

3. Procurement and Financial management

42.       A new public procurement law enacted in January 2006 i s considered generally acceptable in
terms o f procurement framework legislation. However, the procurement environment in Georgia i s rated
as "high risk".

43.       MOA, supported by the PCC, will implement all activities under the Animal Health
Component. MoLHSA, supported by GHSPIC, will implement all activities under the Human Health
 and Public Awareness and Communications Components.                Both Ministries, supported by their
respective implementation units, are deemed to have the necessary capacities for implementing the
Project. All goods and works contracts to be financed by the Bank will be undertaken in accordance
 with the procedures set forth in the Bank's "Guidelines - Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
 Credits" dated M a y 2004 (the Procurement Guidelines). Similarly, the selection and employment o f
 consultants shall be governed by the "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World
 Bank Borrowers" dated M a y 2004 (the Consultant Guidelines).             Further details on procurement
 arrangements are provided inAppendix 6.

 44.      The procurement and financial management functions o f the two out o f the project's three
 components (Human Health and Public Awareness and Communications) will be handled by the
 GHSPIC in MoLHSA and the third component (Animal Health) by the PCC in MOA. Both
 implementing agencies will be responsible for the flow o f funds, accounting and reporting in their
 respective ministries. They will coordinate their work, and the reports will be consolidated by the
 GHSPIC for submission to the IDA.

 45.      A financialmanagementassessment o fbothPCC and GHSPIC was undertakeninMarch 2006
 to determine whether the existing financial management arrangements are acceptable to IDA. This was



                                                    - 16-

in addition to assessment o f the financial management arrangements o f the PCC conducted in October
2004 duringpreparation o f RDP. Furthermore, the FM systems have also been reviewed periodically as
part o f current projects supervisions for last several years and have been found satisfactory in both
agencies. The PCC and GHSPIC have established and maintained good financial management systems
for the implementation o f the active RDP, ARET, and Irrigation and Drainage Community Development
Project by PCC, and PHC project and Hospital Restructuring Component o f SRS by GHSPIC
respectively.    The financial management systems o f both the PCC and GHSPIC are capable o f
supporting the implementation o f the proposed project inaccordance with the requirements o f OP 10.02,
except for the Compensation sub-component for which internal control and fund flow arrangements have
been discussed with the Government representatives but not been prepared duringthe assessment and are
planned to be developed and approved duringproject implementation. The flow o f funds under this sub-
component will only begin after appropriate internal control arrangements as well as fund and documents
flow procedures, satisfactory to IDA, have been adopted and documented inthe Operational Manuah o f
the entityhes that will be responsible for the Compensation implementation. In addition, an action plan
has been prepared with capacity building actions which are required to ensure that the financial
management arrangements are strengthened for this project (presented inAppendix 7).

4. Retroactive financing

46.       Retroactive Financing o f up to an amount o f US1.4 million will be provided for eligible
expenditures incurred after April 5, 2006 and up to the signing o f Financing Agreement.           Eligible
expenditures include goods, works, and services.            Retroactive financing can also be used for
compensation funding provided that the disbursement condition for compensation funding i s lifted (para.
52).

5. Environmental and social aspects

Environmental assessment             Environmental Category          B

47.       The Environmental ManagementPlan has beenprepared and was disclosed on March 3 1,2006,

48.       The Project's prevention-focusedactivities are expected to have a positive environmental impact
as the Project's investments infacilities, equipment, and training for animal and public health workers and
 facilities will develop capacity to improve the effectiveness and safety over existing avian influenza
handling and testing procedures.        This will be reinforced by the mainstreaming of environmental
 safeguards into protocols and procedures for the culling and disposal o f animals during AI outbreaks, and
 for laboratory safety and appropriate waste management procedures. The Environmental Assessment
 (EA) and the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) address the deployment o f mobile incinerators,
 disposal byburial, use o f disinfectants, and laboratory practices.

6. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

49.       Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities related to the project will be the responsibility of
both the MoLHSA and MOA.Depending on the specific situation in each case, these activities could
be carried out by the regular staff o f the agencies (with the support of the respective implementation
units)or by contractingout these functions withspecialized agencies/institutes when appropriate.

50.       Monitoring project progress and the achievement of objectives will entail continuous and
systematic review o f the various project implementation activities. The purpose of the M&Eactivities
are to: (i)  measure input, output and outcome indicators (see Appendix 10); (ii) information    provide
regularly on progress toward achieving results and facilitating reporting to the government and
IDNIBRD; (iii)alert government authorities and the Bank to actual or potential problems in
implementation so that adjustments can be made; (iv) determine whether the relevant stakeholders are
responding as expected and intended by the project; and (v) provide a process whereby the
coordinating and executing agencies can reflect and improve on their performance.

5 1.      The results o frelevantM&E activities will bereflected inthe semi-annual and annual progress
reports. The progress reports will cover the progress with the works, the institutional activities,
training and studies, performance indicators, and Unaudited Financial Reports (UFR). Part o f the
progress reports will be devoted to issues identified during project implementation and the strategies
and actions to be taken to resolve such issues that affect progress. The secondreport of eachyear will
bean annual report, providinginformationo fthe progress during the pastyear.

7. Loadcredit conditions and covenants

52.       A disbursement condition on funding for compensation for culling is the adoption of a
compensation funding manual satisfactory to IDA that describes compensation systems and
procedures, including appropriate internal control mechanisms and documented arrangements for the
 flow of funds and documents.

 8. Policy exceptions and readiness

 53.      There are no policy exceptions for the Project.

  E. FINANCIALAND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION

1. Economicandfinancialanalyses

54.       For the economic analysis, the focus i s on animal health. The costs and benefits are calculated o f
reducing the likelihood o f a catastrophic event (CE) through project interventions. A CE i s defined as
multiple outbreaks that cause substantial poultry deaths and a collapse in demand and prices for poultry
products. Of course, the emergence o f a human influenzapandemic caused by a lethal virus would have a
social and economic impact many times greater than the impact on the poultry sector. This would be
through the costs associated with public and private efforts to prevent the emergence or spread o f the
disease in humans and to treat its effects and the economic consequences o f sickness or death resulting
from the disease outbreaks. However, given the much greater uncertainty o f a human pandemic, the
economic analysis focuses only on the economic losses inthe poultry sector.

55.       Inthis treatment of HPAI as an animal health issue, actions to be taken by the Government are
analyzed using the traditional "without project" and "with project" scenarios.           Under the "without
project" case, the low capacity o f government and the poultry industry to deal with outbreaks causes the
sector to be increasingly vulnerable to a catastrophc AI occurrence. This CE would be characterized by
multiple, simultaneous outbreaks leading to a spread o f the disease to large sections o f the country's
poultry flock. The costs are estimated to be equivalent o f a 60 percent reduction in value added in the
poultry sector in the year o f CE with a gradual and partial recovery in the following three years. A
further, one-time cost to the poultry sector occurs inthe form o f abandoned capital production assets as a
result o f the permanent decrease in demand and poultry stock that has to be culled in response to the
outbreaks. This loss i s estimated at 40% o f the capital stock. The value o f the poultry sector capital stock
itself i s assumed to be equal to three times the value o f annual production in the poultry sector. The
stream o f total annual costs due to a CE in a particular year i s summarized as the present value as o f the
year o f the CE. This value i s then multiplied with the probability o f the CE occurring in a particular year
to arrive at the expected cost. In the without project scenario, the probability of the C E occurring is
assumed to be 10% in 2006, increasing annually at a rate o f 1.0% due to increasingpresence o f the virus
inthe environment.

56.       Inthe "with project" it has been assumed that the impact o f the project will fully come into play
inyear four after the project start. Therefore, the probability of the full impact of a catastrophtc event
being felt i s assumed to be the same as under the without project scenario for the first three project years.
From year 4, the likelihood o f a catastrophic outbreak i s assumed to reduce by 20%. Based on these
assumptions, the analysis yields an NPV o fUS$ 149millionand an internal rate o freturn o f 70.8 %.

2. Technicalanalysis

 57.      Animal Health.       Successful implementation o f the project depends on a phased multi-
 disciplinary strategy based on a sound epidemiological approach to control HPAI outbreaks.                This
 strategy has to take into consideration the range o f epizootic and epidemiological scenarios that exist or
may arise in Georgia as well as the different poultry production systems within the country and different
 levels o f incidence (ranging from high incidence with variable flock outbreaks, through low frequency
 disease outbreaks with partial flock immunity, to sporadic outbreaks).          A balanced combination o f
 appropriate disease control options, tailored to the specific characteristics and needs o f Georgia is
 therefore essential for the achievement o f the project objectives.




                                                      - 1 9 -

58.     The implementation o f the project raises important technical issues and presents substantial
challenges. The mainissues are:


    0   The capacity of the public and private veterinary services.             The Georgian veterinary
        services is undergoing a major restructuring and downsizing and is inadequately equipped and
        trained to deal with HPAI and the potentially large scope, severity and rapid spread o f any
        outbreaks. This i s evident across the entire range o f critical capabilities: surveillance and
        diagnostic capacity for early detection and reporting o f outbreaks, monitoring the disease,
        rapid response and implementation o f the required control measures within and around the
        outbreaks.
    0   Bio-security measures. Bio-containment measures to prevent the spread o f the virus from
        infected premises and bio-exclusion measures to exclude the virus from uninfected locations
        are essential, but have often proven to be difficult to implement effectively. The lack o f
        capacity and experience in practicing effective measures i s one o f the main reasons for the
        persistence o f the disease and its spread inthe world. It will be critical to develop and practice
        effective implementation under the specific conditions o f Georgia and to develop and
        institutionalize efficient coordination among local and national institutions, agencies and
        services.
     0  Harmonized disease information systems.               The importance o f harmonized disease
         information systems, linked to disease surveillance and epidemiological programs, i s widely
         accepted.     Although Georgian authorities exchange relevant information with their
         counterparts in neighboring countries, this information exchange i s not systematic and
         adequately institutionalized. This issue i s compounded by the presence o f two conflict zones.
         The project will support the development o f effective information sharing arrangements within
         the Caucasus region as well as the upgrading o f Georgia's capacity to participate inthe World
         Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) o f the OIE.
     0   Wildlife species and reservoirs are a source of HPAI. Migratory birds are a major potential
         source o f transmission o f H5N1 viruses to domestic poultry. Georgia i s an important stop-
         over place on the flyways for migratory birds and, thus, faces significant risk. It i s very
         difficult to apply bio-security measures aimed at avoiding contact between migratory and other
         wild birds and domestic poultry, particularly because in Georgia backyard poultry
         predominates and domestic birds are allowed to roam freely. In these circumstances, it i s
         likely to prove very difficult, ifnot impossible, to completely eradicate the HPIA virus, but the
         project will emphasize efforts to minimize contact betweenwild and domestic birds.
     0   Poor coordination among public agencies and weak linkages with the private sector.
         Ineffective coordination among ministries and public agencies, as well as weak linkages with
         the private sector, are major impediments to long-termplanning for infectious disease control.
         Given the zoonotic and transboundary nature o f this disease, a well coordinatedpublic-private
         response i s essential. The project will seek to establish efficient coordination arrangements
         and mechanisms.

59.      HumanHealth. According to WHO, the current epidemiological situation o f avian influenza
corresponds to "a Pandemic Alert Period, phase 3, with human infection (s) with a new sub-type, but
no human-to-human spread or at most, rare instances o f spread to a close contact". It differs from
previous influenza pandemics where health services had little time to prepare for the abrupt increases
incases and deaths that characterize these events, for severalreasons: (i) worldhasbeenwarned in
                                                                             the
advance; (ii)this advance warning has brought an unprecedented opportunity to prepare for a
pandemic and develop ways to mitigate its effect; (iii)     apart from stimulating national preparedness
activities, the present situation has created an important opportunity for international intervention
aimed at delaying the emergence o f a pandemic virus or forestalling its international spread.



                                                      - 20 -

 60.     The recent risk to human health posed by the avian influenza outbreaks led to the preparation
 o f a Global Technical Framework (as part o f the GPAI) to guide action against an increasing pandemic
 threat, while recognizing that there are areas that would still require further development and that
 specific actions to be included and supported under country projects (including this one) would reflect
 the epidemiological conditions, institutional capacity, and needs and priorities o f each country.

 61.      Critical for pandemic planning i s ensuring that the building blocks are in place ahead of an
 actual pandemic threat. The two major strategies supported under the GPAI are: (i)            containment
 measures to prevent transmission and spread o f the virus through social distancing measures, judicious
 use o f anti-viral medication, and strengthening o f surveillance and public health laboratory systems to
 ensure that capacity i s in place to identify rapidly and accurately emerging virus sub-types, and (ii)
 maintenance o f essential medical services and mobilization o f international emergency health care and
 staffing for low-income and low-capacity situations, if there i s explosive spread o f the virus within the
 general population and containment i s not longer possible, coupled with preparedness for pandemic
 vaccination development and administration. In addition, it is important to ensure that appropriate
 decision making bodies are in place and have the necessary expertise and authority to make decisions
 quickly and effectively in the face of rapidly developing situations. As such, the Project will support
 short-and long-term actions in the public health sector while ensuring that an appropriate balance i s
 struck between the two. The project i s fully consistent with recommendations o f WHO. The aim o f
 proposedinterventionsis to minimize the morbidity and mortality associated withthe pandemic event.

         GEORGIA: AVIAN INFLUENZA CONTROL AND HUMANPANDEMIC
                          PREPAREDNESSAND RESPONSEPROJECT

Macro-economicFramework

1.      Georgia is a small country with a population o f 4.6 million people which declared its
independence from Soviet rule in 1991. Inthe ensuing 15 years, its efforts to construct a democratic state
and rebuild the economy have been challenged by several factors, including separatist conflicts in South
Ossetia, and Abkhazia, civil war, crisis in Russia and a number o f natural calamities. Significant
economic reforms were undertaken in the early years, which led to good performance in 1996 and 1997,
but momentum slowed thereafter. Achievements intrade reform bank restructuring, legal and regulatory
reforms, privatization and competitionreforms, judicial reform, and health reforms were bluntedby weak
fiscal management and poor public sector capacity. Further, a dramatic deterioration in Governance
slowed economic growth and poverty reduction. Inresponse to the deteriorating situation, opposition to
the Government coalesced in massive protests during Parliamentary elections inNovember 2003, which
prompted the resignation o f President Shevardnadze, and election o f the new Government in January
2004.

2.       Economic performance duringthe first two years following the change o f Government has been
encouraging. GDP growth i s robust with estimated growth o f 5.9 percent in 2004 and 9.3 percent in
2005. Inflation remained at about 6.2 percent inthe 12 months ending inDecember, 2005. Tax revenues
have increased dramatically as a percentage o f GDP, increasing from 14.7 percent in 2003 to 18.2 percent
in 2004 and 19.8 percent in 2005. On the expenditure side the Government has substantially reduced
arrears, increasedpensions, and has been able to increase spending for priority areas such as infrastructure
and education.      Poverty, however, remains high, delivery o f public services requires significant
improvements. Moreover, the young Government now faces a new and sobering challenge - Highly
Pathogenic Avian Flu(HPAI).

3.       Georgia i s bordered by the Black Sea to the west, Russia to the north, Turkey and Armenia to the
 south and Azerbaijan to the east. Georgia's location places it at extreme risk for the spread o f HPAI.
Georgia's border with Turkey is near the regions in eastern Turkey with a high number o f reported
 outbreaks (13 in domestic poultry as o f the end o f January). A major migratory bird flyway crosses from
this direction over Georgia. Another flyway from the north crosses over Georgia's long border with
Russia, where outbreaks in seven regions have been reported. The length o f that border, the fact that it
 traverses difficult mountainous terrain and two conflict zones, complicates surveillance efforts for the
 disease.   The recent recorded outbreak inpoultry and wild fowl and the five human deaths inAzerbaijan
 show the tragic and critical nature o f the threat facing Georgia and its neighbors.

 4.      Georgia reported its first case o f Avian Flu on February 21, 2006 when a dead swan found at a
 lake in Ajara region tested positive to a test using a real time PCR. A second migratory bird tested
 positive the following day, and the Government declared a State o f Emergency inAdjara. It implemented
 culling in a three km radius around the site where the dead birds were found, lulling all domestic poultry
 (about 1800 chickens) in 12 villages within the 3km. radius.            Testing at the Central Reference in
 Weybridge UK later confirmed that the virus was indeedInfluenza A (H5N1).

 5.      Responsibility for the ongoing surveillance and monitoring for H P A I in poultry and migratory
 fowl and for response in case o f an outbreak rests with the MOA. Up until the positive test result, over




                                                       -23 -

1,000 samples had been taken from suspicious birds identified duringpassive surveillance. Also, regular
testing o f water fowl has been initiated at lakes along major migratory routes.

Agriculture and Poultry Sector

6.         Agriculture plays a key role in Georgia's economy, during the last five years, contributing about
20 percent o f total GDP. Due to the fact, that agnculture production is predominately small holder, in
2004 this sector accounted for about 50 percent of employment, though commercial farming i s growing in
importance.

7.         Poultry production i s widespread across the country and provides significant contribution to the
economy. The estimated annual output o f this sector inmonetary terms has grown over last 10 years and
achieved 156 million GEL in2004, though its contributionto the GDP is still quite small at about 1.6%o f
GDP in2004.

8.          Poultry production i s growing more rapidly than other livestock products. Inmonetary terms the
share o fpoultry production to livestock production increased from 10% up to 20%, over the last 10 years.




 9.         Duringthe last few years poultry sector grew not only inmonetaryterms, butalso physical stocks
 also steadily increased, as well as number o f eggs and quantity o fpoultry meat produced.

     11.    The share o f commercial enterprises is increasing, but currently they provide only about 10% o f
   total production. There are about a dozen of commercial enterprises in Georgia, with flock size from
   40,000 to 200,000 head. Despite the fact that there i s no registered case o f Avian Influenza yet in
    domestic poultry, it has already negatively impacted the Georgian economy and especially the poultry
    sector. Sales o f poultry products dropped tremendously, down to 10-15 percent o f previous levels and

three commercial enterprises already slaughtered their flock and stopped operations. Many small farmers
are also slaughtering their flocks.

12.      Responsibility for the ongoing surveillance and monitoring for HPAI in poultry and migratory
fowl and for response in case o f an outbreak rests with the MOA. Until January this year, state
veterinarians were under the Ministry's Veterinary Department, with branch offices in each o f Georgia's
65 Rayons. The MOA,in 2005, undertook a major review o f this structure, and developed a two stage
restructuringplans. Duringthe first stage, in July 2005 the number o f employees was reduced from 2500
to 650, out o f which about 70 veterinarians are employed in the headquarters o f veterinary department
and 580 inRayon offices and in veterinary laboratories. A second stage o f these reforms, which i s to be
introducedover the first half o f CY 2006, envisages that the veterinary department will be absorbed into a
newly created Food Safety Agency and the number o f state veterinaries will be reduced to about 200.
One or, in some cases two, state veterinarians will still be assigned to Rayon offices and the intention is to
evolve much o f the previous state veterinary functions that are o f a more private nature to the private
sector or have the private sector carry out some functions with a public good element, such as
vaccinations or HPAI control measures on a contractual basis. While the basic direction o f the reforms
will eventually lead to a more efficient division o f veterinary services between the public and private
sector, there i s a real concern whether in the transition period the much reduced public sector veterinary
service will be able to cope with the demands of constant surveillance for HPAI. The Government will
need to monitor the situation carefully, and adjust staffing in most critical areas to assure adequate
staffing for monitoring and surveillance, and quick response with containment measures inthe event o f an
outbreak.

 13.      Inresponse to the threat o f HPAIoutbreak the Government has established local crisis centers in
each o f the 65 Rayons based on the former structure of the Rayon veterinary units. Weekly meetings o f a
committee including the veterinary administration, health care department, local Government
representatives as well as local representatives o f the Ministry o f Education and Ministry o f Environment
are taking place to oversee the work o f the monitoring centers. Hotlines to the centers have been
established to report suspicious bird deaths. These centers provide the first line intervention when bird
deaths are reported. Fourteen o f the 65 centers have been identified as being in highrisk areas for HPAI
outbreaks and have been given additional veterinarian staff and equipment for sample collection and
testing.     They are backstopped by eight regional centers that aim to respond within two hours o f a
reported suspicious bird death to assist intaking samples and with disinfection.

 14.       Almost US$ 90.0 million inU S assistance i s being provided to upgrade labs for human testing at
the NCDC, and at Kutaisi Hospital, and three labs for veterinary testing. While the rehabilitation o f the
 labs i s intended to strengthen capacity for a wide range o f testing, the assistance fortunately provides
 Georgia with adequate testing facilities that are fully equipped to test for HPAI on the human side. Also,
 the Central Veterinary Laboratory has been renovated and equipped to test for the virus. Three lab
 technicians have been being trained in administering the test and further training i s scheduled for
 additional technicians. Construction i s also about to start on a Bio-Safety Level 3 lab in Tbilisi with
 separate facilities for animal and human testing. Construction will be finished in 2009. In addition two
 more regional veterinary labs will be renovated in Kutaisi and Akhaltsikhe (2007-2008), each o f these
 labs will have 4 sentinel stations, totally 8 sentinel stations across the country. Included in the US
 assistance, besides equipment and civil works, i s training for lab technicians and consumables and
 reagents needed for the virological tests.

 15.       Inaddition to the proposedproject, Bank assistance to the agriculture sector includes the ongoing
 Agricultural Research, Extension and Training project (ARET) and the Rural Development Project
 (RDP). At the Government's request, funds from both projects have been allocated to meet emergency

needs for H P A I preparedness, including personal protection equipment, disinfection equipment, cars for
surveillance, and materials for sample collection and testing.

Health Sector

16.     Health sector reforms, initiated back in 1995, supported purchaser/provider split, where the
MoLHSA maintained only stewardship role. The ministry, being a steward o f the system, i s responsible
for policy formulation, financing and regulatory action for controlling the quality, safety and effectiveness
o f health services, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.       Service providers are governed by the
commercial law, though major share-holder remains to be the state with the exception o f small share of
already privatized ones. Health services are financed by public and private sources. Public funds are
administered by the autonomous legal entity "State Social Insurance Fund"practicing purchasing function
and the only limitedprivate funding i s formal and pooled. Inthe context o f Governments decentralization
policy some o f the ministry's functions are delegatedto the Municipalities.

17.      Infectious disease surveillance system, sanitary inspection control and health promotion are
carried out by Public Health Department. The NCDC, being the public entity subordinated to the Public
Health Department, serves as a National Referral Center for the control o f communicable and non-
communicable diseases. The central laboratory is further supported by two regional laboratories, one in
the western part of the country and another in the Autonomous Region o f Adjara and the public health
laboratory network.

18.      Two IDA projects are under implementation in the health sector. The Primary Health Care
Project (PHC) i s aimed at helping the Government develop and implement a primary health care strategy,
and the Hospital Restructuring component o f the Structural Reform Support Project (SRS) i s helping to
rehabilitate key hospital infrastructure in the context of ongoing Government efforts to restructure the
sector. Inaddition to the proposed project, some funds from both these projects have been allocated to
finance key equipment to prepare for a human outbreak o f HPAI. The equipment includes respirators,
monitors, and personal protection gear for health care workers.

                             PREPAREDNESSAND RESPONSEPROJECT

1.         A country will qualify for support for an emergency project under the Program when it
demonstrates its commitment and readiness to implement early detection and rapid response measures
appropriate to the specific country conditions. As there i s a wide variation o f country conditions (Le.,
widely differing needs and development levels, as well as implementation capacities), projects need to
reflect the environment in which they will be implemented with scaling and sequencing o f project
activities, management arrangements,             cost-sharing provisions, and risk mitigation measures
appropriate to the Borrower'sRecipient's needs and institutional, fiscal and social reality. To reflect
the above, a country request for assistance will be eligible for financing under the APL when it meets
the following eligibility criteria:

               For countries in endemic situation (e.g. Cambodia, China, Indonesia, LAO PDR and
               Vietnam), where new human infections are being detected, it has prepared and i s
               implementing an HPAIControl Strategy;

               For newly infected countries (e.g. Croatia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Romania, Russia and
               Turkey) with an active outbreak o f avian flu among poultry, but no human infection, the
               existence o f an appropriate program o f rapid response, detection and containment
               measures, including appropriate implementation and monitoring arrangements that the
                international agencies and donor community, including the Bank, could support.

               For countries at risk, with no outbreak, or that are at an early stage o f an outbreak,
                government commitment and appropriate plan o f early detection and rapid response,
                including appropriate implementation and monitoring arrangements that the international
                agencies and donor community, including the Bank, could support.

                For countries with very low income levels and very low capacity circumstances,
                including LICUS countries, special criteria and waivers would apply if a full-blown human
               pandemic were to materialize, to ensure that assistance would be available if and when
                needed, even ifthe country itself would hardly be able to generate or mobilize any
                effective AI response, to safeguard the global public good nature o f the global avian
                influenza objective.

2.          A joint World Bank/WHO/FAO mission made an assessment o f the readiness o f Georgia to
proceed with program of support. It concluded that it meets the eligibility criteria as per (iii)      above,
i.e. it i s a country at risk, at an early stage o f an outbreak. The level o f commitment o f the Government
i s high: (i) letter requesting Bank's assistance was received on January 17, 2006 and a high level
               a
Governmental Steering Commission on Avian Influenza in Georgia (GSCAIG) chaired by the Prime
Minister was established, (ii)       a draft national plan on response to avian influenza pandemic was
prepared by the Government and will be finalized with assistance to be provided by the project, and
(iii) appropriate implementation and monitoring arrangements have been agreed upon. Moreover, the
Government prepared a Program for the Prevention o f Distribution and Control o f Avian Influenza in
Georgia, and asked the World Bank's assistance in financing the program and in coordinating donor
assistance for the program.

                              Appendix 3: DetailedProjectDescription
            Georgia: AVIAN INFLUENZA CONTROL AND HUMANPANDEMIC
                          PREPAREDNESSAND RESPONSEPROJECT


1.       The proposed project i s to be supported by an IDA Credit o f US$3.5 million and a IDA grant o f
the same amount. Inaddition co-financing from the Government o f Japan through a PHRD co-financing
grant will finance US1.4 million in technical assistance for the project. The Project i s supported by the
Bank financed Global Program for Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and
Response (GPAI). The GPAI i s provided using a horizontal adaptable program loan instrument (APL).
The horizontal APL provides an overall framework for coordinated action and co-financing with other
multilateral organization and donor agencies, by establishing a US$500 million facility to provide
individual countries, including Georgia, with financial and technical assistance.

2.       The Proposed project will run for three years from April 2006 to August 2009. It would finance
activities under three components: (i)   animal health; (ii) health; and (iii) awareness and
                                                            human                      public
information. It complements activities financed on an emergency basis under four ongoing World Bank
financed projects and those financed by other donors, namely the United States (USAID and the
Department o f Defense).

Component1-ANIMAL HEALTH

3 ,      This component will strengthen the Government's preparedness for monitoring, testing and
responding to an outbreak o f Avian Fluin the domestic poultry industry. This component has three main
sub-components, namely:

(A) StrengtheningNationalHPAIPreparednessand Prevention Capability(US$ 1.83 millionof
which US$0.33 millionare fromPHRDgrant funds)

A1 Strengtheningthe Regulatory andInstitutionalEnvironment. The project will support efforts to
    -
ensure that the regulatory framework for disease prevention, detection, containment and eradication i s
effective and in accordance with O E standards and guidelines. The project includes a review the current
legislative framework to assure its alignment with the public veterinary services structures that are
currently being reorganized. The component will assist indrafting of legal amendments, regulations and
implementation guidelines and manuals, as required, and assist inassuring that the restructured veterinary
 services provide an adequate preparedness and prevention capacity. Legal and veterinary staff from the
Ministryof Agriculture, representatives ofthe Ministry o f Justice and other agencies with the support of
 international experts on veterinary laws and regulations will review relevant legislation and regulations.
The review will focus particularly on regulations related to the control o f notifiable diseases and the
responsibilities o f public and private veterinary services, and any provisions for compensation
mechanisms for livestock owners inthe event o f mandatory culling. On the institutional side, the current
 veterinary structures are not best suited to respond to the increased need for information and prompt
 action posed by HPAI. To meet international standards set by the OIE and the recommendations
 developed by FAO, the veterinary services need to develop and document appropriate procedures and
 standards for the implementation and management o f animal health measures and international veterinary
 certification activities. The O E has developed instruments that allow national veterinary services to
 carry out a self-evaluation and establish their current level o f performance, form a shared vision with
 service providers and clients in the private sector, establish priorities, and facilitate strategc planning.
 The current reorganization of responsibilities and functions will have to be examined against these


                                                   - 31 -

instruments and further adjustments mightbe warranted for the veterinary sector to ensure it i s capable o f
meeting international requirements. This component will provide Technical Assistance for the legal,
regulatory and institutional review.

A2 - NationalAction and ContingencyPlan. While the Government has taken appropriate measures
for the short term monitoring activities, a comprehensive action and contingency plan i s lacking. The
project will provide technical assistance to assist in developing contingency plans that detail required
activities on all levels and to develop the necessary implementation guidelines and manuals for all
relevant agencies and services. The focus o f the work will be on planning for an outbreak, and detail how
a response to an outbreak would be managed, including organization o f culling programs, isolating the
area o f outbreak, and testing procedures to determine the spread o f the virus. The experts for this
assignment will need to work with the MOA, customs, laboratories, private veterinarians and other
agencies involved inHPAIprevention and control. Support will also be provided for the participation o f
veterinary experts and project staff in regional information exchanges on avian influenza as well as for
working visits to other countries implementing similar activities. The project will also facilitate the
organization o f regular regional workshops for information exchange and cooperation agreements.
Finally, the project will provide for simulation exercises to test the plan and to familiarize plan
participants at all levels with their responsibilities inthe event o f an outbreak o f HPAI.

A3 - Establishmentof a NationalCompensationPolicy and Funding, Early detection and reporting,
as well as rapid response, depend critically on the incentives for poultry owners to report very quickly any
sick and dead poultry to the respective veterinarians.          For this to happen, adequate compensation
arrangements have proven absolutely essential. The veterinary law, amended in 2004, provides for the
establishment o f compensation funding, but does not detail the required implementation arrangements -
including financing, fiduciary aspects, eligibility criteria, payment arrangements, flow o f funds, etc. The
project will provide technical assistance in the development o f these implementation arrangements and
ensure that all key players are sufficiently trained in conducting the compensation payments on the local
level.

Compensation payments, should a disease outbreak occur, will need to be provided quickly and in a
transparent manner. The Government will establish a compensation funding mechanism from which
owners o f culled animals will be compensated, and the project will provide up to US$1.4 million to
 finance the establishment o f this facility. A condition o f disbursement for this subcomponent will be that
the modalities for operating the fund have been established and have been approvedby IDA.

 The legal, institutional, and operational details o f the facility will be developed and agreed upon during
     .
 the first months o f project implementation. K e y parameters guidingthis effort include:

          Compensation payments to owners o f culled animals will be cash payments or transfers using,
     .    where possible, existing mechanisms established for similar transfers (checks, pension payments,
          poverty benefit);
          Records o f animals culled and their owners will need to be kept and verified at the time o f
          culling;
     m.   Separate arrangements for culling commercial operations and backyard poultry will need to be
          designed; and
          Payments per bird will need to be merit based well advertised during the culling operation.
          Actual payment shouldbe made within one month o f the culling operation.

 (B) StrengtheningDiseaseSurveillance,Diagnostic,and Containment Capacity(US$3.24 million o f
 which US$ 0.24 million are from PHRD grant funds)



                                                       - 32 -

B1 - Strengthening the Disease Monitoringand Containment System. Support will be provided to
strengthen the public veterinary services to bring them in line with OIE standards. This will include: (i)
training o f staff; and, (ii)
                            provision of priority infrastructure and equipment (limited works, equipment,
materials and supplies). It will also include targeted improvement o f the border inspection services
operated by the Customs Service through training and required equipment and facilities as well as
improving the mobility o f the veterinary services. Staff training will be targeted at the personnel o f inthe
new Food Safety Agency o f the Ministry o f Agriculture as well as public and private veterinarians
practitioners operating in the rural areas. Specifically training will be provided to the staff o f the 65
Rayon monitoring units and the eight regional rapid response centers. Priority early inthe project will be
given to the centers inRegions and Rayons designated as highrisk for HPAI outbreaks. The focus of the
training will be on awareness raising, monitoring, investigating, sampling and testing procedures as well
as on analyzing epidemiological data and performing risk assessments. The training will also focus on
outbreak containment, including arrangements for culling, disposal and compensation. The project will
also link the local level into the surveillance and monitoring system so that a feedback system for
notifiable animal diseases reaches to farmers, farm workers, and veterinarians at the local level. The sub-
component will support (i)training for veterinarians on treatment o f infected animals, reporting
procedures and immediate local response measures and (ii)      hands-on training for farmers in detection o f
clinical signs of notifiable diseases. Funding will be provided for essential first response equipment.
This will include personal protection equipment, disinfectant equipment, vehicles, mobile incinerators,
and materials for sampling and culling.

B2 - Strengthening Diagnostic Capacity. Georgia's laboratory capacity has been substantially
strengthened over the past years and i s largely equipped to diagnose all notifiable diseases including
HPAI. Therefore, project support will be targeted primarily to strengthening the diagnostic capacity that
needs to feed into the laboratory system. Developing this diagnostic capacity comprises strengthening o f
border inspection, regional laboratories and inspectors and veterinarians working on the local level in
sample collection and submission, detection, reporting and follow-up o f reported AI cases. It also
involves surveillance activities and rapid assessments for serological tests and screening surveys,
Essential equipment, consumables and reagents, staff training and technical assistance will be providedto
complete the chain o f response for disease surveillance. Selected major border crossing points will be
supported through improved facilities for inspection o f suspect consignments including separate
inspection rooms, disinfectants sprayers, wash basins, specimen containers and bags. The project will
also support the strengthening o f the existing epidemiology network to implement the national disease
 and surveillance system to: (i) enable early detection and investigation o f outbreaks o f exotic diseases or
 unusual events; (ii)  provide timely and reliable information about patterns o f occurrence o f enzootic
 diseasesto establish disease control priorities and formulate cost-effective control strategies; (iii)
                                                                                                      facilitate
 international trade and marketing o f local livestock products; and (iv) enable full reporting o f disease
 status to international and regional organizations,

 B3  - Strengthening Animal Disease Information Systems. Project assistance will be provided to
 improve the reporting o f animal health information from the field and the flow o f information among
 relevant agencies. The emphasis will be on developing an efficient disease information system, as part of
 the effort to enable Georgia to participate in global disease information sharing, in full compliance with
 the obligations o f membership in the OIE.         Much emphasis will be placed on human resources
 development in the establishment and use o f database programs (including GIs) and the analysis o f data
 to deliver the necessary support to decision makers charged with prevention and control o f animal
 diseases.    The system will be linked with rapid and standardized methods o f routine analysis o f
 surveillance data, which will demonstrate important changes inthe H5N1 situation, and this information
 will be promptly supplied to field staff. The project will finance relevant epidemiological studies and
 surveillance programs to inform the improvement o f disease control measures, which will be then


                                                     - 33 -

adjusted and improved as new information becomes available. It will also support the upgrading o f
Georgia's participation in the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) to strengthen the
country's ability to participate in global disease information sharing.    The applicability o f graphical
information system technology will be fully exploited.

C. Component ImplementationSupport, MonitoringandEvaluation

Financing will be provided for limited consultant services to ensure effective implementation o f the
project in accordance with Bank fiduciary and procurement guidelines. Implementation support for this
component will be provided through the existing PCC in the MOAwhich i s supporting ongoing Bank-
financed in the sector. Funding will be provided for additional procurement and financial management
support as required, and for monitoring and evaluation.

Component2: HUMANHEALTH

4.       Inthe public healthfield,  short-and long-term actions needto be taken and an appropriate balance
need to be struck between the two. While immediate steps can be taken to address the crisis, there i s also
a longer-term agenda given systemic shortcomings in core public health functions. Work on both the
short- and long-term fronts, therefore, needs to proceed in parallel, and efforts should be made to ensure
that short-term responses are consistent with and contribute to proposed longer-term interventions.
Setting priorities inboth cases i s essential.

5.       Building an effective national public health response will require an enabling environment and
the necessary resources to bring proven interventions quickly up to nationwide scale. Thus, the Project
will help to operationalize some elements that are contemplated as part o f the global strategic plan,
expanding and intensifying the responses rapidly. As it i s unlikely that the global spread o f a pandemic
influenza virus could be preventedonce it emerges, the emphasis i s on reducing its impact. Several tools
will help achieve this aim: (i)   year-round surveillance; (ii)
                                                              effective and accurate methods o f diagnosis;
(iii) distance interventions; (vi) anti-viral drugs; and(vi) strengthenedmedical services. The
      social
interventions supported under the Project will be based on Georgia's epidemiological and programmatic
needs, and well-assessed options for meeting them. The interventionswould be grouped into three broad
categories:

 (A) EnhancingPublicHealthProgramPlanningand Coordination(US$0.42 millionof which
US$0.28 million i s from PHRD grant funds)

While MoLHSA recently prepared a national preparedness plan (NAIPP), development of national
pandemic influenza action plan (NPIAP) i s important. The project will provide technical assistance to
complete required sections, including: (i)    the context and epidemiological underpinnings o f an eventual
 influenza pandemic; (ii)  the current legislative and regulatory basis for intervention; (iii)surveillance
 arrangements; (iv) verification  of suspected cases through serological testing and virological subtyping;
 (v) prevention through immunization; and (vi) symptomatic case management with antiviral drugs. Also
the plan will need to provide details on the coordination o f the emergency response, and the logistics
 involved. It will also need to focus on the protocols and algorithms to be followed for surveillance,
 diagnosis, immunization and anti-viral therapy during inter-pandemic, pandemic alert and pandemic
 periods, and the means o f communication and public information.        Finally, it will need to estimate
resource and training requirements for effective implementation and make the necessary arrangements
 that they are inplace.




                                                     - 3 4 -

The Project will help MoLHSA to buildits institutional capacity to command and control in a coordinated
fashion the implementation o f the plan and assist the GSCAIG to become a truly functioning coordinating
agency. The proposed sub-component will finance technical expertise for the preparation o f the national
pandemic influenza action plan (NPIAP) in close coordination and collaboration with all respective
government agencies. Moreover, financing will be made available for technical assistance to help
establish an enabling legal environment. The sub-component will also meet the resource requirements for
field-testing (e.g. simulation exercises) and implementationinvolving regional and local levels, as well as
supranational levels.

(B) Strengthening of National Public Health Surveillance Systems (US$ 1.02 million of which
US$0.028 million are from PHRD grant funds)

Novel influenza strains are detected through clinical and virological surveillance o f human and animal
influenza disease. More specifically detection involves (i)   active surveillance for influenza-like illness
(ILI) nationwide; (ii)collection of specimens for diagnostic testing and virus subtyping of suspected
cases; (iii)confirmation o f positive and a certain proportion o f negative results in a reference laboratory;
and (iv) outbreak investigation in areas with confirmed human cases. Surveillance systems should be
enhanced prior to the start of a pandemic, to ensure that the high demand for timely information that can
be anticipated ina pandemic can be met. T o this end, the proposed Project will support:

B1- Improvement of Laboratory Networks. InGeorgiathere is one reference public healthlaboratory
for virology at the NCDC which acts as National Influenza Center (NIC).        The capacity of the NIC has
been substantially strengthened over the past year and it i s largely equipped to diagnose all notifiable
diseases including HPAI. It i s not clear however, whether existing capacity can cope with the increased
demand in times o f pandemic. Therefore, project support would be targeted primarily to strengthen the
diagnostic capacity. Under this sub-component, financing will be available to upgrade the existing
national reference laboratory in Tbilisi (NRL), including design, renovation and upgrade to Bio-Safety
Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory with concomitant physical containment requirements (P3), required for virus
isolation and sub-typingto determine various strains. In addition, financial support will be provided to
upgrade the regional public health laboratory in Batumi for rapid diagnosis and cell culture, as well as
equipping the NRL with the mobile laboratory. Support will be provided for upgrading regional public
health laboratories through procurement o f consumables, and training for regional health managers and
communicable disease division chiefs.

B2   -  Improvement of Health Information Systems. In coordination with PHC project and other
ongoing interventions financed by donor agencies, this sub-component will support technical assistance
and training to strengthen the Health Management Information System (HMIS) to improve surveillance,
communications, and information sharing at the different levels o f the health care system to strengthen
preparedness and response capacity to avian influenza and other infectious disease outbreaks and to fast-
track available treatments for the disease.

(C)Strengthening Health System Response Capacity (US$2.7 million o f which US$0.212 million are
from PHRD grant funds)

Aggressive containment measures such as isolation and prophylactic use o f antiviral drugs may slow the
 spread o f a pandemic and allow time for response measures. Although mass vaccination i s the preferred
 intervention, an efficacious vaccine may not be ready and/or available for use as part o f a large-scale
vaccination campaign soon enough to contain the pandemic. Anti-viral supply and production capacity
 are also limited. Therefore, the project will indirectly support through the implementation o f the NPIAP,
 "social distancing measures"   --such as simulation exercises, quarantines, bans on mass gatherings, and



                                                    - 35 -

travel restrictions, backed up by a well-designed communication strategy. The project may also help
MoLHSA to implement its vaccination strategy inthe case o f a pandemic, depending upon the estimation
of country's needs. In addition, the project will support the procurement o f anti-virals o f sufficient
quantity for prevention o f Influenza inthose groups at highest risk such as poultry farmers and healthcare
workers, Additional preventive actions such as personal hygiene promotion and distribution and use o f
masks will be supported, along with increased awareness and promotion o f community participation in
slowing the spread o f the pandemic. Inthis area, the project will support:

C1 Social DistancingMeasures. Measures to prevent contracting avian influenza is to limit, as much
     -
as possible, contact with the public. Therefore, the project will support the implementation o f immediate
term responses -- the classic "social distancing measures"--such as school closings, backed up by a well-
designed communication strategy. Financing will be made available for developing guidelines on social
distancing measures      to put into operation existing or new laws and regulations, for supporting
coordination with other sectoral ministries and agencies, and for supporting the Ministry o f Health on the
caring health personnel and other sectoral staff involved in pandemic response activities. Additional
preventive actions to complement social distancing such as personal hygiene promotion through various
communication channels, including hand washing and proper cooking, and distribution and use o f masks
will be supported, along with increased awareness and promotion o f community participation inslowing
the spread o f the pandemic.

C2 - Vaccination Support and Anti-viral Therapy. Support will be provided for expanding regular
seasonal flu vaccination as a vital step to prevent an outbreak among humans. In case o f an influenza
pandemic, when a vaccine becomes available, funding could also be made available for implementing an
influenza vaccination program that rapidly administers vaccine to priority groups and monitors vaccine
effectiveness and safety. The targeted priority groups will be selected on the basis o f several factors: (i)
risk o f occupational infectious/transmission (e.g., health care workers); (ii) responsibilities of certain
                                                                                the
occupations in providing essential public health safety services; (iii)  impact o f the circulating pandemic
virus on various age groups; and (iv) heightened risks for persons with specific conditions. To this end,
support will be provided for the rehabilitation, expansion, and equipment o f cold storage facilities where
needed to strengthenthe distribution and storage o f vaccines and other medical products.

In a pandemic, vaccine supply levels will change over time. That is, when a pandemic first strikes,
vaccine will likely not be ready for distribution. The therapeutic use of anti-viral drugs, while not a
panacea, would be part o f the strategy to contain an avian influenza pandemic and to reduce morbidity
 and mortality. Governments and international agencies, such as WHO, are stockpiling anti-viral drugs.
 Therefore, support will be provided for the purchase and distribution o f anti-viral drugs in accordance
 with WHO guidelines and arrangements, determine the susceptibility o f the pandemic strain to existing
 influenza antiviral drugs and target use o f available supplies; adoption o f measures to avoid inappropriate
 use to limit the development o f antiviral resistance and ensure that this limited resource i s used
 effectively. Support will also be provided to monitor patient compliance with treatment regimes and the
 onset o fresistance to anti-viral drugs.

 Although anti-viral drugs such as neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir) do not cure influenza infection,
 they have been shown to reduce the severity o f the symptoms as well as alleviate complications, thus
 decreasing the consequences o f the infection and reducing the hospitalization rate.          However, the
 availability o f influenza antiviral medications i s limited and production cannot be rapidly expanded.
 Therefore, planning by health agencies i s needed to assure effective use o f available drugs. To this end,
 support will be provided for developing guidelines and educating physicians, nurses, and other health
 personnelbefore and duringthe pandemic to promote effective use o f these drugs.




                                                      - 36 -

C3  - Medical Services.      Assistance would be provided to the health care system for preparedness
planning and strategy development to provide optimal medical care and maintain essential community
services. To this end, sub-component will finance: a) technical assistance for the development o f plans to
establish specialized units in selected hospitals and increase bed availability in case o f a pandemic
through more stringent triage for admission and earlier discharge with follow-up by home health care
personnel, b) development and/or updating o f treatment guidelines and hospital infection control
guidelines and measures, including antibiotic stocks, and mobilization o f additional health personnel, c)
training o f health personnel,   d) provision o f equipment, drugs, vaccines, and other medical inputs,
diagnostic reagents, including kits, and e) minor renovation o f specialized unitsin selected hospitals.

(D) ComponentImplementation Support, Monitoring andEvaluation

Financing will be provided for limited consultant services to ensure effective implementation o f the
project in accordance with Bank fiduciary and procurement guidelines. Implementation support for this
component will be provided through the existing PIU for the Primary Health Care Project in the
MoLHSA which i s supporting ongoing Bank-financed in the sector. Funding will be provided for
additionalprocurement and financial management support as required, and for monitoring and evaluation.

Component 3 -PUBLIC AWARENESSAND INFORMATION(US$0.9 million o f which
US$0.3 1millionare from PHRD grant funds)

This component is intended to promote awareness and improved coordination o f the execution of the
contingency plans and the NAPP. It i s designed to safeguard human health and to facilitate surveillance
and monitoring for outbreaks by improving public awareness and information. Under this component,
support will be provided for the development o f strategies to promote public awareness and improved
coordinationo f the execution o fthe national HPAIresponses strategies and plans.

Support will focus on information and communication activities to increase the attention and commitment
o f government, private sector, and civil society organizations, and to raise awareness, knowledge and
understanding among the general population about the risk and potential impact o f the pandemic. It will
provide communications support to the Avian Influenza response operations across different sectors, at
different administrative levels, and along different pandemic phases:


     9  Advocacy interventions will be needed to maintain and/or create the high-level political
         engagement; a multi-sectorial approach; a credible and trusted public sector response; a
        professional media reporting accurately the AI agenda; and an informed base o f decision-makers,
         supportive o f policy implementation and safety-net programs.


     9  Public information and behavior-change interventionsto prevent farmers, poultry workers, traders
         and processors, veterinarians, extension workers and health workers, as well as vulnerable
         groups, from becoming infected. As the epidemic evolves, there will be the need to highlight
        preparedness plans to contain and delay the spread o f the virus.         For the mid-term, formal
         education interventions to segmented populations, will teach general populations about living
         with an endemic situation.


     9   Creation o f a pro-active citizenry, ready to mobilize community resources at the grass-root level,
         to monitor and mitigate the impact on the poorest o f the poor.




                                                     - 37 -

        As fast-reporting and fast-response is a pre-requisite for containment, the communication
        component will use available communications and information technology (ICT), to scale-up
        information-sharing from the grass-root level, up to important stakeholders and decision-makers.

To design and coordinate these activities, a communication unit that is part o f the PIThter-Ministerial
Working Group i s required, with an immediate input into: the design o f an integrated and comprehensive
communications strategy and action plan; selection and sub-contracting o f services to implement the
communication interventions; training o f spoke-persons from priority sectors in managing the media;
partnering with the electronic and print media with a view to highlighting the national response, as well as
accurately reporting on the monitoring, preparedness, containment and mitigation plans, as the case may
be.

A communication professional will be assigned for day to day support to the PIT/Inter-Ministerial Task-
Team. A communications budget, contingent on an overarching strategy and plan, will be assigned to
subcontract high-impact and far-reaching campaigns, and to maintain a constant presence in the public's
agenda. The communication plan will put a strong emphasis on immediate actions to advocate, prevent
and contain, and the budgetary allocation will reflect that emphasis.

In addition to the advocacy role, communication programs will bring the public's attention to a wide
range o f actions stemming from the national response (investments in infrastructure, rapid-training for
service delivery, allocation o f special financial instruments to compensate and mitigate the impact, etc.)
This information, together with the activities of the civic and private sectors, will create an "enabling
environment," that reduces uncertainty, and builds social-support, trust, and understanding o f the possible
scenarios.

To carry out these communication activities, communication specialists and operational resources will be
assigned to the component managers o f both the MOAand MoLHSA, to subcontract rapid-research
around knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP studies) o f vulnerable and at-risk populations; to design
and produce awareness-raising and prevention campaigns; and promote fast reporting through innovative
technologies. The Ministry o f Education and relevant partners will participate in the development of
educational materials to be used in schools, community and faith-based organizations, to access groups
that are marginalizedor hard-to-reach.

The mobilization o f group resources is an important element that needs to be considered, particularly in
preparation for possible pandemic levels 5 and 6. Fostering community support is crucial to facilitate
transparency in the allocation o f financial incentives, responsiveness in the containment and mitigation
actions, and adoption o f policies and ordinances that might be enforced (culling and banning backyard
farming, for example). A two-way flow o f communications, and not only a top-down approach, has to be
established, where local interests and cultural context are accounted.

The communications component will provide resources to subcontract technical assistance, training, as
well as goods and services.

                            Appendix 4a: ImplementationArrangements
           Georgia: AVIAN INFLUENZA CONTROL AND HUMANPANDEMIC
                          PREPAREDNESSAND RESPONSEPROJECT

1.      The project will be implemented by MOAand the MoLHSA. The Minister o f Agriculture will
designate a senior veterinary official as the component manager for the Animal Health Component and
the Minister o f Health will designate a deputy Minister to be in charge o f the Human Health and
Communications Components. Both component managers will be responsible for the implementation o f
their respective components.

2.       GovernmentalSteering Commissionon AvianInfluenzainGeorgia (GSCAIG). Thismulti-
sectoral task force was formed in January 2006 to respond to the threat of HPAI. It i s chaired by the
Prime Minister and includes the ministers o f finance, health, education, agriculture and defense. It sets
overall policy on HPAIprevention and control and oversees the efforts o f the Government inmonitoring
and surveillance, prevention measures, and inpreparing responses to contain identified outbreaks. The
task force would also serve as the overall coordinating and oversight body for the proposedproject and it
will review at least twice annually progress with project implementation.

3.       A Inter-ministerialTask Force (IMTF). This Task force chaired by the Deputy Minister o f
Labor, Health and Social Affairs and representedby Ministry o f Agriculture, Ministry o f Education and
Science, Ministry o f Finance, Ministry o f Defense, Ministry o f Environmental Protection and Natural
Resources, Customs Department, Public Health Department, National Center for Decease Control, Drug
Agency and Infectious Disease Hospital, WHO, WB, UNICEF, and USAID. It i s charged with the
responsibility o f ensuring that the policy and operational directions o f the Commission are carried out.
This task Force meets weekly to oversee and coordinate Avian Fluactivities across the Government and
report on the progress to the GSCAIG.

4.       Project Implementation Team (PIT). Given the multi-sector nature o f the project and the need
to coordinate across the sectors particularly in overall information sharing and in the implementation o f
the communications strategy, a project implementation team has been established to coordinate project
activities. Participants in the team will include the two component managers, and representatives from
the customs department, and the Ministry o f Finance. These same team members serve on the working
group established under the Task Force. The team will be chair by a designated official o f the Prime
Minister's Office. It will meet regularly to review project implementation, identify outstanding issues,
 and coordinate activities.

 5.      Animal Health Component. The implementing agency for this component will be MOA. A
 senior Veterinary official in the ministry, designated by the Minister, will be the component manager for
this component. Since procurement and financial management skills required by IDA and necessary for
Project implementation are lacking within the Ministry, assistance in these areas will be provided by the
PCC which has been established to support implementation o f several IDA projects in the agricultural
 sector. The PCC i s an entity under Public Law reporting to MOA. The entity i s well experienced in
 managing IDA-financed projects and in assuring that procurement and financial management is carried
 out inaccordance with World Bank guidelines.

 6.      PCC accountant/financial management specialists will be responsible for setting up and operating
 the project's financial management and accounting system according to IDA standards and to keep and
 monitor project accounts for the Animal Health component.




                                                     - 3 9 -

7.      Procurement for the Animal Health component will be carried out under the IDA procurement
guidelines. The PCC will draft procurement documents for the Animal Health Component, and will carry
out day-to-day contract management activities. However, the MOAwill be responsible for decision-
making issues such as decisions about evaluation committee members. Contracts will be signed by the
MOAand the contractors. Contract negotiations will be carriedout by the MOAwith participation of the
PCC. The MOAwill keep originals o f all procurement documents with copies at the PCC.

8.      Human Health Component. The Human Health Component will be implemented by the
MoLHSA. The Deputy Minister, who i s responsible for Avian Fluinthe Ministry, will be designated by
the Minister to be in charge o f the Project. As with the other component, financial management and
procurement services for the component will be provided by an existing entity in the Ministry that i s
experienced in implementing IDA projects. Specifically, GHSPIC, which i s responsible for the ongoing
Primary Health Care Project, will also handle procurement and financial management under the Human
Health Component.

9.      The main function o f the GHSPIC will be assisting the MoLHSA to undertake procurement work,
project financial management and accounting, disbursements, financial reporting, and auditing
arrangements.    The activities o f the PIU under this project will be under direct oversight o f the
Component. The Ministry will be responsible for all other functions related to implementation o f this
component, including inter alia decisions relating to the terms o f references for consultants, and
substantive supervision o f their work.

10.     The GHSPIC accountanb'financial management specialists will be responsible for setting up
Project financial and accounting system according to IDA standards and to keep and monitor project
accounts for the health component. An auditor acceptable to IDA will annually audit project-related
accounts, disbursements, and Statements o f Expenditures (SOEs) according to international standards.
Both the GSHPIC and the PCC will coordinate their activities and the GSHPIC will be responsible for
submittingconsolidated reports to IDA.

11.     The GHSPIC will undertake procurement in accordance with World Bank Guidelines for this
component and will carry out day-to-day contract management activities.             However, for consultant
services, MoLHSA will be responsible for establishing evaluation committees, contract negotiations and
signingand providing substantive inputto the contractors.

 12.    PublicAwareness and InformationComponent. The communications component will also be
managedby the Ministryo f Health, specifically by the component manager for the health component, and
GHSPIC will also handle procurement and financial management arrangements for this component.
Substantive management o f the component will, however, need to take into account that the
communication strategy for HPAI has to encompass both the animal and human aspects o f the H P A I
threat. Thus, while the day-to-day management o f the Component will rest within the MoLHSA, for
substantive decisions on the communications strategy, and specific messages arising from that strategy,
the component would receive guidance from the GSCAIG at the level o f strategy formulation, and the
PIT on, inter alia, the content o f specific messages, choice o f media, and design o f training activities.

Preamble

1.       As described in OP 8.50 for Emergency Recovery Assistance (ERA) and in addition to
providing emergency assistance, the Bank may support operations for prevention and mitigation in
countries prone to specific types o f emergencies. Such operations could assist in: (a) developing a
national strategy, (b) establishing an adequate institutional and regulatory framework, (c) carrying out
studies o f vulnerability and risk assessment, (d) reinforcing vulnerable structures, and (e) acquiring
hazard-reduction technology.

2.       Given the threat that H P A Iposes to the economic and social fabric o f Georgia as well as to the
health o f its population because o f the risk o f an influenza pandemic, the Project will be financed
through an IDA Credit and a PHRD Grant to be approved following ERAprocedures.

A. General

3.       Procurement. Procurement under the project will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated M a y 2004 (Procurement
Guidelines), and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers"
dated M a y 2004 (Consultant Guidelines), and with the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement.
Agreements covering procurement methods, thresholds, and other conditionality will be determined
with due regardto capacities and experiences with Bankprocurement o fthe implementing agencies.

4.       The activities covered under the project will be implemented on the basis o f annual work plans
to allow for needed flexibility in adjusting project work to account for in-country experience and the
lessons from implementation by other countries participating in the multi-country GPAI. As a result,
the following approaches to procurementwill be adopted:

B.Procurementarrangements

5.       Procurement Plan. Procurement plans (PP) for each component covering the initial 12 month
period o f Project implementation was finalized during negotiations. PPs will be updated at least every
year and will be submitted to the Bank for its review and approval before the end o f the previous year
and will use a pre-defined standard format which will list as a minimum: (i)      each procurement action
distributed by type o f contract (goods, works, consulting services and training to be carried out during
the following calendar year, (ii) estimated values; (iii) method o f procurement and (iv) the
                                   their                        the
timetable for carrying out the procurement. At the time o f approving the annual work program, the
Bank would agree on the consistency with the application o f the Bank Guidelines to the specific
procurement expected during the year and their methods o f procurement. If needed, the PP would be
revised and re-submitted. A'fonnat for a typical planwas agreed at negotiations.

 6.      Procurement Methods and Thresholds. The PP defines the appropriate methods and thresholds
 for various procurement and selection methods to be followed. Preparation and updating of the PP will be
 guided by the following table which indicates thresholds for procurementmethods and prior review
requirements. The parameters have been determined on the basis o f the Bank's assessment o f the
 capacity o f the two respective implementing agencies (the PCC and GHSPIC) which will be responsible

for procurement, the estimated risks o f corruption inthe country and the capacities o f Georgia's
manufacturing, construction and consulting industries as well as current ECApolicy (this policy was
recently revised).

contracting with firms and individuals debarred by the Bank. The listing o f such debarred firms and
individuals i s locatedat:

C. ProcurementCapacity Assessments

11.      The two PIUs are presently in charge o f procurement under several regular Bank-financed
operations and the experience so far i s good. The procurement staff in each of the two PIUs i s
experienced in procurement following World Bank Guideless. The same staff will be responsible for
procurement under this Project. If need be, additional short-term procurement consultants may be
hired to cope with peak workloads.

12.      The Bank has carried out procurement capacity assessments o f the two PIUs which will be
responsible for fiduciary tasks including procurement and disbursements and has found them
satisfactory. The concerned staff i s also familiar with all the procurement methods to be used under
the Project. However, given the country conditions and recent political history, the overall assessment
is: "high risk". The PP will define thresholds for prior review appropriate to each type and estimated
amount o f contract. Such thresholds will be defined to minimize prior review as appropriate to the
level o f risk.

 13.      As the Project would have a strong decentralized implementation element, and to help the
Bank to carry out post-review o f procurement actions, consultants would be hired by the Project to
carry out annual procurement audits o f a sample o f contracts, under terms o f reference acceptable to
the Bank.

 14.      A number o f specialized UN and bilateral agencies operating in the Region have supported
various country agencies in the procurement o f drugs, vaccines, specialized test equipment and
 supplies and other materials.    Using this type of assistance may become part o f the planned
procurement arrangements. In accordance with the Procurement Guidelines Section 3.9, the Project
 will include the possible use o f Specialized Agencies o f the United Nations (WHO, FA0 and
 UNICEF) as suppliers o f goods (mainly for drugs and vaccines and some medical supplies such as
 reagents); such agencies would follow their own procedures o f procurement.

CountryIssues

1.      The most recent CFAA was conducted in September 2003 and updated in March 2004. The
CFAA assessed each component o f the public expenditure management framework and analyzed the
fiduciary risks in the system o f internal controls. The individual assessments took account o f the level
and magnitude o f risk presented in each component. The CFAA team adopted the European Union's
Public Internal Financial Control Systems (PFCS) model o f internal control as the basis for its analysis
o f the Government's internal control framework. Significant and serious weaknesses remain in many
parts o f the public expenditure management system. However, the Government i s taking actions to
improve its systems of financial management. Particularly, the treasury function revenue accounting was
transferred from the NBG to the Treasury and a system for cash management has been introduced. The
severe cash shortages of the past few years have been addressed. A single treasury revenue account has
been established. Treasury introduced a Treasury Single Account. Inaddition, Treasury i s inthe process
o f implementing a modern Treasury system with the support o f the Bank-financed Public Sector Financial
Management Reform Support Project that i s currently beginning implementation. In addition, the WB
financial management team has reviewed the Treasury system and assessed it as satisfactory for holding
special accounts o f the project.

StrengthsandWeaknesses

2.      The strengths that provide a basis for reliance on the project financial management system
include: (i)significant experience o f both PIUs management and FM staff in implementing Bank-
financed projects for past several years; and (ii)adequate accounting software utilized by both PIUs.

3.       Weaknesses were not identified at the PIUs. However, proper design o f the Compensation
Fundingprocedures and their implementation are expected to mitigate the risk o f misuse o f the funds to
be provided under the Compensation Fundingsub-component,

InternalControls

4.       With the exception o f the Compensation Funding sub-component, for which adequate internal
control procedures need to be designed, both PCC and GHSPIC have maintained an effective internal
control system to ensure that project expenditures are properly authorized, supporting documents are
maintained; accounts are reconciled periodically; project assets, are safeguarded.        Although project
 accounting will be on an accrual basis, detailed assethnventories register will be maintained as part o f the
project internal control procedures. The PCC and Health PIU will implement appropriate controls over
 inventories o f drugs, vaccines, medical equipment, and other sensitive and/or expensive assets will be
 especially important for the project.

 Staffing

 5.      The existing FMstaffing inthe PCC and GHSPIC are considered adequate to implement this new
 project at the initial phase, but additional staff are expected to be needed to strengthen the existing
 capacity inboth PIUs and particularly inthe entity responsible for compensation funding(probably PCC)

to allow for regular reconciliation o f the documents to be received as well as periodic visits to the village
level to review the implementation o f the compensation mechanism. The additional FM staff will report
to the PIUs financial managers and will be responsible for disbursement functions as well as project
accounting maintaining books o f accounts, reporting day-to-day transactions and preparing accounting
              -
reports and financial statements, as well as monitoring financial flows to project beneficiaries. The
financial   managers o f both PIUs will have primary responsibility for the quarterly financial reports
(FMRs) and will prepare the annual financial statements for audit. However, the Health PIU's financial
manager will be also responsible for consolidation o f the separate FMRs into one for regular submission
to the Bank.

Accounting

6.       The accounting books and records o f the both PIUs will be maintained on an accrual basis and
project financial statements, including quarterly FMRs, are going to be presented in United States dollars.
The financial management manuals are being updated based on the agreed organizational structure o f the
FMteam to reflectrelevantaccounting policies andinternalcontrolprocedures.

InternalAudit

7.       No internal audit units exist nor are going to be established inthe PIUs, considering the small size
o f the entities.

ReportingandMonitoring

 8.       For project monitoring purposes, quarterly financial monitoring reports will be required to be
prepared by each PIU for the component/s under their management. Both PIUs will be responsible for
 designing appropriate financial monitoring reports (FMRs) to include: (a) Project Sources and Uses o f
 Funds, (b) Uses o f Funds by Project Activity, (c) Designated Account/Treasury Account Statements, (d)
 Physical progress report, and (e) Procurement report. These financial reports will be submitted to IDA
 within 45 days o f the end o f each quarter. The first quarterly FMRwill be submitted after the end o f the
 first full quarter following the initial disbursement. Formats o f the annual financial statements and the
 FMRs will be incorporated inthe Financial ManagementManuals (FMM)o fbothPIUs. The accounting
 software currently used by the PCC and GHSPIC will need to be upgraded to have the capacity to prepare
 FMRsincorporatingall components, sub-components andexpenditure categories, as may be appropriate.

 InformationSystems

 9.       PCC has the in-house developed software "Coppers" and, for salaries, also in-house developed
 (very simple) software "Payroll".   Both o f them have been functioning for a number o f years already, and
 no problems have been noted. For both systems a very good comprehensive user manual has been
 developed and distributed to all accounting staff. The "Coppers" system has a functionality o f exporting
 to Excel where the FM staff can made further modification to enhance the reports. Recently, the
 accounting system has been upgradedto include the accounting and reporting requirements o f the MOF.

 10.      The GHSPIC is using ORIS accounting software, which i s used by most o f projects in Georgia
 and has been found as adequate for accounting and reporting purposes in WB-financed projects.
 However, ORIS does not yet produce FMRs automatically and it i s planned to complete upgrading of the
 software to incorporate that functionality.

DisbursementArrangements

11.      Project funds will flow from (i) Bank, either via two Dedicated Accounts (Treasury Foreign
                                           the
Currency Sub-Accounts) to be maintained inthe Treasury: one for Human Health and Public Awareness
and Information components implemented by MoLHSA (GHSPIC) and second for Animal health
component implemented by MOA(PCC), which will be replenished on the basis o f SOEs or by direct
payment on the basis o f direct payment withdrawal applications received fkom both PIUs; and (ii)      the
Government, via the Treasury through normal Budget allocation procedures initiated by the PIUs in
accordance with standard Georgian Treasury and Budget execution regulations. The funds flow process
i s describedbelow.

12.      Expenditures will be processed in accordance with standard Treasury/Budget execution
procedures. The PCC and GHSPIC will implement the relevant components o f the project for which they
are the responsible. Thus PCC or GHSPIC will approve contracts, enter commitments, and discharge
payments relating to the components for which they are responsible, all o f which will be performed
through the Treasury system.


CompensationFunding

 13.      The Compensation mechanism was discussed with the Government representatives but not been
developed per the Government request. The mechanism will be documentedand finalized after the project
negotiations, which will be a disbursement condition under the Compensation funding sub-component.
However, key components o f the mechanism and a time line for finalizing the design o f the mechanism
were discussed during the negotiations. Elements discussed included adequate record keeping during
culling exercises, maintenance o f data bases for the records, well advertised pricing arrangements,
transparent flow of funds and documents and payment arrangements, adequate disclosure o f payments
made, clear and appropriate internal control procedures, and adequate feedback or complaints
mechanisms.

 FinancialAudits

 14.      There will be annual audits o f the project financial statements prepared for relevant components
 by PCC and GHSPIC and consolidated by GHSPIC, covering all aspects o f the project, including specific
 requirements for the Compensation Funding. The audits will be performed by independent auditors
 acceptable to the Bank, and inaccordance with InternationalStandards on Auditing(ISA), and the Bank's
 guidelines on auditing as stated in the guidelines: Annual Financial Reporting and Auditing for World
 Bank-financed Activities (June 2003).       The auditors' TORs will be prepared by the GHSPIC in
 coordination with PCC and cleared by the Bank before the engagement o f the auditor. The audit TOR
 will include both the audit o f financial transactions, an assessment of the internal control, funds flow
 mechanisms at the PIUs, and the reasonableness o f the accounting, reporting and internal controls in
 respect o f the Compensation Funding. The annual audit reports will consist o f a single opinion on the
 financial statements o f the project, incorporating the project accounts, including two Dedicated Accounts
 Reconciliation, and SOE Withdrawal Schedules; as well as a Management Letter. The audit reports will
 be submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the end o f the fiscal year to which they relate.
 The cost o f the audits will be eligible for financing from the Credit. The both PIUs will provide the
 auditor with full access to project-related documents and records, including the compensation claims
 database, and with the information required for the purpose o f the audit. Sample TORs for project audit
 will be included inthe Financial Manual.

Financial Management Action Plan

15.      With the exception o f compensation funding, the financial management arrangements o f the PCC
and GHSPIC are adequate, but a number o f capacity building actions are required to ensure that the
financial management arrangements are strengthened for this project.     The following action plan was
discussed with the Recipient during Negotiations. Satisfactory implementation of the action plan will
ensure the establishment o f a financial management system that fully meets requirements o f the Project
and o f the Bank.

Payments
18.     The agreed project budget for both components i s first divided into quarterly appropriations/limits
inconjunction with Treasury. This effectively sets the maximumamount that may be paid on any single
Budget line. Effecting payments through Treasury after the appropriation process will be a three-part
process:
    i) Commitment. Inorder toinitiateapaymentunderaspecificcontract, thePIUwillcompletea
         Commitment Document (see Form No. 1 in Appendix D) and submit the same to Treasury2 for
        processing. Treasury will confirm that the requested commitment i s within the approved
         appropriation3 and will then enter the requested commitment onto a daily database o f requested
         commitments. Commitments for salaries are submitted quarterly (see FormNo. 3-1 inAppendix
        D).Eachevening, Treasury will submit aprintout ofthe daily database o frequestedcommitments
         to the MOF for approval. The MOF will confirm approval o f the requested commitments by
         signing the printout. Treasury will thereafter assign a unique sequential number to all MOF-
         approved commitments. The whole commitment process shouldnot take more than two working
         days.    The PIU will contact Treasury by telephone or in person to obtain the assigned
         commitment number. The PIU will note the assigned commitment number on its copy o f the
         Commitment Document.
    ii)VeriJication.        Upon satisfactory receipt o f the contracted goods, works or services and
         accompanying goods received note, Act o f Acceptance or similar, the PIU will complete one of
         two types o f expenditure verification4to confirm the legitimacy o f the prospective payment prior
         to actually effecting payment. The PIU will present the completed Verification Document (see
         Form No. 2 in Appendix D) to Treasury who in turn will record the verification in the Treasury
         system.      Verifications for salaries are submitted using a different form (see Form No. 3 in
         Appendix D).
    iii)Payment. The PIUwill presentTreasury with a PaymentOrder for payment ofarecorded
         verification. The format o f a Payment Order i s stipulated by the National Bank o f Georgia'. It i s
         usual for a Payment Order to be presented to Treasury together with the corresponding
         Verification Document. After processing a Payment Order, payment will be effected by the
         Treasury within one working day.

 19.     It has been agreed that when executing a Payment Order in respect o f Bank-financed projects
usingTreasury rather than commercial banks to house the projects' Special Accounts, Treasury will first
sell an appropriate amount o f foreign currency from the relevant Special Account (i.e. from the project's
sub-account in Treasury's Foreign-currency receipts account 362 at the NBG) and deposit the GEL
equivalent (equal to the amount specified in the Payment Order) to the Single Treasury Account6before
remitting the GEL to the specified payee. For foreign currency payments GEL equivalent will be
converted to the relevant foreign currency and paid (see below for details).




'Nocopies   o f the contracts or other source documents are requiredby the Treasury. However, the Commitment
Document needs to contain the reference to those supporting documents. Each contract requires a separate
Commitment Document should be prepared for each contract

Assessment o f Treasury to satisfy WB criteria for Special Accounts

20.     Interms o fTreasury's capacity toprovidethe four services requiredoffinancialinstitutions
holding Special Accounts as specified inthe World Bank's Disbursement Handbook':

   i)   Execute foreim exchange and local currency transactions. Criterion satisfied. Foreign exchange
        transactions are executed as follows: upon presentation o f a foreign currency payment order,
        Treasury instructs the NBG to calculate and withdraw the appropriate amount o f GEL from a
        Treasury Single Account and deposit the appropriate amount of foreign currency in the Foreign-
        currency payment account (663). The NBG then transfers the foreign currency from the Foreign-
        currency payment account (663) to the recipient specified inthe Payment Order. The withdrawal
        from the Treasury Single Account i s shown as an expense o f the specified Budget line. For local
        currency transactions, payments are made directly from the Treasury Single Account to the payee
        specified inthe relevant Payment Order.

    ii)Openlettersofcredit. Criterionsatisfied. LineministriesarealreadyabletoobtainLCsthrough
        Treasury as follows: the line ministrysends a formal request for a letter of credit to the Treasury;
        Treasury forwards the request to the NBG; the NBG opens the LC; the NBG informs Treasury;
        Treasury informs the line ministry. PKJswill be able to follow similar procedures.
    iii)Handlealargenumberoftransactionspromptly. Criterionsatisfied.
    iv) Issue prompt and detailed monthly bank statements. Criterion satisfied. Treasury reconciles the
        sub-accounts in the Foreign-currency receipts account (362) on a daily basis and can send regular
        or ad hoc transaction listings by e-mail to any account holder (PIUs) confirming both the
        transactions on as well as the balance inthe Special Account.

Other matters
Direct payments
21.     Direct payments may be made in the normal manner with payments flowing directly from the
WB directly to contractual parties' bank accounts.        However, the extent of these direct payment
transactions should be minimized to the maximum extent possible given that such transactions do not
flow through Treasury and therefore do not: (a) make full use o f country systems; and (b) permit Treasury
to have immediate or up-to-date information on the cash flows relating to government operations i.e.
Budget execution statements will be wrong and could be materially so. If direct payments are made,
Treasury will need to be informed on a timely basis o f these transactions in order that they may be
properly accounted for in the Budget execution reports. PIUs will be required to provide the MOF and
Treasury immediately o f such direct payment transactions after confirmation from the WB Client
Connection system. For control purposes, the PIUs will be obliged to reconcile Treasury's monthly
Budget execution statements to the WB' s disbursement records per the Client Connection system.
Budgeting
22.     Projects' budgets are in any event incorporated into the Georgian annual Budget.                The
implementing PIUs agree on the project's annual project budget with the relevant line ministries, and the
MOF in accordance with standard Georgian Budget formulation procedures. Each project's budget is
shown in the Budget under the relevant entity (line ministry) on a single line (i.e. a unique sub-
organizational code within the line ministry or LEPL) with the budget divided between two sources o f
funding(columns): one for government counterpart contributions and one for World Bank financing. The
project's components budgets are not analyzed in any detail but are rather shown on a single economic

classification, "subsidies"8. It should be noted that a project's components budgets are incorporated into
the Georgian Budget inthe manner described inthis paragraph irrespective o f where the project's Special
Account is held, at Treasury or in a commercial bank.
Transactioncharges
23.      The Treasury incurs no transactions charges from the NBG for acting as its fiscal agent.
Accordingly, WB-financed projects will incur no charges for using Treasury to hold the Special
Accounts.
Foreign exchangegains and losses
24.      N o foreign exchange gains and losses will be incurred in the execution o f foreign currency
payments through Treasury because: (i)       the sale o f foreign currency for GEL from the Special Account,
deposit o f the GEL inthe Treasury Single Account, and sale o f GEL for foreign currency will all happen
on the same day; (ii) the exchange rates used for the selling and purchasing o f foreign currency will be the
official exchange rates o f the NBG; and (iii)    the NBG's official purchase and sale exchange rates are the
same. Accordingly, there i s no financial gain or loss by having foreign currency payments flow through
the Treasury Single Account as opposed to having these payments made directly from the Special
Account. Of course there are more transactions and thus a greater risk o f processing error but these may
be mitigatedby reconciliationcontrols.
Unutilized commitments
25.      Ifa commitment is requestedduringany ofthe first three quarters ofthe year butis not used, the
undisbursedcommitted amount will be fully transferred to subsequent quarters on a cumulative basis. No
further approval o f the MOF i s required for expensing the accumulated commitments. Accordingly, PIUs
may make plans and submit budgets based on optimistic scenarios in order to comply with the contractual
requirements and would not be penalized by Treasury for doing so.
Advancepayments
26.      Inthe contracts with several payments, allpayments except those which are supported by Goods
Received Notes, Acts o f Acceptance or other documentation confirming receipt o f the goods, works or
services, should be considered as advance payments. A contract requiring several on-account or advance
payments will require several Advance Verification Documents indicating the different advances to be
paid. Once a Goods Received Note, Act o f Acceptance or other documentation confirming receipt o f the
goods, works or services have been received, a closing Verification Document inrespect o f the advance
payments already made should be submitted.
Advancesfor business trips
27.       Advance for business trips may be obtained by specifying as much on the Commitment
Document and Advance Verification Document.
Revision of appropriations
28.       Appropriations may be revisedby the Budget Departmento f the MOF.
 Government counterpart financing
 29.      Government counterpart financing i s executed in the same as described above directly from the
Treasury Single Account. No separate account will be maintained for government counterpart financing.




  IfLEPLPIUsare eventually liquidated andtheir project implementingfunctions transferred to integratedline
 ministryPIUs, projects' budgets will need to be further analyzed by standard Georgianeconomic classifications.

Internet banking
30.     For the time being there i s no legislation in Georgia that allows recognition o f electronic
signatures. Accordingly, electronic Internet banking through Treasury i s not permissible. The PIUs will
needto visit Treasury inperson inorder to submit documents and execute transactions.
Interest income
3 1.    Interest will not be accrued on balances heldinthe Special Account.
Biddingfees
32.     Bidding fees are currently collected off-Budget by line ministries requiring such fees and
thereafter either returned to the bidder or transferred to the Treasury Single Account. The PIUs will be
expected to follow similar procedures.
Petty cash
33.      Petty cash (i.e. cash incash boxes) may be held up to the monthly petty cash expenditure limitsas
specified inGeorgian legislation (currently GEL 1,000).
Payments of utilities
34,      Utilitypayments do not require contracts and will be made basedon the reference to the relevant
invoices.

                            Appendix8: Environmentaland SocialIssues
        GEORGIA: AVIAN INFLUENZA CONTROL AND HUMANPANDEMIC
                         PREPAREDNESSAND RESPONSEPROJECT


1.      The Georgia Avian Influenza (AI) Project has been assigned World Bank environmental category
B, since it involves moderate environmental impacts that can be managed during implementation of the
project. Although project activities supporting AI prevention, preparedness and planning, and response
and containment are not expected to generate significant adverse environmental effects, they do present a
moderate environmentalrisk from inadvertent spread o f the AI virus and waste management. Overall the
AI prevention and response-focused activities are expected to have a positive environmental impact, as
the investments in facilities, equipment, and training for veterinary and public health service staff and
laboratories will improve the effectiveness and safety over existing avian influenza handling and testing
procedures by meeting international standards established by the World Organization for Animal Health
(OIE) and the World Health Organization.            This will be reinforced by the mainstreaming of
environmental safeguards into protocols and procedures for the culling and disposal o f animals duringAI
outbreaks.

2.      This environmental management plan addresses the moderate adverse environmental effects o f
the Animal and Human Health Components. For the Animal component, the E M P addresses zoonotic
disease containment and waste management as pertain to disposal o f special waste, emissions and
materials at laboratories, and training for veterinary services workers, to include procedures for safe
handling o f AI materials, safe culling o f infected and at-risk poultry and disposal o f carcasses. For the
Human Health component, the EMP focuses on equipment, refurbishing and training for reference and
regional diagnostic laboratories to include key environmental issues in zoonotic disease containment and
waste management. The EMP provides mitigation plans and monitoring plans to ensure appropriate
attention to environmentalissues, and tracking progress or problems intheir management.

3.      The main areas o f environmental risk from project activities are the inadvertent spread o f the AI
virus during culling, transport and disposal o f carcasses, animal waste, litter, and used protective gear;
contamination o f surface and groundwater from use o f disinfectants; and laboratory bio-safety and waste
management. Inaddition, minor environmental disturbances may occur duringrenovation o f laboratories.
The project environmentalmitigation plan i s provided inAppendix 5 o f the EMP.

4.      Animal Health: Equipment, refurbishing and training for regional laboratories and border
inspection to include key environmental issues in zoonotic disease containment and waste management as
pertain to special waste, emissions and materials; training for veterinarv services and poultrv sector
workers to include procedures for safe handling o f AI materials; safe culling o f infected and at-risk
poultry and disposal o f carcasses. Formal compensation for culled animals should target ownersiprimary
beneficiaries (e.g., specifically including women where they are the primary backyard producers).

5.      Human Health: Equipment, upgrading, refurbishing and training for national reference and
regional diagnostic laboratories to include key environmental issues inzoonotic disease containment and
waste management

 6.     Strategic Communications: No environmental issues, but an important component for design
 and delivery o f communications tools for good hygiene, safe culling and disposal o f animal carcasses,
 animal waste management.

                              Appendix 9: EconomicandFinancialAnalysis
         GEORGIA: AVIAN INFLUENZA CONTROL AND HUMANPANDEMIC
                            PREPAREDNESSAND RESPONSEPROJECT


1.       The continuing outbreaks o f the H5N1 strain o f Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)
that began in late 2003 and early 2004 have been disastrous for the poultry industry in the world. By
early 2006, more than 200 million birds had died or have been destroyed, and losses to the poultry
industry world-wide are estimated to be in excess o f USSlO billion. Despite control measures, the
disease continues to spread, raising serious public health concerns at the global and national levels, and
it has the potential for massive impact on human and animal health as well as an extensive socio-
economic impact, especially on the poorest.

2.       Estimation o f the economic benefit, cost-effectiveness and distribution o f benefits from the
combined implementation o f the project's suggested measures is the objective o f this analysis. A
standard practice o f comparing the incremental stream o f net benefits `with project' to a `without
project' scenario i s employed. The analysis considers virus transmission among animals and among
humans both jointly and separately. At present, HPAI i s mainly an animal health problem, although
more than half o f the 206 human cases registered (globally) as o f May 2006 have been fatal. Since it is
widely believed that a global pandemic o f human influenza i s both overdue and likely, the analysis i s
extended to examine economic consequences o f human-to-human transmission.

3.       Inaddition to human and animal health concerns, a significant socio-economic damage could
be caused to the country by an AI epidemic. The Government should take preventive measures to
control and eradicate HPAI, so that possible losses inthe economy are minimized as much as possible.
Though it is difficult to estimate exactly the full extent o f the damage, the preliminary estimates can be
done by considering the estimated contribution o f the poultry sector to the country's GDP. According
to Georgia's national statistics, the estimated value-added by poultry sector in 2004 was around GEL$
80 million, or about 1.2 % o f the GDP (GEL 6,035 million real GDP in2004). The majority o fpoultry
production inGeorgia derives from smallholder production and represents, inparticular for the poorer
rural households, a significant income source and source o f protein. Poultry i s the most important and
accessible source o f meat and protein for poor rural households. Poultry products constituted 6% o f
the consumption basket in2005.

4.       Today in Georgia about 90% o f poultry are owned by households, and the poultry production
i s a significant part o f rural households' incomes. In addition, there are currently 13 large to medium
commercial poultry farms producing both eggs and meat. However, the intensive coverage o f the
outbreaks inTurkey and speculation about its spread to Georgia already led to a considerable decline
insales that affected bothhousehold and commercial farms. Another way to assess the cost of an AI
epidemic is to estimate the direct loss in poultry production and sales. At present, there are 10.6
million chickens reported in Georgia. If the whole poultry stock i s culled, with an average farm gate
price o f a chicken before AI being GEL 4, the gross value o f poultry lost during the crisis would come
to some GEL 40 million.

5.       The poultry processing enterprises already have faced a loss o f the market and have started
killing their birds. Three o f the 13 commercial producers have already culled their flocks and stopped
production inresponse to fears about the AI. Also importers o f poultry products reports as much as a
98% reductionintheir sales.




                                                     - 56 -

6.      Poultry imports valued around US$ 13.8 million in 2005 and comprised 18.6 thousand tons.
Domestic production i s estimated to be around 16.3 thousand tons. Also farmers in Georgia started
killingtheir birds. Taking no further actions wouldresult inthe loss of a large share of the indigenous
poultry stock inGeorgia (chicken stock currently comprises around 10.6 millionbirds). Giventhat the
majority of poultry i s raised in backyard farming operations and a large share of the poor depend on
poultry to bring in some cash income, effects of this overreactions already start to show in some
regions. A poor householdloses an estimated value ofUSD 100 through abandoning poultrymeat and
egg production (see table). This comprises to around 20% of the poverty line that applies to around
35% o f rural households. The loss of this food and income source can therefore be considered
substantial. The Government i s in the process of combining various benefit programs into a poverty
targeted programthat mightbringsome reliefto the hardest hit households.

7.      The poor would also suffer as a result of absence of poultry meat and eggs in the market
followed by an increase in price o f substitute products during this period. Although, there i s a high
probability that the red meat production would be advanced, and the prices for the substitute products
could return to the pre AI-level, the possibilities of shortages and further price jumps should not be
excluded. Poultry meat and eggs comprise a significant component of the aggregate food basket (6%
in food basket), the ability of the poorest share of population to diversify through other substitute
products i s extremelylimited.

8.      Inthe event of a larger outbreak, culling would comprise a significant expenditures to the
Government (estimated at GEL 3.5 million) to pay for temporary labor for culling and clean-up crews,
overtime police and other officials  inthe rural areas, and for transportation and purchase of imported
materials. In addition, the essential compensation scheme to h c k in in the event of an outbreak
comprises an additional cost to Government. These costs can be kept low through early detection and
immediate action of the relevant authorities to contain the outbreak to a limited area. Using this
approach and calculating all above mentioned losses, the total economic cost for outbreak has been
estimated at 1% of GDP.

Indirect Costs

9.      Incaseofanimal-to-humanandhuman-to-human transmissions, therewouldbeexpensestobe
undertaken by the health sector, such as cost o f hospitalization, etc. Cost o f injections to humans and
birds should be also taken into account. It i s assumed that health disabilities would lead to the loss of
labor force, and hence there would be loss to the overall economic activity.

 10.    The loss o f tax revenues through the almost complete standstill o f poultry products imported
into the country amounts to around US$ 5 million with a potential impact on financing of public
services,

Berzefts of the Project

11.      Inresponsetotheseconcerns, GeorgiahaspreparedaNationalActionPlan, tobesupportedby
the Project. The project i s targeted to support three major areas: (i) prevention, (ii)preparedness and
planning and (iii)  response and containment. The project will have a three-tiered approach and will
address three critical gaps, which are (i) health, (ii)human health, and (iii)strategic
                                                 animal
communications. Economic benefit and cost-effectiveness o f the project can be measuredby using a
"with project" and a "without project" approach. The incremental benefits and costs for each of
projections scenarios were evaluated for a period o f 15 years, with a discount rate 12 percent. The
calculation takes into account the losses in the poultry market, gains o f other meat sectors, loss o f
capital in the poultry sector.     With the with project scenario assuming a 20% reduction in the
likelihood o f a larger outbreak. The analysis considered all projects costs, but does not consider
monthly monitoring costs o f the state veterinary services. However, given that these costs are rather
low for Government, they are not assumed to have a significant impact on the project returns. The
following table summarizes base case assumptions on key parameters.               2004 GDP values and
statistical data were used. An exchange rate o f GEL 1.8/USD was used for currency conversion. The
period o f the analysis has been set for fifteen years. An annual discount rate o f 12%has been used for
the calculationo f the NPV. The assumed parameters are as follows:

 12.     Without Proiect Scenario.      In this scenario, the main costs to the economy of multiple,
 simultaneous outbreaks that cannot be contained properly due to insufficient public and private sector
 capacity i s defined as the net cost incurred as a result o f significant decrease in demand for poultry
products, including meat and eggs. The net cost represents cost to the poultry sector and the positive
 impact on alternative protein sources, notably the redmeat sub-sector.

 13.     It is assumed that inthe year inwhich the CE occurs, the impact on the poultry sector i s a 60%
 decrease in the value added o f production o f meat and eggs. This assumption is based on the immediate
 market reaction observed earlier this year when cases in Turkey increased and observations in other
 countries with regards to price and demand drops after outbreaks. Inthe subsequent three years, the value
 added inthe poultry sector i s assumed to regain 60% o f the pre-CE level.

  14.    A further, one-time cost to the poultry sector occurs inthe form o f abandoned capital production
 assets as a result o f the permanent decrease in demand and poultry stock that has to be culled inresponse
 to the outbreaks. This loss i s estimated at 40% o f the capital stock. The value o f the poultry sector
 capital stock itself i s assumed to be equal to three times the value o f annual production it the poultry
 sector. The assumption has been based on the strong reaction o f the poultry sector to the potential threat
 o f an outbreak.

15.      Gains to the red meat sub-sector that i s an alternative source o f protein to a limitednumber o f the
population and is therefore assumed to be 10% o f the value added in the year in which the CE occurs,
gradually decreasing to 5% over the following 3 years.

16.      The Government and the private sector would also incur incremental cost associated to the
administration o f monitoring and containing outbreaks. However, these costs are extremely difficult to
estimate and are hence not included in this analysis. As discussed above, there i s a significant loss o f
consumer surplus resulting from the perceived risk associated with poultry product consumption. These
losses are not captured in the GDP data uses since the latter focuses on production values. In addition,
shortage o f data makes it impossible to quantify this loss. However, as discussed above the impact on the
poorer segment o f the population can be assumed higher.

17.      The stream o f total annual costs due to a CE in a particular year thus obtained i s summarized in
the form on present value as o f the year o f the CE. This value i s then multiplied with the probability o f
the CE occurring in a particular year to arrive at the expected cost. In the without project scenario, the
probability o f the CE occurring i s assumed to be 10% in 2006, increasing annually at a rate o f 1.0% due
to increasing presence o f the virus in the environment. This process results in an increase o f expected
costs for the period 2006 - 2020, as presented inthe following Table.

 18.      With Project Scenario. It has been assumed that the impact o f the project will fully come into
 play in year four after project start. Therefore, the probability o f the full impact o f a catastrophic event
being felt i s assumed to be the same as under the without project scenario for the first three project years.
 From year 4, the likelihood o f a catastrophic outbreak i s assumed to reduce by 20%.           The stream o f
 expected costs in this scenario are calculated by multiplyingthese probabilities with respective NPVs o f
 costs and presented in the Table above. The total project costs are estimated at US$ 8 million disbursed
 over three years.

 Resultsof the Analysis

 19.      Based on the above assumptions, the analysis yields an NPV o f US$ 149 million and an internal
 rate o freturn o f 70.8 %.

Sensitivity Analysis

20.     A sensitivity analysis was carriedout to analyze the impact of varying assumptions on the results
of internal rate of return of the project. The analysis indicates that the model i s robust as substantial
changes inthe assumptions usedresult inthe IRRto decrease to 24%:

        10%(as opposed to the base case 40%) -resultinginan IRRof 60%;

        Holding all other values constant, assuming a value added loss inthe poultry sector to 40% inthe

        CE year and to 5% in the long term), the capital loss to lo%, while also reducing the gain inthe
        red meat and fisheries sectors (to 1%inthe first year and to 0% inthe long run) and reducing the
        probability of a CE in2006 to 0.5 %; resulting inan IRRof 19.1%.
