The closing date for the will be extended from\n            February 28, 2011 until June 30, 2011. The extension is\n            necessary to allow additional time for remaining project\n            activities to be completed. The project implementation has\n            been slow due to some implementation delays, in part caused\n            by recent staff turnover in the implementation units and\n            procurement delays. During the last mission, the team agreed\n            with the implementation units on a detailed action plan for\n            the project. The Government has revised the project action\n            plan to reflect an updated implementation schedule to\n            complete project activities by June 30, 2011. The project\n            team fully supports the request as the extension will\n            provide the time needed to fully achieve project objectives.\n            This will be the second extension of the project and will\n            bring the total extension period to 22 months."}, "docdt": "2011-02-14T00:00:00Z"}
