INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE SOMALI DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Somali Democratic Republic for the equivalent
of US$9.6 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a second highway
project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Economic Development Prospects in Somaliall
(AE-1D) was distributed to the Executive Directors on January 15, 1971.
A Country Data Sheet is attached at Annex II.
3.        Somalia is one of the poorest countries in Africa, with a
largely undeveloped economy based almost wholly on agriculture, princi-
pally the production of livestock. Most of the Somali people depend upon
livestock and subsistence crop production for their livelihood, and
incomes are very low. The potential for economic growth is limited by a
paucity of natural resources, by the limited technical and administrative
capacity of government and by a transport network which is inadequate for
the economy's needs. While there are few reliable indications, the economy
has probably grown at a modest pace over the last few years. From 1966 to
1970, for instance, the total value of exports increased at an average
annual rate of just over 4 percent.
4.        Both the former Italian Somaliland and British Somaliland, which
united to form Somalia, were heavily dependent on external aid to balance
their budgets and since independence Somalia has had to look to external
aid to finance part of its recurrent expenditures as well as the whole of
its capital requirements. From 1960 to 1969, external assistance for
current and capital expenditures amounted to almost $40O million, of which
about two-thirds consisted of grants and much of the remainder of loans on
concessionary terms. Italy was the largest aid donor ($112 million)
andthe main source of budget support, followed by the USA ($70 million),
the Soviet Union ($53 million), and the Federal Republic of Germany
($30 million). The main source of multilateral aid has been the European
Economic Community ($27 million) and the UNDP has had a sizeable program
of technical assistance.
5.        The present government, which took over in October 1969, is making
considerable efforts to face up to the double problems of eliminating the
dependence of the current budget on external aid and at the same time pro-
moting development. By the exercise of strict discipline in financial



-2-
management, it has made good progress with the former problem through
additional taxation and improved collection and the budget may well have
been close to balance in the fiscal year just ended.
6.        The Government's proposals for economic development are expressed
in a Development Plan, issued last July, covering the period 1971-73. This
was the first occasion on which the government had focussed serious atten-
tion on its investment priorities. The Plan envisaged a total investment
of some $150 million, of which about 35 percent has been allocated to trans-
port and communications, 22 percent to agriculture, including livestock
development, 12 percent to water resources, 9 percent to industry and the
remainder to other sectors. The substantial allocation to transport reflects
both the necessity to improve the transport system and the cost of doing so
in a large, sparsely populated country.
7,.       Investment on the scale envisaged would represent a large increase
over recent years and the extent to which the planned investments can be
carried out within the period envisaged depends partly on the absorptive.
capacity of the economy and partly on the external assistance which can be
obtained. The shortage of experienced persomnel in Somalia makes it diffi-
cult to accelerate the preparation and execution of development projects
and only in the transport sector is the plan based on substantial project
preparation. As to the availabilityof finance, the plan proposes that 20
percent of the necessary investment be provided from domestic sources.
Since the government has first to eliminate the budget deficit and has to
meet the additional recurrent costs connected with any increased investment
a contribution to development on this scale is a commendable if ambitious
target.
8.        In any event, it is clear that a substantial volume of external
assistance over a prolonged period will be necessary if any significant
development is to take place. Furthermore, although Somalia's present
external debt is not high - it amounted at the end of 1970 to about $105
million equivalent, with debt service equivalent to 6 percent of foreign
exchange earnings - the tight budgetary situation indicates that as much
aid as possible should be on concessionary terms. Moreover, in financing
any sizeable investment, external lenders will have to cover a high pro-
portion of the cost of the projects which they finance, and if high priority
projects are to be carried out, this usually implies a need to finance a
considerable proportion of the local expenditures.

PART II - IDA LENDING
9.        There have been no loans by the Bank or IFC operations.   Since
1965 there have been four IDA credits totalling US$12.35 million. A
summary statement of these credits as of November 30, 1971 is attached as
Annex I.
10.       The two credits for the First Highway Project, No. 74-so of
$6.2 million in 1965 and the supplementary credit, No. 123-SO of $2.3 mil-
lion in 1968, helped finance the detailed engineering and construction of
the 216 km Afgoi-Baidoa road, highway maintenance and workshop equipment,
a technical assistance program to staff the Highway Department, a transport
survey, feasibility and engineering studies. The project was financed
jointly with the European Development Fund (FED) and the UNDP which provided
$5.15 million and $3.02 million respectively. Construction of the road
started only in 1968, following delays in the final engineering and prepa-
ration of tenders, and the subsequent need to arrange additional financing
to cover construction cost increases caused in part by the Middle East war
and the closing of the Suez Canal. Once construction began, the work pro-
gressed according to schedule and was completed in March 1971. Problems
have arisen with road maintenance, stenning in large part from inadequate
provisions by the Government of funds for highway maintenance and the diver-
sion of equipment to uses outside the project, subjects that were thoroughly
discussed in the course of negotiations for the proposed Second Highway
Project (see paragraph 23 below).
11.       The 1969 port development credit (S5-so) financed consulting ser-
vices for detailed engineering studies of a new port of Mogadiscio and the
introduction of modern accounting services for the Somali Pbrts Authority
(SPA) in preparation for constructing a new port. Issues concerning the
management of the port authority, the implementation of the new accounting
system, together with the need to revise traffic forecasts in the light of
the continued closure of the Suez Canal, delayed appraisal of the con-
struction project until the end of 1971. The appraisal mission was joined
by a representative of the FED, which has confirmed its willingness in
principle to join with IDA in financing the project. Credit proposals
should be ready for consideration in the course of FY 1973.
12.       The 1971 education project (No. 247-St), which is designed to
improve the quality of education and achieve economies through consoli-
dating existing institutions, is in its initial stages. Legal problems
delayed effectiveness and there have subsequently been difficulties in com-
pleting project staffing. These are receiving close attention.
13.       Considerable efforts have been made by staff from headquarters
and the Permanent Mission in Eastern Africa to identify and help prepare
viable projects in agriculture and livestock, which are the productive
sectors of undoubted priority, but the lack of basic data, and of experience
and research findings applicable to Somali conditions have made for slow
progress. Nevertheless it is hoped that proposals for a livestock project
can also be brought before the Executive Directors in FY 1973.



-14-
14.       The proposed Second Highway Project would be the third Bank
Group operation with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the first being
the parallel financing with IDA of the Tedzani power project in Malawi in
1970 (Credit No. 178) and the second the financing-with IFC and other in-
vestors, of the Panafrican Paper Mills project in Kenya, also in 1970.
On this occasion, as described in Parts III and IV below, IDA and the
AfDB would enter into a joint financing arrangement. The project was
appraised by a mission to Somalia in December 1970 which was joined by a
representative of the AfDB. Negotiations took place in Washington in
July 1971. The Somali delegation was led by Mr. Ibrahim Megag Samater,
the then Secretary for Finance. The AfDB was represented by a delegation
led by Mr. M. Dugan, Deputy Director Operations. The unusually long inter-
val between the conclusion of negotiations and the presentation of the
proposed credit to Executive Directors was to allow for bids to be obtained
for the road construction contract, in order to provide a firm basis for
the cost estimates and avoid the problem of cost overruns encountered with
the First Highway Project.
PART III - THE PROJECT
15.       Somalia's transport system (see map attached) is in the early
stage of development, and many areas are inaccessible tS motor vehicles
for much of the year. In a country of about 640,000 km   there are only
about 900 km of asphalt paved roads, of which 300 km are in need of in-
tensive repair and maintenance, 1,000 km of gravel roads, and about 15,000
km of earth trails and tracks. There are no railways. Somalia is begin-
ning to develop internal air transport services to connect its scattered
urban areas with Mogadiscio, the country's only jet airport. Four ports
handle practically all of Somalia's ocean transport: Berbera in the north,
Mogadiscio and Merca in the center and Kisimaio in the south. Of these
only Berbera and Kisimaio are modern, deep water ports. In Mogadiscio and
Merca ships anchor in the open sea and all loading and unloading is done
by lighterage. The density of cargo and passenger flows in all modes is
light.
16.       An analysis of transport investment needs by consultants under
the First Highway Project confirmed the priority of concentrating attention
on raising the standard of the existing road system to provide adequate
communications within the generally widely separated economic and popu-
lation centers of Somalia. This study formed the basis for the Government's
request for Bank Group assistance in financing a Second Highway Project
designed to meet the principal needs of the Northwest Region. The detailed
engineering of the road was prepared by consultants financed by UNDP and
the African Development Bank (AfDB), with the Bank as executing agency.
17.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Highway Project, Somalia"
(PTR-81a) is being distributed separately. A Credit and Project Summary
is at Annex III. The project consists of:



(a)    the construction of a two-lane paved highway
from Hargeisa, the main city in the north, to
the new deep water port at Berbera on the Gulf
of Aden (about 158 km);
(b)    consulting services for (i) assistance in the
prequalification of contractors, evaluation of
contract bids and the award of contracts for the
highway; (ii) supervision of construction of
the highway; (iii) preparation of a feasibility
study of a road between Hargeisa and Borama (140
km) with a spur to Tug Wajale (20 km) on the
Ethiopian border and subsequent detailed engineering
should the road prove to be technically feasible
and economically justified; and (iv) technical
assistance in transport planning.
The Project would be implemented over a three-year period under the overal1
supervision of the Ministry of Public Works through its Civil Engineering
Department (CED).
18.       Although the Hargeisa-Berbera route is the main transport axis
of the northern region of Somalia, and one of the most important road links
in the entire country, it is at present basically a desert track, rough and
dusty, with poor alignment and drainage. The predominant economic activity
in the region served by the road is raising livestock, Somalia's main ex-
port. Of total animal exports in 1968, valued at $18 million, 66 percent
moved along the route of the proposed project road and through the port of
Berbera. The Hargeisa-Borama road and spur to Tug Wajale, the subject of
the feasibility study, would serve the most fertile areas in the northern
region and complete the route from the coast to the Ethiopian border   It
could in time become the main import and export route of a 5,000 km2 area
in the Ogaden Province in Ethiopia where a number of agricultural and animal
raising programs are being planned.
19.       The project is estimated to cost $10.6 million equivalent, net of
taxes, with a foreign exchange component of $7.7 million, about 70 percent.
This estimate is based on the lowest bid received under international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank/IDA Guidelines and takes
account of the recent exchange rate adjustments. The construction contract
would not be awarded until the proposed credit, if approved, is signed, but
retroactive financing under the credit is required for about $20,000 to
cover the cost of consultant work since May 1, 1971 on the preparation of
tender documents and evaluation of bids. The cost estimates for the various
consulting services required are based on actual proposals or the costs of
similar work carried out under the First Highway Project.
20.       The most likely estimate of the internal economic return for the
project is 19 percent. The benefits would be derived from road user savings
and from reductions in loss of weight and death of livestock during trans-
port to Berbera. Improved quality of cattle delivered to ships is moreover
of great importance if Somalia is to retain and extend the markets for her
livestock.



- 6 -
21.       The project would be financed by the proposed IDA credit of
$9.6 million, covering $7.0 million of foreign exchange expenditures and
$2.6 million of local expenditures, and an AfDB loan of $1.0 million,
covering $0.7 million in foreign exchange expenditures and $0.3 million
of local expenditures. The IDA credit and AfDB loan would be disbursed
approximately in the proportion of 9:1 against expenditures under the
single construction contract and the consultant services for pre-contract
work, construction supervision, studies and assistance in transport plan-
ning. The National Bank of Somalia would establish and operate a project
revolving fund for contract payments under similar arrangements that have
worked satisfactorily under the First Highway Project.
22.       AfDB's participation in this project could only be through a
conventional loan carrying 7 percent interest (including one percent
commission) and repayable over 20 years after 5 years of grace. Since
Somalia is not in a position to service more than a very limited amount
of such finance, it is appropriate that AfDB's participation be small.
The justification of IDA's financing 90 percent of total project cost and
the need for the whole of the project to be financed from external sources
is discussed in paragraph 8.
23.       Reference has already been made to problems arising under the
First Highway Project from inadequate allocations of funds for road
maintenance.  The Government has given undertakings that So. Sh. 6.4
million ($0.9 million) would be allocated to road maintenance in 1972,
this amount to be increased progressively each year to So. Sh. 7.4 million
($1.1 million) by 1975. These amounts would represent a substantial in-
crease over current levels.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
24.       The draft Joint Financing Agreement between the Somali Demo-
cratic Republic, the African Development Bank and the Association; the
draft Development Credit Agreement between the Somali Democratic Republic
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement; and the text of a
resolution approving the proposed Credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. In addition, a draft Administrative Letter
from the Association to the African Development Bank is being distributed.
25.       The format of the Agreements is arranged so that all covenants
which are of common interest to the Association and the African Development
Bank are contained in the Joint Financing Agreement. The Development Credit
Agreement and the African Development Bank's Loan Agreement contain only
the financial terms and those covenants that are of interest to only one of
the lenders, while incorporating by reference the covenants contained in
the Joint Financing Agreement. In all other respects the contents of the
various Agreements conform substantially to the pattern of Agreemonts ined
for highway projects, taking aocount of the existence of the joint financing
by the Association and the African Development Bank.



-7 -
26.       The fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the first dis-
bursement under the African Development Bank's Loan Agreement, the due
authorization and ratification of the execution and delivery of the Joint
Financing Agreement and fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the
effectiveness of that agreement or the right to make withdrawals there-
under, the enactment of legislation to assure the allocation for highway
maintenance of So. Sh. 6.4 million for FY 1972 and the establishment of a
project revolving fund would be conditions of effectiveness in the Devel-
opment Credit Agreement.
27.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMNENDATION
28.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.
