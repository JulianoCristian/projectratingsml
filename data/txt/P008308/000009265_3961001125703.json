reform program, which aims to reduce the\n            macroeconomic imbalances as well as lay the foundations for\n            sustained growth and the restoration of creditworthiness.\n            The two main policy anchors of this program are a tight\n            income policy and restrictive monetary policy, supported by\n            sharply higher interest rates. Measures are to be\n            complemented by structural adjustment reforms in the\n            following areas: (i) increased competition and the\n            establishment of market-based relative prices through trade\n            policy reform, demonopolization and the liberalization of\n            prices; (ii) private sector development, through reform of\n            the regulatory / incentive framework, creation of a modern\n            banking system reform and the privatization of state owned\n            assets; (iii) state enterprise (SE) restructuring and energy\n            pricing which includes clarification of ownership rights and\n            improvement in SEs management, as well as price reform and\n            institutional strengthening in the energy sector; and, (iv)\n            the establishment of an adequate social safety net to\n            prevent income falling below subsistence and increase labor mobility."}, "docdt": "1991-07-09T00:00:00Z"}
