MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
FOR A SECOND HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT SECTOR INVESTMENT PROJECT
1.       I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for the equivalent of US$60.0 million to help finance a project
for human resources development. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with
a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years of grace.
2.       Background. In the absence of natural resources, Jordan has traditionally emphasized the
development of human capital as an important element of its development strategy and as an instrument
for social and economic advancement of its people. Such a policy has been translated into systematic
efforts to expand and develop the education sector. The resulting educational system is well-developed
and has contributed to improving the standard of living in the country. Jordan's rates of participation
in education are among the highest in middle-income countries. Most recent estimates (1989-92) of gross
enrollment ratio is 99 percent for primary grades 1 to 6 and 73 percent for grades 7 to 101. Overall
illiteracy in 1993 was 16 percent of the population over 15 while the corresponding figure for females
was 23 percent2. Equality of opportunity for girls is well established at all stages including higher
education.
3.       The Education Reform Program. In spite of impressive quantitative indicators, educational
gualiy is perceived by policymakers to be an issue in terms of Jordan's human capital and labor market
needs. To improve the quality of education, the Government initiated a major and comprehensive review
of the pre-university educational system which formed the basis for a phased, ten year education reform
program. A major objective of the reform is to train students to think flexibly and critically, to be open
to and capable of processing new concepts and ideas, and to apply in productive ways what has been
absorbed and processed. The underlying goal is to build a skilled workforce and a human resources base
that would enhance the country's competitive capacity. The overall educational reform strategy [endorsed
by the Bank and supported by the first Human Resources Development Sector Investment Loan (HRDSIL
I, Loan 3106-JO) which became effective on May 5, 1990] includes a comprehensive reshaping of basic
and secondary education policies and curricula, together with sector-wide institutional development
initiatives. The reform has been the organizing framework for activities and interventions in the sector
which aim at improving educational quality through: (i) upgrading qualifications of teachers; (ii)
upgrading curricula and textbooks; (iii) upgrading evaluation and student assessment; (iv) improving the
educational enviromnent through the introduction of new technologies and equipment; (v) improving
school administration through staff training and decentralization; and (vi) expanding the school
construction program to reduce the use of unsuitable rented school facilities and double-shifting, and to
accommodate the natural growth in the student population.
4.       Implementation of the Reform Program. HRDSIL I was developed to support the reform
program with a total cost of US$250 million. About US$146 million of that project was financed from
the Bank and OECF loans, about US$4 million in grants, and the remainder financed by the
Government3. Considerable achievements to improve educational quality are expected by the completion
of HRDSIL I (June 1995) especially in: (i) developing new curricula for basic and secondary cycles and
textbooks and teachers' guides for the basic cycles; (ii) instituting a new university-based B.A. program

US$60 million.

for pre-service training of basic education teachers and a certification program to upgrade teachers; (iii)
constructing and equipping new schools to reduce unsuitable rented facilities and double shifts, and
providing libraries, laboratories and workshops in 175 existing schools; and (iv) establishing the National
Center for Educational Research and Development (NCERD) to undertake policy oriented research and
to monitor the impact of the reform program.
5.       PROJECT OBJECTIVES. The principal objective of the proposed project is to further the
improvement of educational quality, building on the accomplishments of HRDSIL I. The focus will be
on introducing measures to enhance the teaching-learning environment including teaching competencies,
curricula and textbooks, administration and management, and creating a strong institutional framework
particularly in relation to examinations and national assessment. In addition, measures would be included
to economize in the use of public resources. The scope is largely defined by the education reform
program and the components are designed to support the realization of its overall goals for the 1995-2000
period.
6.       PROJECT DESCRIPTION. The project would support the following major components4:
(a) Deepening the Qualitative Impact of the Reform (US$36.9 million base costs5). This component
includes: (i) promoting staff development, including training for teachers, trainers, educational
administrators/counselors, principals, assistant principals, and vocational technical coordinators; (ii)
revising assessment tools and techniques in line with the new curricula and introducing items to test
higher cognitive skills; (iii) encouraging and supporting school-based innovations and quality improvement
initiatives on a pilot basis; and (iv) strengthening Technical and Vocational Education and Training
(TVET) through support for an investment program to put into effect actions and means to address the
policy recommendations and the agreed strategy.
(b) Institutional Development (US$11.5 million). This includes: (i) upgrading the staff, equipment, and
facilities of existing Learning Resource Centers (LRCs); (ii) further upgrading the staff and equipment
of MOE's textbook publication unit (printing is contracted to private presses), and computerizing the
textbook distribution system; (iii) strengthening the administrative and feedback systems of MOE
examinations; (iv) further developing the education management information system (EMIS); and (v)
establishing a national assessment program.
(c) Improving the Facilities for Teaching and Learning (US$106.2 million). This component includes
support for a civil works and equipment program which would provide about 95,000 student places
through: (i) expansion of existing school facilities to maximize their potential absorptive capacity (about
30,000 student places), and (ii) construction of new schools to replace rented facilities (about 23,000
student places), reduce double shifting (about 5,000 student places), and accommodate the natural increase
in the student population in state-owned schools (about 37,000 student places). In addition, the project
would support school rehabilitation to improve the condition of dilapidated schools.
7.       PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. The Intermediary. The Intermediary was formed under
HRDSIL I to serve as the central entity to ensure coordinated implementation of the various sub-projects
that comprise the project as a whole. The Intermediary consists of a Policy Council and a Technical
Unit. Since 1990, on the basis of a decree by the Higher Council for Science and Technology (HCST),
NCERD (through its professional staff) has assumed all the functions of the Intermediary Technical Unit.
4     The project cost, financing, and procurement arrangements, as well as the estimated disbursement
schedule, are described in the attached Schedules A and B.
5     Unless otherwise indicated, cost estimates do not include contingencies.



- 3 -
The Policy Council consists of senior staff from all entities participating in the educational reform
program, and a representative from the Ministry of Planning. Under HRDSIL II, the responsibilities of
the Intermediary Policy Council would be to: (i) approve sub-projects appraised and submitted by
NCERD's professional staff; (ii) make policy decisions about implementation within parameters agreed
upon with the Bank; (iii) formulate and recommend sector policies on the basis of data and experience
garnered through the implementation of the reform program; (iv) review the quarterly reports on program
implementation submitted by NCERD's professional staff; and (v) carry out annual reviews and a mid-
term review of program implementation in collaboration with the Bank. The Technical Unit (as part of
the NCERD) would be responsible for: (i) appraising sub-project proposals submitted by the beneficiaries;
(ii) preparing appraisal reports and recommendations on approval for review by the Intermediary Policy
Council; (iii) monitoring the implementation of sub-projects and the project in general, including
procurement for all sub-projects; (iv) monitoring implementation and preparing implementation reports
for review by the Bank and the Policy Council according to an agreed timetable; (v) maintaining project
accounts and arranging for annual audits; (vi) contracting technical assistance for implementation; and
(vii) acting as the Secretariat to the Intermediary Policy Council.
8.       Preparation. Appraisal. and Approval of Sub-projects. Action plans6 provide the basis for the
delineation and preparation of sub-project proposals, prepared by the beneficiries, for those activities
to be implemented during specific years/periods.  Responsibility for sub-project identification,
preparation, and implementation lies with the beneficiaries - the relevant general directorates of MOE,
VTC, MOHE, and NCERD. Sub-project applications endorsed by the beneficiary institution would be
submitted to the NCERD for appraisal and to the Intermediary Policy Council for approval. Six initial
TVET sub-projects would be submitted to the Bank for approval, in addition to other sub-projects selected
by the Bank. NCERD and the Intermediary Policy Council would appraise and approve sub-project
requests on the basis of agreed general criteria for sub-project preparation, appraisal and approval which
are provided in Annex 4 of the SAR; sub-project evaluators would use specific action plan appraisal
criteria included in the project implementation volume. Annex 3B of the SAR includes the specific
criteria to be applied for the appraisal of sub-projects related to TVET.
9.       Sub-Proiect Implementation. The beneficiaries would be responsible for implementing their
respective sub-projects. Sub-projects related to civil works (all contracted to private firms) and school
maintenance would be the responsibility of the MOE's General Directorate for Projects and School
Buildings (GDPSB). The General Directorate for Curriculum and Educational Technology (GDCET)
would be responsible for implementing the sub-projects related to educational technology, the Learning
Resource Centers, textbook publishing and distribution. The General Directorate for Evaluation and
Examinations (GDEE) would be responsible for implementing the sub-projects related to the development
of examinations, and NCERD would be responsible for implementing sub-projects related to development
of the EMIS and sample-based national assessment. MOE's Education Training Center would implement
the staff development sub-projects. Beneficiaries responsible for implementing the TVET component
would be the three providers - the MOE, VTC and MOHE. The concerned General Directorates of the
MOE and NCERD have proven their competence in the implementation of sub-projects under HRDSIL
I. The implementation performance of each beneficiary would be reviewed by the supervision missions
and during the Mid-Term Review.
10.      PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY. MOE's general directorates, particularly those dealing with
curricula, examinations, school buildings and teacher training, are supported in ways that would keep
them functioning properly after completion of the project. In addition, NCERD which is developing as
an effective and quality institution would be strengthened by bolstering its leadership role in the
development of the EMIS, national assessment, and monitoring the reform program. The project will

Appraisal Report (SAR), and detailed in the Impletnentation Volume.

also support measures to rationalize expenditures in civil works. Other measures directed towards cost
efficiency include: replacing rented buildings and reducing fragmentation, thus increasing the number of
students per teacher ratio; adopting a system for textbook loans in grades 5-10 instead of free provision;
and enacting regulations for the future increase of students' contributions. The recurrent cost associated
with the project, including maintenance for equipment and facilities, and new staff, is expected to average
about US$0.7 million annually. As this is about 0.5 percent of MOE's annual recurrent budget, it will
have minimal financial impact, and should be sustainable.
11.      LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS BANK INVOLVEMENT. The following
lessons have emerged from previous experience: (i) project design must be flexible enough to allow for
modifications (based on evaluation and reviews) especially because the implications for the education
sector of the regional peace process cannot be foreseen in detail; (ii) implementation schedules should be
realistic considering the prevailing capabilities and common constraints; (iii) periodic in-depth supervision
and evaluation, involving relevant expertise, should be conducted; (iv) the Government's share in project
costs must be budgeted early enough for timely implementation; and (v) appropriate coordination at all
levels within the MOE and between MOE and other relevant institutions should take place. NCERD has
contributed in a qualitative manner to sector planning and decision making. It needs to be rooted as a
permanent quality institution and to deepen its ties with MOE.
12.      RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT.   While the Government is strongly
committed to the education reform program, it will need substantial outside support to implement the
various components. Bank support for the project is justified for the following reasons: (i) the Bank was
closely involved with the Govermnent in preparing the reform program and financed the first project to
support it; (ii) the reform program is a long-term initiative which covers a wide range of issues and
activities, and no other donor has the depth of experience and resources necessary to support it; and (iii)
the project would constitute a key element in the Government's strategy for human resources
development, which is also concerned with quality issues and linkages to the local and regional labor
market. The project is fully consistent with the Country Policies and Bank Group Assistance Strategy
(discussed by the Board on 3/11/1993) which calls for improving education and maintaining its provision
to protect the environment, reduce population growth and poverty.
13.      AGREED ACTIONS. During negotiations, the Government agreed: (i) to provide to the
Bank for review and comment, a prototype school design that is more economical than the one used in
HRDSIL I, with supporting evidence and clarifications; and (ii) to maintain during the implementation
period the Intermediary Policy Council and Technical Unit (as specified in HRDSIL I) or equivalent from
NCERD's technical staff and other needed support with organization, staffing and terms of reference
satisfactory to the Bank.
14.      POVERTY CATEGORY. Not applicable. Although poverty alleviation is not an explicit
objective of the project, the educational quality improvements resulting from the project are expected to
have a favorable impact on the poverty profile in Jordan.
15.      ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS. The project is classified under the Environmental Category
C: "No appreciable environmental impact."
16.      PROGRAM OBJECTIVE CATEGORIES. With respect to gender issues, rates of female
enrollments and their representation in the teaching force are appropriate and pose no problems. The
private sector will have a role in developing TVET policies and in guiding related activities. There are
also plans in the project to facilitate the role of private community colleges in providing TVET.
17.      PARTICIPATORY APPROACH. To ensure ownership of the project by the borrower and



implementing agencies, a participatory approach was pursued and the project has been developed in close
collaboration between the Bank and the Government. MOE units were involved in an exercise to evaluate
accomplishments, constraints, and future needs in relation to the education reform program. These were
reviewed in a two day seminar in April 1994 and formed the basis for detailed action plans for each
component which were revised during the pre-appraisal mission. In addition, several studies dealing with
relevant issues were undertaken with local resources. Sub-projects, drawn from the action plans, for
those activities to be completed during the first year/phase of project implementation were reviewed with
the appraisal mission.
18.      BENEFITS. The proposed project would make significant and sustainable contributions to
improved instructional quality, managerial efficiency in the sector and human resources development in
Jordan. It is estimated that the learning environment of 95,000 students would be improved as a direct
result of the school facility improvement program. Further, a large number of teachers and school
administrators would benefit through their participation in the training programs. Consolidation of
schools and improved allocation and distribution of educational materials would impact favorably
educationally disadvantaged areas which tend to be poor. Coordination among the providers of TVET
and its linkages to the realities of the labor market and the private sector would be emphasized in order
to increase relevance and reduce wastage. Monitorable targets to evaluate progress, further development
of EMIS, and national assessment would be important contributions of the proposed project to sub-sector
institutional development, and would improve capabilities in data collection and monitoring of educational
quality. A strong institutional framework would be an important legacy of the project since it would (i)
ensure sustainability of the program's accomplishments, and (ii) consolidate the experience gained in
managing the reform process.
19.      RISKS. Given the Government's strong commitment to the reform program, the risks are
relatively low. In addition, it is reasonable to expect that the satisfactory implementation performance
of HRDSIL I will continue and improve. In this regard, however, it is important that Government's
share of project funding is budgeted in a timely fashion. Requests for cofmancing have been initiated
and, in principle, it remains a risk until final commitments are made.  The project would be
reprogrammed if cofinancing problems are faced. UNRWA currently funds and operates schools for
Palestinian refugees enrolling about 16 percent of total students in basic education. The effects of the
peace process are unknown at this point: if UNRWA pulls out, this could cause disruptions which would
affect the time frame and possibly the financial requirements of the education system. On the other hand,
potential reduction in defense spending will avail funds for other sectors including education. In general,
it is expected that any risks associated with the project will be mitigated by the participatory nature of
project design, the role of the Intermediary in on-going appraisal of sub-projects, and a mid-term review
which will correct course as necessary.
20.      RECOMMENDATION. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
