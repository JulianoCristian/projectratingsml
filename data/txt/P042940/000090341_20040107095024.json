The\n            lessons learned indicate that it is important to understand\n            the degree of political commitment a borrower has to a\n            project and how economic and political changes might affect\n            that commitment. It is also important to assess whether this\n            commitment will be sustained in a changing economic\n            environment. In Algeria there had been a long history of\n            top-down provision of housing by the Government. A flexible\n            project design would have been useful to facilitate\n            adjustments in the project if policy changes. Local teams\n            learned important lessons from the first group of\n            subprojects, but there was no mechanism for the lessons to\n            be used to improve subsequent subprojects. A phased approach\n            allowing more flexibility to improve the design would have\n            been useful. In designing a project with a phased approach,\n            a well-defined monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanism\n            would be important so that the Bank and the Borrower can\n            monitor performance and make necessary changes. Visible\n            commitments from beneficiaries are needed. The project did\n            not include concrete measures to confirm serious commitment\n            of beneficiaries who are willing to participate in the\n            project. During social surveys, beneficiaries who wanted\n            participate in the project always responded positively to\n            the questions on their willingness and readiness to make\n            required financial contribution regardless of their\n            financial capacity. Institutional arrangements for the\n            provision of land tenure are critical. The cost recovery and\n            land tenure regulation planned for the project were delayed\n            because land auction data was not available and title\n            registration was complex. Capacity building at the local\n            level needs to go in parallel with slum up-grading schemes.\n            The project introduced new design and implementation\n            methodologies to local teams, particularly concerning the\n            importance of socio-economic aspects and multi-sectoral\n            coordination. However, this important learning was not\n            reinforced due to the cancellation of technical assistance\n            component. The project could not finance these activities\n            due to the lack of Government counterpart financing."}, "docdt": "2003-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
