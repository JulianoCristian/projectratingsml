beneficiaries; c) increase the efficiency of technical\n            design of low-income housing; d) assist the institutions at\n            the central and local level in delivering their\n            responsibilities within the project; e) improve\n            environmental and social policy; and f) strengthen the\n            institutional capacity for tenure regularization. There are\n            two project components. First, the site development for\n            low-income families component will finance the civil works\n            necessary to carry out subprojects to rehabilitate existing\n            sites and develop new sites through the provision of water,\n            sewerage, roads, power, and constructing core housing units.\n            The second component will strengthen i) the MoH (Ministry of\n            Housing) capacity at the local level mainly through training\n            programs dealing with environment, subproject preparation\n            and management studies; and b) the National Housing Agency\n            (CNL) with a comprehensive human resource program."}, "docdt": "1998-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
