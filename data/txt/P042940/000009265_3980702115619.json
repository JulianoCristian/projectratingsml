Adverse effects are:\n            temporary resettlement (settlement servicing); permanent\n            resettlement (rehousing in subsidized units); or\n            displacement of residents either within or outside the slum\n            area concerned (slum redevelopment). The northern part of\n            Algeria, hence all sub-projects, are susceptible to seismic\n            risks. The consequences of potential risks are mitigated by\n            enforcement of anti-seismic standards applicable to formal\n            construction projects. The anti-seismic building codes have\n            not been enforced in existing slums. Currently, and prior to\n            implementation of the project, the risk of flooding due to\n            the small text of the wadi bed. This risk will be eliminated\n            through the widening of the wadi in the context of the\n            project. The Merzoug Amar site, located near Fezzara Lake,\n            does not appear to be vulnerable due to its position and the\n            control of the lake level by a drainage canal.
