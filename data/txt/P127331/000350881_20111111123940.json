to assist the government\n            in strengthening fiscal management and institutional\n            mechanisms and programs responsible for an integrated\n            violence prevention strategy. The DPC operation supports\n            progress towards the Country Partnership Strategy objectives\n            of expanding opportunities and reducing vulnerabilities and\n            of improving citizen security. Specifically, the operation\n            supports four areas that are central to the reform program:\n            (1) tax administration, focused on improving taxpayer\n            compliance; (2) civil service reform, focused on the\n            rationalization of the public wage bill by delinking\n            teachers\u0092 salary adjustments from those reflected in the\n            private sector's minimum wage; (3) pension reform,\n            designed to lessen contingent fiscal vulnerabilities by\n            reducing the public pension institutions' actuarial\n            deficits, and (4) citizen security reform, focused on\n            strengthening institutional coordination mechanisms and\n            programs needed for an integrated violence prevention\n            strategy . The reforms supported by this operation are\n            expected to have a positive impact on poverty and inequality."}, "docdt": "2011-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
