{"cdata!": "Ratings for the First Programmatic\n            Reducing Vulnerabilities for Growth Development Policy\n            Credit Project for Honduras were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: sustaining the dialogue on\n            macroeconomic performance is critical for a satisfactory\n            outcome of a development policy credit. Much more care can\n            be exercised in establishing the outcome indicators in order\n            to better capture the relevant macroeconomic risks in a\n            high-uncertainty environment such as in Honduras. Linking\n            the program with analytical work is the key to providing the\n            basis for a satisfactory outcome. The design of the\n            operation was backed by solid analytical work which enabled\n            the bank team to respond to the government requests in a\n            short period of time under a difficult social and political\n            environment. All the Economic and Sector Work (ESW) allowed\n            the government and the team to identify priority policy\n            areas, build consensus around critical issues."}, "docdt": "2013-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
