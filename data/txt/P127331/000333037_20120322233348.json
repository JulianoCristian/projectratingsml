Republic of Honduras. The operation\n            supports the Government's program to tackle its\n            difficult fiscal situation in the short run, and to launch a\n            number of structural reforms that will pay off in the medium\n            to long run. Specifically, the operation supports four areas\n            that are central to the reform program: (i) tax reform,\n            including closing tax loopholes, widening some tax bases,\n            and improving tax administration; (ii) civil service reform,\n            focused on human resource management in the education sector\n            and a rationalization of the public wage bill; (iii) reform\n            of power sector tariffs to support the financial\n            sustainability of the state-owned electricity company; and\n            (iv) strengthening public financial management and\n            transparency by resolving outstanding public sector arrears\n            and investigating the shortcomings of the financial\n            management information system. The operation is prepared in\n            the context of an Interim Strategy Note, presented jointly\n            with this operation to the Board of Executive Directors."}, "docdt": "2011-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
