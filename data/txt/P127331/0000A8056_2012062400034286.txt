                         The Government of Honduras has made significant progress in achieving the objectives of its reform program, supported under the First Programmatic Reducing Vulnerabilities for
                         Growth DPC (DPC1). The INPREMA law, submitted to Congress as part of the DPC1 prior actions, was approved by the legislature in December 2011. The Government also
                         submitted to Congress a transfer pricing law, which was also approved in December. The Government is currently working on designing regulations for these laws with technical
                         assistance from the World Bank (some regulations, such as loan and investment provisions of INPREMA, have already been approved).
                         The Government has also made substantial progress towards the DPC1 outcome indicators, three of which have been achieved already. According to the INPREMA law, all
                         PROHECO teachers are legitimate affiliates to INPREMA and all PROHECO employer and employee contributions for January - April 2012 were deposited with INPREMA. The
                         central government wage bill -- one of the key indicators of program performance -- has come down to below 10 percent of GDP from a baseline of 11 percent in 2010. Furthermore,
                         all 604 large taxpayers are now filing electronically, which substantially exceeds the program target of 370 electronic filers. Information is not yet available on the average perception
                         of insecurity, but the Government has also made progress in this area by submitting to Congress a revised version of Arbitration and Conciliation Law to expand the authority of
                         municipal governments regarding alternative conflict resolution mechanisms.
                         On the other hand, the implementation of the INJUPEMP reform has been delayed (due in a large part to the challenges the Government has been facing in socializing and

                         demonstrated its commitment to resolving the outstanding debt to INPREMA and the Bank is providing technical assistance in this area.
