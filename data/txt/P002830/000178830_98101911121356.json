     Project for Togo consists: (a) improving and diversifying\n            the production of the principal upland crops on some 18,500\n            ha and developing: (i) about 3,000 ha of low land for\n            rainfed rice cultivation and providing credit for the\n            purchase of 110 power tillers and 75 small rice mills; (ii)\n            25 ha of vegetable production; and (iii) 600 ha of\n            smallholder coconut; (b) infrastructure development through\n            the construction of about 300 km of secondary and feeder\n            roads; 20 tube wells and 2 earth dams; 15 dispensaries; 150\n            village stores; and 20 village markets; and (c) studies to\n            prepare: (i) a gravity irrigation scheme for 1,000 ha for\n            rice cultivation and to make investment proposals for areas\n            to be freed of onchocerciasis; and (ii) field trials to test\n            techniques to restore the productivity of depleted soils and\n            test the resistance of coconut hybrids to Kaincope disease."}, "docdt": "1976-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
