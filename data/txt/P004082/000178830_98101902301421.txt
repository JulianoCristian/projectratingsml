THE SIXTH RAILWAY PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:               The Republic of Korea
Beneficiary:            The Korean National Railroad (KNR)
Amount:                 $12CI million equivalent
Terms:                  The loan would be for a term of 17 years, including
four years of grace, with interest at 7.45% per annum.
Project Description:   The project, which forms part of KNR's Investment
Plani 1977-1981, aims at: (i) providing KNR with the
capacity required to meet forecast traffic; and
(ii) reducing operating and maintenance costs. It
includes continued double tracking and electrification
of :Lines, extension of yards and terminals, continued
installation of centralized traffic control, track
and rail renewal, separation of road and rail at
crossings, installation of a permanent way workshop,
procurement of diesel locomotives, passenger cars and
freight cars, provision of a new passenger car work-
sholp, installation of additional telecommunication
and power facilities and provision of technical
assistance to KNR. The proposed loan will also
finance transport sector studies. The project will
enable the railways to move increasing quantities of
bulk commodities and passengers on routes for which
the railways remain the most economic mdde of trans-
port, thus realizing sizeable savings in transport
costs to the entire economy. The only risk is that
traffic forecasts may be too optimistic. However, in
an economy growing as rapidly as Korea's, the short-
fall, if any, is not likely to be significant.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPM4ENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR A SIXTH RAILWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent of $120 million to help
finance the foreign exchange cost of a sixth railway project. The total
project cost is estimated at $406 million equivalent of which the foreign
exchange component is expected to amount to $190 million equivalent.  The
remaining $70 million of the foreign exchange expenditure will be met
through borrowing from other foreign sources as indicated in the Financing
Plan which forms part of the Loan and Project Summary. ThJ loan would have
a term of 17 years, including four years of grace, with interest at 7.45
percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY /1
2.        The latest Economic Report ("Growth and Prospects of the Korean
Economy") was distributed under cover of SecM77-158 dated March 4, 1977.
The Country Data Sheets are attached as Annex I.
Recent Economic Developments
3.        During the last few years, the external economic environment has
been subject to unexpected, sharp and sudden changes which seriously affected
economic activity in Korea and, more particularly, its external trade and pay-
ments situation. The boom in world trade led to increases in the volume of
Korean exports of 46% and 54% in 1972 and 1973 respectively. But in 1974,
the quadrupling of oil prices combined with a sharp rise in the prices of
foodgrains and capital goods led to a deterioration of 18% in the terms of
trade. At the same time, the deep recession in the industrialized countries
caused a slackening in the growth of exports to some 9%. The purchasing power
of exports, which had expianded by over 46% each year in 1972 and 1973, actually
decreased by nearly 11% in 1974. During 1975 export volume grew by a remark-
able 23%, assisted by the devaluation of the won in Dece--  1974 and a very
vigorous drive to expand and diversify markets. However, part of this gain
was offset by a further deterioration of 10% in the terms of trade.
4.        Among the major economic targets set by the Government in 1976 were
the containment of inflation to 10% and a reduction in the balance of payments
current account deficit substantially from $1.9 billion in 1975 to $1.4 billion.
The former goal was achieved and the latter substantially surpassed. Wholesale
prices, which had increased by nearly 80% between the end of 1973 and the end
of 1975, increased by around 9% in 1976, primarily because import costs (which
more than doubled between 1972 and 1974) apparently decreased by about 2% in
1976; moreover, the growith in domestic credit was limited in 1976 to 21%
(compared with increases of 54% and 32% in 1974 and 1975 respectively).
/1 Paragraphs 2-17 are identical to those contained in the corresponding
section of the President's Report (No. P-2237-KO) on the Rural Infra-
structure Project II which was approved on March 7, 1978.



- 2 -
5.        Primarily, as a result of the recovery in the OECD countries,
Korea's exports increased in 1976 by 36% in volume and there was an improve-
ment of 14% in the terms of trade. While part of this increase in exports
may have been supplied by a drawing-down of inventories, it is evident
that it could not have been achieved without substantial additions to
production capacity in the last couple of years. A remarkable feature of
Korea's economic management through the crisis of 1974 and 1975 was that
fixed investment continued to grow at an average of 11% p.a. in constant
1970 prices, raising its ratio to GNP from 24.3% in 1973 to 25.6% in 1975.
6.        The real growth of GNP in 1976 was 15.5% as compared with an
average increase of 8.5% in the two previous years. This was the result
primarily of buoyant exports, but the extraordinary growth in agricultural
output was also a significant factor. Value added in agriculture grew
at over 7% in each of the last two years. While weather conditions were
favorable over the past three seasons, there has also been a real improvement
in yields as a result of better technology and the more effective use of the
various inputs.
7.         At the end of 1976, total outstanding debt was about $7 billion
in medium and long-term maturities and an additional $2 billion in maturities
of less than one year. Debt service payments of nearly $1 billion in 1976
were well within Korea's repayment capacity. The ratio of debt service pay-
ments to exports (of goods and nonfactor services) declined from an average
of 21% in the early 1970s to 11% at the end of 1976.
8.        It would appear that Korea achieved several of the objectives it
set for itself in the Third Plan, despite the balance of payments difficul-
ties experienced in 1974 and 1975 and a generally less favorable international
economic environment than had been expected. The rate of growth of GNP
was 11.2% p.a. compared with the original target of 8.6%. Considerable
progress has also been made in expanding the manufacturing sector. Progress
in reducing reliance on foreign savings and in restraining inflation
fell short of expectations. Furthermore, even with employment growing at
4% p.a. during the Third Plan period, there has been little improvement in
the unemployment situation.
9.        Preliminary indications suggest that industrial production, exports
and balance of payments targets for 1977 have been realized. Industrial pro-
duction, which rose at an annual rate of over 9% during the first four months
of 1977, increased at a faster pace in the subsequent months; a real growth
rate of GNP of 10% appears to have been achieved. Exports are expected to
have risen by about 30% and imports by 27%. Services receipts may be higher
than originally projected due to a considerable increase in both tourism and
remittances from workers and construction companies overseas. The current
account deficit may have been as small as it was in 1976 or even slightly
lower. Price increases averaged about 10% as planned. The introduction of
the value added tax as well as increases in money supply resulting from
rising levels of net foreign assets are exercising pressures on prices, and
the Government plans to hold the price line by further liberalization of food
and other imports as well as by keeping low the prices of grains released
from government stocks under the Grain Management Fund.



-3-
Longer-Term Prospects and Program
10.       The preparation of the Fourth Plan (1977-81) afforded an oppor-
tunity for a comprehensive review of Korea's economic problems, prospects and
priorities. Korea's longer-term goals as specified in the Plan are "growth
with enhanced self-sufficiiency' and "greater equity and social development."
It is the firm intention of the Korean Government to achieve a maximum rate
of growth consistent with a sound balance of payments and also with the main-
tenance of internal financial stability. The Plan projects that the current
account deficit will be eliminated during the next few years. National sav-
ings are expected to finance as much as 92% of total investment as compared
with about 72% in the Third Plan period (1972-76). However, these projections
may prove overly optimistic. The domestic savings target appears somewhat
ambitious, while the projected investment requirements may turn out to be too
low.
11.       Growth and stability are not the only objectives.  Enhanced equity
and greater social development are also of importance in the Korean scheme of
things. The main emphasis is: (a) on providing adequate employment oppor-
tunities for the rapidly growing labor force to prevent any increase in the
unemployment problem; and (b) on achieving a wider distribution of the bene-
fits of growth. Rising employment is the most important instrument for
achieving an equitable distribution of the benefits of growth. This is all
the more so because, despite the success in reducing the rate of growth of
population to around 1.8% p.a., the labor force continues to grow at over
3% p.a. because of the baby boom following the Korean War in the early 1950s.
Health outlays will increaLse as a proportion of total investment with special
stress on preventive care and an innovative health delivery system to service
low income families, especially in the rural areas. Rural incomes are
expected to increase as a result of a further improvement in agricultural
terms of trade and increased opportunities for nonfarm employment, primarily
through the Saemaeul (New Community) Movement and small industries development.
The quality of life in the rural areas is to be further enhanced by the
provision of additional infrastructure facilities.
12.       The achievement of these goals would not require a change in
the basic development strategy of export-led growth, which Korea has
followed so successfully since the mid-sixties. GNP is expected to rise
at 9.2% p.a., fueled by the growth of 16% p.a. in the volume of manufactured
exports.  The manufacturing sector, which now contributes 32% of GNP, is
expected to provide 54% of the increase in GNP during the Plan period,
increasing at 14.3% a year. The ratio of commodity exports to GNP is
expected to rise from the current level of about 30% to about 42% in 1981,
with the manufacturing sector providing about 92% of total exports compared
with 90% in 1976. This demands the achievement of continuous gains in effi-
ciency and productivity. Korea's comparative advantage will gradually shift
towards manufactures, such as machinery, electronics and shipbuilding, which
require relatively more skilled labor. It is also necessary to achieve some
import substitution in steel and chemicals to ensure an adequate supply of



- 4 -
intermediate inputs for the export industries. These changes in the indus-
trial structure will require intensive efforts to improve the mechanisms for
the transfer of foreign technology and the development of appropriate indi-
genous technology.
13.       The Plan targets for exports are challenging but appear to be
attainable, given the extraordinary drive of the Korean exporters, a con-
tinuation of the present level of export incentives and the assumption that
the economies of the OECD countries will grow at an average rate of around
4-5% annually while the volume of world trade expands at an annual rate of
about 8% during the period.
14.       Strong policy measures are envisioned in the Plan to increase the
mobilization of domestic resources. Success in restraining inflation is
expected to have a significantly favorable effect on the mobilization of
private savings. In the past, private savings have fluctuated with the move-
ment of the terms of trade and the rate of inflation. The terms of trade are
projected to be fairly stable through the Fourth Plan period and a rate of
inflation of the order of 8-9% a year is foreseen. The Government has taken
measures designed to channel the higher private savings likely to be gener-
ated by these developments to an increasing extent into the financial sys-
tem, and, thereby, into more effective use for productive investments. In
addition to restoring a positive real rate of return on financial forms of
savings, the measures include the imposition of a capital gains tax at the
rate of 50% on undeveloped land, and 30% on nonprincipal household dwellings.
Funds that went into real estate are now flowing into the securities market
where the after-tax yields are more attractive. At the same time, direct
measures have been taken to force corporations to "go public," thus increas-
ing the supply of corporate securities. Steps are also being taken to
increase the variety of financial securities in terms of maturities, yields
and conditions that would constitute an attractive package to investors.
15.       The measures to increase the mobilization of private savings
are supplemented by fiscal actions to increase public savings. The defense
tax surchage imposed in 1975 is to be continued and a value added tax has
been introduced. The extent of the subsidization of farmers and urban
consumers through the Grain Management Fund is being reduced. The increased
resource mobilization and the strong restraint on most current expenditures
will make substantial budgetary surpluses available to finance capital
expenditures.
16.       The Plan's priorities, strategy and programs are sound.  The con-
tinued emphasis on relatively rapid growth is essential in the light of the
need to create additional employment for the growing labor force. Further-
more, the predominant role the export sector is expected to play is appro-
priate in view of Korea's limited natural resources. Moreover, Korea has the
manpower and the entrepreneurial capacity to implement the Plan's invest-
ment program. The Plan strikes a reasonable balance between the various



objectives of increasing employment, maintaining a minimum growth of per
capita incomes, strengthening the balance of payments and making progress
towards diversifying the industrial structure so as to sustain export growth
in the 1980s.
17.       Notwithstanding the efforts being made to increase the mobilization
of domestic resources, Korea's ability to meet its investment requirements
from domestic savings may fall short of the Plan projections, and a sizeable
continuing inflow of external capital will be necessary. It is estimated
that Korea may need to borrow an average of $2.5 billion p.a. over the next
several years. Its ability to obtain foreign capital in these amounts on
reasonable terms will continue to be a challenge. The servicing of the debt
should not pose serious diLfficulties given the present debt service ratio
and the prospects for continued export growth, provided that the proportion
of external debt incurred on shorter term and at high interest rates is not
excessive. On the assumption that Korea can obtain the required inflow of
capital on reasonable terms, the debt service ratio which now stands at
around 11% is expected to decline slowly to just under 10% at the end of the
decade and remain at about that level during the 1980s.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
18.       As of January 31, 1978, Korea had received 36 Bank Loans (including
one Third Window Loan) and 8 IDA Credits, totalling $1,679.5 million in loans
and $106.8 million in credits (taking into account cancellations and the
refinancing of one IDA Credit in a subsequent Bank Loan).
19.       A substantial part ($558.2 million) of Bank financing has been for
the transport sector. $289.5 million has been lent for agricultural projects.
The Korea Development Finance Corporation has received $220 million, the
Korea Development Bank $142.5 million, and the Mtedium Industry Bank $85 mil-
lion in Bank loans for relending to private industry. An additional $80.0 mil-
lion has been lent directly to industry in support of a heavy machinery
project. A total of $103.3 million has been provided for three education
projects and a vocational training project; $25.0 million for a tourism pro-
ject; $15.0 million for a secondary cities project; and $60 million /1 for a
rural infrastructure project. In addition, two Program Loans amounting to
$175 million have also been granted to Korea.
20.       As of January 31, 1978, $678.7 million of the total Bank lending
remained undisbursed on effective Loans and Credits, mostly from commitments
in the past two years. Ihe rate of disbursement has increased quite markedly
in recent months. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Loans,
IDA Credits, and IFC Investments as of that date and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects. As indicated in the notes, progress on project imple-
mentation is generally satisfactory.
11 A second loan of $95.0 million for the Rural Infrastructure Project II
was approved on March 7, 1978.



- 6 -
21.       Excluding one project that was subsequently cancelled, IFC had by
January 31, 1978, entered into 18 commitments totalling $70.5 million (net
of participations and cancellations). Under consideration is a project in
lead smelting.
22.      The emphasis which the Government places on agricultural and
rural development is reflected in the Bank's proposed lending program.
An agriculture marketing project and a multipurpose project, including an
irrigation component, are under preparation.
23.       The further development of the industrial and agricultural
sectors and the anticipated growth of exports will require concurrent
infrastructural development. Although the transport sector will be given
less emphasis than in the past, the investments required are large, and thus
there is considerable support for this sector in the proposed program.
24.       The share of the Bank Group in Korea's total external debt dis-
bursed and outstanding at the end of 1976 was about 8.9%, and the share of
debt service was of the order of 4.9% at that time. These ratios are
expected to increase to around 18% and 11% respectively, by the end of the
present decade.
PART III - TIIE TRANSPORT SECTOR
25.       The fundamental changes in Korea's economy in the past decade were
accompanied by significant changes in the transport sector. The railway system,
which had been rehabilitated following the Korean War and remained for many
years the only means of large-scale movement of goods and passengers, has
lost its preponderant position, although it still remains an important mode
of transport particularly for bulk commodities. A diversified road transport
network has been developed and paved roads more than quadrupled during the
decade. The share of coastal goods transport in total traffic has also
increased markedly, primarily due to the movement of oil products. The
country's export drive and reliance on foreign trade has led to a sixfold
increase in the volume of port traffic and an eightfold increase in Korea's
international fleet.
26.       The Bank Group, through its association with the Government's
efforts to modernize and expand the transport sector dating back to 1962, has
played an important role in these developments. Some $220 million has been
provided for five railway projects designed to increase its capacity and
improve its operations; three loans totaling $191.5 million have been made
for highway construction and paving of high priority sections of the national
network and for a countrywide maintenance organization; and two loans totaling
$147 million have been provided for the expansion and modernization of
facilities at Busan, the country's premier port, and at Mugho, primarily for
improving coal handling facilities.
27.       As Korea's economy continues to grow and the pace of industrializa-
tion intensifies, there will have to be a corresponding expansion of transport
facilities. The internal transport system will have to cope with the movement



of large volumes of widely used bulk commodities such as coal, cement,
iron and steel, and fertilizer. The industrial complexes which are bur-
geoning on the south and southeastern coast and are planned in the southwest
will require the import of large amounts of raw materials and the transport
of intermediate products between plants. Some of these plants are likely
also to export large volumes of their output. In addition, a more diffuse
pattern of growth in nonbulk freight traffic and passenger traffic is
expected to result from the general growth of the economy.
28.       The preparation of the Fourth Plan (1977-81) afforded an oppor-
tunity to formulate and review investment proposals related to the transport
sector on a more systemat:ic basis than hitherto. Traffic trends were ana-
lyzed in detail and the proposed investments are based on the assumption
that Korea's economy wilL continue to grow at about 9% per annum and that the
deepening of the industr:ial structure will intensify. The investments pro-
posed amount to about W 2,800 billion and represent just over 14% of the
total investment called iEor in the Plan. The modal allocation, compared
with that undertaken during the Third Plan, is as follows:
1972-76                           1977-81

The Fourth Plan allocation of total investment to the transport sector is
about the same percentage as in the Third Plan period, but represents an
increase of 50% in real terms. About half of the investment will be undertaken
by the public sector (mainly for highways, railways and ports) and the other
half by the private sector, for vehicles and ships. In broad terms, the
investment program appears to respond satisfactorily to the growing demand
for transport facilities and the intermodal allocation of investment reflects
the changing composition of demand, although questions regarding some of
the specific investment projects remain; the Government intends to subject
these to a more detailed scrutiny to ensure that their objectives are met in
the most economical manner.
29.       The past and planned development of the various transport modes has
been influenced by: the nature of Korea's terrain (about two thirds of the
country is hilly); the concentration of economic activity and population



- 8 -
around the Seoul-Incheon and Busan areas; the location of the country's major
coal deposits, limestone and cement plants in the northeast; a long coastline
along which industrial activity is increasing; and the economic dependence on
the export of manufactured goods and imports of bulk raw materials. The
major features of the transport system (illustrated in the attached Map)
are summarized below.
30.       Highways.  There was virtually no highway system in Korea 20 years
ago; only a few kilometers of interurban roads were paved and many villages
were without road connections to the rest of the economy. The present
highway system is still inadequate to cope with the rapid growth of road
transport, despite the Government's efforts since 1968 to catch up with the
backlog of necessary improvements. Only about half of the national highways
and 20% of other roads are paved. This situation will require a continued
high level of investment.
31.       Ports and Shipping.  Freight traffic through the ports has increased
from about 13 million tons in 1966 to over 80 million tons in 1976. This
tremendous increase resulted in serious port capacity problems, particularly
at Busan, the largest port, which handles 20% of the country's external trade.
The Bank has assisted development in Busan through two port projects and the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) is financing the expansion of Incheon, the port
nearest to Seoul. The Saudi Fund for Development participated in the finan-
cing of the First Port Project (Loan 917-KO). The Government has also
proceeded to develop a number of specialized ports serving specific industrial
sites, e.g. Bugpyeong handles cement and Pohang handles inbound and outbound
material for the steel mill located there.
32.       The role of coastal shipping has greatly increased in the last
decade from 10% of the ton-km moved in Korea in 1966 to 27% in 1976. This is
mainly due to the construction of industrial complexes at coastal locations,
and, to a lesser extent, to shortages in rail and road capacity. Korea's
share in the merchant shipping of its external trade has been increasing and
reached about 38% of total tonnage in 1976.
33.       Aviation.  Although domestic air passenger traffic grew rapidly
until 1973, it still amounts to less than 1% of total passenger-km; airfreight
is also negligible. Domestic routes are served by the privately owned Korean
Airlines (KAL), which also operates internationally. Most international
traffic is handled at the Seoul-Kimpo International Airport; other inter-
national airports are at Busan and at Jeju Island, a major tourist center.
34.       Railways.  Korea's transport system is now evolving into a more
balanced multi-modal system in which different traffic modes complement each
other according to their technical and economic characteristics. Cost
comparisons indicate that rail transport is still the most economic means of
moving bulk traffic over medium and long distances, and also has an important
role to play in serving long distance passenger traffic. In 1976, about 81%
of rail freight traffic consisted of six bulk commodities, as against 69% in
1966. In addition to its long distance hauling of bulk freight and passengers,
KNR is expected to play a growing role in providing rapid transit service for
Seoul and its suburbs. The system which KN4R operates is the most "mature"



segment of Korea's transport sector. The severe damage s tained during tile
Korean War was repaired with the help of a large USAID-financed rehabilita-
tion program during the fifties. Since then, a continuing modernization and
expansion program has been under way. Since 1962, Bank Group assistance to
KNR, through five projects, has amounted to $220 million. The first three
lending onerations have been satisfactorily completed. Disbursements related
to the Fourth Railway Project (Loan 853-KO) are 98% complete, but the Closing
Date has been extended to Miarcn 31, 1979, to allow for disbursements for
equipment with long delivery times. The loan of $100 million (No. 1101-KG)
made in 1975 for the Fifth Railway Project is over 77% disbursed and it is
expected that the Project will be completed by the end of 1978.
35.       The major requirements of the Loan/Credit Agre,r1-ts covering these
first five railway projects fall into four main areas: (a) KNR's status and
financial autonomy; (b) KNR's financial situation; (c) railway operational
and technical matters; and (d) transport coordination. Although KNR has not
been established as a public corporation, gradual progress has been made in
providing it with more autonomy. Under the proposed project, the Government
has agreed to take all nec:essary action to enable KNR to operate with autono-
mous powers satisfactory to the Bank (Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement).
As regards railway finances, KNR earned positive returns until 1971; since
then its financial situatiLon deteriorated due to increased highway competition,
which eroded earnings frorm profitable passenger services; sharp inflation,
which increased costs substantially; and tariffs, maintained at levels by
the Government which did not fully compensate for inflation.  The remedial
action proposed is referred to in paragraphs 50-52 below. The requirements
of covenants covering operational and technical matters, in general, have
been met satisfactorily, with a consequent improvement in KNR's level of
performance.
Transport Policy Planning and Coordination
36.       Over the past two years, the Government has taken steps to improve
transport coordination. In 1975, this function was reorganized by the
establishment of a Transport Coordination Committee (TCC) K nsisting of nine
directors, representing ministries most directly concerned with transport
matters, and a Transport Coordination Office (TCO) in the Ministry of Transpor-
tation. The TCO is headed by a director general, who also acts as Chairman
of the TCC. Its main functions are to collect data and assist in the formula-
tion and review of transport policies, especially those related to pricing
and regulation. While the charter of the TCC includes intermodal coordination
of transport sector investments, the TCC has in fact not exercised this
function. The Economic Planning Board (EPB), which exercises budgetary
control and plays a major coordinating role with regard to all other minis-
tries, is primarily responsible for decisions on investment projects. EPB
intends to make much more intensive reviews of investment projects and has
established a separate Bureau of Project Evaluation to this end. This is
particularly necessary in the case of the transport sector since transport
infrastructure is capital-intensive, and careful project evaluation and
preparation will help to ensure that capacity increases are provided at the
least cost to the economy, and that efficient use is made of existing capacity.
The Basic Economic Report identified a series of studies related to the



- 10 -
transport sector; EPB has selected three of these for priority consideration.
The Government intends to have these studies carried out mainly by local
consulting firms with some specialized technical advisers acceptable to the
Bank (Section 4.09 of the draft Loan Agreement). Provision is made in the
proposed loan for the financing of such assistance.
IV. THE PROJECT
37.       The proposed project consists of the investments which KNR intends
to start during 1978 and 1979. It was appraised by Bank missions in April-
May and July 1977. A Staff Appraisal Report based on the findings of the
missions (No. 1790-KO dated March 10, 1978) is being circulated separately.
Supplementary project data are provided in Annex III. Negotiations were held
in Washington from February 13 to 17, 1978 with a Government team led
by Mr. J.K. Park of the Economic Planning Board.
38.       The major components of the proposed project are summarized below:
(a) electrification of 8.5 km of double track line and double tracking
and electrification of 22.7 km of lines in the Seoul suburban
areas;
(b) double tracking of 8.6 km of line in the northeast region;
(c) additional crossing loops at 17 places and extensions to marshal-
ling or station yards at 11 places;
(d) installation of centralized traffic control on about 200 km of
lines;
(e)  rail or track renewal on about 330 km and provision of 320,000 cu m
of ballast and 150,000 concrete sleepers;
(f) provision of a permanent way workshop and track maintenance
equipment;
(g) separation of road and rail at level crossings;
(h)  right-of-way improvements;
(i) the acquisition of two breakdown cranes, 30 main line diesel loco-
motives, 211 passenger cars and 1,420 freight cars and repowering
of 59 diesel locomotives and 14 diesel rail cars;
(j) provision of a new passenger car workshop at Daejeon and improvements
to existing locomotive and car workshops and running sheds;
(k) improvement of telecommunications and power facilities;
(1) construction of housing (about 680 units) for train crews and other
employees; and



- 11 -
(m)  provision of training equipment and continued technical assist-
ance to KNR.
39.       The total project cost is estimated at $406 million equivalent of
which the foreign exchange component is expected to amount to $190 million
equivalent (about 47%). The proposed loan of $120 million would cover the
cost of about 33,000 tons of rails, track maintenance equipment, two break-
down cranes, 211 passenger cars, 1,420 freight cars, workshop equipment,
technical assistance to KNR and transport sector studies. The remainder of
the foreign expenditure will be met through borrowing from other foreign
sources as indicated in the financing plan included in the Loan and Project
Summary. About $3.2 million will be provided by the Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund of Japan at 3.5% interest, repayable over 13 years, including
7 years grace; $8.6 million equivalent is expected to be provided by a
European manufacturers' consortium for electrification, at interest rates
varying between 6% and 8%, with repayments over 7 years, including 2 years
grace; about $39.7 million will be provided by the US Export-Import Bank and
US commercial banks, for diesel locomotives, at an interest rate of 8.5%,
repayable over 10 years. Suppliers' credits have not yet been secured, but
in the past have borne interest at about 5.5-6.5%. The local currency
required (W 105 billion, $217 million equivalent) will be provided largely by
Government loans on concessional terms. Physical contingencies of 10% have
been included for all items except motive power and rolling stock, rail and
track renewal, track material, workshop and track maintenance equipment.
Price contingencies have been included for all items; assumed price increases
for local currency items are 8% annually in 1977/78, 7.5% in 1979 and 7% in
1980/81 and for foreign currency items 8% annually in 1977, 7% in 1978, 6.5%
in 1979 and 6% in 1980/81.
Procurement
40.       All items to be procured under the proposed loan will be subject
to international competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank guidelines.
In bid evaluation, Korean manufacturers of equipment will be allowed a
preferential margin of 15% of the c.i.f. cost of competing imports, or the
relevant prevailing leviel of customs duties, whichever is lower.
Disbursements
41.       Disbursements would be made on the basis of 100% of the c.i.f.
cost of imported equipment and materials; 100% of the ex-factory cost of
locally manufactured equipment and materials if local bidders are successful;
100% of the foreign exchange costs of technical assistance for transport
sector studies; and the total cost of other technical assistance. A disburse-
ment schedule is given in the Loan and Project Summary.
KNR Organization, Management and Staff
42.       KNR is a semi-autonomous agency within the Ministry of Transpor-
tation, with its own management, accounts, and allocation from the national
budget. The Government, largely through the Economic Planning Board (EPB),
exercises control over staff, financial, budgetary and tariff matters.
Management is generally satisfactory but there remains a need to strengthen



- 12 -
certain aspects, especially the capability for development of technical,
financial and economic policies and investment planning. The Government
has recognized the situation and a management study, financed under the Fifth
Railway Project (Loan 1101-KO), will be carried out by consultants (Sec-
tion 3.08 of the draft Loan Agreement). KNR is also carrying out a Manage-
ment Rationalization Plan to: (a) reduce costs through mechanization of
maintenance, improved operations, closing or rationalization of lines and
stations, and reorganization of administrative functions; and (b) increase
revenues through improved passenger services, expansion of container services,
provision of private sidings, reclassification of freight rates and improve-
ments to the passenger fare structure. The number of permanent employees has
remained almost constant at about 34,000 and the forecasts assume that there
will be no major change during the project period. Staff productivity in
terms of traffic units (passenger-km plus net ton-km) per employee is high
(roughly 600,000 in 1976) compared with other railways. The higher pay
scales in the private sector cause some difficulties in retaining qualified
and experienced personnel. KNR's training programs were reviewed by the Bank
during the Fifth Railway Project and were found to be fundamentally sound.
KNR Facilities, Traffic and Operations
43.       The KNR system consists of 3,097 route-km of standard gauge
(1.435 m) and 47 km of narrow gauge (0.76 m) lines with about 567 km double
tracked.  The single-track industrial lines between the Northeast and Seoul
are electrified and most of the Seoul urban tracks are also electrified in
association with the Seoul Metropolitan Electric Suburban Railway System.
Many lines are in mountainous areas with steep gradients and numerous sharp
curves. Maximum train speed varies from 110 km/h (on the Seoul-Busan double
track line) to 70 km/h. Centralized traffic control (CTC) has been installed
in the Seoul urban area and on the heavily trafficked single track line
Seoul-Jecheon. Under the proposed project, CTC is to be installed on another
200 km of lines. Automatic block operation is provided on the Seoul-Busan
line. Most of the other main lines are equipped with tokenless block signal-
ling and interlocking systems. Telecommunications are in general adequate,
but some improvements are being carried out and will be continued under the
proposed project. A microwave system has recently been installed between
Seoul and Busan, and a start has been made on providing improved station-to-
station and station-to-train communications. The fixed installations are
adequately maintained.
44.       KNR's motive power and rolling stock fleet consists of 386 diesel
and 69 electric locomotives (with about 20 steam locomotives still in service
on shunting duties), 120 diesel rail cars, 128 electric rail cars, about
1,800 passenger cars, and about 16,000 freight cars. Another 20 electric
locomotives, 90 electric rail cars and 750 freight cars, not included in the
project, are ordered or being ordered for delivery during 1977 and 1978. An
additional 30 diesel locomotives, 211 passenger cars and 1,420 freight cars
are included in the project.
45.       KNR has four main workshops for maintenance of motive power and
rolling stock. A new freight car workshop is being constructed at Daejeon
and a new adjacent passenger car shop is proposed under the project. KNR



- 13 -
is planning to transfer all passenger and freight car main',enance to these
new workshops at Daejeon and, by about 1980, close two of vihe existing
workshops.
46.       Freight traffic, measured in ton-km, grew by 6.0% per annum from
1966 to 1976. Between 1972 and 1976 it grew at 7.7% per annum and is expected
to grow by 7.5% per annum from 1976 to 1981, with the basic composition of
the traffic remaining unchange' Passenger traffic grew steadily until 1969,
but dropped in 1970 and 1971 due to sharp bus competition on the newly opened
Seoul-Busan expressway. However, it has been growing steadily since 1973.
From 1972 to 1976 average annual growth was 5.5%. The annual growth rate of
passenger traffic from 1976 to 1981 is estimated at 5.8%. Preliminary
results for 1977 indicate that freight traffic is in line ; ch the forecast
while passenger traffic is about 5% higher than forecast.
47.       Operating efficiiency and utilization of available equipment remains
high and continues to improve, while availability of rolling stock has been
lower than expected, mainly due to delays in appointment of a technical
advisor agreed to under the Fifth Railway Project, in the supply of spares
and components and in the provision of new centralized freight and passenger
workshops. With progress now being made on all these three aspects, it
should be possible to improve the situation during the 1977-81 investment
plan period. During negotiations, KNR agreed to submit to the Bank, no later
than December 31, 1978, a plan of action to achieve the operational forecasts
used as a basis for the calculation of the rolling stock requirements
(Section 3.11 of the draft Loan Agreement). This should include, inter alia,
the improved maintenance of rolling stock and locomotives, the adequate
provision of funds for spare parts, the complete phasing out of steam loco-
motives and improved training.
KNR Finances
48.       Despite KNR's impressive operational efficiency, its low unit costs,
and the heavy volumes of passenger and freight traffic that it handles, its
financial situation has been deteriorating in recent years. KNR operated on
a profitable basis until 1970.  Since that year, due to ii:  asing highway
competition eroding its hitherto very profitable passenger traffic, and to a
rapid increase in costs due to the fuel oil price rise and to mandatory wage
awards, its revenues have been insufficient to meet its operating expenses
and amortization payments. Its net losses have risen from W 4.6 billion
($11.5 million) in 1971 to W 9.7 billion ($20.0 million) in 1976.
49.       KNR's growing fiLnancial difficulties were discussed in detail
during the negotiations pertaining to the Fifth Railway Project in January
1975. It was recognized that, even allowing for fairly sizeable tariff
increases over the next few years, KNR would not have a positive net revenue
until 1978 at the very earliest. However, the Government fully appreciated
the urgency of improving KNR's financial situation given the need to make
further considerable capital expenditures to enable the railways to continue
to fulfill their crucial role in the economy. In this connection, the
Government agreed to formulate a financial recovery plan with the objective
of enabling KNR, by 1980, to: cover its operating expenses, meet its debt
service obligations in full, and make some contribution towards capital



- 14 -
investment. In the interim, in order to provide KNR with the resources
necessary to finance its medium-term expenditures, the Government agreed to
provide funds to cover KNR's debt service obligations until a financial
recovery plan acceptable to the Bank was implemented. These arrangements
were outlined in a Supplemental Letter to the Loan Agreement pertaining to
the Fifth Railway Project.
50.       Despite Government efforts to augment KNR's revenues by increases
in passenger fares and freight rates, KNR's financial performance deteriorated.
This was primarily due to the fact that these tariff increases were insuffi-
cient to counter the high rate of inflation in 1975 and 1976 when labor costs
increased by 150% and other costs by about 70%. While revenue per freight
ton-km was W 4.64 in 1976, the cost per ton-km was W 5.76; the revenue per
passenger-km (W 3.67) also did not quite cover the cost (W 3.69). In 1976,
KNR incurred a net operating loss of W 10 billion ($20.6 million); taking
interest charges into account, its net deficit amounted to W 23.4 billion
($48.2 million) in that year. However, there has been some improvement in
1977. The Korean authorities and the Bank have endeavored to formulate and
implement effective remedial measures during the past two years. The matter
has been discussed with the Korean authorities at the highest level. The
Government is in full agreement with the Bank's view that measures should be
taken to ensure KNR's financial viability in the long term. Further, the
Government is in agreement with the Bank that the problem should be tackled
through a combination of raising tariffs and, on a decreasing scale, budgetary
support. However, the Korean authorities are reluctant to take abrupt and
drastic action since this may be inconsistent with one of its most important
macroeconomic objectives, namely, to stablize domestic prices. Taking these
considerations into account, the Government has now formulated a plan which
aims at effecting a substantial improvement in KNR's financial situation.
The main elements of this plan are as follows:
(a) a progressive increase in passenger fares and freight rates over
the remainder of the 1977-81 Fourth Plan period. It is intended
that passenger fares be increased by at least 10% per annum during
the 1978-81 period, and freight rates by 15% in each of the years
1978-80 and by 10% in 1981. In view of the Government's policy to
keep annual inflation at no more than 10%, these increases would
ensure that railway passenger tariffs would be set at levels
sufficient to offset the effect of inflation, while freight reve-
nues would increase in real terms; in this connection the Government
has agreed: (i) to raise freight and passenger tariffs to a level
acceptable to the Bank as a condition of loan effectiveness (Sec-
tion 6.01(b) of the draft Loan Agreement) - the increases are
expected to be 15% and 10%, respectively; and (ii) to ensure that
tariff increases would be effected in subsequent years in order to
help KNR to earn a rate of return on net assets of about 2% in
1979 rising to about 4% by 1981 (Section 4.04(b) of the draft
Loan Agreement);
(b) a graduated Government subsidy to KNR which would decrease from
W 14.6 billion in 1978 to zero by 1981; and



- 15 -
(c)  the local currency required for KNR's capital expenditures
during the 1978-81 period would be made available through conces-
sional Government loans bearing interest at about 6% per annum.
51.       On the basis of the above-mentioned plan and reasonable assumptions
regarding traffic and operating costs, it is estimated that KNR's cash
generation would be sufficient to cover debt service and provide a contribu-
tion towards its capital investment needs commencing fiscal year 1979 (Sec-
tion 4.04(a) of the draft Loan Agreement); further, during the interim, the
Government has agreed to provide KNR with such funds as are required to meet
KNR's debt service requirements (Section 4.06 of the draft Loan Agreement).
By 1979, KNR's working capital would be adequate and its debt equity ratio
will not rise above 36:64.
52.       Given KNR's high standards of operational efficiency, there
appears to be little room for effecting economy on the cost side. It is
felt that if the plans outlined in para. 50 above are carried out, KNR will
have made acceptable progress towards attaining financial viability. It is
intended that the financial situation be kept under close scrutiny in order
to ensure that KNR continues to make progress towards the attainment of its
financial objectives.
Justification, Benefits and Risks
53.       KNR continues to play a vital role in the economy of Korea.  While
road transport and coastal shipping have increased their share of total
transport demand over the last decade, the railway remains the most economic
mode of moving bulk commodities to inland destinations. The line haul
costs are only a fraction of road costs, and, while the costs of coastal
shipping are competitive with rail costs on a ton-km basis, the circuitous
sea routes around the peninsula often give rail the advantage. It is impera-
tive that rail capacity be sufficient at all times to handle this traffic,
which is vital for the country's continued development.
54.       Regarding passenger traffic, the combination of increasing incomes
and the government policy of restricting the use of private automobiles has
led to a sharply increasing demand for the more comfortable and faster train
services. Despite Korea's relatively high per capita income, the 70,000
private cars presently in Korea amount to only 2 per 1,000 persons. The
ratios are 2.6 in Indonesia, 7.7 in Thailand, 10.6 in the Philippines and
37.4 in Malaysia. Only the last named has a higher per capita income than
Korea. For long distances in the 300-400 km range, express trains offer more
comfortable, safer and slightly faster trips than highway buses. Special
express trains also compete favorably with air travel on the Seoul-Busan
route. In view of the above, it appears well justified to develop express
train services to satisfy the fast increasing demand, particularly since
these are the most profitable services of KNR. Operating ratios for the
special and limited express services were 63 and 66%, respectively, in
1976.



- 16 -
55.       The economic evaluation of the proposed project focuses on project
investments globally, and on particular items wherever possible. The larger
group, about 62% in all project costs, consists of investments which are
primarily geared to increase the capacity of the railways to carry traffic for
which rail transport is the most economic way of satisfying transport demand.
The remaining project items consist of: (a) way and structure renewals
(10%); (b) investments in the Seoul suburban rail system (SMESRS) (7%); (c) a
new central passenger car workshop at Daejon (5%); and (d) miscellaneous
investments (16%). Items in (b) and (c) above are subject to further review
following completion of studies now in progress (Section 3.09 of the draft
Loan Agreement). No economic return has been calculated on these items
because of lack of appropriate cost benefit data, although there is adequate
evidence to support their inclusion in the project.
56.       The benefits of investments to increase the railway's capacity to
carry freight traffic are measured in terms of transport cost savings for
the economy of the country. The economic benefits in terms of transport cost
savings would yield an economic rate of return (ERR) of over 40%. The pro-
posed capacity increases for passengers are for the better quality services
provided by KNR: the special and limited express trains. Benefits of
increasing the capacity of these services are measured in terms of willingness
to pay for the service over and above their costs and give a return of 17% on
the investment. The program submitted by KNR for way and structure renewals
during the plan and project period was examined on the basis of the age and
characteristics of rail, track, and traffic on particular lines and was found
acceptable. If this program were not carried out, the quality of the track
would deteriorate, with the risk of increased accidents. Speed restrictions
needed to ensure safety would gradually reduce capacity, particularly on
single track lines which account for most of KNR's network. The return on
the program based on maintenance costs savings averages about 27%.
57.       The average economic return on the capacity increasing investments
and way and structure renewals, which account for 72% of total project costs
(see para. 55 above), is 30%.
58.       The main area of risk is in traffic forecasts, which have often
been over-optimistic for railway projects. However, in an economy growing as
rapidly as Korea's it is unlikely that the shortfall, if any, will be signifi-
cant. For the purpose of the sensitivity analysis, the ERR's have been
recalculated for the capacity increasing investments assuming that both
freight and passenger traffic would increase at 50% of the forecast between
1977 and 1981. In this event the ERR would be reduced to 24%.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
59.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Korea and the Bank,
and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft Loan Agreement follows the general pattern of loan
agreements relating to railway projects. Special conditions of the project
are listed in Section III of Annex III.



- 17 -
60.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
61.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
Agricultural Sector
Loan No. 795      Yong San Gang Irrigation Project; $33.0 Million Loan
Credit No. 283   and $15.0 Million Credit of February 2, 1972; Effective
Date: September 15, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project, located in one of the most drought-prone areas of
Korea, provides four storage dams, canal systems and land development to
irrigate 33,700 ha. The project was delayed initially by modifications
in the design of the dams arLd later when rapid inflation outpaced the
allocation of local funds. The dams have now been complet-d And about
19,000 ha was irrigated in 1977. Good progress is being made on other,
works which are expected to be completed in mid-1978, about 18 months
behind schedule. Consequently, the Closing Date has been extended from
September 30, 1977 to December 31, 1978. The project cost is estimated
at about $151 million compared to $88.6 million at appraisal, but because
of increases in rice and barley prices, the economic rate of return is
expected to be close to the appraisal estimate of 13%.
Loan No. 942      Seeds Project; $7.0 Million Loan of November 16, 1973;
Effective Date: April 24, 1974; Closing Date: December 31,
1978
The project consists of: (a) the installation of five field crop
seed processing and storage facilities; (b) farm machinery for seed pro-
duction; (c) procurement of seasonal seed inventories through the operation
of a revolving fund; (d) seed testing laboratories and equipment; (e) crop
research (financed in part by USAID); (f) feasibility studies for irriga-
tion and area development; and (g) technical assistance. The necessary
legislative and administrative action for revising the Seed Law and estab-
lishing an "Office for Seed Production and Distribution" has been taken.
Project implementation, although one year behind the appraisal schedule,
is proceeding satisfactorily. Project costs (OSPD/NAPIO components) have
increased from the appraisal estimates of about $14.0 mil1icu to about
$35.0 million. Disbursement has been somewhat slower than expected at
appraisal but should substantially improve in FY78; it is envisaged that
civil works, construction and purchase of equipment will be completed in
1978.
Loan No. 994      Integrated Agricultural Products Processing Project;
$13.0 Million Loan of June 7, 1974; Effective Date:
March 19, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This project provides long-term funds to the Agriculture and
Fisheries Development Corporation (AFDC) for onlending to subborrowers in the

private sector for the purpose of integrating on-farm productivity of fruits
and vegetables with modern, hygienic processing facilities, using land that
is presently idle or underutilized. The vegetables and fruits involved
are mainly asparagus, shiitake (oak mushroom), spinach, mushroom, strawberry
and peach. Implementation of the project as a whole has been slow. This is
mainly because loan demand for processing facilities, which were specifically
included in the project and account for nearly 70% of total project cost, has
been negligible. Changes in market conditions which have been primarily
responsible for this lack of demand are expected to persist during the
project period. In view of this, in September 1977 the Bank approved AFDC's
proposal to revise the project to include financing of processing facilities
for the freezing and cold storage of fish, meat, fruits and vegetables, fruit
juice extraction and concentration, and vegetable drying, for which there is
strong demand. As a result of the inclusion of these facilities, the loan
amounts approved have increased significantly. If this increased momentum in
lending is maintained as is expected by AFDC, the implementation of the
project, now about 18 months behind schedule, would not be further delayed.
Disbursements, as of January 31, 1978, were 30% of the loan.
Loan No. 1193    Second Integrated Dairy Development Project;
$15.0 Million Loan of June 4, 1976; Effective Date:
November 11, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The project consists of: (a) the establishment of about 450 new
dairy farms; (b) the continuation of the development begun as part of the
First Integrated Dairy Beef Project on about 400 dairy farms; (c) the expan-
sion of existing processing plants, the diversification of their production,
the establishment of 2 milk collection centers and 50 small milk cooling
units and the construction of a milk products plant at Yeongnam; and (d) the
expansion of technical services for both farm development and milk processing.
Effectiveness of the project was delayed for about a year, but farm develop-
ment is progressing rapidly and the project may be completed within the
period originally foreseen. Although technical assistance for new farmers
has been somewhat weak, the Korea Dairy Beef Company (KDBC) is in the
process of strengthening its farm advisory staff. Construction of KDBC's
new processing plant and expansion of one of the existing plants are under
way, and the other existing plant will be expanded this year. KDBC's
financial situation improved over the course of 1976 and the company showed
a profit for the first time in 1977. Prospects are for continued, gradual
improvement. As of January 31, 1978, disbursements were 30% of the loan.
Loan No. 1216    Rural Infrastructure Project; $60.0 Million Loan of which
Loan No. 1218T $40.0 Million Third Window of March 19, 1976; Effective Date:
June 4, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Project implementation is proceeding very well. The Fuelwood,
Roads and Bridges, Water Supply and Rural Electrification components were
completed by the end of 1977. Minor Irrigation has experienced some delays,
mainly the result of budgetary shortages and a cost overrun of 18%, but
should be substantially completed by early 1979. Upland reclamation is

proceeding in accordance with the revised time schedule and will be
completed in 1978. Project monitoring and reporting continue to be satis-
factory and a good start has been made on the Hydrologic Services Study and a
major project evaluation study. The estimated cost of the project is likely
to be 16% above the appraisal estimate, mostly as a result of cost overruns
for Minor Irrigation and Rural Electrification and an increase in the size of
the Water Supply component. Disbursements are practically in line with
appraisal estimates.
Loan No. 1319    Miho Watershed Area Development Project; $29.0 Million
Loan of August 5, 1976; Effective Date: October 21, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The aim of the project is to increase agricultural production and
farm incomes on about 12,665 ha, and to benefit directly some 10,400 farm
families. The project cconsists of: (a) the construction of dams and canals
to irrigate 8,315 ha; (b) the conversion of 2,045 ha of cultivated upland to
irrigated paddy fields; (c) land consolidation on 4,600 ha of irrigated and
nonirrigated land; (d) the development of 495 ha for irrigation of upland
crops and 550 ha for orchards; (e) upland reclamation and bench-terracing of
1,200 ha of presently uncultivated land; (f) the improvement of about 80 km
of river channels; and (g) the construction of about 150 km of village access
roads. For implementation, the project has been divided into five geographic
units. A contract for construction of all works in the first unit was
awarded in August 1977.
Loan No. 1328    Second Agricultural Credit Project; $20.0 Million Loan
of October 12, 1976; Effective Date: March 10, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The project is a continuation and expansion of the agricultural
program financed under the First Agricultural Credit Project. It provides
funds to the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) for
medium and long-term loans, through selected Gun cooperatives of NACF, to
farmers for investments in apple orchard development, silkworm rearing
houses, sprinkler irrigaLtion for orchards, greenhouses for vegetable produc-
tion, and on-farm storage.  The project became effective on March 10, 1977
and lending to subborrowrers commenced in the following month. Project
implementation has generally been progressing satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1364    Yong Sin Gang Irrigation Project Stage II; $95.0 Million
Loan of February 11, 1977; Effective Date: April 22, 1977;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1984
The project w:ill provide irrigation and land development on
20,700 ha in the lower reaches of the Yong San River. Project works include
an estuary dam, sea dike, pumping stations, irrigation canals, reclamation of
5,500 ha of tidal lands, conversion of 3,250 ha of uplands for irrigation of
paddy, land consolidation of 3,200 ha, and irrigation of 1,050 ha of uplands.
Construction of the access roads and a portion of the estuary dam was recently

completed. The main contract for estuary dam construction was awarded in
December 1977, in line with the appraisal schedule.
Loan No. 1503    Ogseo Area Development Project /1 - Stage I;
$36.0 Million Loan of January 4, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983
The project will benefit some 23,000 farm families by providing
new irrigation on 7,100 ha, improved irigation and drainage on 3,700 ha and a
more assured water supply on an additional 1,500 ha. Project work consists
of nine pumping stations, 190 km of main and secondary canals and land
development including 5,800 ha of land consolidation, 2,500 ha of improved
drainage (of which 1,500 ha would also be consolidated), 2,200 ha of tertiary
irrigation and conversion of 1,800 ha of upland and forest to paddy land.
Industrial Sector
Loan No. 1095    Korea Development Bank Project; $60.0 Million Loan
of March 31, 1975; Effective Date: June 17, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project provides funds to KDB to make subloans to finance direct
imports for subprojects principally in the manufacturing and transportation
sectors. Almost the full amount has already been committed to finance 33 sub-
projects, ahead of the time estimated at appraisal. Disbursements now amount
to over 97% of the loan amount, also ahead of the original estimate. KDB's
performance in using the loan has been highly satisfactory.
Loan No. 1145    Fifth Korea Development Finance Corporation Project;
$55.0 Million Loan of July 23, 1975; Effective Date:
September 5, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The loan covers about half the KDFC's foreign exchange require-
ments through the end of 1977. The proceeds are used to finance direct
imports of machinery and equipment, and the foreign exchange component
of domestically-produced capital goods and of civil works. Over 97% of the
loan proceeds have already been disbursed. KDFC's performance in using
the loan has been highly satisfactory.
Loan No. 1175    Medium Industry Bank (MIB); $30.0 Million Loan of
November 26, 1975; Effective Date: January 28, 1976;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980

The project provides $75.0 million to be used by KDB to make
subloans and investments to finance direct imports for industrial subprojects
during the period 1977-78; the remainder of the loan, $7.5 million, would
be relent by KDB to its wholly-owned subsidiary KILC, which would use these
funds to acquire machinery, equipment, facilities and other property to
be leased to investment enterprises during the same period. Commitment of
funds has begun and is progressing as expected; disbursemer- as of
December 30, 1977, is about 15% of the total loan amount.

tional institutions at secondary, post secondary and university levels. It
also includes preinvestment studies on health and management education.
Project execution is now about two years behind schedule. The principal
causes of delay have been slow equipment procurement owing to staff shortages
in the Office of Supply (OSROK) at the initial stage and an internal Korean
review of procurement procedures. Implementation is now proceeding satisfac-
torily. Covenant requirements under the Development Credit and Loan Agree-
ments are largely met. The project is now expected to be completed by about
mid-1979; the Closing Date which has been extended from December 31, 1977 to
December 31, 1978 would require to be extended further.
Loan No. 1096    Third Education Project; $22.5 Million Loan of March 31,
1975: Effective Date: June 6, 1975; Closing Date: June 30,
1980
The project includes assistance for extensions and equipping of
nine institutions (technical, agricultural and fisheries) under the Ministry
of Education (MOE) and seven vocational training institutes (VTIs) under the
Administrator of Labor Affairs (ALA). Project implementation is about nine
months behind schedule mainly due to earlier difficulties with counterpart
funds. These shortages resulted in part from the delay of the Second Education
Project and ensuing bunching of financial requirements. However, substantial
progress has been made and disbursements are on schedule. Of the nine
institutions under MOE, six are under construction and one institution has
been completed. About 80% of the equipment has been tendered. No cost
overrun is anticipated at this time. Both MOE and ALA project units are
functioning satisfactorily.

Closing Date:  June 30, 1982
The loan provides funds to help finance: (a) construction of and
equipment for 8 Vocational Training Institutes (VTIs), with 450 places each
with boarding facilities; (b) equipment for the Central Vocational Training
Institute (CVTI); and (c) expert services for the Vocational Training Bureau
(VTB), and specialist services to the CVTI and VTIs.

Tourism Sector
Loan No. 953      Kyongju Tourism Project; $25.0 Million Loan of
January 4, 1974; Effective Date: May 6, 1974;
Closing ])ate: December 31, 1978
The project forns part of the first phase of the planned develop-
ment of the Bomun Lake resort near Kyongju. It provides for a multipurpose
dam; an irrigation system for about 1,200 ha; improvement and expansion of
the water supply and sewerage and solid waste disposal systems for the city
of Kyongju and the resort area; installation of electrical supply and tele-
communication facilities for the resort area; the construction and/or
realignment of about 57 km of roads, infrastructure, including storm water
drainage, environmental sanitation, community facilities, and a golf course;
a school for training hotel personnel; and a feasibility study for the
development of tourism on Cheju Island. Construction of the dam, work on the
irrigation system, civil works for the Kyongju City water supply and sewerage
and the electricity component have been completed. Work on the water supply
and sewerage system in the Bomun area which was delayed because of ground-
water investigations was started in September 1977 and work on the golf
course has also begun. Road work and construction of common buildings in the
project area were delayed due to the shortage of local funds, but are now
progressing satisfactorily. Construction of the first hotel at Bomun Lake
has started and negotiations for a second are well advanced. About 50% of
the loan has been disbursed and project completion is now scheduled for
December 1978.
Regional Development
Loan No. 1070    Secondary Cities Regional Project; $15.0 Million
Loan of January 15, 1975; Effective Date: August 18,
1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1979
Implementation of the Secondary Cities Regional Project is pro-
ceeding satisfactorily. Three housing sites, two access roads and a city
market have been completed. Progress on the remaining two subprojects is
nearly on schedule. Tenders for the ninth subproject are being evaluated.
Allocation of housing plots has been completed at Yeosu and Mogpo sites
where, as in the case of the Gwangju site, a strong demand for such plots
was demonstrated. Efforts to cross-subsidize smaller plots for lower-income
families through the sale of larger plots have been most successful. After
the initial delays, mainly in fulfilling conditions of effectiveness and
establishing the Gwangju Regional Development unit, the project has moved
extremely well. Total project costs are now estimated at $22.1 million
compared to the appraisal estimate of $25.0 million ($20.8 million at
current exchange rate). A surplus of nearly $3.0 million is anticipated in
the loan amount, mainly due to devaluation of the won in December 1974. As
of January 31, 1978, disbursement was over 53% of the loan amount.

awarded. Overall the project is about 70% completed. Total cost is currently
estimated to be $145 million with a foreign exchange component of $100 mil-
lion. The loan provides $80 million foreign exchange and the overrun is being
financed by the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD). The Korea Maritime and Port
Authority (KMPA) has now appointed consultants to assist in adopting improved
operational and financial procedures. The financial situation at the project
ports is satisfactory and will be further improved if the proposed tariff
increases in 1978 are effected.
Loan No. 956      Second Highway Project; $47.0 Million Loan of January 25,
1974; Effective Date: April 4, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978

of about 130 km of highways and paving, chiefly on existing alignments, of
a further 634 km of national highways were completed on schedule and the
highways opened to traffic in October 1975. The cost, in US dollar equi-
valent, exceeded the estimate by about 5%. Feasibility studies for future
projects of about 1,000 km of roads were started in August 1975, followed by
detailed engineering. Delay occurred in setting up a new nationwide highway
maintenance organization but the organization has now been established in
accordance with decrees published in June 1975. All the maintenance offices
have been constructed and staffed and equipment procured under the loan. The
Government has been requested to increase the budgetary allocation to enable
an adequate program of periodic maintenance to be carried out. By the end of
