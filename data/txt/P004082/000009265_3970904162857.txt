PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Sixth Railway
Project for which Loan 1542-KO was approved in March 1978 in the sum of US$120
million. The loan was fully disbursed and closed in December 1982, only s!x
months after the originally planned date.
The PCR was prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Transportation
Division I and is based on a review of the project files, information provided
by the Korean National Railroads (KNR) and additional data gathered during the
Project's final supervision in January-February 1983. The assistance of the
Government and KNR in particular, is gratefully acknowledged.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operatinns Evaluation nePartment but
the project was not audited by OED snaff. The draft PCR was sent to the
Borrower who approved it without modifications (see attachment).

SIXTH RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1542-1-us
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
The project was the sixth Bank Group Operation in the railway sector
in Korea. It consisted of a two year tranche of the Fourth Five Year Plan
1977-81, namely the plan investments scheduled to start in 1978 and 1979
(paras. 2.02 and 2.03).
The project achieved its objectives to increase KNR's capacity while
improving operational efficiency and maintaining reasonable financial perfor-
mance.  As passenger traffic increased faster than freight, the investment
plan was modified during implementation (para. 3.02). Modifications were in
general suitable except for the complete doubling of the Chung Bug Line which
was premature. After an exchange of views between the Government and the
Bank, the Government agreed to compensate KNR for its expenditures on this
line beyond the scope of the project (para. 3.03). Procurement for original
project items was completed ahead of schedule, but some delay occurred in
disbursement for additional items (para. 3.23). Project implementation was
satisfactory except for the economic feasibility study of major investments
for 1980 and 1981 financed under the technical assistance included in the
project (para. 3.24).
During the project period, freight and passenger tariffs increased
in real terms (para. 5.05). However, these increases were generally applied
across the board, and some rates, particularly for ordinary passenger trains,
still failed to cover costs (para. 5.07). As a result, KNR could not meet its
financial objectives; and remedial actions were included in subsequent
projects (paras. 5.16 to 5.18).
One aspect of this project's experience of more general interest is
the very close cooperation and dialogue maintained with KNR on investment
planning, traffic forecasting and financial/management policies and
planning. A flexible approach on both sides permitted adjustments in the
investment plan and in the project to best fit the needs of the rapidly
evolving Korean economy.



KOREA
SIXTH RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1542)
PROJECT COHPLETION REPORT
1. 'INTRODUCTION
1.01      Korea's remarkable economic growth over the last two decades has
been supported by an impressive development of its transport system. During
1961-78 transport demand grew faster than GNP. Domestic passenger traffic
increased thirteen times and freight six times while per capita income more
than tripled and real GNP multiplied five-fold.
1.02      To meet increasing demand for transport the Government embarked on
a heavy transport investment program. About 20% to 25% of public capital
expenditures were allocated to the transport sector during four successive
5-Year Economic Development Plans (1962-81). These considerable amounts
were mainly used for increasing and modernizing the capacity of all
transport means of the country.
1.03      The Bank has assisted Korea in reaching its transport objectives
through the provision of finance for implementing capacity increase
investments and technical advice aimed at optimizing use of available and
additional resources. US$434 million were financed by the Bank under seven
Railway projects to help modernize and expand rail capacity and improve the
Korean National Railroads (KNR) technical, managerial and financial
performance. US$147 million were financed under two ports projects to
introduce containerization in Busan and improve the organization and
management of ports. US$465 million were financed under five road projects
and a technical assistance credit to develop and maintain the national,
provincial and county road system.
1.04      By the end of 1977 the Bank had helped finance the following
railway projects:
Bank Loan/Credit

Project                     Year         Loan/Credit         (US$ million)
First Railway Project       1962        Credit 25-KO             14.0
Second Railway Project      1967        Credit 110-KO            11.0
Third Railway Project       1970        Credit 183-KO            15.0
Loan 669-KO              40.0
Fourth Railway Project      1972       Loan 863-KO               40.0
Fifth Railway Project       1974       Loan 1101-KO             100.0



Subsequent to the Sixth Railway Project the Government and the Bank agreed
on a Seventh Railway Project estimated to cost US$604.3 million of which
US$94 million would be financed from Loan 1836-RO.
1.05      Bank railway projects in Korea were aimed at improving KNR's
organization and developing its assets. Until 1963, KNR was an integral part
of the Ministry of Transportation; it had neither separate legal status nor
indepedent management. In 1963, as required under the First Railway Project
KNR was established as a semi-autonomous entity with its own manager, budget
and accounting. The revised organization was an improvement, but there was
still an excessive degree of dependence on, and control by, the Government in
financial, budgeting and staff matters. At the Bank's request, the Govern-
ment later agreed on measures giving slightly increased powers to KNR manage-
ment, and enabling KNR to concentrate on installing and operating commercial
budgeting and accounting systems. While the situation improved somewhat as a
result of these steps, KNR'B freedom of action continued to be hampered by
the Government's strict control of budgets and tariffs. With pay scales tied
to those of the Government's civil service, the railway has had difficulties
in attracting and retaining certain specialized technical staff, notably
accountants, economists and computer specialists.
1.06      Korea's railway system consists of 3,111 route-km of standard gauge
(1.435 m) lines of which 607 km are double track and of 53 km of narrow-gauge
(1.067 m) lines, linking major production and consumption areas and seaports
(Map 13134). The narrow gauge Su-In line (Suweon-Incheon) will be widened to
the standard gauge by end 1986 to handle anticipated imports of anthracite
and bituminous coal through the Incheon Port Coal terminal presently under
construction. The Bank will contribute to the financing of this terminal and
the widening of the Su-In line as part of the Coal and Cement Distribution
Project, the relevant loan of which was approved by the Board on April 26,
1983. Many lines pass through mountainous areas, requiring steep gradients
and numerous sharp curves. Rails are mainly 50 kg/m, generally laid on
wooden sleepers; concrete sleepers are being used as replacements on the
higher speed lines. Operational performance is good and staff productivity
high. Bank-financed railway projects have helped improve KNR's ability and
efficiency to carry increasing quantities of freight, particularly coal and
cement produced in the northeastern part of the country, and of rapidly
growing passenger transport demand, largely in the Seoul area and the
Seoul-Busan corridor.
1.07      The scope and content of the Sixth Railway Project are described in
paras 2.03 and 2.04. The following Completion Report is based on information
provided by KNR in compliance with Section 3.04 (c) of Loan Agreement
1542-KO, additional data gathered during the Project's final supervision in
January-February 1983 and a review of the Bank's files in Washington.

2. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01      The possibility of a Sixth Railway Project was first mentioned in
writing in late 1975, about the same time as the first draft of KNR's
Investment Plan for 1977-1981 was prepared. The project was identified
during a supervision mission in April 1976. The Investment Plan was further
discussed during a preappraisal mission in September-October 1976 and the
appraisal mission in April-May 1977, however basic agreement on the size of
the plan was reached only during a post-appraisal mission in June-July 1977
and further minor reductions were undertaken during the continued preparation
works.
2.02      The investment plan agreed to at negotiations totalled R 503 billion
(US$1037 million) with a foreign exchange component of W 211 billion
(US$436 million) or about 43% . Its breakdown is given below.

3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
Project Start-up
3.01      There were no particular start-up problems.  For the major
Bank-financed project items bids were invited within 5 weeks after signing
of the Loan Agreement.
Revision of Content of Project
3.02      General.  The content of the project was changed substantially
(Tables 3.1 and 3.2), the main changes being:



-7-
(a) the doubling of the whole Chung Bug line (113 km), of which
only an 8.6 km section originally was included in the project
(para. 3.03);
(b' change in the alignment and scope of the Gyeongju by-pass line
(para 3.04);
(c) change in size and at the same time deferment of the Bugog
freight terminal (para 3.05);
(d) additional work on station buildings (para. 3.06);
(e) additional quantities of Bank financed items (para. 3.07);
(f) addition of new items (para. 3.08 and Table 3.2);
(g) deferment of capacity increasing investments, (para. 3.09); and
(h) slowing down the permanent way improvement program (pars. 3.10).
3.03 Chung Bug Line. The question of doubling the Chung Bug line was raised
by KNR and the Goverment before the appraisal of the Sixth Railway Project.
However, the Bank did not agree with the Government on the economic justifi-
cation for the whole work, and only doubling of the section Gongjeon-Bongyang
(8.6 km) at an estimated cost of W 2.6 billion including contingencies) was
included in the project. Nevertheless, the Government, giving the doubling
of the whole Chung Bug line high priority for political and military reasons,
decided to go ahead with the construction and works were started along the
whole line in early 1979. After exchange of views with the Governeant and
MNR, the Bank suggested in a letter of September 4, 1979 that these works
should not be considered part of KNR-s investment plan and be executed with-
out placing an extra financial burden on INR. In a letter of February 4,
1980, the Government agreed to compensate KNR for its expenditures for the
works not included in the Sixth Railway Project. This solution was not fully
satisfactory as KNR had to bear maintenance and operating costs of an
uneconomic and underutilized investment. This situation is expected to be
somewhat alleviated when KXR vill utilize the Chung-Bug line for transporting
to the cement plants in the Jecheon area coal imported through the new
Incheon port coal terminal and the Su-In line to be widened under the Coal
and Cement Distribution Project (Loan 2267-KO signed April 29, 1983).
The works were completed in October 1980 at a total cost of U 67.6 billion.
3.04      Gyeongju By-Pass Line. At the time of appraisal only preliminary
engineering was done and on the basis thereof a 3.5 km by-pass line at a
cost of US$1.1 million (including contingencies) was eavisaged. During
final engineering the project was changed to include a 5.9 km line and two
additional station yards. The total cost is now estimated at U 8.0 billion.



The works which started in April L979, are ongoing and expected to be
completed only in 1984.
3.05      Bugog Freight Terminal.  The project included a general cargo
terminal at an estimated cost of W 2.2 billion including contingencies,, In
early 1979 KNR suggested a substantial increase in the size of the toroinal.
After further analysis and discussions with KNR the Bank in November'1979
recommended to defer finalizing the plans for the terminal until tbe results
of a then ongoing coal-and cement distribution study were availab(e. MM
accepted this recommendation and the plans were deferred. Agreeient on the
final design has later been reached with the Bank and a new c'plex,
including separate terminals for coal;- cement, containers angeneral cargo
is included in the Coal and Cement Distribution Project.  Se terminal,
which is estimated to cost about U 79.8 billion, is under construction and
expected to be completed by 1986.  The costs shown under he Sixth Railway
Project (W 8.0 billion) are mainly for land acquisitioand earthworks
carried out in 1979-80.                                  /
3.06      Statioa Buildings.  The project included  nor works (total cost
below W 0.2 billion ) at 30 stations. During theAproject perigd works
were carried out at only 15 stations, but at a c!st of W$2.S million of
which about US$1.0 million to rebuild the Ir  station, which was badly
damaged in an explosion and fire accident, a   about W 1.3 billion at five
other stations to meet traffic demand.
3.07      Additional Quantities of Bank- 4nanced Items.  Considering the
savings in cost on Bank financed items  para. 3.29 and 3.30) and the urgent
need for passenger cars and track mai  enance equipment, the Bank agreed
to finance additional quantities as ollows:
(a)  in December 1978, 35 passenger cars at a cost of about US$8.4 mil-
lion;
(b) in January 1980, s re parts for passenger cars at a cost of
US$0.7 million;   d
(c)  in June and N  ember 1980, track maintenance equipment at a cost
of about US$.6 million.
In November 1981 t   Bank agreed to KNR using        then remaining uncommitted
funds, about US$0.7 million for employing lo 4onsultants for conducting
detailed engineefing for the widening of the gauge of0 he Sr-In line

3.05      Bugog Freight Terminal. The project included a general cargo
terminal at an estimated cost of W 2.2 billion including contingencies.  In
early 1979 XUR suggested a substantial Increase in the size of the terminal.
After further analysis and discussions with RNR the Bank in November 1979
recommended to defer finalizing the plans for the terminal until the results
of a then ongoing coal-and cement distribution study were available. NRK
accepted this recommendation and the plans were deferred. Agreement on the
final design has later been reached with the Bank and a new complex,
including separate terminals for coal; cement, containers and general cargo
is included in the Coal and Cement Distribution Project. The terminal,
which is estimated to cost about U 79.8 billion, is under construction and
expected to be completed by 1986. The costs shown under the Sixth Railway
Project (U 8.0 billion) are mainly for land acquisition and earthworks
carried out in 1979-80.
3.06      Station Buildings. The project included minor works (total cost
below W 0.2 billion ) at 30 stations. During the project peri9d works
were carried aot at only 15 stations, but at a cost of W$2.5 mLllion of
which about USS1.0 million to rebuild the Iri station, which was badly
damaged in an explosion and fire accident, and about W 1.3 billion at five
other stations to meet traffic demand.
3.07      Additional Quantities of Bank-Financed Items. Considering the
savings in cost on Bank financed items (para. 3.29 and 3.30) and the urgent
need for passenger cars and track maintenance equipnent, the Bank agreed
to finance additional quantities as follows:
(a) in December 1978, 35 passenger cars at a cost of about US$8.4 mil-
lion;
(b) in January 1980, spare parts for passenger cars at a cost of
US$0.7 million; and
(c)  in June and November 1980, t.ack maintenance equipment at a cost
of about US$0.6 million.
In November 1981 the Bank agreed to MNR using the then remaining uncozzitted
funds, about US$0.7 million for employing local consultants-for conducting
detailed engineering for the widening of the gauge of the Su-In line
(para. 3.25).
3.D8      Xew Items.  As shown in Table 3.2,  NRK in 1978-80 carried out items
not included in the project at a cost of about Won 24.6 billion. The
rain items were:
(a) Improvement of stations in the Seoul area for electric operation
at a cost of W 9.0 billion. The works, which mainly consisted of



- 9 -
new platforms, stairs and modifications of buildings, vere needed
for the increasing urban passenger traffic;
(b) thirty-seven electric railcars at a cost of W 10.9 billion,
needed to meet the urban traffic demand, and agreed to by the
Bank in September 1979; and
(c)  A new statiou in Jeonju, at a cost of W 3.0 billion, which was
needed for the city development and financed by the Government.
3.09      Deferment of Capacity Increasing Investments.  Dae mainly to lower
freight traffic than forecast (paras. 4.0] and 4.02) and scarcity of local
funds, capacity increasing investments, at a total estimated cost of about W
29.6 billion were deferred to 1981 or later. The major deferred items were:

(paras. 3.09 and 3.10) and (ii) the new Daejeon passenger car workshop
which, mainly due to delays in engineering but also to slow progress in
construction works is delaved almost two years, the project as defined at
appraisal, was completed by the original completion date, December 31, 1981
(Table 3.1). For two items, the Chang Weon siding and the Gyeongju by-pass
line (para. 3.04), which were substantially increased in scope, some works
were carried over to 1982 and later.
Procurement

3.13      Preparation of bid documents  The appraisal assumption that the
Bank's agreement to all bid documents except rolling stock workshop
equipment which was scheduled later, would come in March 1978 was very
optimistic, considering that the SAR was issued only on March 15 and the
Loan presented to the Board on March 31. KNR submitted most of the draft
specifications to the Bank during negotiations in February 1978 and the
Bank commented on them on March 7, 1978. However, the revision of the
documents and the Bank's final review and agreement took another 1-2 months.
Nevertheless, bid invitations for all items, except rolling stock workshop
equipment (see above) and permanent way workshop machinery, the procurement
of which was deferred by more than one year to match the timing of the
construction of the workshop, was done by mid-May, within five weeks after
the signing of the Loan Agreement.
3.14      Bid evaluation.  The appraisal procurement schedule provided for
one month for the Borroweer's bid evaluation. Considering the two-step
procedures used in Korea (opening and evaluation first of the technical
proposal and only thereafte: of the priced bids) and the involvement of two
agencies; INR and the Central Office of Supply (OSROK), this time is adequate
only for exceptionally simple cases. For most of the items the bid
evaluation took about 4.5 months, of which about 3 months for the review of
the technical proposals, which in the case of the passenger and freight cars
and the rolling stock workshop equipment was delayed because of complaints
from bidders.
3.15      Bank review of bids.  The Bank's review of the Borrower's bid
evaluation took only 3 to 15 days, which is the same or better than the
appraisal estimate.
3.16      Award of contract.  The time from the Bank's agareement to award
of contract to the signing of contract was average only 6 days or much
shorter than the appraisal estiamte.
3.17      Total time for bidding.  The actual time from the Bank's agreement
on bid documents to the award of contract varied from about 5 to 14 months
(average 8 months) as compared to the appraisal estimate of 4 to 5.5 months
(average 4.7 months). The difference is mainly related to the bid
evaluation (para. 3.14).
3.18      Delivery.  The actual average delivery period uas about 13.5 months,
or about 2 months shorter than the appraisal estimate. For limited express
passenger cars, a substantial delivery delay occurred (para. 3.22), increas-
ing the delivery period for this item to near 27 months. For all other
items, the actual average delivery time was only about 12 months, or about
3.5 months shorter than the appraisal estimate.
3.19      Total procurement time.  The actual average total procurement time
(from Bank's agreement on bid documents to completion of delivery) for all
Bank-financed items originally included in the project was about 21.5 months
as compared to the appraisal estimate of about 20 months. The delivery of



- 13 -
all these items was completed by early January 1981, as scheduled at
appraisal and about 18 months before the original Closing Date. The addi-
tional items (para. 3.07) were delivered by September 1981, except for one
item, the track meas4ring car (para. 3.23), which vas delayed beyond the
original Closing Date.
3.20      Passenger Cars. The procurement of passenger cars (total cost
about USs57.3 million) involved some problems and is, therefore, described
in detail below. Bids for 45 special express and 166 limited express
passenger cars were invited on May 16, 1978. Four bids were received and
the technical proposals yere opened on August 1, 1978. After review by KNR
and OSROK one bid was rejected as non-responsive to the specifications. Two
proposals (from Ssangyong Corporation, Korea and Tang Eng Iron Works,
Taiwan) were accepted while the fourth bidder, Hyundai Heavy Industries,
Korea, which at the time was (and still is) one of Korea-s leading
manufacturers of heavy equipment (ships, diesel engines, cars etc.), was not
considered qualified because of -absence of manufacturing and supplying
records of the offered products." After complaints b-? Hyundai and
further investigations, the Bank, recognizing Eyundai s experience and
capability as a manufacturer of heavy equipment,-on September 22, 1978,
recommended OSROK to judge Hyundai's capability -from the plant and
machinery they possess and the experience they have in the manufacture of
industrial equipment which includes similar operations- (to manufacturing
railway rolling stock). After further review KNR, however, maintained its
earlier position, whereafter the Bank, considering that this was a case
where (i) the capability of a Korean manufacturer was judged by Korean
authorities, and (ii) there was no reason for doubts about the integrity of
the judgment, on October 16 agreed to the proposed disqualification of
Hyundai. Accordingly, OSROK decided to reject Hyundai's bid and the
remaining two price proposals were opened on November 2.
3.21      For special express cars (45) only one bid (by Ssangyong) was
submitted and later accepted. For limited express power source cars (14)
Ssangyong submitted the lowest evaluated bid, while for limited express
coaches (152) Tang Eng was the lowest bidder as shown below:
Bidder          Price           Delivery period
(USS)              (months)
Ssangyong, Korea       31,536,135               12
Tang sng, Taiwan       22,860,952               18
KNR and OSROK, who apparently wanted a contract with Ssangyong, expressed at
this stage doubts about Tang Eng-s capability to carry out a possible
contract, however, the Bank, after further investigations, stated that it



- 14 -
would have no objection on technical basis to giving Tang Eng the contract.
KNR then strongly emphasized the need for delivery within one year from
contract, and OSROK, therefore, on December 18, recommended as its main
alternative to award contract to Tang Eng only for the quantities (80 cars)
this firm could deliver within one year, while the contract for remaining
cars (72) would be awarded to Ssangyong. However, in case this proposal
could not be accepted by the Bank, OSROK alternatively proposed award to
Tang Eng of contract for all 152 cars. On December 21 the Bank agreed to
the alternative proposal, and contract with Tang Eng was signed the
following day.
3.22      According to the contract with Tang Eng the delivery of 152 cars
would be completed by June 1980, however, due to internal problems within
the manufacturing firm, the delivery was completed only by end-Janaury 1981.
Although limited express passenger traffic in 1980 was 26% above the
appraisal estimate, it was lower than the 1979 traffic. The pressure to
place new cars in service had therefore abated and the delay did not cause
any problems.
3.23      Track measuring car.  The procurement of a track measuring car,
the financing of which was agreed to by the Bank in June 1981 (para. 3.07),
involved complications, which delayed the delivery and caused a deferment
of the Closing Date (para. 3.31). Bids were invited on September 25, and the
technical proposals of the two bids received were opened on December 2,
1980. At the time of the opening of the priced bids, in early March 1981
one of the competitors, an Austrian firm informed the Bank that the other
competitor, (a Swiss firi-)had offered a machine which was not new as
required by the specifications.  The result of further comprehensive
investigations by OSROK was that  the Swiss firm could not show that the
machine offered was new. OSROK therefore decided to invite new bids, which
were opened on August 7 (technical proposals) and September 3 (price
quotations). On September 28 the Bank agreed to award a contract as
proposed by OSROK. The contract was signed on October 2, 1Q81, for delivery
within 12 months, however the machine was actually delivered only in
December 1982.
Technical Assistance
3.24      The main part of the technical assistance included in the project was
for economic feasibility studies of major investments planned by KNR for the
years 1980 and 1981 and proposed for inclusion in the Seventh Railway Project.
Three of five invited Korean firms submitted proposals in August 1978. A Korean
consulting firm assisted by a U.S. firm was selected to carry out the study, vhich
started on February 9, 1979. The draft final report, which was issued in August
1979, was not acceptable to the Bank, and the consultants were requested to do a
substantial revision of the report. This revision took very long time and the
final report, which was of mediocre quality, was issued only in July 1980, close
to two months after the signing of the Loan Agreement for the Seventh Railway
Project. Thus, the study was of rather limited value for the preparation of that
project.

3.25      During the preparation of the Coal and Cement Distribution Project
the feasibility of widening the narrow-gauge Su-In line was studied, and as a
result a decision was taken to include the works in that project. The final
engineering study, which was completed in February 1982, was partly financed
from Loan 1542-KO (para. 3.07).  The widening of Su-In line will be carried
out as part of the Coal and Cement Distribution Project (Loan 2267-KO).
Project Cost
3.26      General.  A comparison of the appraisal estimate of price
escalation with the actual cost development in Korea during the period
1976-1982 is shown in the following table:

is a reasonable approximation also for foreign currency items consider-
ing that Ci) a large portion of these items were procured in Korea, and
(ii) for imported items (mainly from Japan, Taiwan and USA) the devalu-
ation of Won must be taken into account.
3.27      The actual project cost as reported by KNR, compared with appraisal
estimates are shown in Table 3.5 and summarized below.

3.28      The cost overrun of 21Z (or 33Z if also non-project items are
counted) is analysed in Table 3.6. The analysis shows that only about 70% of
the original project quantities were executed while about 30% were
deferred. Jn the other hand, additional quantities of project items
correspondiug to 33% of the original project were carried out (of which 24%
for the doubling of the Chung Bug line, (para 3.03). Thus, the total
project quantities executed were slightly higher than the appraisal estimate
(3%). This indicates an average price increase of 17% above the appraisal
estimate, which is in line with the actual overall inflation in Korea over
the execution period (para. 3.26).

3.30      As shown in para. 3.29 the actual cost of the original Bank-financed
items was only 91% of the appraisal estimate, leaving an amount of about
US$10.4 million for additional quantities of passenger cars, track main-
tenance equipment and technical assistance (para. 3.07).
Disbursements
3.31      Disbursements under the loan are shown in the graph, Annex 2.  As
shown in paras. 3.12 -3.19 there were some delays in the procurement of the
Bank financed items which lead to about nine months delay in the start of
disbursements.  However, by the beginning of 1980 the delay was reduced to
about two months and the disbursement for all original items was completed
ahead of schedule. The delay in procurement of an additional item (para.
3.23) caused the 21 months delay in completion of disbursements and the
deferment of the Closing Date of the loan.
4. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
Freight Traffic
4.01      Freight traffic statistics for the period 1967 to 1982 are given
in T4ble 4.1 and graph, Annex 3, which illustrate the history of traffic
forecasts for the KNR from the Bank's Second to Seventh Railway Projects.
The fourth project appraisal is the only one which underestimated the growth
of freight traffic, and only by a small margin by 1976. The third, fifth,
sixth and seventn project appraisal grossly overestimated traffic growth.
By 1981 the forecast done for the sixth project exceeded the actual traffic
by as much as 29%. For the period 1976-1979, an annual growth of 8.3% was
projected while the actual growth was only 4.4%. In 1980 and 1981 the
situation was even worse with a slight decline (about 1%) in total freight
traffic, due to the general decline in Korea's economy. The growth was
lower than expected for all commodities, and in particular for coal. The
planned target for coal production of 24 mt by 1981 was not reached.
Actually production stagnated around 18 mt until 1981 when it exceeded 19 mt
for the first time. The risk of not achieving the target had been recognized
at the time of the appraisal (para. 2.20 of the SAR). Cement traffic was
also lower because of the stagnation in construction. Domestic demand for
cement in 1980 and 1981 amounted to only 56 and 53% of installed capacity
versus 92% in 1978.
Passenger Traffic
4.02      Intercity Traffic.  As shown in Table 4.2 and graph, Annex 4 both
the fourth and the fifth project appraisals underestimated the growth of
intercity passenger traffic. In both cases the forecast was about 10% below
actual traffic by the end of the forecast period. For the sixth project,



- 18 -
actual traffic exceeded forecast up to 1980, (+11% in 1979 and +8% in 1980);
however, in 1981, traffic dropped 4% from its 1980 level and as a result the
actual traffic came very close to the forecast. For the seventh project,
which assumed continuation of the very high growth, reached between 1976 and
1978, forecasts turned out to be extremely overestimated due to the
difficult economic situation since 1979.
4.03      Seoul Urban Traffic. KNR's Seoul urban railway traffic (Table 4.3
and graph, Annex 5), which started in 1974 grew at an annual rate of about
22% from 1976 to 1981 as compared with a forecast of 13% in the sixth
project appraisal. By 1981 the forecast was only 69% of the actual traffic.
The forecast for the seventh project, which assumed a continuation of the
steep growth up to 1979 also turned out to be too optimistic. As for other
traffic, the economic decline in 1980-81 also affected the Seoul urban
railway traffic, which from 1979 to 1982 grew only by about 6.5% annually as
compared with the forecast growth of about 25%. The high growth forecast
had been postulated in parts on the opening of new lines which was postponed
due to the economic stituation.
Operations
4.04      Selected operating statistics for 1977-82 are given in Table 4.4.
In general, operational efficiency is very high. Availability of motive
power and rolling stock increased over the period while utilization of
rolling stock and productivity in general increased up to 1979-80, but
declined thereafter due to declining traffic.
4.05      A comparision of forecast and actual operational performance
indicators is shown in Table 4.5. For availability and average freight car
load, the forecasts were achieved or exceeded. The utilization of limited
express passenger cars was much better than forecast up to 1979 but declined
with declining traffic in 1980-81. For the utilization of locomotives
and special express passenger cars the appraisal forecast turned out to be
too high. Turnaround for gondola cars has improved to a level close to
forecast in 1981, while for other types of freight cars turnaround has
declined to levels far below forecast, mainly due to declining traffic.

5.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
BACKGROUND AND CONCLUSIONS
5.01      KNR's financial objective is to generate from its gross operating
revenues funds sufficient to cover working costs, debt service requirements
and finance a reasonable proportion of its capital expenditure without undue
financial assistance from the Government. To this effect it was agreed
during loan negotiations that the Borrower and KNR would take all measures
necessary to allow XNR to earn gross operating revenues sufficient to cover
the aggregate of (a) working costs; (b) depreciation provisions based on
fixed assets revalued annually; and (c) rates of return on average fixed
assets in use of not less than 2Z in 1979, 3.2% in 1980 and 4% thereafter
(Loan Agreement Section 4.04). KNR's actual gross operating revenue during
project implementation (1977-82) covered each year items (a) and (b) but was
not enough to earn the anticipated rate of return. The present analysis:
(a) looks into reasons for KNR's failure to meet its rate of return targets;
(b) assesses the impact of this failure on KNR's financial situation and (c)
reports on remedial action taken in subsequent projects.
5.02      The analysis is backed by Tables 5.1-5.3 which show appraisal
projections and actuals of KNR's income statements, sources and applications
of funds and balance sheets for 1977-82 and Tables 5.4(a) to (e) which show
actual total and unit operating revenues, operating costs and net operating
revenues broken down into types of passenger trains and main freight commodi-
ties over 1977-81. Tables 5.1-5.3 are summarized in the Table on page 20.
5.03      The main conclusions to be drawn from the analysis are (a) that
the very low tarrif applied to ordinary passenger trains was the major
reason behind KNR-s failure to meet the project's financial objectives, and
(b) that KNR would have been close to meeting its 1981 rate of return
objective despite this inadequate rating, if the growth of the very profi-
table express train traffic, all of which exceeded appraisal forecasts
(para. 5.04) had not significantly slowed down since late 1979 as a result
of the difficult economic situation affecting Korea as well as the rest of
the world (para. 5.06-5.09). The latter finding is a substantial and
encouraging departure from the past when KNR's failure to meet its finencial
objectives was only due to the inadequacy of its tariffs.
Income Statements
Traffic
5.04      Actual passenger traffic exceeded appraisal forecasts by 16% in
1979. However, this excess decreased to 10% in 1980 and 8% in 1981 as overall
passenger traffic stagnated at its 1979 level. KNR-s freight traffic perfor-
mance reached 96% of appraisal forecast in 1978, but only 83% in 1980 and 77%
in 1981. The actual share of freight traffic decreased from 38% of total

traffic quoted in traffic units (1 pass-km equivalent to 1 ton-km) in 1977 to
33% in 1981, while the share of passenger traffic rose from 62% to 67%.
Appraisal projections were 39Z for freight and 61% for passenger in 1977 and
41% for freight and 59% for passenger in 1981. This shift in traffic trend
adversely affected KNR-s earnings as passenger traffic historically generated
a profit while freight traffic, principally coal and cement, suffered heavy
losses due to inadequate tariffs.
Tariffs
5.05      Table 5.1 shows that KNR-s actual gross operating revenues were
substantially higher than projected at appraisal mainly because traffic and
tarrif increases were higher than anticipated. The following table shows
that, over 1977-81, passenger tariff increases slightly exceeded inflation
every year except in 1980, and that by December 1981 they had been increased
6% more than the CPI over the 4-1J2 year project petliod. Freight tariff
increases were below inflation through mid 1980 but exceeded it substantially
for the rest of the period. As a result freight tariffs were increased about
10% more than inflation over the same 4-1/2 years. C.,al tariffs which were
historically lower than others were increased by 902 between mid-1980 and the
end of 1981.

However, these increases were generally applied across the board. As a result
some rates were still far short from covering costs. The most striking case
relates to ordinary passenger trains, tariffs of which were even short of
covering variable costs (Tables 5.4(a) to (e).
Net Operating Revenue Generated by Passenger Traffic
5.06      The table in para 5.05 shows that until 1979 passenger tariffs grew
faster than inflation. As a result the net operating revenue generated by
this traffic increased from W 3.6 billion in 1977 to W 18.1 billion in 1979.
During this period the rapid growth of the very profitable express trains'

traffic generated enough profits to more than offset losses on ordinary
trains, for which tariffs did not even cover variable costs (Table 5.4 (a) to
(e)). However, express train traffic growth slowed down in 1980-81 in line
with the difficult economic situation of the country. As a result the net
operating profit from passengers decreased rapidly to W 16.1 billion in 1980
and W 2.2 billion in 1981. The table in page 23 shows that these revenues
would have been Won 18.5 billion higher in 1980 and W 60.5 billion in 1981 if
e:-press train traffic had continued growing at the same rate as between 1976
and 1979 (about 17% p.a.). The main explanation behind these potential addi-
tional profits is that the additional traffic would have been transported at
variable operating cost only, as passenger fixed costs were covered by actual
traffic (tables 5.4(d) and (e).
5.07      The Government has systematically kept ordinary train tariffs low
based on the understanding that they are mainly used by the poorest layer of
the country's population. As this was a major reason behind KNR's failure to
meet its financial objectives, the Government agreed to conduct a survey of
ridership on ordinary trains in order to determine the occupancy factor and
the optional fare ro be applied to these trains' users, based on their income.
Upon completion oi che survey the Government, KNR and the Bank will agree on
(a) possible reductions in the number of ordinary trains in operatioin;
(b) tariffs; and (c) subsidies to be provided by the Government to make up
for losses on ordinary trains and commuter traffic. A 50% increase in ordi-
nary train tariffs applied in 1980 (considered to be a reasonable assumption)
would have generated additional revenues of W 12.9 billion in 1980 and W 3.3
billion in 1981.
Net Operating Losses generated by Freight Traffic
5.08      Freight tariffs in general, in particular for coal and cement,
which represent together about 60% of KNR's freight traffic, were historically
much below costs. The table in para. 5.05 shows that freight tariffs were
increased more than inflation over the project implementation period. This
explains why net operating losses incurred from freight traffic which
increased from W 1.4 billion in 1977 to W 19.9 billion in 1980, were reduced
to Won 11.2 billion in 1981. Given MNR's high productivity there was little
room for reducing operating costs. Even larger tariff increases would
consequently have been needed to offset losses. However, their imple-
mentation would have been politically difficult in a period of very high
inflation, and in some cases would even have adversely affected KNR's
competitiveness.

Thanks to the above mentioned tariff increases, MUR was close to covering
operating costs every year although the latter exceeded appraisal estimates by
5% inu1978, 19% in 1979, 46% in 1980 and 69% in 1981.  However, it did not
generate revenues enough to finance interest charge on loans contracted for
financing project investments. Its annual net deficit grew in line with
interest charges.

return and net revenues (losses) assuming that KNR would have been able to

express trains traffic (para. 5.06) and (c) simultaneous materialization of

Loan Agreement rate of return objectives were 3.2% for 1980 and 4Z for 1981.
KR would have improved its financial performance if it had achieved optiron
(a) approached the Loan Agreement objective in 1981 if it had achieved
option (b) and approached the Loan Agreement objective for 1980 and
surpassed this objective for 1981 if it had achieved option (c). KNR-s
failure to meet the financial objectives of the project should consequently
be blamed primarily on the inadequacy of ordinary train tariffs but also
on the 1979-82 worldwide economic recession.

Financing of Investments
5.13      To finance its capital investments amounting to W 556.9 billion
K=NR used the following sources:
(W bil)
Government contributions                      84.3
Borrowing                                    380.6

Total                                     556.9
To finance this gap IMR had to progressively deplete its working capital which
became negative starting in 1980, i.e., short-term liabilities exceeded
current assets.
Balance Sheet
Short-Term Situtation
5.14      Table 5.3 shows that KNR*s working capital deteriorated from a
positive U 8.9 billion position at the start of the Project to a negative
w 90.6 billion by its completion as a result of the above explained shortage
in resources for debt service and investment financing.  To cover the
worsening deficit in working capital RIR had to increase its long-term



- 27 -
borrowing from local sources, which led to heavier interest charges at a
time when KNR's gross operating revenue barely covered operating costs. KNR
was consequently unable to achieve the 1.5 ratio of current costs to current
liabilities provided for under Section 4.04(c) of the Loan Agreement.
Long-Term Situation
5.15      This additional borrowing explains the progressive deterioration
of KNR-s long debt to equity ratio which fell from 29/71 at the start of
the project in 1977 to 38/62 by the end of 1981. This ratio is expected to
further deteriorate due to the additional long-term debt KNR incurred
to finance the investment component of the Seventh Railway Project. To
cover the related debt service KNR will have to generate substantial
funds. As its operating costs cannot be significantly reduced the only way
to generate these funds is to increase gross operating revenues, which
requires that all tariffs fully cover costs.
Remedial Action Taken
5.16      To prevent KNR's future financial performance from being hampered
by inadequate tariff policies due to the Government-s social or economic
considerations the Government and the Bank agreed at negotiations of the
Seventh Railway Project that the Government would establish not later than
December 31, 1984 a revised KNR tariff structure of KNR which would (a)
provide KNR with revenues sufficient to cover all operating costs plus the
agreed rate of return on average net fixed assets in use; and (b) ensure
that no single tariff would be lower than the <NR-s variable cost unless the
'Government subsidizes the difference between the latter cost and the tariff
(Loan 1836-KO Section 4.04 and 4.08 and side letter dated May 21, 1980).
5.17      A comparison between Tables 5.4 (d) and (e) shows that thanks
to the above mentioned tariff increases net operating losses incurred by
KNR on coal and cement transports were reduced from W 2.96/ton-km and
0.40/ton km respectively in 1980 to W 0.78 and 0.17 in 1981. Calculations
prepared during appraisal of the Coal and Cement Distributions project
showed that KNR-s tariffs as of December 31, 1982 covered 118% and 113% of
coal and cement operating costs but where short 2% for coal and 5% for
cement to cover full cost including debt service requirements. At
negotiations of this project it was agreed that the full cost coverage will
be reached by July 1, 1984 for coal and by January 1, 1985 for cement and
will be maintained thereafter.
5.18      During the above mentioned negotiations it was also agreed that
the Government would:
(a) adjust K'ivR's original 1982-86 investment plan to fit
the reduction in traffic demand caused by the 1980-82
economic recession; and
(b) ease the debt service obligations of KNR through subsidies.

6. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01      KNR's operating productivity is one of the highest in the world,
mainly as a result of the action of its highly competent technical management.
However, its financial results do not fully reflect this efficiency.  This is
mainly because KNR's present status as a semi-autonomous agency prevents its
management from enjoying the freedom in planning, organizational and financial
decision-making needed for facing increasingly fierce competition and adapting
to abrupt changes in traffic demand and or economic conditions.
6.02      The government was aware of these deficiencies and therefore agreed
to carry out a comprehensive management study under terms of reference agreed
with the Bank. This study, which was financed under Loan 1101-KO (Fifth
Railway Project), was completed in September 1979. At negotiations of the
Sixth Railway Project agreement was reached to implement the study's recommen-
dations in agreement with the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 3.08).
6.03      The study-s main conclusion was that KNR should be gradually
transformed into a public corporation in which managerial functions would be
delegated, under the guidance of a Board of Directors and the control of the
Administrator (renamed President), to three line managers (renamed Executive
Vice Presidents) in charge of Planning, Coordination and Control; Operations;
and Administration, respectively. The attached chart 20995 shows KNR-s
recommended organization. This transformation would be preceded by a set of
short and medium-term measures focussing on: (a) the establishment of a
management information system and an aggressive marketing organization; (b)
the strengthening of &NCRs capability in the fields of economic analysis for
investment planning, financial management and accounting procedures, with
special emphasis on implementation of performance budgeting and incremental
long-term variable costing; and (c) progressive reorganization of KNR-s
management along the lines described above to ensure KNR-s smooth transi-
tion to its new status. During negotiations of the Seventh Railway Project,
it was agreed that KNR would become a public corporation no later than
January 1, 1987. Agreement was also reached on a timetable for implementing
the short and medium-term measures. A team of technical assistants financed
from Loan 1836-KO assists KNR in this implementation. This assistance covers
the following areas:
(a) Preparation of a detailed plan of action for transferring
KNR into a public corporation;
(b) Strategic planning;
(c) Investment planning;
(d) Performance budgeting;
(f) Traffic forecasting;
(g)  Marketing;
(h)  Management Information System;
(i) Commercial accounting;
(j) Traffic costing and tariffing; and
(k) Management training.

7. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.01      The Sixth Railway Project financed a two-year slice (1978 and
1979) of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1977-81). The economic evaluation of
the appraisal analyzed separately: (a) the large investments which can be
clearly isolated in terms of the benefit they were to generate; and (b)
other investments which have a network-wide effect and which benefits cannot
be assigned to a particular traffic.
7.02      The large investments analyzed separately, including calculation
of an economic return are:
(a) capacity-increasing investments for increasing freight and
passenger services (or 62% of appraisal project costs); and
(b) way and structures renewals (10%).
The other investments including upgrading the Seoul Suburban Rail System
(7%), a passenger car workshop at Daejon (5%) and miscellaneous investments
C16%), were evaluated based on their individual objective, without calculat-
ing their economic returns as cost-benefit data were lacking.
7.03      The methodology followed for the economic reevaluation is the same
as that of the appraisal. For ease of comparison, cost and benefit figures
were computed in end-1976 constant prices as for the appraisal. The recal-
culated rates of return for the main componnents of the sixth project are as
follows compared to appraisal estimates:
ECONOMIC RATES OF RETURN (Z)
Appraisal       Reevaluation
Capacity increase for freight services                40                18
Capacity increase for passenger services
(special and limited express trains)                17               28
Way and structures renewals (weighted
average on the 8 lines included under
the project)                                        28               28
Overall economic evaluation (for the
3 components above)                                 30               22



- 30 -
7.04      As a result of changes in project components, the investments for
capacity increase for freight and passenger services represent 74Z of the
total actual cost of the project, compared to 62% at appraisal. The main
increase is due to the Chung Bug line double-tracking which in itself repre-
sents 28% of the project actual cost (Tables 10 and 11). This added cost
has been entirely allocated to freight services, as the Chung Bug line is
essentially an industrial line. The combined effect of less freight traffic
and higher investment costs resulted in a drop of the ERR to 18% (Table 12).
7.05      The capacity increases for passenger special and limited express
services were well justified. In fact, traffic greatly exceeded forecasts
as a substantial amount of the demand for rail passenger transport shifted
from the ordinary services toward the better services offered by the limited
express. The proportion of this traffic increase from 47% of total pass-km
in 1977 to 61Z in 1982. For 1981, the forecast for limited express passenger
traffic amounted to 7 billion pass-km but the actual figure was 8.8 billion.
Special express services amounting to about 10% of limited express, however,
increased somewhat less than forecast. The return on investments for both
types of service combined is 28%, exceeding largely appraisal estimates
(Table 13).
7.06      The way and structures renewals were the third investment analyzed
at appraisal. It was to amount 10% of total project cost, but due to
deferments and changes of priorities, this component amounted only to 7% of
actual investments. As expenditures were reduced only for track sections
having lesser priority, it is expected that the return on this smaller
investment is at least equal, or possibly higher, to the 28% computed at
appraisal. However, data were not available to carry out a detailed computar
tion and it was deemed not worth to spend more time on such small investment
which return is definitely substantial.
7.07      The weighted overall rate of return is 22% for the three main comr-
ponents of this project, representing about 82% of the total project cost.
Despite the premature double-tracking of the Chung Bug line, the overall
return is within the range expected at appraisal, mainly because of a very
conservative assessment of the traffic forecast, and thus benefits, of
passenger services.

8. THE ROLE OF THE BANK
Project Objectives
8.01      The project objectives were in general appropriate, and the agreed
modifications of project content and scheduling were justified.
Project Content
8.02      The Bank played an important role in reducing the originally pro-
posed size of the project to what at appraisal was considered technically and
economically justified.
8.03      The actual costs of originally included Bank-financed items was in
total only 91% of the appraisal estimate (varying from 69% to 111% for indivi-
dual items). With the Bank's agreement, the main part of the savings was used
for procurement of additional passenger cars, needed to meet traffic demand,
which up to 1980 increased far beyond the appraisal forecast. In the case of
freight traffic the forecast was far too optimistic (in 1981 the forecast
exceeded the actual traffic by 29%). Consequently, the agreed quantities of
additional freight cars were too high, which resulted in a still existing sur-
plus of freight cars. This situation could have been avoided by using a
system of awarding contracts for a basic quantity of say 80% of the estimated
requirements with an option to add the remaining 20% as needed considering the
traffic development. No further freight cars were included in the seventh
project.
Project Implementation
8.04      The project implementation schedule was in general realistic and
the Bank's assessment of KNR's implementation capacity was correct or even
somewhat on the low side. Although disbursements started about nine months
late, the disbursement schedule was in general realistic, as disbursement for
all originally included items was completed slightly ahead of schedule.
Operating Forecasts
8.05      Appraisal estimates of operating efficiency were in general realis-
tic; however, the utilization of motive power was somewhat lower than forecast
and the utilization of rolling stock declined to levels below forecasts, due
to declining traffic.
Financial Performance
8.06      As under previous projects, KNR did not meet the financial objec-
tives of the project. However, this failure is to be blamed on the
reduction in traffic demand triggered by the worldwide economice recession
started in late 1979 rather than an inadequate tariff increases as was the
case in the past. As can be seen in para. 5.05, tariff increases applied



- 32 -
during project implementation were broadly in line with inflation for
passengers and exceeded inflation for freight mainly in 1980/81. Thanks to
these increases, KNR' losses on freight traffic decreased substantially and
coal and cement tariffs as of December 31, 1981, generated a net operating
profit. Passenger traffic generated a small net operating profit in 1981
although ordinary train fares were below variable costs and traffic on
express trains was stagnant at the previous year's level. The Bank has been
instrumental in convincing the Government af the necessity of the above
tariff increases.
Institutional Building of [QR
8.07      The Bank has played a useful role in pressing the Government and KNR
to undertake the management study and implement its recommendations along
lines explained in Chapter 6 of this report.
Bank Supervision
8.08      The scope and schedule of supervision missions were adequate in the
context of the borrower's managerial and technical competence. There was good
continuity in Bank staff supervising the project.
Working Relationship
8.09      Project preparation and supervision were greatly facilitated by the
continued close and open-miuded cooperation between Government and KXR
officials and Bank staff built-up during preparation and execution of five
successive projects. The increasing familiarity of Korean officials with
Bank7s objectives, procedures, requirements and Bank staff's awareness of
Koreas problems and customs led to a smooth and efficient dialogue between
the two parties.
9. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      The objectives of the Project were:  (a) to increase KNR's capa-
city to enable it to respond to anticipated Increases in passenger and
freight traffic demand; (b) to improve operational efficiency; (c) to
improve KR's financial performance through reductions in operating costs
and tariff adjustments; (d) to monitor progress of the management study
financed from Loan llOl-KO but carried out under Terms of Reference agreed
during negotiations of the Fifth project; and (e) to study the feasibility
of future railway projects (or transport sector projects including a railway
component). Project implementation was generally successful. Physical
investments gave KNR the additional capacity it needed; operational effi-
ciency was good; the project's financial objectives would have been reached
if traffic had not been adversely affected by the 1980-82 worldwide economic
recession; and good progress was made toward the reorganization of  M.



- 33 -
Physical Component
9.02      Most of the major components included in the original project were
completed on schedule. The deferment of implementation of capacity increase
investments listed in paras. 3.09-3.10 and of the construction of the Bugog
terminal had no detrimental effect on KNR's traffic. The additional works
on the Gyeongju by-pass line, the construction and/or extension of stations
and the procurement of 37 additional electric railcars for urban traffic were
well justified. The only project item which could have been reduced is the
number of freight cars which was based on somewhat too optimistic traffic
projections. Project costs were substantially in line with appraisal fore-
casts. The economic return is somewhat below appraisal estimate, but still
very good.
9.03      The only physical project item implementation of which raised a
problem vas the doubling of the whole Chun-Bug line which was not economic-
ally justified. The Government's response to the Bank's objections to it
i.e., the takeover by the Government of the cost of the part of this doubling
not included in the original project was not fully Eitisfactory. it resulted
in transferring the burden of the cost of an uneconomic investment from KNR
to the Government while obliging KNR to bear maintenance and operating costs.
Operations
9.04      Thanks to the dedication and high quality of KNR-s staff,
operating efficiency improved over its already high level during the first
two years of project implementation. The decline in utilization of motive
power and mainly rolling stock during 1980-82 was due to the stagnation of
passenger traffic and the decline in freight traffic.
Finances
9.05      The Government made a commendable effort to raise tariffs main'/
for freight, to catch up for their former inadequacy. Unit costs did not
decrease as anticipated at project appraisal, partly due to high inflation,
but mainly because some project investments were underutilized due to the
above-mentioned slowdown in traffic demand. The inadequacy of ordinary
passenger trains was a major reason behind KNR-s failure to reach the pro-
ject-s financial objective. Despite this major shortL3ming, KNR would have
met this objective if passenger express trains traffic had grown in 1980-81
at the same rate as over 1977-79. The next step towalx- the improvement of
KNR's financial performance will be the establishment of a cost based tariff
system. The Government and the Bank have agreed on a set of measures aimed
at reaching this goal as part of the Seventh Railway project (Loan 1836-KO)
and the Coal and Cement Distribution project (Loan 2267-KO). KNR's financial
performance should improve considerably once its tariff will be cost based
and the pick up of traffic will provide for full utilization of investments
implemented under the Sixth and Seventh Railway Projects.

Institution Building
9.06      The comprehensive management study r: rried out by a U.S.
consulting firm in association with a Koreai ;nsulting firm was completed in
September 1979. The study's main conclusion is that KNR should be gradually
transformed in a public corporation entrusted with a substantial degree of
managerial freedom and financial independence. During negotiations of the
Seventh Railway Project it was agreed that this goal should be reached no
later that January 1, 1987. Agreement was also reached on a time table for
implementing shortand medium-term measures recommended by the consultants
for assuring a smooth switch in KNR's status and organization. This is
being done with the assistance of consdltants financed from Loan 1836-KO.
Studies
9.07      As mentioned in para. 3.24, the report on the economic feasibility
study of major investments proposed for inclusion in the Seventh Railway
project carried out by a team of local and foreign consultants was of mediocre
quality.
9.08      The final engineering study for the widening of the Su-In line was
sucessfully completed in February 1982, partly financed from Loan 1542-KO.
Follow up Projects
9.09      The effort undertaken under the first six Korea railway projects
are being pursued under the ongoing Seventh projcect and the Coal and
Cement Distribution Project. Completion of the latter project is planned
for December 31, 1986 coinciding with the target data for the establishment
of KNR as a public ccrporation. Implementation of the physical and institu-
tional components of the two projects is expected to transform KNR into the
operationally efficient and financially viable organization needed for
fuillfilling its role in the Korean economy.
