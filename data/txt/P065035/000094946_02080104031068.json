Feed processing operations are believed\n            to be on a small scale and mostly run by households and\n            herders. The major potential environmental impacts are dusts\n            and noise, which will be minimized especially in residential\n            areas by putting crushing machines indoors. Wool packing\n            will not involve use of chemicals and so no wastewater from\n            wool washing is anticipated. However the operation should be\n            standardized and managed according to the principle of\n            minimum impact to the environment. Dead animals should\n            either be sent to the local epidemic prevention station for\n            disposals or be disposed in a centralized way to prevent\n            cross infection and environmental pollution. Chemical used\n            in the laboratories should be stored properly by type and\n            according to the management regulations for toxic materials.\n            After use, the chemicals should be properly handled and sent\n            to the designated disposal sites. Feedlots produce\n            significant quantities of farmyard manure (organic waste)\n            rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, which could potentially\n            pollute groundwater and surface water. It is necessary to\n            keep manure in sedimentation ponds for a period of time\n            before applying to agricultural fields and artificial pastures."}, "docdt": "2003-07-17T00:00:00Z"}
