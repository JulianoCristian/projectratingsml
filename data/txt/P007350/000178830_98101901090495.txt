PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report on the Honduras Seventh Highway
Project for which loans in the amount of US$35.0 million (US$7.0 million on
Third Window Terms and US$28.0 million on Standard Terms) were approved by
the Executive Directors on November 23, 1976. The loans are about 96%
disbursed. About US$0.7 million are not committed and would be cancelled.
The Loan closed on December 31, 1983.

SEVENTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1341-HO/1342-T-HO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The Seventh Highway Project was successful in achieving its main objective of
reconstructing the Talanga-Juticalpa-Catacamas road. This was done at a cost
13% below appraisal estimates, in spite of the additional costs brought about
by the upgrading of the standards of the Juticalpa-Catacamas section
(para 3.05) and the need to carry out substantial repair works on the project
road (para 3.07). The ex-post economic evaluation yielded estimated rates of
return for the Talanga-Juticalpa and the Juticalpa-Catacamas road sections of
21% and 12% respectively, confirming the probable viability of the project
(para 5.03).
During the execution of the civil works, the Borrower initiated changes in
the design standards of the Juticalpa-Catacamas road and in the alignment of
the Talanga-Guaimaca road without prior Bank consultation. In the first
case, the Bank found the changes justified and accepted their inclusion in
the project (para 3.05). However, in the case of the new alignment for the
Talanga-Guaimaca road, which necessitated a new bridge 54m long, the Bank did
not fully accept the Government's arguments for the change and did not agree
to finance the new bridge from the proceeds of the Loan (para 3.03).
Two civil works contractors presented claims to the Borrower, for diverse
reasons (paras 3.03 and 3.05).
Loan funds freed because of the lower-than-expected cost of civil works and
the deletion from the project of the Telica Dam Study (para 3.15) were
reallocated to the construction of three access roads connecting the main
road to the towns of Campamento, Juticalpa and Catacamas (para 3.08); to the
construction of a 6.05 km road between Catacamas and the Escuela Nacional de
Agricultura (para 3.09); to the purchase of additional equipment and spare
parts for the country's highway maintenance program (para 3.15); and to the
Labor-Intensive Road Construction Program (para 3.16).
The following discussion summarizes the main aspects of the Technical
Assistance elements included in the project:
(a) Transport Planning. A Highway Master Plan was developed under
the project (paras 3.11 and 3.12).
(b) Technical Assistance to the Directorate General for Roads
(DGC). This technical assistance focused on the organization
and equipment of laboratories. Its training element was
hampered by the slow progress in laboratory construction and
shortage of supplies. Two practical courses were offered and,






in addition, four laboratory technicians attended specialized
courses in Mexico (paras 3.13, 3.17 and 3.18).
(c) Technical Assistance for the Directorate General for Road and
Airport Maintenance (DGMCA). The consultants helped to
introduce a system for road maintenance and equipment
management in a Pilot District. However, implementation of the
system at the national level was postponed and is being carried
out under the follow-on Eighth Highway Project (paras 3.19,
3.20 and 3.21).
(d) Technical Assistance to the Construction Industry. Consultants
carried out a study identifying the mDst serious bottlenecks
faced by the industry. However, since the study is still being
reviewed, the technical assistance that should have emanated
from it has not been carried out.
The lessons to be learned from the project, identified in this Report, refer
to:
(a) the need to examine cost estimates in future projects in
Honduras more carefully;
(b) the need for future Bank supervision to increase emphasis
following through on the institution-building aspects of the
projects, after securing prior Government commitment;
(c) the difficulties inherent in establishing an efficient road
maintenance system in countries greatly lacking in staff and
facilities; and
(d) the need for continuation of the Bank's efforts to identify and
implement appropriate technologies in labor-abundant countries.






HONDURAS
SEVENTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1341-HO/1342-T-HO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Honduras, with an area of 115,200 km2, is the second largest of the
five Central American countries. The generally rough topography, character-
ized by several mountain ranges, makes the development of the road infra-
structure difficult and expensive. Significant road development in Honduras
started only in the mid-1960s, and, during the last decade, major efforts
were made to extend and improve the network. Roads now interconnect major
population centers; however, parts of the country, especially the east and
northeast, have poor access and low road density.     The present network
consists of about 8,545 km, of which 1,716 are paved. Its backbone is the
north-south road which, starting at the San Lorenzo Port on the Pacific
Ocean, passes through Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, reaching Puerto Cortes
on the Caribbean Sea (Map IBRD 14823R (PCR)).
1.02      Over the past 25 years, the Bank has been involved continuously
with highway development in Honduras. Since 1955, eight highway projects
have been approved, with loans and credits amounting to US$88 million
equivalent. With the reconstruction of the Talanga-Juticalpa-Catacamas road,
financed under the subject project, the primary road network has been largely
completed. The emphasis of investment in the road subsector has now shifted
toward the expansion and improvement of the secondary and feeder roads and
the maintenance of the system.    This policy, supported by the Highway Master
Plan (December 1977) prepared under the Seventh Highway Project (para 3.11),
provided the basis for the formulation of the ongoing Eighth Highway Project
(Loan 1901-HO), under which about 350 km of feeder roads located in selected,
agriculturally productive valleys are being constructed and about 115 km of
existing secondary roads are being improved.
1.03     This project completion report is based on information obtained from
the Minutes of the Board Meeting, the LAC Information Center, Appraisal
Report No. 12353a-HO, staff supervision reports, consultants' final reports
and reports from the Project Unit in the Secretariat of Communications,
Public Works and Transport (SECOPT).
II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01      The civil works components of the project constitute the second
tranche of the reconstruction of the Tegucigalpa-Talanga-Juticalpa-Catacamas
highway corridor; reconstruction of the first tranche (Tegucigalpa-Talanga)
was financed under the Sixth Highway Project (Loan 896-HO) and completed in
February 1977. The feasibility study for the Tegucigalpa-Talanga-Juticalpa
road was prepared by U.K. consultants, with financing provided by the Central



American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) and the U.K. Government. The
study was completed in 1971 and updated by the Sectoral Planning Office of
SECOPT in late 1975. Detailed engineering was prepared by the same
consultants and completed in 1973. For the Juticalpa-Catacamas section, the
feasibility study and detailed engineering were prepared in 1974-75 by US
consultants, with financing provided under Loan 896-HO.
2.02      The project was appraised in February 1976.     The issues paper,
circulated on April 7, 1976, dealt mainly with the question of the investment
necessary for the development of the area of influence of the project road.
In particular, the paper discussed the possibility of excluding from the
project the reconstruction of the Juticalpa-Catacamas road to release funds
for a comprehensive study of the Guayape Valley development and for the
construction of the feeder roads program that would emanate from such study.
The Decision Memorandum, issued on April 30, 1976, stated that it would not
be advisable to postpone reconstruction of the Juticalpa-Catacamas road in
order to have funds for feeder roads since the logical first step in
improving the Guayape Valley roads was to reconstruct the Juticalpa-Catacamas
road. Thus, reconstruction of the road was retained in the project, although
loan funds were also allocated for a study of the development of the Guayape
Valley. Loan negotiations took place in October 1976; the loans, amounting
to US$35.0 million (US$7 million on Third Window Terms and US$28 million on
Standard Terms), were approved by the Executive Directors on November 23,
1976 and became effective on May 20, 1977.
2.03      The components of the project and their estimated costs as given in
the Appraisal Report, are shown in the tabulation on the next page.
III. PROJECT EXECUTION
Civil Works
3.01       Invitations for prequalification of contractors were issued in
August, 1976, following Bank guidelines on procurement. Nineteen firms (one
local, 18 foreign) were prequalified and, on December 23, 1976, SECOPT issued
the invitations to submit bids for one or more of the four sections into
which the project road had been subdivided. Contracts were awarded as
follows:
(a) Section II 1/, Talanga-Guaimaca (33.1 km), to a French-Honduran
joint venture;
(b) Sections III and IV, Guaimaca-Rio Guayape (33.9 km) and Rio
Guayape-Juticalpa (47.0 km), to a US contractor; and
(c) Section V, Jutlcalpa-Catacamas (38.3 km) to an Italian firm.
1/ Section I was the Tegucigalpa-Talanga road financed under the Sixth
Highway Project.

3.02      Although the Italian firm was the lowest bidder for Section II, the
contract, with the Bank's concurrence, was awarded to the French-Honduran
joint venture to give an opportunity to new companies to establish themselves
in the country. The basic value of contracts awarded for civil works was
about US$28.0 million, 10% below the appraisal estimate of US$31.0 million
(excluding contingencies).
3.03      The reconstruction of the Talanga-Guaimaca Road (Section II) began
in September 1977 and thereafter proceeded ahead of schedule. In February
1978, a Bank mission found that, over a 10-km road section, works were

figures.

proceeding on a revised alignment that was about 3 km longer than the
original design, necessitating the construction of a new bridge 54 m long.
The change was initiated without prior consultation with the Bank. Although
the new alignment provided somewhat better geometrics, the Bank did not fully
accept the Governments's arguments for the change and did not agree to the
financing of the cost of the new bridge from the proceeds of the Loan. The
design and construction of the bridge were therefore financed from the
Government's own resources. The Talanga-Guaimaca road section was
successfully completed in May 1979 at a total cost of US$6.1 million--about
US$184,000 per km--and the quality of works was considered good. Immediately
after the completion of works, the French partner of the joint venture
submitted claims totaling about US$1.1 million as compensation for costs
incurred because of the shortage of fuel in the country during the
construction period and the execution of works not covered by the contract;
the supervision consultants had not approved these extra works, which were
not part of the design. The Directorate General for Roads (DGC) did not
accept these claims. Following this refusal, the French partner of the civil
venture inititated arbitration procedures through the International Chamber
of Commerce in Paris. Although the Government reiterated its refusal of the
claims to the appointed arbitrator, the case still has not been resolved.3/
3.04      Works on the Guaimaca-Rio Guayape road (Section III) were
satisfactorily completed in September 1979 at a total cost of US$8.7 million,
or about US$250,000 per km.    After the completion of works on Section III,
the US contractor encountered financial difficulties, causing delays in the
implementation of works on the Rio Guayape-Juticalpa road (Section IV). The
firm stopped work in March 1981, and the contractor's insurer assumed the
responsibility for carrying out the contracted works through subcontractors.
This road section was expected to be completed by early 1983, but, because of
a shortage of bitumen coupled with some financial and organizational problems
of the subcontractors, it was completed in December, 1983. The Government
invoked the penalty clause for late completion. Total cost of the
Rio-Guayape-Juticalpa road was US$13.8 million, or US$241,000 per km.3/
3.05      Construction of Section V (Juticalpa-Catacamas) by the Italian firm
was carried out on schedule and completed by the end of 1980 at a total cost
of US$8.4 million, or about US$221,000 per km. In early 1978, a Bank mission
found that SECOPT had upgraded the design standards to make them homogeneous
with those for the Talanga-Juticalpa section. The changes in standards,
introduced without prior consultation with the Bank, were based on a sub-
stantial increase in traffic volumes with respect to appraisal estimates.
The Bank, based on what SECOPT submitted, post-facto, accepted the changes,
and the Loan Agreement was amended accordingly. After completion of works in
1982, the contractor submitted claims to the Government for about US$2.0 mil-
lion, alleging increased costs because of the execution of works not covered
by the contract and higher-than-expected labor costs. Part of these claims
was accepted by the Government but not made effective because the contractor
didnot submit required evidence.
3.06      The supervision of the civil works was carried out by a joint
venture of Honduran, Nicaraguan and Costa Rican firms. During the early
3/ See the Borrower's comment on this paragraph (Annex I).

stages of project implementation, its performance was hampered by inadequate
coordination between the Project Unit, the DGC and the supervisory group,
leading to an excessive turnover of personnel within this group. These
shortcomings resulted in decisions being taken without a clear definition of
who was responsible for monitoring compliance with Bank procedures. As a
result, Bank approval was not solicited by the Government regarding changes
in civil works (paras 3.03 and 3.05). During 1979, SECOPT undertook the
improvement of supervision and of the Project Unit including a substantial
change in staff, and the clear definition of the functions and
responsibilities of each of the above-mentioned groups. These actions
improved the consultants' performance, which was generally adequate. The
estimated total cost of supervision (US$3.3 million) was 32% above the
appraisal estimate and represents 10% of the cost of the civil works. The
cost overrun was caused by delays in the completion of the civil works, which
necessitated a two and a half years extension of the consultants' services.
3.07      Exceptionally heavy rains during August and September of 1979
caused serious damage and landslides on all sections of the Tegucigalpa-
Catacamas road. Some repairs were carried out by contract on a cost-plus fee
nasis by the US contractor for Sections III and IV. However, based on
further assessment of the condition of the road, the Bank and SECOPT
concluded that, in order to prevent possible serious deterioration,
additional repair and maintenance works along the Tegucigalpa-Catacamas road
should be included in the project. Initially, SECOPT proposed, and the Bank
agreed, to award the contract for the repairs to the US contractor, but, in
view of the firms's financial problems, the contract for an amount of US$1.36
million was awarded to a local contractor following local competitive bidding
procedures acceptable to the Bank. Works were completed by November 1983. A
local firm was retained for the supervision of the repair works at a total
cost of US$187,000. This amount represents 14% of the civil works, which is
adequate. In general, there is a minimum supervision effort that is required
regardless of the size of the civil works. Therefore, for small projects,
the cost of supervision represents a higher proportion of the cost of civil
works.
3.08      Because of the lower-than-expected costs of civil works
(para 3.02), loan funds became available for other uses. Early in 1980,
SECOPT proposed, and the Bank agreed, to use uncommitted loan funds for the
construction of three access roads connecting the main road and the towns of
Campamento (2.17 km), Juticalpa (3.17 km) and Catacamas (1.29 km).     The Bank
initially asked SECOPT to request proposals from the US and the Italian
contractors responsible for Sections IV and V respectively for carrying out
these works; however, since the Italian firm had barely enough equipment to
complete its section of the main road, the contracts were signed with the US
firm. Construction of the access roads to Campamento and Juticalpa stopped
in March 1981 because of the financial difficulties of the contractor, when
works were about 30% complete. At that time, construction of the access road
to Catacamas had not yet started. The contractor's insurance company also
took over these projects, which were completed by the end of June 1983, at an
estimated total cost of US$1.4 million (about US$210,000 per km).



- 6 -
3.09      In December 1980, SECOPT proposed the construction a 6.05-km road
between Catacamas and ENA (Escuela Nacional de Agricultura). The Bank, after
reviewing the feasibility study report, approved the inclusion of this road
in the project. Following local bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank, a
contract was signed in October 1982.     Works were completed satisfactorily in
November, 1983 at a total cost of US$1.06 million (about US$175,000 per km).
A local firm was retained for the supervision of this element of the
project. Total cost of supervision was US$159,000, or 15% of the civil
works.
3.10      Table 1 summarizes information regarding the cost per km of the
different roads included in the project. Appraisal estimates of the cost per
km of the Talanga-Juticalpa road were excessive. Although the substantial
repairs that had to be carried out after the heavy rains of 1979 (para 3.07)
were naturally not envisaged at the time of appraisal, final costs are still
below appraisal estimates. The repair costs have been mostly concentrated on
the Guaimaca-Juticalpa section, raising its cost substantially above the cost
per km of the Talanga-Guaimaca section.
Transport Planning
3.11      The Bank, under the technical assistance component of Loan 896-HO,
financed a transport planning study which was carried out by US consultants.
The study, completed in late 1976, laid the groundwork and provided the basic
data needed to prepare a Highway Master Plan under the project. The same
consultants were retained to develop the Plan, which was satisfactorily
completed at the end of 1977. Under the Plan, covering in detail the
1978-1982 period, priority was given to small scale improvements of the trunk
network, with special attention to deferred maintenance and to the
construction of secondary and low standard feeder roads to serve agricultural
areas. The priorities identified under the plan served as the basis for
defining the Eighth Highway Project.
3.12      Loan funds were also used to extend the consultants' services
initiated under the Sixth Highway Project in the area of training staff of
two offices within SECOPT (the General Directorate for Transport and the
Sectoral Planning Office). The consultants' report emphasized that qualified
staff, as well as a sustained planning effort, would be required by SECOPT
for the successful implementation of the Plan. In view of this
consideration, and also recognizing institutional weaknesses within SECOPT,
the Bank agreed to the use of about US$100,000 of loan funds to hire an
experienced Honduran transport economist for a three-year period. Despite
these efforts, improvements in planning capabilities were not adequately
incorporated within SECOPT's institutional structure. Most of the
difficulties can be attributed to lack of qualified staff.4/ The total cost
of the transport planning element of the project, including the hiring of the
local economist, was about US$522,000, as compared with the appraisal
estimate of US$475,000.
4/ The Borrower attributes the difficulties to the provision of technical
assitance to separate departments within SECOPT, instead of focusing on a
coordinated planning unit.



Purchase of Maintenance, Workshop and Laboratory Equipment
3.13      The loan included funds for the purchase of the most urgently
needed maintenance, workshop and laboratory equipment through international
competitive bidding. By early 1980, the procurement of maintenance
equipment and spare parts, as originally envisaged, had been completed.
However, the exclusion from the project of the Telica Dam Study (para 3.15)
freed loan funds which, at the Government's request, were reallocated to the
purchase of additional maintenance equipment and spare parts. Deliveries are
expected to be completed in 1984; the total cost of this component is
US$3.3 million.
3.14      For the purchase of workshop and laboratory equipment, Section
4 (b) of the Loan Agreement states that no disbursement would be made until
SECOPT had provided facilities, satisfactory to the Bank, for the installa-
tion of the equipment. To this effect, the Borrower undertook to build a
laboratory and a workshop in San Pedro Sula and to improve the existing
laboratory in Tegucigalpa. The works proceeded extremely slowly because of
managerial problems, shortage of funds and inadequate design of the San Pedro
Sula workshop, which required substantial revisions to make it functional.
The necessary installations became operational between mid-1982 and early
1983. The Bank, aware of the time-consuming process of equipment procurement
in Honduras, agreed that the invitation to bid for the equipment might take
place before the buildings were completed, reconfirming, at the same time,
the above-mentioned condition for disbursement. Procurement of workshop
equipment has been completed at a total cost of about US$569,000, while
procurement of laboratory equipment was completed by December 1983 at a cost
of about US$293,000.
Telica Dam Study
3.15 The original Loan Agreement included funds for a study of the inte-
grated development program of the Guayape Valley. In mid-1978, the Bank was
informed that the Canadian International Development Association (CIDA) had
made a formal proposal for carrying out the study. The proposal was
accepted, and the US$500,000 allocated for that purpose became available for
other uses. In July 1979, SECOPT proposed, and the Bank agreed, to use
US$100,000 of those funds for the engineering studies of the Catacamas-Culmi
road. By the end of 1979, after lengthy debates, the Bank agreed with the
Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) on the use of the remaining funds for a
study of the Telica Dam site in the Guayape region with the purpose of
investigating its potential for irrigation, domestic water supply, flood
control and hydropower development.     The Loan Agreement was modified
accordingly. A Bank Agricultural Division, in charge of this component,
agreed, in mid-1980, to MNR's selection of a French-Honduran consulting firm
for carrying out the study. The consultants' proposal included a foreign
exchange requirement of US$720,000, which was made available under Category
5 (a) of the revised allocation of proceeds of the Loan. However, since the
study was never started, the Bank informed the Borrower, in November 1982,
that, since it was clear that the study could not be completed before the
loan's closing date, the Bank would no longer consider its financing under

the Project. The Bank recommended, and the Borrower agreed to, a realloca-
tion of the loan proceeds to finance much needed equipment and spare parts
for its highway maintenance program.
Labor Intensive Road Construction Program
3.16      In February 1976, the Bank agreed to a Government proposal to
promote the development of labor-intensive technology for low volume feeder
road construction and maintenance. To support the launching of the labor-
based construction program, a two-year, US$400,000 technical assistance
scheme was established, financed in equal parts by the Government of Honduras
and by the Bank's research program for appropriate construction technol-
ogies. The scheme was initiated in March 1976 with the arrival in
Tegucigalpa of the German consultants who, working with Honduran public
sector engineers and economists in a newly created "Feeder Roads Unit,"
provided assistance to develop the organization and methods of road
selection, construction, supervision and administration, suitable to labor-
intensive techniques. The program soon gained substantial local acceptance,
and about 150 km of roads were built between 1976 and 1978. In January 1978,
the Ministry transformed the Feeder Roads Unit into a "Department of
Labor-Intensive Construction" within DGV. Since the contract for consultant
services was to expire in September 1978, the Government, in May 1978,
proposed to the Bank the extension of the program for an additional two-year
period with financing for extension of the consultant services and
acquisition of equipment, using the surplus funds that resulted from highway
construction cost savings due to both lower-than-expected base costs and
lower incidence of cost escalation.    The Bank agreed, and the second part of
the program was included in the project in September 1978. The Loan
Agreement was changed accordingly, and the proceeds of the loan were revised
to allocate US$1.0 million to the program.    A Final Report issued by the
consultants points out that the work performed under the 1976-1980
Labor-Intensive Road Construction Program resulted in the construction or
improvement of over 330 km of all-weather rural access roads to the Honduran
network. The program, now also covering the maintenance of rural roads, is
proceeding well, funded by its own resources as well as by several bi-lateral
and multi-lateral agencies.
Technical Assistance to the Directorate General for Roads (DGC)
3.17      In November 1980, a German firm was selected to carry out this
technical assistance which included, inter-alia, a study of DGC's Human
Resources and Institutional Improvements, especially the organization and
equipment of laboratories. The training aspects of the technical assistance
were scheduled to take place after the laboratory buildings were completed
and the new equipment installed. However, because of slow progress on the
laboratory constructions and shortages of training supplies, the training
program, conducted in May and June of 1980, suffered from inadequate
facilities, equipment and textbooks.5/ Two practical courses on Soils and
Materials Mechanics were offered to Taboratory engineers and assistants. The
consultants' final report of August 1980 contains recommendations regarding
training of laboratory personnel in the aspects of organization, planning and

laboratory constructions and shortages of training supplies, the training
program, conducted in May and June of 1980, suffered from inadequate
facilities, equipment and textbooks.5/ Two practical courses on Soils and
Materials Mechanics were offered to Taboratory engineers and assistants. The
consultants' final report of August 1980 contains recommendations regarding
training of laboratory personnel in the aspects of organization, planning and

and supply shortages.



control of road construction which SECOPT is endeavoring to carry out. To
this effect, an experienced local engineer has been appointed as Chief of the
Geotechnical Department and is currently implementing the consultants'
recommendations. The cost of this component was US$116,000.
3.18      Also, under the training program, SECOPT reached an agreement with
the Mexican Secretariat of Public Works (SAHOP) to send four laboratory
technicians to Mexico, with transportation and cost-of-living expenses paid
from loan proceeds. The trainees attended a special six-month (April/
September 1981) course at a total cost of about US$17,000.
Technical Assistance for the Directorate General for Road and Airport
Maintenance (DGMCA)
3.19      This technical assistance was carried out by the consultants (US)
between May 1978 and November 1980. Its main objective was to design and
introduce a system for road maintenance and equipment management for at least
one year in a Pilot District before extending the system at the national
level. Periodic meetings and lectures chaired by the consultants were carried
out to implement and test new management procedures. In addition, 18 members
of the DGMCA, comprising engineers, administrators and executives, made one-
week training trips to the United States to observe the implementation of
road maintenance and equipment management systems in several districts of the
states of Maryland and New Mexico.
3.20      The first program was completed satisfactorily but, when the system
was considered suitable for implementation at the national level, the
consultants were asked by SECOPT to postpone its introduction to other
districts and to concentrate on studies required for the preparation of the
Eighth Highway Project. This postponement resulted in the extension of the
contract by four months. Furthermore, because of the delay in the
preparation of the contract for the continuation of the consultants' services
under the Eighth Project, SECOPT requested a new three-month extension, which
was agreed by the Bank, to ensure the continuity of this technical
assistance.
3.21      A final report, presented by the consultants in June 1981, lists
the objectives partially achieved under the Seventh Highway Project and
expected to be consolidated under the ongoing Eighth Highway Project. Among
them:
(a) the implementation of a new system for maintenance and equip-
ment administration comprising the programing, execution,
control and evaluation of the work performed;
(b) the simplification of data collection and field reports;
(c) the study of a new costing system;
(d) the centralization of data to be used as a management tool;
and



- l1O -
(e) the reduction of the delays experienced in the procurement of
spare parts with the creation of an office of the Proveeduria de
la Republica (Central Procurement Office) attached to DGMCA.
3.22      The final cost of the technical assistance to DGMCA was about
US$694,000, which, added to the cost of the technical assistance to DGC and
to the scholarship program (paras 3.17 and 3.18), represents a total cost of
about US$827,000, 74% above the appraisal estimate of US$475,000. This
substantial increase in cost is mostly due to the extension of the scope and
duration of the work by the US consultants (paras 3.19 and 3.20).
Technical Assistance to the Construction Industry
3.23      In compliance with Section 3.04 of the Loan Agreement, the
Borrower, in November 1977, signed an agreement with the Honduran Chamber of
Construction Industry for assisting in the carrying out of an aid program to
the local construction industry. German consultants were selected to provide
this technical assistance, and the contract was signed in August 1979. A
consultants' report identified the most serious physical and financial
bottlenecks faced by the industry and made specific recommendations leading
to increasing the predictability of future work and the availability of
timely credit supply. However, the technical assistance to the construction
industry that should have emanated from the consultants' study was not
carried out. The report is presently being reviewed by the Honduran Chamber
of Construction Industry and SECOPT. Their recommendations will be discussed
with the Honduran Government in the near future since Loan 1901-HO estab-
lishes the obligation of the Borrower to act on the report's recommenda-
tions. The total cost of this project component was US$226,000, 64% above
the appraisal estimate of US$138,000.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.01      A comparison between appraisal and final cost estimates (including
contingencies) is shown in Table 2. The final cost of the original project
items which remained in the project is currently estimated at about US$44.0
million, including normal contingency allowances, some US$7.2 million (14%)
less than the appraisal estimate.     The remaining funds were used for new
project elements (Labor Intensive Road Construction Program, access roads,
etc.) or for increasing the scope of the original ones. Bank participation
remained at 68% of the total project cost, as estimated during the appraisal.
4.02      Disbursements lagged considerably behind appraisal estimates during
the first year-and-a-half of project implementation, as shown in the
following tabulation. A four-month delay in starting the construction of the
Talanga-Juticalpa road, indecision on the use of the Guayape Study funds,
delays caused by a contractor's financial problems, and additional procure-
ment of maintenance equipment and civil works also contributed to the dis-
bursement delays. The acceleration of disbursements in 1979 reflects the
on-schedule completion of most of the project's original civil works, by far
the largest element of the project.

4.04      The original Closing Date, December 31, 1981, was extended twice
first to June 30, 1983 and finally to December 31, 1983.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01      The upgrading of the gravel Talanga-Catacamas road was justified at
appraisal on the basis of quantifiable benefits accruing to road users mainly
from reduced vehicle operating costs which would result from improvements in
road design and surface characteristics and from a 13.2-km shortening of the
Talanga-Juticalpa Section.
5.02      The economic reevaluation of the project road was based on a
methodology similar to the one used at appraisal. However, certain
assumptions have been modified, as follows:
(a) Savings in Maintenance Costs
The appraisal estimated that the difference in maintenance
expenditures for the "with" and "without" project cases would
result in a net additional economic cost for the project.
However, given the present level of traffic (about 700 vehicles
per day), an assumption of net savings from reduced maintenance
costs seems more realistic. Since the results of the economic
analysis were not sensitive to different assumptions about
maintenance costs, they were ignored in the economic
reevaluation.
(b) Projected Traffic Growth
Projected traffic growth at the time of the appraisal was
heavily based on the possible development of the forest
industry in the Olancho region, which was expected to be
limited by a rapid rate of exhaustion of resources. Therefore,
the appraisal projected a conservative average annual traffic
growth rate of 5% for the first ten years of the lifetime of
the project and 4% thereafter, although the historical traffic
growth rate in the years preceding the appraisal had been about
8% p.a. Traffic counts carried out by SECOPT in March 1983
show that actual traffic levels in the Talanga-Juticalpa and
the Juticalpa-Catacamas road section are 13% and 7%, respec-
tively, above those expected at appraisal for that year. This
higher-than-expected traffic is explained by the development
taking place in the several valleys in the area of influence of
the project road. Therefore, in spite of the modest growth of
the forest industry, the economic reevaluation has been based
on a projected annual traffic growth of 6% for the first 10
years of the project and 5% thereafter.



- 13 -
5.03      The ex-post economic evaluation yielded estimated economic rates of
return (ERR) of 21% for the Talanga-Juticalpa road and 12% for the Juticalpa-
Catacamas road, versus the 16% and 11% respectively estimated at appraisal.
The substantial difference in the ex-ante and ex-post ERR for the Talanga-
Juticalpa road is due to an actual and projected traffic growth above that
estimated at appraisal and to a final cost of construction 16% below the
appraisal estimate 7/.   In the case of the Juticalpa-Catacamas road, the
extra benefits brought about by the higher traffic growth were mostly offset
by a real cost of construction 23% above that envisaged at the time of
appraisal. This cost increase was due to the adoption of a higher design
standard than that agreed at appraisal (para 3.05).
VI. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
6.01      The performance of the Borrower, except for the changes in road
designs initiated without previous consultation with the Bank, can be
considered as generally satisfactory. Regarding the contractors' claims, the
Borrower is reviewing their different elements and is prepared to satisfy
those claims found justified. Following are the major covenants and the
Borrower's efforts to comply.
6.02       "Section 3.08 (a).  Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the
Borrower shall: not later than June 30, 1977, submit to the bank a detailed
plan setting forth the action to be taken by the Borrower, including, without
limitation, the provision of adequate incentives, in order to recruit and
retain the services of qualified personnel for DGC and DGMCA."
The covenant was partially fulfilled. After several postponements
of the deadline to submit the above mentioned plan, the Bank sent,
in July 1979, a consultant to assist SECOPT in this matter (the
cost of these services did not come from loan proceeds). As an
interim solution to the implementation of the Plan's recommenda-
tions, the Government strengthened SECOPT's capabilities by con-
tracting advisors at salaries higher than the civil service scale.
6.03       Section 4.03 (a). The Borrower shall: (i) cause all national roads
of the Borrower to be adequately maintained and cause all necessary repairs
thereof to be made, all in accordance with sound engineering practices;
(ii) cause all maintenance equipment of the Borrower to be adequately
maintained and cause all necessary repairs and renewals thereof to be made,
all in accordance with sound engineering practice; (iii) cause existing
repair workshops to be adequately maintained, particularly by improving, not
later than December 31, 1977 and in manner satisfactory to the Bank, the
equipment repair and laboratory facilities at Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula
7/ The comparison between actual and appraisal estimated costs (including
contingencies) was made in constant 1982 prices.



- 14 -
(including disposal of obsolete equipment presently stockpiled therein); and
(iv) provide, promptly as needed, the funds, facilities, services and other
resources required for the foregoing."
The Borrower partially complied with the preceding covenant.
Compliance with item (i) is expected to improve after the equipment
financed under the Seventh and Eighth Highway Projects is in
operation. The continuation under the Eighth Highway Project of
the technical assistance in this area is also expected to
strengthen the capabilities of DGMCA and improve maintenance
operations. Compliance with item (ii) is also expected under the
Eighth Highway Project. Regarding item (iii), the San Pedro Sula
laboratory, the Tegucigalpa workshop, the San Pedro Sula workshop
and the Tegucigalpa laboratory are operational. Some equipment
remains to be delivered by the supplier to the San Pedro Sula
laboratory. The delay in complying with item (iii) was mainly the
result of temporary lack of compliance with item (iv).
6.04       "Section 4.03 (b) (i). The Borrower shall take all necessary action
to: not later than June 30, 1977 or such date as shall be acceptable to the
Bank, cause the dimensions and weights of the vehicles using the national
roads of the Borrower to be kept within the limits provided by the laws and
regulations of the Borrower."
SECOPT complied well in advance with the preceding covenant.
Enforcement of maximum weights and dimensions of vehicles started
on January 6, 1977, and the program is being continued success-
fully. Currently there are 13 weighing stations in operation.
VII. ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01      The Bank was significantly involved in project identification and
preparation by inclusion of feasibility studies under the preceding Sixth
Highway Project and by participation in review of subsequent designs and
studies which were financed by others. The scope and size of this, the
Seventh Highway Project, were within SECOPT's administrative capabilities.
The original implementation schedule was reasonable, but additional works and
procurement of equipment described in preceding chapters delayed completion
beyond the originally envisaged date.
7.02      The Bank, during project implementation, showed the necessary
flexibility to reassign funds released by the lower-than-expected civil works
costs and by the deletion from the project of the Guayape Valley Study. At
the same time, in the case of the changes in road design standards and
alignments initiated by the Borrower without prior consultation, the Bank's
response was adequately firm. The Bank accepted those changes that were
justified, as well as part of the already started realignment for which
substantial costs had already been incurred. However, it refused to finance
a new bridge, leaving to the Borrower the responsibility of bearing most of
the cost of the Government's decision.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The Seventh Highway Project was successful in achieving its main
objective of completing the second tranche of the Tegucigalpa-Catacamas
highway, with an estimated rate of return above that expected at appraisal.
In addition, the well chosen technical assistance elements resulted in some
improvements in the area of road maintenance and transport planning which are
expected to continue under the Eighth Highway Project. However, because of
the Borrower's financial and staffing constraints, planning efforts, namely
the updating of the Highway Master Plan completed under the project, were not
pursued. The Government was committed, under the Eighth Highway Project, to
update the Plan, using its own resources. Because of financial constraints,
the Government requested that surplus funds from the Seventh Highway Project
be reallocated to finance the updating of the Plan. The Bank did not agree
to this request, but waived the Borrower's obligation to update the Plan
under the Eighth Highway Project. In the case of the implementation of a
maintenance system at national level, results continue to be below expecta-
tions, with budgetary constraints and delays in equipment and spare parts
procurement contributing to the slow pace of achievement in this area.
8.02      There are several lessons to be learned from this project:
(a) One particular lesson can be learned from the fact that
appraisals of the last three Highway Projects in Honduras
substantially overestimated the cost of civil works. This
pattern suggests that, in the future, the Bank should examine
cost estimates in Honduras more carefully in order to improve
the planning process of resource allocations.
(b) In addition, future Bank project supervision should give more
emphasis to the institution-building aspects of its technical
assistance components. The Seventh Highway Project had, as the
main objective of its transport planning element, the prepara-
tion of a Highway Master Plan. However, the plan, by itself,
becomes a temporary tool if the planning agency does not
develop the necessary capabilities to monitor and update it in
a continuous and systematic way. Although the project
marginally provided for such needs, supervision efforts focused
on the civil works component and did not pay early attention to
the detrimental effects that the lack of coordination of the
project executing units of the different lending agencies were
having on the technical assistance for planning.
(c) Another lesson to be learned from this project refers to the
difficulties inherent in establishing an efficient road
maintenance system in countries greatly lacking in staff and
facilities. The Bank should be less optimistic in this area,



- 16 -
realizing that the development of such a system is a slow and
tortuous process that can be achieved only over a longer term.
In addition, the Bank should consider the possibility, in
future projects, of reducing the emphasis on the implementation
of over-sophisticated management information systems. The
focus, as a first step, should be on developing, from the
in-place system, high standard field work together with simple
forms for reporting inputs so that physical targets and costs
can be readily controlled and that realistic planning and
budgeting can be carried out.     The introduction of such
improvements should be preceded by some measure of success in
training the necessary local staff.
(d) A final lesson can be derived from the implementation of the
Labor-Intensive Program for road construction in Honduras. The
success of the program, coupled with the substantial
institution-building that accompanied it, indicates that the
Bank should continue with its efforts to identify and implement
appropriate technologies in labor-abundant countries.

Dear Sir:
As requested we are intorming you of our agreement with the
contents of the Project Completion Report (for Loans 1341/1342-HO); we attach
below certain suggestions which we feel are appropriate, though we leave it
to your judgement as to whether to include them or not.

claim to the DGC.
- paragraph 4, line 6: change the length of the road built between
Catacamas and the Escuela Nacional de Agricultura from 6.6 km to 6.05 km.
- Comment: no reference is made to the project to correct the
other deficiencies of the Tegucigalpa-Catacamas highway.
Page vi, paragraph 2, line 1: replace "Direccion General de
Carreteras" by "Direccion General de Caminos."
Page 1, Introduction, paragraph 1.01, line 11: replace 1,610 by
"1,716 are paved."
Paragraph 2.02.
- Line 10: it would improve the report to say "reconstruction of
the Juticalpa-Catacamas road."
- Line 13: it would be better to say "the decision to reconstruct
the road was retained."
1/T.N.   The report does not use the word "sued," but the distinction
intended in this comment makes little sense unless translated in
this way. In any event, the writer's comment applies only to the
Spanish version.

Paragraph 3.01. It is suggested that the, paragraph be written as
follows:
"Invitations for prequalifioation of contractors were issued in
August 1976 in accordance with the World Bank guidelines on procurement
included in the Loan Agreement. Nineteen construction firms were
prequalified among which were one Honduran company seso4.ated with a foreign
company.
On December 20, 1976 the Secretariat in a written communication
informed the prequalified firms (regarding) their participation in one or
more of the four sections into which the project had been subdivided. On
December 23, the invitation to bid was published in the largest daily
Honduran newspapers. Contracts were awarded as follows:
(a) Section II, Talanga-Guaimaca (33.1 km) to a French-Honduran
company;
(b) Sections III and IV, Guaimaca-Rio Guayape (33.9 km) and Rio
Guayape-Juticalpa (47 km) to a U.S. contractor; and
(c) Section V, Juticalpa-Catacamas (38.32 km) to an Italian firm."
Paragraph 3.03.
- Line 2: replace October by September.
- Line 7: change 55 m to 54 m.
Page 5, paragraph 3.03. It is suggested that the (remainder of
the) paragraph read as follows:
"...French partner in the joint venture presented claims for a
total of about US$1.1 million as oompensation for additional costs
incurred in executing the work, which according to the contractor
should have been recognized by the Government in addition to the
unit prices established in the contract. SECOPT having consulted
the DGC and the consultants did not accept these claims; following
this refusal.... in Paris. The position of the Honduran Government
was to refuse arbitration on the basis that the claim was presented
by only one of the partners in the joint venture."
Paragraph 3.04, line 8: change text to:
... using subcontractors. It was expected that the remaining work
would be completed by early 1983 but because of the financial
problems of the insurer and the organizational problems of the
subcontractors the work was only completed in December 1983. The
Government invoked the penalty clause for late completion.

The total cost of the Rio Guayape-Juticalpa section and access
roads (para. 3.08) was US$13.08 million, or US$241,000 per km."
Paragraph 3.05, line 12. Change text to:
"... works in 1982, the contractor subnitted clai,na to the DGC for
approximately US$2 million, alleging increased costs resulting from
execution of works. Part of these claims was accepted by DGC but
was not settled before the due date because the contractor did not
present the necessary supporting documents."
Paragraph 3.06. It is suggested that the start of paragraph be
changed as follows:
"The supervision of the civil works was carried out b} a -onsortium
of Central American firms consisting of one company each irom
Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. During the early stages of
project implementation, its performance was hampered by inadequate
coordination between the Project Unit, the DGC and the supervisory
group, leading to an excessive turnover of personnel within this
group. These shortcomings..."
Ibid., page 6, line 2.    Change text to "...undertook the
improvement of supervision and of the Project Unit, including a substantial
change..."

of the consultants' services, which represented an increase of 63% in the
original period of services."
Paragraph 3.07
- Line 2. Change to: "... caused serious damage and destruction
on various sections of the Tegucigalpa-Catacamas road."
-  Line 8.  Change text to:   ... repairs and maintenance on the

for the supervision of the repair works at a final cost of US$182,000."

completed in December 1983 at a final cost of US$1.4 million (about
US$210,000 per km)."

Paragraph 3.12.
- Line 3. Change text to: "...training staff of the two
departments within SECOPT (the General Directorate for Transport and the
General Directorate of Sectoral Planning)."
Ibid., page 8, line 2. It is suggested that the paragraphs be
divided at this point and the text changed to:
"Part of the difficulties in the transport planning component of
the project can be attributed to the use of separate consulting
services instead of focusing on a coordinated planning unit. The
total cost of the planning element, including the hiring of a local
economist, was US$522,000 as compared with the appraisal estimate
of US$475,000.

Paragraph 3.16, line 18. Change to: "...withing DGV given that
the final contract..."
Ibid., page 9, line 1. Change to: "...the consultant services and
acquisition of equipment for this program, using the surplus funds that
resulted from highway construction cost savings due to lower-than-expected
base costs and the effects of a reduction in cost increases. The Bank..."
Paragraph 3.17.
- Line 8. Change to: "...equipment installed. Owing to delays
in the contracting of consultants and the supply shortages, the training
program

2/        In English both words mean "surplus."
3/        In the English version "project" cannot be made plural but in the
Spanish text the change should be made if more than one project is
involved.
