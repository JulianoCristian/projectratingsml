          National Power Corporation (NPC) for the Bicol Power\n            Restoration Project (BPRP). The projects objective is to\n            support the stabilization of power supply in the Bicol\n            region by replacing or repairing critical electricity\n            transmission infrastructure damaged by typhoons in 2006. The\n            projects components: (i) restoration; and (ii) initial\n            preparedness. The Bank's strategy for emergency support\n            is to support financing of critical assets of investments in\n            the power transmission system serving the Bicol region, thus\n            assisting in the removal of infrastructure constraints to\n            the region's economic development. The projects\n            financial plan for provision has been made for a 10 percent\n            contingency to ensure that there should be some funds\n            available in case of further emergencies or cost overrun.\n            The Implementing Agency for the project, TransCo, is a\n            government- owned and controlled corporation, created in\n            2000. The appraisal activities applicable to the project are\n            ; (i) a review of lessons learned from past projects and\n            their incorporation in project design; (ii) economic\n            analysis of the financed investments; (iii) assessment of\n            the institutional capability of TransCo to manage the\n            project; and (iv) evaluation of environmental and social safeguards."}, "docdt": "2008-01-11T00:00:00Z"}
