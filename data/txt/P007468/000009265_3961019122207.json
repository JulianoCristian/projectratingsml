The objectives of the project were: (i)\n            to sustain production and increase efficiency at the\n            Clarendon plant; (ii) to improve environmental conditions\n            related to its operations; (iii) to help establish the\n            holding company (CAP) as an effective joint venture partner;\n            and (iv) to support sound sectoral policy. The Bank's\n            performance in project preparation and design was highly\n            satisfactory. The borrower's performance in project\n            preparation was highly satisfactory. The key lessons learned\n            from the project were as follows:  (i) while private\n            sector-driven mineral development is generally most\n            efficient, a situation can arise in which the interests of\n            investors conflict with the best interests of the economy;\n            (ii) a joint-venture between government and a private\n            investor can be an effective vehicle for industry or mining\n            operation, in the case where the government acts as a\n            responsible, commercial shareholder; (iii)  even though\n            initial objectives may prove to be unsustainable, financial\n            parameters would have been relevant tools to examine the\n            project's performance and examine measures to improve\n            it; and (iv) this project again demonstrates the importance\n            of being a low-cost producer in view of the price risks\n            involved for projects producing mineral commodities."}, "docdt": "1995-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
