                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to contribute to raising living standards and to reducing inequalities and regional disparities by improving access to
                         markets, job opportunities, infrastructure and social services for rural communities in Tocantins' poorest regions, while ensuring sustainable use of natural
                         resources and the protection of fragile ecosystems.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation has been satisfactory in the past ISR period. However, the impact of the international crisis on the State has negatively affected the State capacity to fully
                         overcome past delays in Project implementation.
