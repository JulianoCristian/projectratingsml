Some lessons learned included:\n            political cycles had a clear impact on the rhythm of\n            implementation of the Project. This challenge is amplified\n            in multi-sector operations given the larger number of\n            entities involved in implementation. To address this\n            challenge, Projects should try to limit the number of\n            entities, recognize the risk or factor in political\n            variables in Project design. Moreover, the distribution of\n            Bank and counterpart financing should take into account\n            incentives or disincentives at political levels, as was the\n            case under this operation, to ensure that activities with\n            lower political visibility are still undertaken in a timely\n            fashion. Although multiple institutions and stakeholders are\n            involved in multi-sector operations, projects should design\n            some degree of centralization under a unified Project\n            Implementation Unit to make complex operations more\n            manageable and expedite implementation, particularly to\n            facilitate multiple procurement processes. From the\n            Bank's perspective, these multi-sector operations that\n            involve numerous activities and procurement processes\n            inevitably rely on strengthened and intensified Bank\n            supervision. A long term lesson learned through past Bank\n            experiences in the State is the need to move beyond narrow\n            approaches to improving accessibility (focusing on trunk\n            infrastructure or isolated interventions on municipal\n            roads), and adopting a more integrated approach both\n            vertically, within the road network to link various road\n            levels to provide seamless logistics, and horizontally among\n            various other regional development requirements. This\n            'holistic' approach, which is inherently more\n            complex to implement, and to which the new proposed\n            operation is ultimately responding, relies on strong\n            coordination between the different Government levels,\n            ensuring that micro interventions at local level are\n            supplemented by investments undertaken at regional and\n            national level."}, "docdt": "2012-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
