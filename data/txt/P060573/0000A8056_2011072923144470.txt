                         markets, job opportunities, infrastructure and social services for rural communities in Tocantins' poorest regions, while ensuring sustainable use of natural
                         resources and the protection of fragile ecosystems.

                         While progress implementation has been slow over the past 6 months due to the rainy season and Government change, overall implementation is satisfactory with a loan fully
