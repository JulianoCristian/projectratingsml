      phase of the Government's structural adjustment program\n            which aims at reversing the economic decline of the country\n            and laying the foundation for sustainable growth over the\n            medium-term, while continuing to improve the balance of\n            payments and the public finance position. The second phase\n            is based on: (i) real producer income increases through\n            agricultural incentive reforms in order to expand production\n            of export crops, together with a liberalization of foodcrop\n            export, in order to give farmers access to regional markets;\n            (ii) an action program to raise foodcrop output through\n            upgraded extension services and improved input supply; (iii)\n            continued improvements in macroeconomic management,\n            particularly in public investment programming and execution\n            with primary emphasis on maintenance and rehabilitation of\n            existing assets; (iv) a public enterprise sector reform\n            through restructuring, privatization where possible, and\n            closure if necessary of the bulk of Government-owned\n            enterprises; and (v) preparation for an industrial promotion\n            policy as part of the continuing structural adjustment process."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
