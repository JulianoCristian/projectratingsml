and provide training for\n            civil servants and public sector personnel. Major components\n            include: (a) providing of classrooms, science facilities,\n            offices and site work for about 11 community junior\n            secondary schools, (b) constructing about 7 new community\n            junior secondary schools, (c) assisting about 7 youth\n            brigade centers and 9 agriculture brigades, (d) expanding\n            the facilities at the Botswana Training Center and the\n            Institute of Development Management, and (e) providing\n            technical assistance for specialist services in the Project\n            Implementation Unit. The project will help Botswana meet its\n            future work force requirements by expanding enrollments at\n            the junior secondary level and in institutions providing\n            vocational, civil service and management training. The\n            project's risk involve the adequate provision of junior\n            secondary school teachers, particularly in mathematics and\n            sciences, and possible difficulties in the formation and\n            operation of the agricultural brigades."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
