In close cooperation with, and assisted by the\n            Bank, the Government through its various entities played a\n            very positive role in the preparation of the project, even\n            if preparation did not always go into such details as would\n            be needed eventually for speedy project implementation. It\n            would appear that the one weakness of the Bank relative to\n            this project was in the project design. For the benefit of\n            future Bank projects in education in Botswana, it is to be\n            hoped that the close and intensive working relationship\n            between the Bank on the one hand, and the Government on the\n            other, could be maintained even under the auspices of the\n            re-organization of the Bank."}, "docdt": "1989-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
