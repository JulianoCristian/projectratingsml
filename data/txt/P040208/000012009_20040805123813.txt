3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

The objective of the Industrial Support Institutions Upgrading Project (the Project) was to put in place an
efficient and market-responsive system of agencies providing support to individual firms in various
industrial sectors, in particular, to those firms seeking to become more internationally competitive. In
particular, the project intended to improve the quality of services offered by existing sectoral technical
centers (STCs), to refocus STC activities toward assistance to private sector firms, to establish new STCs
for sectors not covered by existing STCs, and to establish a national metrology system to promote
improved quality of Tunisian exports and to reduce the costs to exporters of meeting European Union
standards. The target beneficiaries of the project were small- and medium-sized manufacturers that, while
forming a large percentage of Tunisian manufacturers, did not have the financial or managerial capacity to
make necessary technological improvements.

In the context of the re-orientation of the Tunisian economy toward the private sector and the opening of
the economy to global competition, the Government of Tunisia (GoT) sought to upgrade the
competitiveness of Tunisian industry through the Programme de Mise à Niveau (PMN), or the Industrial
Upgrading Program. This ongoing program consists of a series of measures aimed at upgrading the
productive and competitive efficiency of individual enterprises that request assistance, as well as at
reducing negative environmental impacts from industry through improvements in basic infrastructure and
technology.

Tunisian STCs prior to the Project did not play a facilitating role in manufacturing and industry. They had
a reputation as inefficient agencies, a burden to the industrialists they were supposed to serve, and an
instrument of government control on the activity of the firms in any given sector. Most enterprises reported
virtually no interaction with the majority of the STCs, and diagnostic studies demonstrated vast room for
improvement. In addition, virtually no metrology system existed in Tunisia; enterprises exporting goods
would perform metrology measurements abroad, at almost ten times the costs by which these services could
have been rendered locally.

The Project, therefore, aimed to promote the objectives of the PMN by (i) restructuring, upgrading, and
strengthening existing STCs; (ii) establishing new STCs for sectors not yet served; and (iii) establishing the
basis for a National Metrology System. In addition, as part of the strengthening and establishment of
STCs, the project would strengthen capacity for technical assistance to reduce industrial and manufacturing
impacts on the environment.

3.2 Revised Objective:

Not applicable.

3.3 Original Components:

The Project as designed had two main components:            assistance to the institutional development and
technical upgrading of sectoral technical centers, and establishment of a national metrology system.

Under the component to assist the institutional development and technical upgrading of STCs, the Project
planned to fund civil works, goods (equipment and vehicles), and technical assistance and training to (i)
upgrade four existing STCs; (ii) establish new STCs; and (iii) strengthen or develop STC advisory services

with respect to "clean" technologies and other changes that would reduce environmental impacts of
manufacturing and industry.

Assistance to existing STCs: Existing STCs that would receive assistance (in the form of on-lent funds
from the GoT that would be used to purchase equipment and consulting services) were the Centre National
du Cuir et de la Chaussure (CNCC), the Centre Technique des Matériaux de Construction de la
Céramique et du Verre (CTMCCV), the Centre Technique des Industries Mécanique et Electrique
(CETIME), and the Centre Technique du Textile (CETTEX). Equipment and consulting services were to
complement changes to the management structures of the STCs and their operational mandates in the
provision of technical assistance to manufacturers. The objective of such investments were to create
structure to support the marketing of STC activities, ensure technical upgrading and skills strengthening for
existing staff, introduce new management procedures, and set sales objectives for the services of the
centers. Total project funds allocated to this sub-component were FF 119.3 million (US$ 23.1 million
equivalent at that time), of which 82.6 million (US$ 16 million equivalent) was to be provided by the Loan.
Approximately half of this amount was for identified investments and activities; the remainder would be
available for activities that required additional funds or for new activities.

Establishment of new STCs: Funding for the establishment of new STCs was allocated through the
Project. The new STCs would be created with the same managerial and operational structures as the
restructured existing STCs, directed toward sectors that did not have existing STCs. Four centers were to
be created: the Centre Technique de la Chimie (CTC), for chemical industries, the Centre Technique du
Bois et de l'Ameublement (CETIBA) for wood and furniture, the Centre Technique de l'Agroalimentaire
(CTAA), for agroindustry, and the Centre Technique pour l'Emballage (PACKTEC), for packaging.
Total project funds allocated to the sub-component were FF 131.6 million (US$ 25.5 million equivalent), of
which FF 74.2 million (US$ 14.4 million) would be provided by the Loan. Funds were provided on a grant
basis to the new STCs.

Development of environmental advisory services. Finally, the STC component included funding for the
development of a new line of STC environmental advisory services, including in the area of information and
research on clean technologies, upstream waste minimization and reduction, economies in the use of raw
materials, energy, water, and chemical products and other substances in the production process, waste
recovery and recycling, training in environmental best practices, and environmental audits. Such services
would aim to improve compliance with national and international environmental and quality standards.
Project funds of FF 16.2 million (US$ 3.1 million equivalent) were allocated to the sub-component, FF 4.7
million (US$ 910,000 equivalent) from the Loan.

Establishment of a National Metrology System:                   The second Project component was the
establishment of a National Metrology System, whose objective was to upgrade national testing
and measurement facilities to international standards, thereby reducing testing costs of exporting
firms. A total of FF 53.9 million (US$ 10.4 million equivalent) was allocated to development of
metrology, of which FF 38.5 million (US$ 7.5 million equivalent) would be provided by the Loan.
Financing would be provided for civil works and equipment for laboratories.

3.4 Revised Components:

The project was restructured three times during its life.         In May 1999, a component focusing on
institutional reform and strengthening of the Agence de Promotion Industrielle (API) was added. This
component was appraised at approximately US$6 million equivalent.



                                                      - 3 -

Following the Mid-Term Review of the Project, it was agreed to reduce the allocation to the strengthening
of the existing STCs sub-component by half. This was a result of the relatively slow disbursement under
the identified activities under the sub-component, and the unlikelihood of additional activities or
participants requesting funds. In addition, the sub-component to develop environmental advisory services,
which had been non-performing, was dropped from the Project. Finally, Project funds which had been set
aside for potential emergency training needs resulting from delays in the provision of assistance from other
donors was also cancelled, due to lack of interest on the part of the Government of Tunisia to borrow from
IBRD for technical assistance. In total, FF 48 Million (US$6.3 million equivalent) was canceled at that
time (late 2000).     In April, 2003, an additional Euro 3.47 million (US$3.7 million equivalent) was
cancelled.

Note that the closing date of the Project was extended from December 31, 2002 to December 31,
2003. This extension was to accommodate the procurement of equipment to the STCs that would
complete material needs for STC strengthening. The Bank and the GoT agreed that institutional
measures ­ completion of surveys to monitor STC progress, continued actions to establish a
National Metrology System, and institutional development of the STCs ­ would continue.

3.5 Quality at Entry:

This ICR rates the Quality at Entry of the Project as unsatisfactory. An earlier review by QAG rated
Quality at Entry as satisfactory. This ICR notes several key flaws in the design of the Project which made
implementation difficult and achievement of objectives unlikely. These design flaws were in part due to the
Project's being rushed to the Board without adequate preparation and finalization of prerequisites. In
addition, the Project conflicted with the objectives of other Bank projects.

Flaws in original design: The Project had originally included objectives and components related to the
fundamental restructuring of the industrial support framework of Tunisia, including support to the
Direction Générale de l'Industrie (DGI), which was responsible for the STCs and which was to manage
the project, and to the Union Tunisienne de... ... (UTICA), or the Tunisian confederation of employers,
which was the main private-sector counterpart for the Project. These two agencies were key to the
reorientation of industrial support in Tunisia; their exclusion from support in the final project design
weakened championship of the reform and strengthening of the STCs and the development of a metrology
system.   In addition, activities related to the strengthening of these bodies had been relatively more
advanced than those that remained in the project; it had been intended that initial activities would take place
concurrent to final preparation of STC and metrology activities. The removal of initial activities caused a
drop in momentum toward the project, and slowed implementation of the remaining components.

Inadequate preparation: Project preparation relied on a series of assumptions related to the private
sector's (i) ability to manage the restructured and new STCs and (ii) demand for advisory services. The
Project had envisaged that the professional federations would take over management of the STCs, however,
their capacity was overestimated. They were generally no more than a one-man operation, without the
authority within the respective industry to facilitate needs assessments, much less develop and promote
advisory services. Not having strengthened the professional federations weakened the chances for success
of re-orienting the STCs toward private sector services. In addition, demand for services was far lower
than expected ­ only recently, as the opening of borders to EU partners, has demand for services picked up.

Project preparation had not finalized key aspects of the new STCs, including their design, management, and



                                                     - 4 -

location. This resulted in significant delays in the establishment of the new STCs. In addition, STC
Program and Performance Contracts ­ contracts between the Ministry of Industry and the STCs that set
out the STCs' objectives and intended outputs ­ had not been finalized prior to Board presentation. The
end result was that investments in the STCs were delayed several years.

Similarly, the design and implementation responsibility for the metrology component was not specified
before Board presentation. Without the identification of the lead agency for the component (and for the
overall effort), decisions on investments were delayed during a long period of political discussions.

These design and preparation problems created the need for serious adjustments to be made during Project
implementation and had a serious impact on the ability of the project to achieve its objectives.

Finally, outcome indicators agreed on did not adequately reflect the impact of the Project. The Project
established four output quality indicators, evaluating value added, productivity, increased exports, and
capital investment of firms using the STCs relative to the sector as a whole. Bi-annual firm-level surveys
of STC clients and other enterprises were undertaken to assess the impact of the STCs on those indicators,
and of the general assessment of the private sector of STC services. The surveys, however, could not
assess whether changes were the result of interactions of firms with the STCs. This was exacerbated by
the sporadic interaction of firms with the STCs.

Conflict of objectives with other World Bank-supported projects: Simultaneous with the Project, the
World Bank supported the expansion of vocational training services through a Second Training and
Employment Project. As part of the preparation of the vocational training project, diagnostic studies were
undertaken at each of the existing STCs, and in fact contributed to a heavy overestimation of demand for
potential technical assistance provided by the STCs. Over the course of the vocational training project,
STCs then used vocational training grants provided by the GoT to provide technical assistance to
enterprises.    This undermined incentives for the STCs to become operationally self-sufficient and
private-sector-focused, put strain on the Program and Performance Contracts of the STCs, and affected the
credibility of the program.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

The ICR rates the achievement of Project objectives as Unsatisfactory. This rating is based on the
relatively poor performance of the STCs and lack of progress in establishing a metrology system. In
particular, most of the older technical centers do not cover their expenses, and new STCs are only just
becoming operational. With regard to the metrology system, there has still not been agreement on an
institutional body that would set out its framework, much less the establishment of a network of
laboratories to meet measurement and testing needs of industry.

The project has achieved some significant impacts in terms of institutional development of the
centers, creating a new environment which is focused on performance and delivery of public
services to the private sector. The bi-annual survey and the subsequent indicators seem to affirm
that the STCs, particularly the older ones, have become a part of the industrial fabric of Tunisia.
It has further laid the basis in terms of acquisition of equipment and the creation of an adequate
metrology laboratory with respect to some of the measurements that are important to Tunisian
exporters. It appears that the authorities are on track to eventually deliver what they have
promised within the context of this operation, as they are demonstrating leadership in continuing

positive steps.

4.2 Outputs by components:

The STC sub-component related to the strengthening of existing STCs is rated as satisfactory. This
component has seen the most dramatic improvements in terms of institutional development, and results of
the last bi-annual survey painted an encouraging picture for these centers. (See Annex 1 for estimates of
key performance indicators.) It shows that, on the whole, technical centers have made progress in terms of
market penetration, and that customer satisfaction in terms of their services has dramatically increased,
even when comparing the results with those of the biannual survey of just two years ago.

Equally important, however, has been the improvements in private-sector management of the STCs, the
strengthening of the STC boards, and the use of management performance contracts as a basis for
contracting and evaluation. Although the performance of the STCs was uneven over the life of the project,
as of the end of the Project, all centers have improved their turnover about fivefold or more over the course
of the project. Two of the centers are fully self sufficient and cover their expenditures, with at least 50
percent of revenue generated from services provided to client enterprises.           The two other STCs ­
CTMCCV and CNCC ­ have not performed as well, but are going through reorganizations that have
already had positive impacts on their performance. Even in those centers that have underperformed, the
mentality has changed.

The sub-component for the establishment of new technical centers is rated unsatisfactory. Significant
delays were incurred; originally expected to be put in place in two years, the centers are barely functional
after seven years. The delays were a reflection of design problems discussed earlier, but also reflect a lack
of understanding of what it takes to have a performing center. There were problems in staffing (in
particular, hiring of staff on a permanent basis, rather than hiring experienced consultants on a contractual
basis to address specific demands), and procurement of the necessary equipment was lengthy and required
the full attention of the existing staff, diverting attention away from providing services to industrial firms in
the sector. In addition, staff hired were often inexperienced, requiring the provision of additional training
and resulting in further delays. That said, the Project did succeed in establishing new STCS ­ institutions
were created, buildings were built or rented, staff were hired, and the centers were equipped. The four new
centers are capable of developing business and adequately performing client services. This is a major
success for the project.

However, the centers have had mixed results, generally well below what had been anticipated and expected.
In some cases, such as in the agro-industry center, the direction of the center's activities was misguided,
focusing on research and development and neglecting services to the industry. Only one of the centers has
truly begun providing services to the industry (PACKTEC); obviously, none of the centers has reached the
goal of having client services reach 50 percent of its activities.

The component to establish a National Metrology System is rated unsatisfactory. This assessment is
made on the basis of the objective of establishing an overarching organization for metrology.               This
objective was not achieved over the life of the project. That said, the Project funded state-of-the-art
equipment for several STCs and laboratories, enabling testing of several primary measures. Equipment
requirements were prioritized, with the initial deployment to the following STCs and laboratories: CETIME
(dimensional metrology), CTMCCV (force and pressure), CNCC (temperature), Metrology Légale
(volume, pressure and mass for commercial transactions), Central Laboratory (mass and pressure),
CETEC (force), and National Defense Laboratory (electricity). These testing dimensions were considered
the minimum necessary to provide adequate metrological support to the industrial sector.


                                                        - 6 -

An overall plan for a metrology system was prepared under the Project, based upon diagnostic work
financed by the Coopération Française. The plan provided for the initial infrastructure of a metrology
system to be placed within the STCs, complemented by other national laboratories. The equipment of the
above STCs and laboratories is a base on which to construct a national metrology system. This is a major
accomplishment of the project, as these laboratories started from very low levels and are now competitive
in their respective areas of expertise.  The laboratories now equipped are going through the process of
accreditation (ISO 17025) in terms of testing and metrology. This process is ongoing and proceeding for
almost all laboratories.

The Project, however, had intended that the laboratories be organized and administered by an overall
authority. While some progress has been made of late, there have been significant delays in this area and
the project has closed without having achieved any major breakthrough. To date, there is no national
metrology system, and no functional working group of experts. Without an authority to coordinate,
prioritize and focus the work of this loose network of laboratories, the national metrology system is simply
a few laboratories conducting selected measurements, which falls short of what was envisaged to occur
under the project. There are still prospects for future development of a national system ­ terms of reference
for a metrology authority have been prepared that take into account the work under the Project, and
members of the authority have been nominated.

The component to reform and strengthen the Agence de Promotion Industrielle is rated satisfactory.
As a result of the restructuring, API is providing services through a single entry point to potential
exporters. Additionally, through a partnership with the STCs, the agency ­ which has a vast network of
local offices across Tunisia ­ was able to increase the volume of services provided within the context of the
PMN at least ten fold. This provided a net benefit to the centers as well as to API.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:

The Project required demonstration of an economic or financial rate of return equal to or greater
than 12 percent, and a-priori feasibility studies were undertaken for all investments funded by the
Project. However, ex-post investment evaluations have not been carried out, and it is not possible
to judge the rate of return generated by the project.

4.4 Financial rate of return:

See 4.3 above.

4.5 Institutional development impact:

The institutional development impact is rated as substantial in terms of the impact on the STCs.
In particular with respect to the existing STCs, the performance contracts have had a significant
impact on the way that the STCs are managed, with a focus on services to the private sector, on
the needs of industry, and on cost recovery. While not all the centers have achieved the same
level of success, the example of the better performing centers is a positive one. It is expected that
as the new centers increase their activities, and as demand for services increases, the pattern of
operational and managerial improvements will continue.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

Factors outside the control of the GoT and the PMU that affected the Project included delays in
the execution of technical assistance activities financed by the EU. This had a negative impact on
the STCs, hampering their ability to effectively utilize the equipment procured through the
Project. Furthermore, it delayed institutional development and retarded the growth of technical
centers. In addition, weaknesses in professional associations impeded the functioning of the
Administrative Boards of the STCs, which reduced the STCs' managements' effectiveness.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

Several factors contributed to weak implementation and poor outcomes.                 In particular, the
agencies responsible for the follow up of the Project did not approach project implementation ­ in
particular, the role of the STCs ­ in a consistent manner. This resulted in significant disputes that
required close attention by Project management and that resulted in serious delays in
implementation and procurement. In addition, lack of a common vision reduced the credibility of
the stated reforms and the commitment of STC management in some cases. For example,
promises undertaken by one ministry were subsequently invalidated by another. This greatly
reduced the credibility of Performance Contracts, which, for example, included the possibility of
performance bonuses, but which were not subsequently given even if stated achievements were
met. In addition, the nomination of the Director Generals of the STCs were independent of STC
boards, calling into question the managerial independence of the STCs.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The placement of PMU staff as GoT representatives on the boards of the STCs facilitated monitoring of
Project progress and collaboration between the PMU and the STCs. The PMU's role was in effect
strengthened from a monitoring role to a managerial role. In addition, PMU reporting directly to the
MVTE/ME gave the PMU the necessary authority to fulfill its role.

5.4 Costs and financing:

The loan was originally for an amount of 200 million French Francs, which was equivalent to US$ 38.70
million at the time of approval.

Project costs were affected by a mid-term project restructuring and cancellations in an amount of FF 48
Million (US$6.32 million equivalent). The reduced loan amount was subsequently converted to 30.47
million Euro when the Euro replaced the franc. In addition, Euro 3.47 million (US$3.7 million equivalent)
was cancelled in April 2003.

The majority of Project funds were disbursed to the STC component. A total of Euro 15 million
went to strengthening of existing STCs and the establishment of new STCs, including Euro 2.2
million for civil works, Euro 11.8 million for equipment, Euro 0.45 million for consultant services
and training, and Euro 0.67 million for vehicles. A total of Euro 1.2 million was used for the
purchase of equipment related to the establishment of a national metrology system. The total
Loan amount disbursed at closing was Euro 16.6 Million (US$ 17.8 million equivalent). The

undisbursed balance at closing ­ Euro 3.34 million (US$ 4.08 million) was cancelled as of June 7,
2004.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

This ICR rates the sustainability of project achievements as likely. The ICR team was able to note that the
GoT appeared committed to the objectives of the project. In particular, the government has clear ideas
regarding the future of the STCs and the development of the metrology system, including development and
implementation of new performance programs/contracts for the STCs before the end of the calendar year.
The new contracts will be for a period of three years, and will have nine evaluation criteria, and are an
indication of the GoT's commitment to the use of performance contracts for the management of the STCs.
New contracts will be implemented for all eight STCs, although performance indicators may vary.

The metrology system is being followed up in the context of work undertaken under a new framework
agreement with the EU. Under this agreement, a technical expert in charge of metrology will be placed
within the responsible unit. In addition, terms of reference have been developed for an assessment of the
existing system and the development of a plan to further the implementation of the metrology system,
building on what has been put in place under this project.

These measures lead the ICR to rate the sustainability of reforms likely.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

The Centers have functional Boards as well as management teams, and new performance contract
should go into effect before the end of 2004. Evaluation of the performance of the centers will be
undertaken in that context by the Direction Générale des Stratégies Industrielles (DGSI) and the
Ministry of Finance (MOF). In addition, the daily work of the implementing agency is being
undertaken by DGSI, which has overseen the project from the outset. For these reasons, there is
no necessary transition to regular operations.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

Bank performance during Project preparation is rated unsatisfactory.              The project was not
adequately prepared at the time of Board presentation. The Bank failed to satisfactorily assess the
difficulties associated with the scope of reform it was assisting, once critical components of the
original design were removed from the Project. The project was presented to the Board to appear
responsive to client demands, but in so doing presented a project that could not adequately deliver
its expected outcome.

7.2 Supervision:

Bank performance during Project implementation is rated satisfactory. However, Bank efforts
were largely directed toward trying to resolve problems in implementation, rather than on
continuing dialogue on the overarching objectives of the Project. The central failing of the



                                                    - 9 -

supervision work was not to be more insistent in the beginning in demanding that the appointment
and the management of technical centers be left to the boards of the centers and that Government
oversight be undertaken under those auspices.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:

Overall Bank performance is rated as unsatisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

Borrower performance with respect to Project preparation is rated unsatisfactory. At the outset of project
preparation, the Government sought to undertake a very impressive and daring program of reform of the
support framework for Tunisian industry. In the end, it agreed to pursue a more limited agenda, dealing
exclusively with the STCs, without however addressing the problems of important actors, such as UTICA.
While it did delegate unprecedented management freedom to the STCs, it failed to accept the principle of
total management freedom and accountability, which was at the base of the project. Furthermore, it chose
to leave many aspects of the program undefined, leading to protracted disputes during implementation and
equally long disbursement delays.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

Borrower performance with respect to Project implementation is rated unsatisfactory. This rating is based
on the problems suffered by the Project during the majority of the period of implementation, even though
recent Borrower actions have rectified many of the problems.

Over the course of the project, disagreements between the implementing agency, the Ministry of
Industry, and the MOF prevented the establishment of budgets for the STCs, which were in turn
unable to undertake long-term planning and to manage resources in the interest of their
consistency. In addition, Borrower interference in the appointment of the general directors of the
STCs undermined the objective of independent boards, management and decision-making.
Finally, inconsistency with respect to evaluation of the performance contracts undermined
credibility of the contracts.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

The performance of the implementing agency is rated satisfactory. Despite limited financial
means, and under very adverse conditions, the implementing agency admirably managed the
project. It kept excellent project files, became expert in World Bank procedures, and provided
technical assistance on procurement issues to STC staff.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

Overall borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory. Overall, the Borrower did not act in a
consistent manner vis-à-vis this operation, often pushing in different directions to the detriment of
both the technical centers and to the intended beneficiaries ­ Tunisian enterprises.

8. Lessons Learned

Ex-ante investment in consensus building and outreach to the private sector is necessary as part of project
preparation of institutional development projects. Without significant private sector participation and
buy-in (as well as high-level public sector support for reform), the reform process is likely to suffer delays
and inefficiencies.

A well developed overall strategic framework incorporating the theoretical underpinnings of the project, but
also defining in detail necessary institutional arrangements, is an important precondition for project
implementation. This type of framework, in the context of institutional development operations, becomes a
blueprint for wide-ranging change.

In institutional development projects, technical assistance and training is sometimes more important than
material investments. If the allocation of tasks must be divided across donors, it is very important that
these activities are synchronized. The ultimate success of the operation depends on it.

In the development of a demand-driven system, it is necessary to pay equal attention to the development of
capacity on the demand side, as the success of the reform depends in large part on the demand side being
properly organized and having the ability to express its needs and the capacity to contribute its share. For
example, in the case of this project, developing the capacity of industrialists would have helped
tremendously in project implementation.

For projects necessitating organizational and cultural transformation, it is important to allow flexibility
during the study and roll-out phases. During these phases, mistakes and innovations must be permitted.
Nonetheless, flexibility on the implementation of the reform must also be accompanied by adherence to the
fundamental precepts of reform.

Government commitment is essential, in particular for reforms of the same scope as those of the project.
This must be accompanied by an ability to cooperate systematically and coherently across ministries and
institutions, as well as by the participation and proactive involvement of a local champion at the highest
levels who is empowered to resolve contentious issues when they arise. If this is present, it leads to other
positive aspects, such as the allocation of well-qualified personnel for project execution and effective
decision-making during difficult moments and the minimization of delays.

The development of easily understandable performance indicators that match the anticipated results is an
important part of being able to promote and measure success. The indicators are a management tool for
both the client, for its internal discussions, and for the Bank, and should be used to evaluate the progress of
the project throughout implementation. They eventually could be revised according to needs. In certain
cases, it is helpful to specify the calculation method of the indicators in order to facilitate their reliability.
