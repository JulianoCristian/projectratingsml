This experience in institutional\n            development, reinforce lessons learned, namely on the need\n            for ex-ante investment in consensus building and private\n            sector outreach; a well developed overall strategic\n            framework incorporating the theoretical underpinnings of the\n            project, but also defining in detail necessary institutional\n            arrangements; and, Government commitment, in particular for\n            reforms within the project scope.
