1.1       BACKGROUND OF PROJECT
Environmental Impact Assessment of Lam Ta Rhong Pumped
Storage Project represents another EGAT's contlnual attempt
in Its routine undertaking to preserve national environ-
ment and to enhance its development project benifi-cial to
the national development.
The planned Lam Ta Rhong Pumped Storage Project is located
in the area between Sikhiu and Pak Chong Districts of Nakhon
Ratchasima Province as shown In the location map, Figure
1-1.   The Project is the first of its kind being introduced
to Thailand. Its components include: upper reservoir, under-
ground powerhouse, tunnels, switchyard, and power trans-
mlssion system. The general features of the project is
shown in Figure 1-2. The existing Lam Ta Khong reservoir
constructed by the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) will be
used as the lower reservoir.   An upper  reservoir  will  be
constructed on the nearby mountain to create the   hydraulic
head and storage capacity enough to provide for generating
electricity  during  peak periods.      The  powerhouse  and
generating facilities as well as the connecting tunnels will
be constructed underground.     There will be a cable tunnel
from the underground powerhouse to an outdoor switchyard and
the transmission line will join the existing 230  kV  double
circuit between Saraburl and Nakhon Ratchasima.
The major concerns of the Project regarding the environ-
mental aspect are the use of land area for the construction
and the use of the existing Lam Ta Rhong reservoir as the
lower reservoir.
The land area to be acquired is approximately 3 sq km which
is  considerably  small  when  compared  to   other   EGAT's
projects. However, the area of concern is partly classified

as the watershed preservation area stipulated by the govern-
ment especially the upper reservoir site Is located on the
watershed classification 1B. The detailed environmental
assessment of which is required for approval by the National
Environment Board (NEB).
EGAT has awarded this Environmental Impact Assessment Study
Project (EIA) to Khon Kaen University (RKU) which is a
leading regional university where the project is situated.
The study was undertaken by the KKU's multidisciplinary team
during the period August 1990 to February 1992.
1.2       OBJECTIVBB AND SCOPE

scope
The study involves collection, analysis, and interpretation
of literature, existing data, and data collected during the
study period that allow accurate evaluation and prediction
of impacts of the Project upon the environmental resources/
values as well as for development of recommendations for
mitigation and compensation/resettlement plannings, and the
environmental monitoring programs.
1.3       STUDY APPROACH
Formulated Concept of Study
The concept of the EIA study was formulated as follows:
- The EIA study Is one of the normal EIA confor-
ming with NEB guidelines.
- In particular, as the upper reservoir site is
lacated on the watershed area classification 1B,
parts of the study results are intended for used
1-5



as  the   envlronmental   justlfication  in  the
selection of upper reservoir alternatlve sites.
Bounding the ASSUBeUnt
The EIA study has been focus on the impact of the Project
during two main development stages: the construction and the
operation stages.
Regarding  the  ecological  systems   and  spatial   extent
coneerned,  all  three   ecosystems,   namely   terrestrial,
aquatic, and human have been considered with varying degrees
of significance in different areas. In formulating the study
framework, the spatial extent was bounded by subdividing
into the following five areas shown schematieally in Figure
1-3.
Area I : Lam Ta Ihong reservoir and its vicinity.
This area comprlses the water body of the Lam Ta
Khong reservoir and the settlement along the
reservoir rim.   The major concern for  this  area
is the aquatic ecosystem which consists of water
quantity, water quality, and aquatic biology which
reside in the reservoir. The human ecosystem -of
concern consists of those settlements where the
people  live  on   reservoir   production,   i.e.,
fisheries, agriculture in the drawdown zone, etc.
Area II: the proposed right bank alternative sites
for upper reservolr. This- area comprises the three
proposed alternative areas on the right bank
mountain which are composed of the forest and
deforested  upland cultivation  areas.   There is
complicacy In terms ef law and regulations since
parts of the area concerned are in the forest area
classified as the watershed preservation stipula-
ted by the government. The ecosystems of major
concern in this area are of human and terrestrial.

Area Ifl: the proposed left bank alternative site
for upper reservoir.   The characteristic of  this
alternate area is similar to area II. However,
less effort on the investigation is required for
the area will be investigated for the completeness
in the comparlsoin study only. There Is no possi-
bility that this site will be reconsidered to be
used for upper reservoir.
Area rV: Dounstreau irrigation area. This is the
area which shares the major proportion in demand
of water from Lam Ta Khong reservoir at present.
As a result, the proposed operatlon of the Pumped
Storage Project will affect this demand of water
both for irrigation and for maintaining base flow
in the Lam Ta Khong downstream. Consequently, the
agricutural  production,  water   quantity,   and
quality in the stream may be affected.
Area V: Nakhon Ratabcaima urban area mad districts
In the vicinity.    At present,  this even growing
urban area as well as the districts in the
vicinities are supplied with the water transmitted
from the  Lam  Ta  Khong  reservoir.   This  water
demand, even though sharing less proportion, its
priority  seems  to  be  higher  than  any   other
demands. Furthermore, It is necessary to maintain
a higher water quality standards for this urban
supply.
Impact Identification
According to the environmental consequence in the Project
area ecosystem, the environmental impacts of the Project of
both  primary and secondary sources are identified.   To  be
conformed with NEB guidelines, the environmental resources
and values are then classified into four levels as guided
by NEB: (1) physical resources, (2) ecological resources,
(3) human use values, and (4) quality of life values.

Impact Analysis
To fulfill EGAT's objectives of this EIA study, the Impact
analysis has addressed questions regarding  points  such  as
the probability, timing, severity, and diffusion of each
Identified impact; who/what/where will be affected and how;
their probable response; and how slgnlflcont the Impacts
will be. To answer these questions, the steps of approach
which have been used are as follows:
1) Identify the major cause-consequence linkages
for developing  a  conceptual  model  of   the
environmental systems related to the project
development.
2) Carry  out  detailed  investigations  on  the
present conditions and trends of the various
environmental components and to clarify the
relationships  among the  environmental   com-
ponents.
3) For some  specific  sub-systems  which  require
crucial  analysis   and   are   technologically
feasible, appropriate mathematical models have
been used for the analysis.
4) At the final stage, the overall project
environmental   impact   has   been   evaluate.d
according to the identified linkages.
Technical Organization Strategies
To perform this interdisciplinary EIA study, task forces in
various disciplinary areas have been formed.   One important
aspect In organizing the study of this nature is to make
every part of the study harmonized into one unique study
under the same objective. In doing this, the strategies in
creating a Technical Core  Team  have  been  ipplied.   This
Technical Core Team which comprised a number of EIA experts
has been created since the early stage to develop the con-
ceptual frameworks of the study, to detail out the concepts
into study program and plant to  supervise the various tasks

CTIAFnCr       2
2.1       BACKGROUND OF PROJECT
Thailand's economic growth rate in  1989  was  11%,  which  was
prominent among Asian developing nations.    Particularly,  the
growth  of  its  industrial  sector  was  signlficant.   It  is
necessary for EGAT to provide sufficient electric energy supply
to be able to cope with the increasing demand In the future due
to the continuing growth of the country.
In 1989, the installed capacity of electric power generating
facilities in Thalland was 8,314 MW. Its composition of power
sources consisted of 2,271 MM from hydro plants (27.3%) and
6,043 MW from thermal plants (72.7%).-
The Thai Government has a policy to. utilize indigeneous energy
sources such as natural gas, lignite, hydropower, etc., and to
suppress the import of oil as much as possible.
With the above policy, hydroelectric power resource development
in Thailand has been carried out through large scale projects
such as at the Bhumibol Dam (535 MW) on the Ping river, the
Sirikit Dam (375 NW) on the Nan river, the Srinagarind Dam (540
MW) on the Quae Yai river, the Khao Laem Dam (300 MW) on the
Quae Nol river, and the Rajjaprabha Dam (240 NW) on the Xhlong
Saeng river.    As a result of this  development, the remaining
possible large-scale hydroelectric power resources serving peak
period demands may be limited to the international rivers, such
as the Mekong river and the Salawin river, which are along
borders. However, the implementation of this development,e.g.,
the Mekong river project involves internationally-complicated
factors. It is not likely that the development will be realized
in the near future.
Under such circumstances, keen attention has been focussed
recently on the Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project which is
close to Bangkok metropolitan area, the biggest demand area of
2-1



electricity In Thailand. This will ensure sufficient electric
power supply to cope with the high growth of electricity
demand, especially at peak periods.
In 1988, the Thai Goverrment requested the Japanese Government
to assist in carrying out a feasibility study on the Project.
This study was then implemented by JICA between 1989 and 1991.
The study results are summarized in the following sections.
2.2       CONCLUBON OF THE PROJ=CI FEASIBILITY 8TUDY
The Lam Ta Rhong Pumped Storage Project is planned to be
carried out at the Lam Ta Rhong River, a tributary of the Nun
River of the Mekong River system, 200 km northeast of the
capital  Bangkok.   The Feasibility  Study  reveals  that  the
project is feasible from technical and economic points of view.
An outline of the conclusions are glven below.
1) Electric power demand in Thalland recorded an
annual growth rate of 14 percent in 1990 as a
result of   rapid   lndustrlalization.   It   Is
predicted that demand will grow at an annual rate
of approximately 16 percent in 1991 and 7 percent
In 1997. The peak power demand in 1990 of 7,094
MW is estimated to become about 13,000 - 14,000
MW In 1997. Therefore, there will be a necessity
to construct new facilities of approximately 900
NW every year.
2) At present, only a few power sources exist to
meet the rapid increase of peak power demand. In
order to supply reliable electric power in the
future corresponding to the rapid industriali-
zation of Thailand, it is necessary to develop
hydroelectric power plants capable of coping with
the peak load. The Lam Ta thong Pumped Storage
project is extremely promising as a power source
to cope with the above-mentioned increase in
demand and as a power source to supply peak loads
of Thailand.
2-2



3) The optimum scale of development of the Lam Ta
Khong pumped storage power plant is 1,000 NW
having the capability of 8 hours' continuous
operation (storage capacity of upper reservoir).
It ts desirable to commence operation of the
project at the earliest, and it is considered
that this is in the year 1997. In the case that
the development of the project is divided into
two stages and that the unit 3 and 4 (250 MW x 2
units) are installed later than 1997, it is
recommended that the units 3 and 4 shall be
installed by the year of 2002  from  an  economic
point of view.
4) The power system stability poses a limitation of
plant operation. The 1,000 KW generation will be
possible in 1997, however, pumping at off-peak
time will have to be restricted to 500 MW at most
from  the  stand  point  of the   power   system
stability.
5) In addition to the function of power supply
capability the Lam Ta Khong -power plant will
provide the following benefits to EGAT's system.
The  project  will  have  quick  load   following
characteristics corresponding to load fluctuation
regulating the system frequency and voltage,
reserve capacity in case of failure of other-
power plants, and reducing the frequency of
start-and-stop of thermal power plants there by
enabling high efficiency operation of thermal
power plants.
6) Civil structures including surface membrane fill
dam for upper reservoir, underground powerhouse,
penstock and tailrace tunnel were designed taking
into consideration topography, geology, availa-
bility of construction materials, earthquakes and
environmental  aspect.    Bedrock  of  the  upper
reservoir,  the  waterway  and- tha  underground
powerhouse is composed of  sedimentary  rock   of
Mesozolc era, and remarkable faults or other
2-3



l -
problems were not found judging from the results
of In situ rock tests. There are no technical
problems which would influence the realization of
this project.
7) The project area is located in an environmental
area where development Is restricted by the Thai
government. Construction of structures on the
surface are prohibited in a part of the area. In
order to evade the restricted area, underground
structures are adopted ln this project. There are
no people livlng In the project area, so there
will be  no  resettlement  problem.    Since  the
project is designed considering the envLronment,
it is feasible from an environmental point of
view.
8) The estimated project cost Including import duty,
interest during construction and escalation up to
1997 is 16,674 million Baht (US$641 million).
9) The present value of surplus  benefit  (B  -  C),
benefit-cost ratio (B/C), and equalizing discount
rate (EDR) of the project obtained from economic
comparison of the Lam Ta Khong power plant and an
alternative thermal plant are 1,504 million Baht,
1.16,  and  17.4  percent,  respectively.   These
values indlcate that the development of the
project is economically feasible.

2.3       PROJECT DEvLWPEET
2.3.1    METHODOLOSY
To obtain the optimum development plan of the Lam Ta Xhong
Pumped Storage Project, the following methodology has been
used :
1) Layout of the project Is studied, from viewpoints
of topography, geology, environme6tal regulations
and economics to select the optimum layout.
2) The development scale ls studied from a viewpoint
of demand-supply balance, unit capacity and power
system's stability.
3) Development scale Is studied from the optimization
study using benefit and cost of the project.
4) The development plan is finalized taking Into
account the abovementioned t1) to (3).
2.3*2    BELECZION OF TUE OPTfUDE LAYOUT
In determining the optimum layout of the Lam Ta Thong Pumped
Storage Project, three alternative sites and five alternative
routes shown in Figure 2-1 were planned for the upper reservoir
and the waterway respectively.
Site reconnaissance and preliminary study which took Into
account following points were carried out by JICA Team.
1) Watershed Classification. The watershed in the
Project area is classified into two groups as
follow (See also Figure 2-1):
- Class 1A area: The land use in this area is
prohibited in order to protect the headwater of
rlvers.
- Class 1B area:  In case of public-:And use by
government  organization,   the   organization
should propose and report the environmental
2-11



effect of the project to the National Environ-
ment Board (NEB), and obtain the approval of
NEB for the land use.
2) Households  Inundatrd.     The  compensation  and
resettlement cost Is not much.  However, social
and environmental factors  caused by resettlement
should be considered.
3) Availability of Access Load, Lenght of Access
Tunesl, Length  of Transmission Line, and Under-
water Works.   These  factors  affects  the con-
struction cost of the Project.
Considering the factors mentioned above, characteristics of
each alternative are described below, and summarized in Table
2-2.
Characteristics of Upper Reservoir Bite
l) Alternative iM-1.   The reservoir  is a  surface
membrane type and is located on a terrace of the
right bank  of the  existing   Lam   Ta   Khong
reservoir.    Judging from the  topography,  High
Water Level (HWL) is assumed to be about EL. 640
M.  Access road from National  Highway  No.2  to
the site exists;  however,  it should be imp;oved
for the construction of the reservoir.   The UR-1
area is classified In to watershed class 1B.
2) Alternative UR-2.    The reservoir is an ordinary
type rockfill dam at the upstream of a gully on
the right bank.  BWL is assumed to be lower than
about EL. 590 a judging from the topography, and
distance between the existing Lam Ta Rhong
reservoir and the upper reservoir is longer than
UR-1. AccessLbility to the project site is the
same as UR-1.    The UR-2 area is classified Into

watershed  class  1B.   This  alternative  has  a
resettlement problem of about one hundred house-
holds in the upper reservoir area.
3) Alternative ULM-.   The reservoir is the  surface
membrane type and Is located on a terrace of the
left bank of the Lam Ta Xhong reservoir. Similar
to UR-1, HWL is assumed to be about EL. 640 a.
Existing road from the Lam Ta Khong dam to the
site  is  available;  however,   it   should   be
improved.  The present condition  of  the  access
road is worse than those of the alternatives on
the right bank. The most serious problem for
this site is that this area is classified into
watershed  class  IA,  in which  land   use   is
prohibited in any case in order to protect the
headwaters of rivers.
Characteristics of Waterway Route and Location of Powerhouse
.1) Alternative WR-1.  Thls alternative connects the
upper  reservoir  UR-1  and  the  Lam  Ta   Xhong
reservoir with the shortest  waterway.   Accessi-
bility to the powerhouse is good, since National
Hlghway No.2 passes along the right shore of the
Lam Ta Xhong reservoir.   As regards the accessi-
bility to the underground type powerhouse, the
length of the access tunnel to the powerhouse and
the length of a cable tunnel will be about 1,000
m and 600 m respectively.
2) alternative Wk-2. This alternative connects the
upper  reservoir  UR-1 and  the  Lam  Ta   Xhong
reservoir without passing the area of watershed
class lk. However, the length of the waterway ls
about 2,000 a longer than that of WR-1. Accessi-
bility to the powerhouse is similar  to  that  of
WR-1 .
2-15



3) Alternative WR-3.  This alternatlve connects the
upper  reservoir  UR-2 and  the  Lam  Ta   Khong
reservoir. However, the length of the waterway
ls about 1,000 m longer than that of WR-1.
Accessibllity is the same as that of WR-1.
4) Alternative IL-1. This  alternative connects the
upper  reservoir UL-1 and  the  Lam  Ta   Rhong
reservoir. The length of waterway is about 300 m
shorter than that of WR-1 and the shortest of all
alternatives.   However, underwater work  in  the
Lam Ta Khong reservoir is much mare than WR-1.
This alternative has the followLng two problems.
- An access road to the project site of about 6
km long should be constructed since no existing
road along the left bank of the Lam Ta Khong
reservoir is available.
- The length of transmission line is about 25 km
longer than the alternatives WR-1, WR-2 and
WR-3 located on the right bank of the Lam Ta
Khong reservoir.
5) klternative WL-2.  This alternative connects the
upper reservoir UL-1  and  the   Lam  Ta  Khong
reservoir. Underwater work ln the Lam Ta Khong
reservoir is less than WL-1. However, the water-
way tunnel ls longer than WL-1. As for the accL.4s
-road to the project site and and the length of
transmission line, this alternative has thesame
problems as WL-1.
Determination of the Optimum Layout
1) Upper Reservoir Site.    Concerning the selection
of  the  upper  reservolr  site,  two   Important
matters should be considered.    One is watershed
classlfication, and the other is resettlement.
Alternative UL-1 has a problem of location ln the
2-16



area of watershed class 1A. Alternative UR-2 has
a resettlement problem.    Besides, the effective
head of this alternative Is smaller than other
alternatives, since Its Max. of HWL is lower than
others.    On the other hand, Alternative UR-1 Is
located In watershed class 1B, where restriction
to land use is not so strict as in watershed
class 1A. In addltion, thls alternative does not
have a resettlement problem.   As a result of the
study above, Alternative UR-1 was selected as
the upper reservoir site of Lam Ta Thong Project.
2) Route of Vaturway and Location of Powerhoune. Two
alternatives, WR-1 and WR-2, were studied for
their  compatibility  with  the  selected   upper
reservoir UR-1.  After consideration of the fact
that the construction cost of WR-1 is about 12%
less than that of WR-2,  Alternative. WR-1 was
selected as the layout of the waterway and the
location of the powerhouse of the  Lam  Ta  Khong
Project.
3) Optimum Layout.    As  a  result  of the  study
mentioned above, Layout No.1 which is the. combi-
nation of the UR-1 and WR-1 has been selected as
the optimum layout of the Lam Ta Khong Project.

2.5       PROZECT FELTURES
General features of the preliminary design are shown in Figure
2-2 to 2-7
2.5.1     UPPER RESERVOIR
The upper reservoir is a pool type regulating pondage with 340
x 103 m2 of reservoir area and 10,300 x  103  i3  of  reservoir
capacity made by digging and partially eabanking a gently
sloped plateau at about 640 m above the sea level on the right
side shore about 6.5 km upstream from Lam Ta  Khong  dam.   The
maximum output is 1,000 MW and the power can be generated for 8
hours.
The inner surfaces of pool are covered with the asphalt
concrete. The embankment is made by using some of the muck.
The upper reservoir is large scale pool type reservoir with an
allover asphalt facing fill-type dam.
For the location of upper reservoir, the most advantageous area
was selected by taking into consideration the topography,
geology, extension of waterway, dam construction cost, etc; The
watershed classification area 1A designated by the National
Environmental Board was avoided, thus preserving proper envi-
ronmental condition (see Figure 2-6).
The geologic condition of upper reservoir Is such that the
surface stratum contains 3-4 m of weathered residual soil and
under this surface stratum, about 5 - 15 m thick claystone and
10-35 m thick coarse-grained sandstone layer are alternately
distributed.  Therefore, the foundation of dam is the claystone
and coarsegrained sandstone layer.
The  following  table  shows  the   specification   for   upper
reservoir.

2.5.2      WAVEZRAY
The route of waterway is designed in such a way that the length
of waterway on the gradual mountain ridge is kept shortest.
Since the waterway is installed across watershed classification
area IA, it is installed underground to leet the environmental
control.
The following table shows specifications for waterway.

The foundation for the power Intake is set on the hard and
coarse-grained sandstone.
The bedrock of penstock and tailrace consists of mainly silt-
stone and fine-grained sandstone with coarse-grained sandstone
being partially  distributed.   Since  these  strata  are  kept
nearly horizontal.
Since the upper reservoir is pool type regulating poundage, It
is made in the morning-glory shape, because the power intake
has to be installed on the bottom of reservoir.
2-32



The penstock is underground laid type steel pipe with total
length of about 690 m x 4 - 2 ways,  which  connects  with  the
upper, middle and lower horizontal sections and the upper  and
lower inclined  tunnels  (51°).  The  inner  diameter  of  the
penstock varies from 5.80 to 2.60 m. 2 way is provided from the.
upper horizontal part of the lover inclined tunnel.    For  the
sections lower than the lower  horizontal  tunnel, 4 ways  are
provided.
The maximum design head including the water-hammer pressure for
the steel penstock is about 600 a.   The  steel pipe  withstand
the total hydraulic pressure. Total weight of steel pipe is
about 7,580 t.
The tailrace is circular pressure tunnel with a total length of
1,470 m x 4 - 2 ways.
Since the tailrace  tunnel  is considerably  long,  the  surge
chamber is reguired against load built-up and load rejection.
The outlet is designed in such a way that it is continuously
widened from the circular pressure tunnel and changes to the 4-
series box culvert, thus ensuring that the water flow velocity
is smoothly  reduced and water  is  smoothly  diffused while
generating power and that the water flow is stabilized without
containing air while pumping.
Installed at the tailrace tunnel are 4 draft gates (Bonnet
type; dia. 4.90 m) and 2 tailrace gate (Roller gate; width 5.20
m height 6.60  m) which  are  used  for  the maintenance  and
inspection of turbines and tunnels. A screen is also installed
at the outlet.
2.5.3     POWERHOUSE
Just as in the case of the waterway, the powerhouse is con-
structed  underground.  Furthermore, we  avoided   watershed
classification  areas 1A  and 2A by minimizing the entrance of
2-33



access tunnel of powerhouse and the switchyard area (see Figure
2-6).
The powerhouse is a large scale underground cavern (width 22 m
x height 45.7 m x length 117 m) constructed about 300 a under
the ground is equipped with pump turbine, 250 KW x 4 units,
power generator and other accessories. In the transformer room,
a large  cavern  (width 20 m x helght 25.5 a x length 108 m) is
previded about 70 m apart from the center of turbine, in order
to install 4 units of  transformer  and  GMCS.   The  excavated
amount  of the  powerhouse  and the  trsnsformer room  Is about
168,000 D@.
The-geologic condition near the underground powerhouse and
transformer room is such that the upper part of arch consists
of siltstone and finegrained sandstone and the area under the
arch is made up of sandy siltstone and fine-grained sandstone.
Both of them are kept horizontal as in the case of the water-
way.
The cross-section of underground powerhouse and transformer
room Is in the "mushroom shape" which satisfies a wide range of
geologic requirements and improves the economic aspect with the
minimized cross-sectional shape.
The underground powerhouse and the c-atside on the surface are
connected by the access tunnel for powerhouse (total length;
about 1,210 m) and the power cable tunnel (total length; about
710 a).
The acceus tunnel for powerhouse passes from the National
Highway at a gradlent of about 14%, through the transformer
room and reaches the erection bay of the powerhouse.
2.5.44    ZLECTRICL JND UICEHCIL BEQUIXEP T
Electrical and mechanical facilities of the plant consist
mainly of four pumping-generating units with a nominal unit
capacity of 250 MW and transformers installed in underground
2-34



caverns, GIS type outdoor switchyard equipment, control facili-
ties and various auxiliary  equipment.   The plant is  designed
to operate being controlled both remotely from the EGAT's
dispatching center and locally by one-man-control at the power
station.   Outlines of main units are as follows:

The Lam Ta Khong power plant shall be connected with EGAT's
power system by means of four circuits of 230 kV transmission
lines, two circuits of which with Thalan 3 substation and the
others with one of  existing  two _230  kV .transmlssion  lines
between Saraburi 2 and Nakhon Ratchasima 2 substations by pi
branch.
2-35



Therefore, two routes of double-circuit transmission lines i.e.
from the Lam Ta Khong power plant to Thalan 3 substation and
from the plant to the connecting point with the existing trans-
mission line are to be constructed.
The length of the transmission lines to be newly constructed
for connection with Thalan 3 substation and the existing trans-
mission line are approximately 95 km and 15 km respectively.

3.1      SURFACE WATER HYDROLOGY
3.1.1 1       I   ODUCTION
The inflow to the reservoir depends on the surface water
hydrology.    The surface water hydrology in turn depends on
the type of land use, soil type, slope of the watershed
area, and length of stream.    However, the  major factor is
the land use; which affects the climatological environment.
For example, deforestation reduces the moisture in the air.
Fortunately, this area is influenced by the rainy storms
originated in the Pacific Ocean.
Objectives
1) To investigate the existing hydrological condi-
tion in the concerned areas.
2) To evaluate the potential changes of hydrolo-
gical condition in the area due to thp project
development.
Scope of work
The existing hydrological data on rainfall, streamflow and
percolation as well as the watershed characteristics were
reviewed.   The future trend and changes in land uses resul-
ting from the project development were investigated to
predict the changes in hydrological condition.
3.1.2 2   ETHODOLOGY
1) The rainfall and streamflow data were reviewed
as well as the characteristics of the watershed
area.
3-1



2) Land use was also Investigated for changes due
to the Project development.
3) The computer model written from the concept of
SCS was used.   The  model  was  calibrated, and
then used to simulate the surface runoff from
the rainfall data.
3.1 .3    MCISTING NNVIXO)N TAL C0NDITION
The average rainfall was computed by the Theissen method,
based on the data obtained from Pak Chong's agrometeorolo-
gical station, Pak Chong animal food station, and Lam Ta
Khong (M 38 C) station.   These  rainfall  data  can be sum-
marized as follows :-
Station Period    Range/Year     Average
(a..*)         (inn.)
Pak Chong Agromet    1968 - 1978     806.3 - 1487.3    1082.8
Pak Chong Animal Food   1967 - 1972  541.8 - 1377.3     880.5
K 38 C                1967 - 1988    527.7 - 1255.0     928.3
Total average         1967 - 1988    563.0 - 1339.1     990.4
The detailed result is shown in the Appendix.  The estimated
inflow was between 110-495 mcm., the average was 261.32 mcm.
from  1963  to  1989.   The evaporation and percolation loss
were measured at the Lam Ta Khong Dam to be between 1187.4
to 1860.6 mm. per year.  The average was 1547.5 mm. per year
from 1973 to 1987.   More information is shown in the Appen-
dices.  The accurate  percolation is difficult to be carried
out due to higher expense compared to the other parameters.
Moreover, the reservoir has been built for more than 22
years. The surface of the reservoir Is at present covered
by  fine  particles  due to  sedimentation.   An  experiment
had been performed along the boundary of the reservoir. The
results did not indicate any interesting information.
Figure 3-1 and 3-2 show the average rain and streamflow data
that  correspond  with  each  other.   From the study of the
3-2



watershed area, the data can be summarized as followed :

The  length  of the  main stream is 61.0 km.   The length of
stream from outlet to centroid of the area is 29.0 km. Thq
average slope is 0.00277.
By using the Inflow data from 1963 to 1988, rainfall from
the same period and the characteristics of watershed, a
SCS model was calibrated and used for simulation.   However,
the calibration was done on the equivalente amount basis.
The comparison of rain and inflow can be seen in Figures
3-1 to 3-4. The results of model calibration and simulation
are shown in Appendices and in Figures 3-5, 3-6. However,
the accuracy of the model depends on the rain fall data that
should be well distributed.

3.1.4.1 Construction Period Impact
The construction site has been selected from Areas II and I,
the Areas III and IV will not be disturbed. Area II Is
selected for reservoir construction and area I for the
intake  and  outlet  structure.    Area  I is at  the  lower
reservoir, especially under the water.
3.1.4.2 Long-Teru Impact
There will be no effect at all.   The upper  reservoir which
will be constructed in Area II is on the top of the Khao Yal
3-4



Tiang.   There is no  watershed  area of the upper reservoir
except the surface area of the reservoir. If there Is no
reservoir, about 50Q of rainfall on this area will flow to
the Lam Ta Khong reservoir.   The other 50 percent will flow
to the opposite site. This is because the location of the
upper reservoir is on the border line of Lan Ta Khong
watershed area.
It can be concluded that there will be no changes of hydro-
logical condition In the area due to the project development.

3.2.2    METHODOLOGY
The project work has been undertaken through the following
steps
1) Compilation  of existIng  date and  prelilnary
lnvestlgatlon   of  the  concerned  areas  for :
geologlcal data, ground water,and other physical
characteristics.
2) Surface reconnaissance has been carried out in
the field in connection with air-photo, LANSAT
Image interpretation,-existing topographic and
hydrogeological map.
3) Investigation of groundwater has been performed
with respect of rock types affecting aquifer
properties and groundwater level potentiometric
elevation or static level above mean sea-level
(MSL).
4) An analysis and evaluation of ground water
condition of the project area have been sum-
marized according to the above data.
5) The conceptual model of ground water have been
developed to predict the recharge and flow of
ground water in the regime due to changes in
land uses and changes in ground cover due to the
Project development.
6) Mitlgation measures   and monitoring   program
have been developed accordingly.
3.2.3    EXIETI3G BEVIUOCOED OAL CONDIOSE
Generally, groundwater in the area of UR-i, UR-II, and
UR-III occurs in consolidated sedimentary rocks of Mesozoic
age which are known as the Korat Group including Pra Wihan
formation, coarse-grained sandstone and siltstone of uncon-
fined-and confined aquifer, while clay layer, claystone, and
mudstone play the role of.an impermeable layer. The depths
of ground water level are between less than 10 meters and
3-10



nearly 50 meters  below the  land  surface.    The amount of
ground water Is relatively small in those aquifers except in
the fractured zone such as cracks, joints , beddlng planes,
weathered zone which give a higher yield of about less than
5 m3/hr depending on the size and continuity of the fracture
and the complexity of joints system.
The project areas of UR-I and WR-I have been intensively
investigated   for  groundwater   condition  thanks  to  the
existing ten test holes which were drilled by EGAT-team.
The data on land surface and water level elevations have
been plotted in Flgure 3-7 to 3-14. The cross sections data
are shown in Figures 3-15.    Generally, the land surface of
the project area was highest at the DHU-3 or about 660
meters above  MSL.    It  then gradually  drecreased through
DHU-5 at the center of the reservoir to DHW-1 , a little bit
higher  than  630  meters.  After that, the land surface was
rapidly decreased along the line of water way to the
elevation of nearly 270 meters near the dam. The surface
shape of water level elevation was almost the same as land
surface.   The  highest  water  level elevation of about 600
meters was observed at the area of the upper reservoir and
then the elevation steeply decreased along the water way to
about 260 meters near the dam. However, the depths of water
level of Area UR-1 were approximately between 14-48 meters.
The smallest depth and highest elevation were at the center
of the  reservoir.    The WR-1 area has the  depths of water
level between about 6-38 meters ranging from large dept near
the pumped storage to small depth near the dam. In addition,
the contour maps of the groundwater level elevations before
and after heavy rain were constructed as shown in Figure
3-8 to 3-14.     The  effect of heavy rain raised the water
level about 5-30 meters. Two months after this the ground-
water levels were gradually decreased over the area between
about one to nearly 30 meters. Finally, the plot shows that
the water divide is located at the upper reservoir area,
Therefore at the point groundwater flow is diverted into the
eastern valley and the other western side into the dam.

3.2.4    IMPACT ASSESSMENT
3.2.4.1 Constructlon Period Impact
In the course of this study, the amount of water drained ln-
to the excavated cavity has been estimated. The computation
of water way has been determined by using the radius of
cylinder or tunnel which ls equal to 6 meters. The computa-
tion was divided into two parts, namely horizontal and in-
clinal  tunnel.   The  horizontal  tunnel  starts  from  the
generator house to the inlet of water way at the dam. The
computation was based on aquifer data from test hole DHT-1
which consisted of Phu Kradung formation with layers of silt
sandstone, quartzitic sandstone and siltstone. The summation
of transmissivity for fractured zone derived from the aquifer
was 24 meters thick, This was equal to 2;134 m2/d. Thus the
average hydraulic conductivity would be 0.0889 m/d. However,
If the hydraulic gradient of the flow was 0.48 meter/meter,
the computation yielded a discharge along the tunnel of about
1.609 m3/d per meter length of tunnel. In addition, the es-
timated flow would be lower for non-aquifer or massive part
of the rocks. Thus, the total flow through the total length
of the horizontal tunnel will be smaller than that. According
to the lnclinal parts from pumped storage to the generator
house, the toal discharge would be a little higher than the
horizontal one. Hence, a small discharge could be expected
near the pumped storage and a large discharge near the
generator house due to increase of hydraulic gradient with
depth and vertical cut of tunnel through many aquifer layers.
With reference to the average hydraulic conductivity of DHW-
1 of 0.1276 mId and the flow hydraulic gradient of 0.50 meter
per meter the estimatlon indicated a discharge of 2.406 m3/d
per meter length of tunnel. Furthermore, the discharge of
unlined conduits for the road located on the left and right
side of water way from the generator house to the highway has
been determined based on the average aquifer permeability of
DHW-2 of 0.2440 m/d and the hydraulic gradient of 0.5 meter/
meter. The result disclosed the discharge value of 4.601 m3/d
3-17



per moter lentgth of condu$t,.Henco, the discharge was rather
high due to the complex fractzire zone of quartzltlc sandstone
at the depth of 216 to 231 meters from land surface, Other-
wise the discharge of other parts would be much smaller espe-
cially for non fractured -zone. In terms of drained water
during the construction ofthe upper reservoir, the flow has
also been calculated according to the hydraulic conductivity
of 12.967 m/d, and the hydraulic gradient of 0.1 moetr/mstor.
The permeabllity of  quartzitic  sandstone  at the  reservoir
base was found as low am the impermeable strata. Therefore,
the discharge water would be about 9 m3/min. However, ground-
water discharge Into the excavated cavity would fluctuate
with  seasons.   The higher  discharge  was estimated to take
place in the rainy season and the lower one in the dry
season.
3.2.4.2 Long-Turm Zupact
In order to find the -Ipact of the upper reservoir on the
groundwater regime during the operation period, a conceptual
model  was applied  by using  the  following  data;  average
annual rainfall at Lam Ta Khong Station of the years 1967-
1988 (928.25 m.), reservoir lined area (250,000 m2), assumed
rainfall  Infiltration (35% of the average annual rainfall),
the aquifer premeability (0.1728 mid) based on quartzitic
sandstone, and aqulfer thickness (50 meter.).
The  model  outputs  are   shown  in Figures  3-16 to  3-17
including  groundwater level contour and surface plot.   The
upper reservoir wll .decrease the water level underlay from
highest level .-at tIue- .en%d of Septiaber 1990 to about 36
meters at the  center of the  reservoir or about 10 meters
under the reservoir base level. Therefore, the groundwater
divide would change to a new location at site DBU-3 and
around the edge of the upper reservoir. :However, the effect
on local groundwater supply will be wvry small due  to small
discharge and very far well field fur*grillage water supply.
In contrast to the upper reservoir, the effect-of water way

3.3      8URFACE AND GROUND WATER QUALITY
3.3.1      MOTRODUCTION
The study of the quality of surface water in Lam Ta Khong
Reservoir, Lam Ta Khong canal upstream, ground water near
the reservoir, and the characteristics of sediment was
carried out for the analysis of their physical, chemical,
biological, and pesticide  characteristics.   The purpose of
the study was to evaluate the impacts of the Project on the
water quality, to suggest mitigation plans, and to carry out
follow-up studies of the water quality after the project was
in operation.
Objectives
1) To investigate the existing condition and trends
of the Lam Ta Khong Reservoir water and ground
water quality.
2) To-provide water quality data for reservoir
aquatic system modelling.
3) To assess the impact of the water quality in the
Lam Ta Khong Reservoir on water use, i.e.  water
supply, fisheries, irrigation, etc.
4) To recommend appropriate mitigation measures and
monitoring program.
Scope of Work
The aquatic environment studied for water quality was the
Lam Ta Khong Reservoir. Furthermore, the water quality in
ground water and related water regime in the vicinity of the
Lam Ta Khong  Reservoir was also  investigated.   For  the
reservoir, the assessment was conducted on the existing
condition and trends of water quality.   The  data  obtained
represented the conditions varying over a one-year period.
The water quality parameters considered were those  pertain-
ing to the water quality requirement for community water
supply, and the requirement to maintain the balance of
3-21



aquatic ecosystem. Following the assessment of the Impact
of  the  Project  development upon  water   quality,   the
mitigation plan and the monltoring program for water quality
were prepared.
3.3.2      TRODOLOWY
1) Reviewed existing data on physical, chemical,
and bacteriological characteristics of water  in
the Lam Ta Rhong Reseryoir, Lam Ta Rhong canal
upstream and ground water; including pesticides
In the water and sediment in the Lam Ta Khong
Reservoir.
2) Prepared sampling equipments, vehicles, and
laboratory equipments and supplies  ;   i.e.,
sample bottles, reagents, standard solutions,
and field equipments for in situ measurement.
3) Field procedure: In situ measurement was carried
out for these parameters: temperature, dissolved
oxygen, pH and conductivity.   For the remaining
parameters, water sample collection for labora-
tory analysis was made at 0.5 m. depth from
water surface.   Sediment sample  collectLon was
made  as  grab samples at the  top  layer of
reservoir bed using special equipment.    Ground
water sample collection was made at the depth of
0.5 m  from  well water surface.  Appropriate
sample  preservation  as   recommended  in the
Standard Methods (APHA, 1985) was applied.
4) Analysis was made at the Environmental Engil-
neering Department and the Chemistry Department
of 11U.  Methods  of determination of water
sample were those in the Standand Methods (APRA
1985).
5) Saven sampling stations were located in seven
zones representing reservoir spatial charac-
teristic variation. The sampling stations were
located approximately at the center of esch zone
3-22



area. One station in the Lam Ta Khong canal
before entering the reservoLr ls selected for
surface water quality.   One shallow well at Wat
Khao Nol near the Lam Ta Khong Reservoir was
selected for the investigation of ground water
quality.    Field   investigation  and  sampl:ng
stations shown in Figure 3-18.
6) Data analysis was performed by drawinq conclus-
Ions from existing and current data in order to
determine the two trends of water quality, i.e.,
with and without Project development.
7) Mitigation plan and monitoring program were
developed.

3.3.3.1  Burface Vator Quality
Lm Ta Khong reservolr receives water from three canals: Lam
Ta Rhong and Khlong Phai canals flow into the reservoir at
Zone 7, and Huay Kin Lap canal flows into the reservoir at
Zone 5. The study over the past year revealed that during
the season when water was copious, the quality of water at
Zone 7 and 5 fluctuated, greatly.  The   results  which  are
hown In Table A-7 to A-14 (Appendix) are summarized as
follows.
Physical water quality The parameters that showed the most
obvious change were  turbidity  and color.   In  the  rainy
season when their values were the highest, turbidity was
1960 NTU with 496 color unit at Station 5, while that at
Station 7 was 1900 NTU with 480  color unit. At the  end of
the rainy season, turbidity at Statilon 5 decreased to
between 7.0-5.3 NTU with 2.0-10.0 color unit, while that at
Station 7 was between 3.0-4.6 NTU with 4.0-33.0 color unit.
The two parameters did not vary much at other stations over
the year, except for Station 6 which is adjacent to and
affected by Station 7. Turbidity at Station 6 was higher

than at the rest of the stations in the rainy season with
660 NTU and 188 color unit whereas in the dry season,
turbidity was 2.6 NTU with 3.0 color unit. The average
turbidity values for Stations 4, 3, 2, and 1 were 6.22 NTU
with 10.50 color unit, -8.83 NTU with 24.47 color unit, 6.20
NTU with 9.12 color unit, and 6.60 NTU  with   17.42   color
unit accordingly.  The conductivity and pH values  did   not
vary much over the seasons. The conductivity values at
Stations 5 and 7 were lowered a little In the rainy season
because of the dilution of rain water, they increased in the
dry season within the range  of  240-377 us.   The values at
other stations were between 200-376 us. the pH values for
all stations were between 6.8-8.16.
Chemical water quality   It was found that  the  quality  of
water at stations 5 and 7 was lower than at other  stations.
The values for the following parameters: biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand  (COD), and  suspended
solid (SS) were highest in the rainy season with 8.03, 12.
00, and 768mg/1  accordingly  at  Station  5.   The  highest
values  at  Station  7 were  9.15,  16.30,  and  828   mg/i
accordingly. The values for these parameters at Station 1
were lowest with 2.55, 7.60, and 4.0 mg/l accordingly.
Other  parameter   values   did   not  vary  much  in   each
season. for example, the values for alkalinlty, total
hardness of heavy metals   did   not   exceed  the  standard
level 2 surface water. As for  the   values   for  dissolved
oxygen (DO), those at Stations  5   and   7   were  lower at
other stations with 5.00-6.70 mg/l at Station 5, and 5.9-
7.50 mg/l at Station 7. aquatic life can still live at these
values.
Biological water quality In the rainy season, microorganisms
were found in larger quantity than in  other  seasons.   The
largest quantity was found at Stations 5 and 7: with over
2400. MPN/100 ml of total  coliform,  and  170 MPW/100 ml of
fecal coliforn at Station 5, and over 2400 MPN/100 ml of
total coliform,- and over 2400 NP/300 mil of fecal coliform
3-25



at Station 7. After the ralny season, the microorganisms
did resulting In a much lower quantity detected even at
Stations 5 and 7. The biological water quality at Station I
was good all year with an average value for total coliform
of 4.67 MPN/100 ml and 0.33 MPN/1O ml for fecal coliform.
As for pestlcide content in sampled water, pesticides of the
organochlorine family were found at Station 7 only. p_-p'-DDE
ug/l was found to be lower than 0.1 ug/l.   In  the  vlnter,
only p-p'-TDE of 0.2 ug/l was found at Station 5. No
pestlcide was found in the summer. This was possibly due to
the .small amount of pesticides washed into the reservoir
which got diluted to the point of no  detection.  When the
different aspects of water quality were compared with the
NEB standard, the quality was at Class 2 water quality which
Is a clean water source usable for cocsumption after a
general treatment.  The water Is suitable for aquatic-life
conservation and favorable to fishery for -the purpose of
fishery and recreation.
3.3.3.2 Ground Water Quallty
Ground water at Wat Khao Noi sampling site was found to have
physical, chemical, and biological characteristics within
the  NEB  standards as shown In  Tables  3-1 and 3-2.    The
result of water analysis over the past year which was shown
In Table 3-2 was simmiarized as follows. In the rainy season,
the values for turbidity and color of ground water were
highest with 181 NTU and 600 color unit.   In other seasons,
they were in the range of 3.00-5.20 NTU and 0.00-7.00 color
unit. The pH value did not vary much over the year with 6.
80 -7.75, and the  averge  value was  7.29.   The value for
dissolved solid was between 580-780 ag/l, and was found to
be lower in the rainy season than in the summer. The
detected amount of chloride was between 20-40 mg/I, and was
also higher In the rainy season than in the summer. As for
heavy metals, only a rather small amount of iron, 0.17- 5.00
slgj, was found. Manganese was found in a very small amount,

0.00-0.20 mg/I. Other toxic heavy metals were not found.
Regarding the amount of nitrate and phosphate, a very small
amount was found, 0.03 mg/l of nitrate and 0.90 mg/l of
phosphate.
3.3.3.3  Sediment
The area where the largest amount of pesticide was detected
was Zone 7 which was one of the reservoir Inflows that
flowed through an area that was mainly used for agriculture.
Only one group of pesticides, organochlorine, was found In a
very small amount, in the rainy season.    During the winter
and summer, the sediment was wldely distributed along the
bed of the reservoir causing the pesticide content to become
less concentrated.   Thls is shown in Table A-15 (Appendix).
The table reveals that only pesticides of the organochlorine
family were found. The amount of pesticides remained in
sediment was largest in the rainy season at the area around
Station 7. The amount detected was 0.045 mg/I. The amount
decreased after the rainy season.   The amount of pesticides
at other stations was a little higher in the rainy season,
and was between 0.0O0-0.019 mg/l. It could be concluded that
pesticides were present In sediment in a small quantity.
Since no standard for pesticide presence in sediment has
been established, it is not possible to make a comparison.
Nevertheless, when the amount was compared with the standard
for surface water, it was still lower than the acceptable
amount.
As for the BOD of the sediment, the BOD value was higher
after a rain and gradually decreased when the summer
arrived. The highest value of 1642 mg/l was found at
Station 4, and the next highest amount of 1440 mg/l was
found at Station 7. The lowest amount of 360 mg/l was  found
in the summer at Station 4. The sediment studied was taken
from the  surface  not  from  a  depth.   Consequently,  the
parameter values varied according to  seasons.   If  samples
had been taken at different depths and the parameter values
3-29



averaged, there would not have been much variation in the
parameter values.
3.3.4   IMPACT ASSE6SMENT
3.3.4.1 Construction Period Impact
During construction, soil and rocks will be dug up and
dumped at a disposal area around the storage tank. A tunnel
will be excavated, and soil will be disposed at another
disposal area at the edge of the reservoir. The Impact will
be caused by soil disposal at the edge of the reservoir.
During the rainy season, the soil will be eroded and flown
into the reservoir causing more turbidity in the water. This
in turn will affect the ecology system of the reservoir
which will be discussed in detail in sections 4.1 and 4.2:
Aquatic Biology and  Fisheries.   Such  turbidity,  however,
will not have any effects on the water around the water
supply intake point because the point is approximately 4.5
km. away. Soil particles will have settled before they reach
the intake point.
3.3.4.2 Long-Term Impact
During the operation of the Project, water will be pumped up
to the storage tank and discharged into the reservoir. It is
possible for small fish and organisms to be pumped to the
storage tank as well, inspite of a prevention measure.
These organisms will die because of a high pressure change.
Their carcasses will become food for the fish in the
reservoir.  If they are not   eaten   up,  they  will  float
around the water discharge point, The discharged water at
the bottom of the reservoir at the velocity of 1 m/sec will
disperse the sediment with an average BOD of 782 mg/l. This
will cause a higher BOD content which inturn will lower the
dissolved  oxygen  content.   Moreover  the  discharge   and
pumping periods are close together this will result in
incomplete sedimentation of particles. Thus, pumped water
3-30



will contain some of the carcasses and sediment but the
violent movement during pumping and discharging will result
in a large amount of oxygen ln the water. The water will be
stored in the upper reservolr during the day for some time.
Consequently, the water discharged into the lower reservoir
will contain more dissolved oxygen and lower  BOD.   Besides
the movement of water at the surface will make it possible
for oxygen In the air to dissolve into  the  water.   It  is
expected that the quality will not change much from normal
conditions.
In  conclusion,  the  Impacts  on  the  water  quality   eg.
turbidity and dissolved oxygen will occur only during a
short period in  a  day.   After  this  period,  the  normal
quality of water will be restored by nature.

Pak Chang Agrometeorological Station 1969-1989
Evaporation
The maximum and minimum evaporation rates occurring in March
and October were 167.9 and 111.0 mm., respectively. For the
whole records, the highest occured ln 1972 (1925 mm.)   Thls
trended to  decrease.   The  average  for the whole year was
1682.4 mm.  This can be confirmed by mass curve which begins
to deviate in 1981.
RelatiLve Humidity
The monthly averages of relative humidity were between 65.1-
76.7 percent. The minimum and maximum occurring in March
and September were 65.1 and 76.7 percent, respectively. The
humidity was highest in 1970 and lowest in 1987 (76.8 and
64.6  respectively).   From  the yearly average, it can be
seen that the relative humidity tended to decrease from.
1969-1987 and then increased again in 198B. The mass curve
shows the deviation in 1981 where a slight change can be
seen.
Sunshine
The average monthly sunshine ranged between 125.0 in August
and 214.8 hrs per month. The records show some fluctuations.
The mass curve begins to deviate in 1981 with a very small
slope.
Toeperature
The average temperature was highest in April (28 degree
celcius) and lowest in December-(21.4 degree celcius). The
average for the whole year was 25.6 degree celcius. The
hightest  maximum  was 38.8 degree celclus which occured in
1988 and the lowest  minlmum was 3.6 degree celcius In 1975.
For yearly average, the records were normal.

Solar Radiation
Solar radiation was maximum in April and minimum In Novem-
ber. This ranged between 11.017 to 9.249 k.cal/sq.cm/month.
The records show the highest energy in 1986 (127.671 k.cal/
sq.cm/year) and minimum in 1985 (115.905 k.cal/sq.cm/year).
Nakorn Ratchasima Station 1951-1989
Wind
The maximum average wind velocity occurring In July was 28.9
knots/month. The lowest was In September (17.7 knots/month)
The average for the whole year was 22.2 knots/month and
tended to decrease from 1951 to 1975.   This  can be seen in
mass curve that the curve begins to deviate in 1963.
Lam Ta Khong Station (M38 C) 1967-1988
Rain
The maximum rain was 244.6 sm. which occurred in September
and 2.4 mm. in December. The average for the whole year was
928.3 mm. The total rain at this station ranged from 527.7
to 1255 mm. and fluctuated from year to year. However,
the trend of curve is normal. This can be confirmed by the
mass curve.
3.4.4     IMPACT ASSESSMENT
3.4.4.1   Construction Period Impact
The Project construction area is very small compared to the
size of the  Lam Ta Khong  watershed  area.   The upper con-
struction area is 2.23 sq.km. or only 0.156 percent when
compared to the total area.   Moreover, the  tunnel  will be
3-41



constructed under the ground without disturbl?g the ground
surface. This very small area of construction will have no
influence on the climatological condition of the area.
3.4.4.2   Long-Term Impact
No effect on the operation is foreseeable, the reason is the
same as above.
3-42



3.5       ATMOSPHERIC QUALITY
3.5.1     INTRODUCTION
Atmospheric quality In the Project area Is involved when the
Project construction is  brought  about.   During  the  con-
struction period impacts due to transportation, tunnelling,
and excavation are major activities. Appropriate mitigation
should be proposed for the Project construction so that the
impact on atmospheric quality can be minimized.
Objoctives
1) To investigate the existing atmospheric quality
in  the  proposed  Project  development   areas
seasonally.
2) To predict impacts on atmospheric quality due
to the Project development with particular
emphasis on the construction stage.
3) To develop mitigation measures to be applied
during the Project construction to prevent
undesirable impacts on the atmospheric quality.
Scope of Work
The investigation was emphasized on the atmospheric quality
parameters relating to the Project construction activities,
i.e., particulates, noise and vibration in the areas which
will be affected by the proposed Project development.
3.5.2     METHODOLOGY
The task has been carried out through the following steps:
1) Preliminary   investigation  of  the  concerned
areas.
2) Reviewing the existing data on meteorology
relating to the atmospheric quality in the
proposed Project areas.
3-43



3,
3) Seasonal observation of the existing conditions
pertairing to the atmospheric quality In the
Project areas.
4) Reviewing   the  Project  feasibility  plan  to
identify the activities which may cause the
atmospheric quality Impacts                                  4
5) Developing appropaiate measures for mitigation
the impacts.
3.5.3     EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
Atmospheric condition of the Project construction slte is
considered mainly on the Identified areas as shown in Figure
3-26 i.e., (1) upper reservoir area, (2) switch yard area,
(3) intake and outlet area, and (4) muck disposal area.
Another area along the Mittraparp Highway is also considered
as a line source due to automobile emission when traffic
flow is taken place.
The facilities and activities during construction period of
such areas can be summarized In the Table 3-3.

Construction Areas.

5. Kitraparp         5.1 Trucks and       5.1 Transportation
Highway               Vehicles
The seasonaly atmospherlc condition of the area, in terms of
wind, temperature, and rain, were presented in section 3.4.
Based on the meteorological data, it was found that wind is
the significant effect on atmospheric condition.   Direction
of wind and its velocity is shown in Figure 3-26.
In  the  upper  reservoir  area  there  is  no   significant
difference among the seasons in terms of emission, noise,
and  vibration  because  of  less  traffic  on  this   area.
Emission due to traffic  flow  can  be  dispersed  into  the
atmospheric surrounding due to wlnd effect.   For  the  line
source on Mittraparp Highway, emission Is also dispersed
into the open area (i.e.,  Lam  Ta  Khong  Reservoir).   The
probable effect due to emission may be minimized in both
areas.
3.5.4     IMPACT ASSESSMENT
3.5.4.1   Construction Period Impact
The impact on atmospheric quality will be occured during
construction period due to the activities in the  fur  areas
mentioned earlier.  The activities, areas to  be  disturbed,
and cause of impact/significant level can be lnvestigated
and summarized in Table 3-4.

The most important aspect concerning the impacts during
construction period Is the impacts from blasting which will
be performed in the excavation works at the upper reservoir
site and the waterway/transmission  line/entrance   tunnels.
The impacts wlll be in the forms of vibration, noise, and
flying rocks.
In the Project construction, all blasting works will be
under close controlled such that the vibration  displacement
velocity at 50 m depth below ground surface will be less
than 50 mm/sec as recommended by the United Bureau of Mines.
The vibration at thls level will not disturb any geological
structure or cause land slide.
Noise from blasting in the tunnel will go in the direction
of the tunnel ports, which face toward the open space of Lam
Ta Khong reservoir. The-impact is estimated as less as to
be ignored.
Flying rocks from blasting at the upper reservoir site will
be controlled not to fly outside the  excavating  site,   So
the impact will be small.
3.5.4.2   Long-Tern Impact
There will be no activity causing impact on atmosperic
quality during the Project operation period. Thus, no long-
term impact Is ai-itlcipated.

306      SOIL FERTILITY, EROSION AND SEDTATION
3.6.1    ImnODUCTION
The environmental assessment of soil fertility, erosion and
sedimentation induced by the project was attempted to
Identify short-tenm and long-term impacts.   The  impact  of
the project on soil fertility, erosion and sedimentatlon was
a theme of multidispllnary factors concerned. These included
physical environments of the area and human activities
acting upon the area.    The assessment was  based  on  the
present situation compared with the future possible Impact.
This study involved the context regarding physical factors,
not the economy policy.  It should be noted that information
used for assessment was based mainly on scientific methods
rather  than  social  aspects  which  could  be   relatively
dynamic.
Objectives
The objectives of-this study were to:
1) Identify soil fertility class, soil erosion
potential and sedimentation in the study area.
2) Assess the impact of the project development  on
soil fertility, soil erosion and sedimentation.
3.6.2    METHODOLOGY
Soil fertility
Land quality in terms of soil fertility assessment was
carried out using the method developed by Nyandat and
Muchena (1980). This method was suggested by FAO (198l),
and based on combined chemical properties. These properties
include  some   characteristics   diagnostic   of   nutrient
retention capacity, availability of treating nutrient and
retention of a combined land quality. This quality refers
to the capacity of the soil to release plant  nutrients  and
3-49



to retain added nutrients  against  losses.   The  following
steps were carried out in the assessment:
1) Composite samples of soil for each terrain and
landuse type were collected at 30 cm. depth. The
samples were then air dried and sieved through a
2 m.m. sized screen.
2) The soil samples were chemlcally analyzed.
3) An evaluation of the class is based on a combi-
nation of 3 sub-classes. (Rl, R2 and R3) The
chemical properties used for each sub-class can
be summarized as follows :

Soil erosion
Detailed assessments of soil erosion can be carried out
through field  experiments during  long time  series.   Many
research studies have been undertaken to establish mathe-
matical models for predicting soil erosion.   The  Universal
Soil Loss Equation (USLE) is the most well known model.
The objectives of this study were to evaluate and map soil
loss in the project area.
The  Universal  Soil  Loss  Equation  (USLE)  developed   by
Wischueier and Smith (1978) was adopted.

A = RKLSCP
A  =  Soil loss
R  =  Rainfall factor
K  =  Soil erodibility factor
LS = Slope factor
C  =  Crop management factor
P  =  Conservation factor
The Department of Land Development undertook the experiments
regarding each factor in Thailand. (Srikhajon K, 1988). The
estimation in The  Lam Ta  Khong area  was  based  on  the
previous study mentioned earlier. In addition, a number of
factors were compiled from topographic map (LS), soil map
(R), satellite data (C) and field  investigation.   Rainfall
factor was acquired from-30 years record of the Department
of Meteorology.
Sedimentation
This study was conducted using high resolution satellite
imagery. Automated classification of suspended load in the
reservoir was undertaken using Landsat TM data acquired on
November 1990.    It was apparent that TM band 1  (0.45-0.52
um) was capable of detecting sediment turbidity in water.
Density slicing of pixel values was performed using the
Meridian Image Processing System available at Khon Kaen
Univesity.

3.6.3.1 Soil Fertility
The chemical properties of soil are shown in Table 3-5.
Soil fertility evaluation was carried out by random sampling
of soil on the terrain and landuse types (see Figure 3-27
and attached landuse map).   Consideration was given only to
soil quality and capability in terms of combined chemical
properties.

The results obtained can be concluded hereunder:
1) The soils of the flooded plain and the dissected
erosion surface In the area are classified as
high to moderate fertility soils.
2) The soils found on the other terrains are low to
very low in fertllity.
3) Fertile soil is dependent upon the underlying
parent rocks.   Soils derived from limestone and
shale are rich in plant nutrients whereas those
from sandstone are poor.
4) Referring to soil map generated by the Depart-
ment of Land Development, irreqular soil depth
with a number of rock outcrops have been found.
Slope complex is the main mapping unit in the
study area. This mapping unit consists of two
or more recognized taxonomic units which may be
similar or contrasting but occurring together in
a more or less regular pattern, and are so
intimately associated geographically.
3.6.3.2 Soil Erosion Potential
Soil loss in 'the pumped storage project" area is summarized
in Table 3-6 and in the attached map (Figure 3-28). It
should be noted that the estimation of soil loss was based
on the USLE which consists of a number of factors as
described above. The C and P factors are dynamic, have a
wide range of  variation  and  are   dependent  upon   human
activities.   The C factor varies from time to time.   The P
factor in this  estimation  was  assigned  as  maximum.   No
measurement on soil conservation was done.
Soil loss in the area has a wide range of severity depending
greatly upon the slope factor. The figures account for 0.64
T/ha/yr to over 800 T/ha/yr.

3.6.3.3 Sedimentation
The map of the suspended load in the reservoir is attached
in this report (Figure 3-29).   The resultant  map  obtained
from Landsat TM data has 4 classes of suspended load: very
low, low, moderate and high.   In this regard, the suspended
load was  qualitatively  assessed.   The resultant map could
be matched to water quality to quantitatively identify
suspended load in the reservoir. As shown in the map, the
suspended load Is  higher  In   quantity  according  to  the
darkness of the blue color. The suspended load near the dam
site is lower than that of the upper part. The left side of
the reservoir contains lower suspended load than the right
side.   The reasons behind this occurrence should be further
studied.                        I
The result obtained and presented here is referred to the
condition on November 1990. There may be different patterns
in some period of the years. The monitoring of this pattern
can be done by using multi-temporal satellite images.
3.6.4    IMPACT ASSESSENT
Soil Pertility
As shown in the landuse map, (Figure 5-26) the pumped
storage area to be selected will fall on the gently dipping
plateau with field crop and fruit trees, and the soil being
low/very low in fertility. In terms of soil quality, the
area is potentially low in crop production. High fertilizer
input and conservation measures are needed to increase the
agricultural utilizition of land. The area, comenidered only
inherently fertile, is unsuitable for crop production.   The
selection criteria for pumped storage site Is based on a
number of parameters  concerned.    The  information of soil
chemical properties provides a supplemental parameter in
this regard. In landuse planning, high fertile soil is
reserved for agricultural use whereas low fertile one is
used for other purpose. In this case the pumped storage

Boil erosion
In the USLE, the modification of C and P factors will lead
to change In the soil loss. During the construction period,
the vegetation cover will be cleared to a certain extent.
As a result, the project activities (construction, land
clearing) will enhance severity of soil erosion at this
period.   When the construction, reforestation  and  conser-
vation practices are completed, soil erosion can be greatly
reduced.
Sedimentation
The proposed pumped site in the -eservoir corresponds to
water with moderate suspended load. The suspended load is
posltively correlated  to  the  soil  erosion.   During  the
construction period, the project activities will offer the
opportunity in increasing suspended load in the right side.
This will be enhanced in the year having lower water level.
When the project is completed and reforestation and conser-
vation measures under taken, the suspended load will be
reduced to a great extent. As a consequence, there is in
the long run less impact on the sedimentation in the
reservoir.   But  the  pumping  activities   will   increase
suspended load In the pumping reservoir area.

3.7      GEOLOGY, SEISMOLOGY AND INERJAL RESOURCES
3.7.1    INTRODUCTION
Objoctives
The objectives of this topic is to (a) locate geologic
features which may be hazardous to or may obstruct the
construction or operation, (b) evaluate the potentiality of
mineral resources of the proposed sites and adjacent areas,
(c) draw recommended mitigation or development plan on site
preparation and construction.
Scope of Work :
There was a review of geologic setting of the project area.
using existing data such as air-photos, satellite imagery,
geologic maps and geologic reports of the area made by the
Department of Mineral Resources, together with seismiclty
maps and reports as well as the information available from
the project  feasibillty  study.   Field  observations  were
undertaken after the study of existing data study had been
compLeted in order to fullfill the completion of the data.
The mitigation and/or development program is also recom-
mended based on the results of the study.
3.7.2    HETHODOLOGY
The task was conducted through visual alr-photos and satel-
lite imagery interpretation, geologic and seismotectonic
maps study in order to get the overview of the Project area.
After reviewing the existing data, geological field surveys
were  also  carried  out.    Geologic  data  including  the
distribution of rock formations, geologic structures, stra-
tification and faults were mapped.   The presence of condi-
tions resulting from intense tropical weathering I.e. depth
of weathering surface, degree of consolidation and its
relationship to geomorphology and rock types were also
3-63



recorded. Geophysical survey using Gamma-ray spectrometer
was carried out to measure the radiometric energy that
might radiate  from  radioactive  minerals.   The rocks and
soils or sediments are also collected, microscopically
identified and evaluated as construction materials or
economic  deposits.    All of the  obtained information was
used to draw the conclusion concerning geologically environ-
mental setting.   The Project activities were considered in
geological polnt of view to obtain the suggestion of
optimization and/or appropriate development program.
3.7.3    EXISTING ENIONMENTAL CONDrTIONS
(A). Geology
The geology of the study areas comprises two main rock
groups (Figure 3-30 a) : (a) Folded sedimentary and igneous
rocks outside the Projedt area somewhat western and south-
western part from the basin of Pak Chong district. (b)
Mountains along the margin of Khorat plateau consisting of
nonmarine sedimentary rocks of the Triassic to Cretaceous
period of Mesozoic era.    The  rocks  in  group (a) are the
so-called Ratburl group mainly-consisting of shale, mudstone,
limestone, chert and sandstone.   The igneous rocks are com-
posed of granodiorite, granite, andesite and rhyolite. This
rock group forms  numerous  small folds trending eastwest in
axes.    A number of high angle faults  with a length of the
order of 10 km. can be observed but there is no evidence
that the regional geologic structure could be affected. The
nonmarine rocks in group (b) are the so-called Khorat group
which unconformably overly the folded unit or Rathburi group
and igneous rocks.   The main  rock  types  are  sandstone,
mudstone,  shale,  claystone and partly conglomerate.   This
sequence is somewhere around 600 m. thick in the Project
area. (Figure 3-30 b) The relation between layers are con-
formable to the northwest-southeast strikes and the 5° -10°
northeast dips. The Phu Kradung formation consisting of
siltstone, sandstone and partly conglomerate and the Phra
Wihan formation consisting of white sandstone siltstone

and -claystone are  exposed in the Project area.  The age of
these formations Is Jurassic. The Rhorat group does not
fold but simply Inclined wlth low  angle  northeastward.  In
the Project area and the vicinity,   although  there are few
faults, high-angle faults are found running from north-
northwest to south-southeast at the western end of the
plateau, 7 km northwest of the Project area. Local faults
are also present.
The faults in the Project area are believed to have been
formed in old age and no report is available about an active
fault In the Quaternary period.
(B). Mineral Rbauresm
Unconsolidated materials in the Project area are colluvial
and tulus deposits in the foot sloping area and stream or
fluvial deposit along the river. The thickness of these
sediments  varies from place to place.  No such material as
fine aggregate for construction material can be observed.
Seven  stream  sediments  of the total weight of 35 kg. have
been identified  and no such economic minerals can be found.
The location of collected sediments sample is shown in
Figure 3-31.
Because of the similarity of geologic conditions, geophy-
sical investigation using gamma-ray spectrometer was perfor-
med only at the alternative site II.    Grid system was used
in this investigation.   The spacing of data point is  25 m.
Reading of total count, Uranium, Thorium and Potassium is
recorded.    The maximum reading is only 20 count per second
as maximum at the location of the bored holes. According to
the results, there is no radioactive mineral present in this
area.   The location of this lnvestigation Is- also shown  in
Flgure 3-30.

(C). Seismology
With the data obtalned from seismic observation network,
seismicity in Asia can be drawn by selecting the magnitude
of earthquake higher than 6. There are two kinds of regions
classifed, namely high seismic and low seismic regions.
According to this basis, Thailand can be considered a stable
selsmic region (Figure 3-32).
In   terms  of  structural  geology  and  tectonic  history,
Thailand can be divided Into three tectonic units (Figure
3-33): (1) Eastern Thailand represented by Khorat plateau,
(2) Central Thailand with the Gulf and lowland in the
central valley and (3) The western and northwestern mountain
range.   The intensity of earthquake is higher ln unit three
and lower in unit one.
The Project area is in tectonic unit one with only small-
size or local faults. There are no faults reported as
active ones in the country. Therefore, It seems to have no
direct relationship with the movement of faults or tectonic
activities.
3.7.4    XMPACT ASSESSMETM
The results of investigation reveal that geologic condition
of the Project area Is feasible.    The environmental impact
of the Project caused by geologic features can be cited as:
short or construction period and long-term or operation
period.
3.7.4.1 Construction Period Impact
The impact during the construction period seems to occur
from  rock  excavation.   ,The  specific rock types that may
cause  tremendous  dust  are  claystone  and  shale.   Since
mineral compositions of both rocks are nontoxic minerals,
there is no direct impact on the community outside Project

affected. The other impact that may occur is soil erosLon.
Debris from excavation may also be flown with surface
water causing deterioratlon of water quallty.
3.7.4.2 Long-Term Impact
Long-term   lmpact   due   to  geologic  settlng   or   post
construction period may not arise. The property of rocks In
the Project area that has to be studied for more detalls is
slake   durability  or  weatherinq  of  rocks  subjected  to
tropical climate.   The impact may not be direct to environ-
mental aspect but to the stability of the construction
structures. Regarding mineral resources deposit, there is
no impact because of Its low pdtentiality.

4.1      AQUATIC BIOLOGY
4.1.1    INTRODUCTION
Lam  Ta  Khong  Reservoir is a large area of  static,  fresh
water ecosystem wlth the surface area at H.W.L. of approxl-
mately 37.5 km2.    The reservoir is  shallower In the upper
reach than in the lower reach area.    Many rivers flow into
the reservoir for example, Lam Ta Khong River, Hual Khlong
Phai, Khlong Mo Tack, etc.   Most of these rivers flow In at
the upper reach of the reservoir and hence enhancing the
production potential of the area.
The objectives of this task were
1) To investigate the existing conditions and the
activities of aquatic communities.
2) To assess deleterious and beneficial impacts of
the proposed project on the aquatic communities
and activities.
3) To    recommend    the    mitigation/development
measures,  and  set up monitoring  programs  for
aquatic communities.
The scope of work was an follows
The aquatic biology of Lam Ta Khong Reservoir was studied.
The general characteristics of aquatic biology from related.
literatures and reports  were reviewed.   Field studles were
conducted  to  investigate  the  present  conditions.    The
parameters studied included plankton diversity and their
abundance, primary productivity, chlorophyll a content,
aquatic weeds and  benthic animals  in the  reservoir.   The
environmental impacts were identified together with the
mitigation/development plans and monitoring programs.

4.1.2    METhODOLOGY
The task uwai conducted us follows :
1) Information and data from related sources were
collected.
2) In   the  field  investigation,  seven  smapllng
statlons at the center of each zone (Figure 4-1)
were set to Investigate plankton diversLty and
their abundance, primary productlvity, chloro-
phyll a content, aquatlc weeds and benthos. The
investigation of these parameters were under-
taken three tlmes so that the information would
represent  the  three  seasons of the year, i.e.
the rainy season (5-7 October 1990), the cold
season (1-3 February 1991), and the dry season
(7-9 June 1991).    In addition,  chlorophyll a
content was monitored bimonthly through the one-
year period. The methods employed for collection,
preservation, and analysis were the 'Field and
Laboratory Methods for General Ecology' (Brower
and Zar, 1984) and the "Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewatarw (APRA,
AWWA, WPCF, 1985).
2.1) Plankton : Plankton samples were collected
from the water column of each sampling
station by flltering the water through
plankton net of 25 micrometer pore size.
The collected samples were preserved in 5%
formalin    solution    for      subsequent
identification and determination of their
abundance.
2.2) Primary Productivity : Field investigations
on prlmary productivity were conducted by
using the light and dark bottle method.
2.3) Chlorophyll a content : Chlorophyll a was
extracted from water sample collected from
the water tolumn of each sampllng statlon

2.4) Aquatic   Weeds   :  The   occurrence  and
distribution   of   aquatic   plants   were
recorded and quantified by representative
sampling with one-meter grids. The plant
specimens were collected and preserved for
further identification.
2.5) Benthos : Benthic animals were collected by
using the Ekman dredge. After being sifted
through a set of wire sieves, the specimens
were preserved in 5% formalin solution for
further identification and determination of
their density.
4.1.3    EXISTING EUVI  NHETL COnDITIONS
Plankton
The plankton community of Lam Ta Khong Reservior during the
study period can be classified into 6 phyla, 33 species.
These consisted of 4 phyla, 22 species of phytoplankton and
2 phyla, 11 species of zooplankton (see Tables 4-1 to 4-3.
The findings are as follows.
(a) In the rainy season (5-7 October 1990), it
was found that the number of plankton at the
seven zones ranged from 194.6 x 103 cells/na
(Station No.7) to 56,119.0 x 10 cells/n3
(Station No.1). The extreme difference of
plankton   density  among  the  seven  zones
especially those between the zones at the
upper   and  at  the  lower  reach  of   the
reservoir (Flgure 4-2 a) were caused by a
great quantity of dilutlon water in the
upper zones which flew in the reservoir as
a consequence of the very big storm two days
prior to the  investigation  period.  Phyto-
plankton found in  abundance was  iCZrocystis
sp.  while  the   zooplankton  were   Maine

macroce rpe and copepod nauplilus. There were
16 species of plankton found ln this season.
(b) In the cold season (1-3 February 1991), the
number  of  plankton  found  ranged   from
21,244.6 x 103 call/3 (Station No.2) to
77,642.5 x 103 cellsftP (Station No.7). The
zonal variation of plankton density -in the
cold season was not as high as that of the
rainy  season. However, exceptional   high
density of plankton was observed at zone 7
(Figure 4-2 b).    This was believed to be
due to the effect of high nutrient content
in the rivers that flow into the reservoir.
The phytoplankton species found in abundance
was Mtcrocystls op. while the abundant zoo-
plankton was Noine macrocarpa. Seventeen
species of plankton were found durlng this
period.
(c) The number of plankton found in the dry
season (7-9 June 1991) ranged from 20,586.2
z 103 cells/a2 (Station No.1) to 46,217.1 x
103 cells/m3 (Station No.7) (Figure 4-2 c).
The plankton density of the zones at the
upper reach of the reservoir (Zones 3, 5, 6
and 7) were considerably higher than those
of the zones at the lover reach (Zones 1, 2
and 4). Phormidluw sp. was the phytoplankton
species found in abundance  while the domi-
nant  zooplankton  species   was   copepod
nauplius.  Totally there were 26 species of
plankton found in this season.
Primary Productivity and Chlorophyll a Content
Primary productivity of the reservoir ranged from 121 to 750
zgC/t?/d, from 1,251 to 1,867 mgC/rP/d, and from 1,690 to
2,866 mg Ct/X)d in the rainy, cold and dry season respec-
tively (Table 4-4, Figure 4-3). The extremely low producti-
vity in the rainy season was anticipated to be due to the
4-8



storm  effect  mentioned  earlier.   However, the production
potential of the reservoir in terms of primary productivity
is in general in the level of low to moderate comparing with
other large water bodies in Thailand like Kwan Phayao, Nong
Han, etc. (The Thai-Japan LSIFP, 1985). No apparent pattern
of zonal variation in production potential was observed.
Yet there was a tendency of higher production potential of
the zones at the upper reach of the reservoir (Zones 3, 5, 6
and 7) when the effect of the heavy storm was excluded.
The results from chlorophyll a content investigation showed
a very close correlation to the findings of the primary
productivity and hence confirmed the result of the study
(Table 4-5 Figure 4-4).
Aquatic Woods
During the study period, 10 families and 14 species of
aquatic plants were found. According to their habits, these
aquatic plants could be divided into three groups, i.e.,
submerged,  floating,  and  emerged  plants.   The number of
species of each group was 8, 4 and 2 respectively.
Their distribution and abundance were shown in Table 4-6.
The main aquatic plant communities occurred as association
of several submerged plants with different dominant species
in each  season.   In the rainy season,  Potemogeton crispus
and  Hydrille verticillata were abundant while  P. polygonf-
folius, Blyxe japonice and Chers zeylenice were dominant in
the cold season. And in the dry season Hydrille verticillate
and P. polygonifolius were the dominant species.    Floating
plants were very few and there were only some patches of
of emerged plants on the bank of the reservoir.
Benthos
The community of benthic animals found during the study
period was composed of two mollusc species.   As high as 95'5
or more of the community was the bivalve (clam), Corbicular

sp.,(uvunrv) while univalve (snail) Clea bandomians (weUL&"i)
accounted for the rest (Table 4-7). The results from the
findings clearly showed that benthic animal density was
relatively higher in the rainy season than in the cold
and the dry seasons (Table 4-7, Figure 4-5).
In conclusion, when the overall view of the aquatic biology
ecosystem is considered, Lam Ta Khong Reservoir can be
roughly divided into 2 zones, namely the zones of lower
production potential (Zones 1, 2 and 4) and the zones of
higher production potential in which the Intake/outlet site
is situated (Zones 3, 5, 6 and 7).

4.1.4    IMPACT ASSESSKNT
4.1.4.1 Construction Period Impact
Increased erosion from the construction sites, i.e., intake
-outlet and disposal sites and hauling routes, will Increase
sedimentation and turbidity in the vicinity along the
shoreline of the Lam Ta Khong Reservoir which consequently
disturb the activities of aquatic lives.
Underwater work at the intake-outlet channel will destroy
and disturb the habitats of the aquatic lives In the area.
The degree of impact wlll be very slight considering short-
term impact and confined boundary anticipated to be affected.

4.1.4.2 Long-Term I psat
The operation of the Project might possibly destroy plankton
and other small aquatic lives in the lower Lam Ta Rhong
reservolr. The survey conducted on aquatic biology in the
reservoir  reveals  the   existence  of  relatively  low  to
moderate  plankton  density.      These  plankton  which  are
Important food sources for larger aquatic lives especially
fish could be pumped in during the pumping period which
occurs daily. Since there is a great and sudden increase of
pressure inside while water Is pumped up to the upper
reservoir these plankton mlght be killed.    The increase in
death rate of plankton might reduce fish products In the
reservoir.  However due to the fact that the remains  of the
killed plankton still possess thelr nutritive values, It is
anticipated that their function as food source for aquatic
lives of animals In higher trophic levels in the lower
reservoir will still exist.
The daily pumping action will create moderate positive
impact through the induction of nutrients overturn from the
bottom to the water body in the affected area which in turn
will promote plankton growth. This phenomenon is anticipated
to more or less counteract the killing affect caused by the
Project operation.
As far as the plankton klll is concerned, the percentages of
water volume being daily pumped ln from the lower reservoir
play a very important role in delineating the degree of
Impact  upon the-plankton  community in the  lower reservoir.
When the percentages are low especially in rainy season due
to large water volume In the lower reservoir, the impact will
be very slight since only small percentages of plankton will
be killed and the replacement rate will cover up the effects.
On the other hand, when the percentages grow higher and
higher particularly In dry seasons when the water volume of
the lower reservoir decreases the degree of Impact upon
plankton community and primary productivity is anticipated to
lncrease.

Negligible impact is anticipated to occur to aquatic weeds
and benthic organlsms.   For long term operation period, they
are anticipated to be able to adapt themselves and maintain
their normal activities.

5) Four field studles on flsh population were done
on October  20-21, 1990,  January  19-20, 1991,
June 8-9, 1991, and August 24-25, 1991.
4.2.3   VXISTIN G VInMrT   COND ImONS
From the smples taken by seining and collecting from
fishermen from four samplinq periods (October, 1990 to
August, 1991), 24 species of freshwater fish representIng 14
familles (Table 4-8) were found. Based on the number of
species  found,  Cyprinids  ranked first with seven species
(about 29.17 percent of the total), following by Anabantids
(3 species or 12.50 percent), Bagrids and )astacembalids (2
species each or 8.33 percent), and the other 10 families
(one each or 4.17 percent).
Based on the observation, the interview with local fishermen
and on the actual fish sampling, the fish species listed in
Table"4-9 were divided arbitrarily into the 'less common'
lcoumon,. and  'abundant.       The proportions  of these
cattagories were 54.17, 20.83 and 25.00 percent respectively,
all of them being from of the 24 species found in Lam Ta
Khong Reservoir during the sampling period.    Of the 24
species found, 8 species (about 33.33 percent) were classi-
fied as the species of commercial values.
Feeding habit and the species of commercial values-are shown
in Table 4-10. The F/C ratio (the total weight of all forage
fish to the total weight of all carnivorous fish in the fish
population) was about 1.49 for the fish caught in Lam Ta
Khong Reservoir during October, 1990 and August 1991.  Thls
indicates an unbalanced fish population, as compared with
the most desirable F/C ratio range of 3.0-6.0.
The results of thls study show. that there were 6 specles of
fish which had the ovary in the resting stage   (eggs at the
sam stage before ovulation) during the sampling period.
(Table 4-11)

The standlng crops of fish In Lam Ta Thong Reservoir during
the sampllng periods are shown in Table 4-12.  The standing
crop of fish in Zone 3-4 was the highest (6,772.4 g/ral)
compared to other zones. The lowest standing crop was found
in Zone 5-6 (312.8 g/rai). The simple average standing crop
was 2,830.5 g/rai. When compared to other reservoirs In the
Northeast the standing crop of fish in Lm Ta Khong reservoir
is In the range o low productivity.
4.2.4   IWAa _
4.2.4.1 Construction Psrlod Impact
Only slight negative impact Is anticipated as a consequence
of increased erosion and the disturbance and destruction of
suitable habitats for aquatic lives.
4.2.4.2 Lang-Term Impact
The operatlon of the Project might possibly destroy plankton
and small aquat&c lives in the lower Lam Ta Khong Reservoir.
The survey conducted on aquatic resources in the reservoir
reveals the existence -of relatively moderate   plankton
density, various types of sa-il flsh, and fingerlings of
some large fish at the proposed intake/outlet slte. A lot
of these fish have the habit of feeding at the area near the
bank. Those which are feeding themselves near the tunnel
could thus be pumped up during the pumping period whlch
occurs dally.    Since there is a great and sudden change of
water pressure inside the pipe while water is pumped up to
the upper reservoir, these plankton and fish will be-killed.
The dlscharge of water also has another impact. The current
of outflow water at the tunnel exit naturally attracts fish.
Fish are also attracted by dead organisms including the
remains of plankton and fish, making the tunnel exit their
food  source.   This -results In the gatherlng  of a  large
number of small fish around the tunnel exit and hence, they
are susceptible to be killed during the pumping period.
4-24



The Increasing death rate of both plankton and small fish
will reduce. the F/C ratio and standing crop of fish In the
reservoir.   These  small fish mostly feed on  plankton  and
aquatic plants, and they are ln turn the food for larger
fish.   The  reduction of small flsh means the reduction  of
food for larger fish, and so there Is a decrease of large
fish populatlon, which in turn, leads to the economic loss
for the local fishermen.

4.3      AQUATIC PARAIT
4.3.1     TI RODUCTIQO
Many klnds of parasites require mollusks to complete their
life  cycles.  For example, Bithynia sleamensfs  goniomphelos
(weuVII) acts -s the first lntermediate host of liver fluke,
OpisthMrchis viverrini which is highly prevalent ln the
Northeastern part  of Thailand.   Radix (Lymnnes) rub)ginose
(uouMa) serves as a first intermediate host of cattle liver
fluke,  Fasciola sp.   The  changing of ecology  of  water
reservoir should be investigated for distribution and trans-
mission of parasites.
Objectives z
1) To study the variety of mollusks in Lam Ta Thong
reservoir which are possible to serve as inter-
mediate hosts of human parasites.
2) To determine the infectlon rate in each kind of
mollusks in each season.
3) To study the fluctuation of the sampled mollusk
population in each season.
4) To estimate the density of each kind of mollusks.
Seope of work :
Mollusks  were sampled  in the. 34 selected stations  near
the bank around the Lam Ta Thong Reservoir. The variety of
species of mollusks, their densities, infection rates and
fluctuation of sampling population of each species of
mollusks during each season were investigated.
4.3.2    SNODOLOGY
Hand collection method was used for sampling of mollusks
withln 5 minutes by 2 men at an area of about 10 meters long
and 1 meter wide. The collections were done in marked areas
of 13 stations on the left bank and 21 stations on the right

bank (Figure 4-7).    Emch  station was about 500-700 meters
apart from the  stations  nearby.   The sampling of mollusks
was carried out in three seasons: the rainy season (October),
the  cold  season  (February)  and  the  summer (May).  The
collected mollusks were brought to Parasitology Laboratory,
Faculty of Medicine, KKU. They were measured, Identified for
species and examined for parasitic infection by the crushing
method.
4.3.3    flBTZJG Z3VThOUTIL COHDXTIONB
The prevalence of Opisthonchis viverrinl infection in Amphoe
Si   Khul  and  Pak  Chong  was   3.24  and  1.24   percent,
respectlvely.    In the rainy season only dead  shells  were
collected  for Identification.  Three species of clams  were
identif led as Scables crispeta (wawnr71), Limnoperna siamensis
(NEunir) and Corbicule sp. (evUn1i) Four species  of  snails
were found I.e. Filopsludins mertensi mertensi (NuEVI),
Clee  helena (oullwO), Mel enoides  tuberculate  (WevivV),
Bithynie slamensis goniomphalos (waw7r). In cold and summer
seasons, two species of alive clams I.e. L. siamensis
(MeunwV) and Corbi-cula sp. (neunni) were found. Five species
of snails i.e.  Indoplenorbis exustus (vauh), F.. martensi
(MiDuDIU), R. rubiglnosa (unuiU), C. helene (uauniu) and B.s.
goniomphalos (IN,utiW) were  found.   The  density  of  these
mollusks is  shown In  Table 4-13.   The  dominant  specles,
Limnoperna slemensis (weuniu) was found on the rocks, poles
and even on the leaves, sticks or died corn stems.
The population of L. slawensis (rniunin) increased in summer
and  their  sizes  also increased (Figure 4-8).   This means
there are two peaks of growth curves in the cold season and
the summer.    But for the  other species the peaks were not
evident  (Flgure  4-9  to  4-12)  because   offsprings  were
reproduced many  times  within  a year.    For example, B.s.
gonlomphalos (Maul%) reproduced two generations a year
(Brokelman et al., 1986).

From  the  previous  study  in   Chiew  Larn  Water  Resource
Development   Project,  Suratthani,  there was  no  parasitic
infection in the sampled snails. The density of the snails
was presented as comparatively abundant among the other
species (Impand et al.,1984). In Nam Khek River, Phitsanulok,

Dally fluctuation of water level in the lower reservoir will
result in decrease of the mollusk population especially in
the dry season when the degree of water level changes are
severe.    However since there was no  parasltic infection In
these mollusks no lpact from the Project is antlclpated.
Llmoperna siamnsls (ueunnu), with its ability to  attach to
various substrates, ls anticipated to be an obstacle to water
flow  in the  water tunnel.   To solve this  problem  regular

4.4               WILDLIFE, AND RARE  IPECIES
4.4.1    INTRODUCTION
In performing the Environmental Impact Assessment of Lam Ta
Khong   Pumped  Storage  Project,  the  exiting  ecological
conditions In terms of flora and faunS needed to be examlned
In order to determine the economic value of the forest and
wildlife in the concerned areas and to antlclpate the lmpact
of the project upon the areas.
Objectives
1) To determine the forest structure and floral
composition in the concerned areas.
2) To identify the existing wildlife species as
well as their population census.
3) To determine the economic values of the forest
and wildlife resources.
4) To estimate the Impact of the project upon the
forest and wildlife resources.
5) To recommend the forest and wildlife management
after the project construction.
Scope of Work :
Five field surveys were carried out from December 1990 to
August 1991. Four surveys were performed on the right bank
area and one on the left bank area (See Figure 4-13). On
both areas the floral conditions of all proposed reservoir
sites were recorded.   An investigation was conducted on the
specles compositlon and population of birds and mammals.

grasslands were found to cover the areas with very few
timber species left. Thus, in the subsequent survey, line
intercept technique was used in order to examine the floral
conditions of these sites. Thirty lines of ton meters were
lald systematically at each site. For each line, the plants
that were touched by the llne or wbich underlied or overlled
the line were noted.
For each  plant encountered  by  the above method  two  mea-
surements  were  recorded:  the  length  (in meter) of  each
plant  species  touched  by the  line or which  underlied or
overlied  the  line  (I) and the maxlmum width (in meter) of
each plant species perpendicular to the line (M). The length
(in meter) of the line overlying bare ground was also mea-
sured. From the data obtained the following values were
computed by the equation :

Wildlife Resources
Species and population of marmal, on both left and rlght bank
were recorded by means of the mark and recapture method for
small mammals and the track count method for big game ma_-
mals.   For small mammals, five mammal lines were systematl-
cally laid in each proposed reservoir slto and In each llne
ten life traps were laid  systematically.   The bird species
on the left bank and. the right bank were noted by using
binoculars (eight tlmes magnificatlon power) and a telescope
(twenty to sixty times magniflcation power).   The Identifi-
cation was based upon the two books 'Bird Guide of Thailand'
by  Boonsong .Lekagul,  and   'A Field Guide to the BJrda of
South-East Asia' by Ben King. The bird population were
estimated by Percent Diversity TechnLque (modifled from

4.4.3    EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
From field surveys the following existing environmental
conditions were noted:
Floral Resources
The results from the line intercept technique used to
determine the floral composltion of all proposed reservoir
sites on the right bank URI, UR2 -and UR3 are shown in Tables
4-14, 4-15 and 4-16 respectively:   At UR1 the most dominant
plant  (in terms of  important  value)  was Peinisetum poly-
stechyon while UR2 had Imperats cylindrice as the most
dominant  plant.  At UR3 P. polystachyon  and r. cylIndrica
were the two most dominant plants.
Forest Structure
There were very few timber species included saplings and
seedlings remaining on the right bank area, there was no
rare or protected timber species left. From the remnant
timber species the types of original forest should be dry
evergreen and mixed deciduous forest.      The timber species
found on the right bank were low in economic value since the
approximate height of those trees was lower than fifteen
meters and the dlameter at breast height was below twenty
centimeters. The average volumn of wood for each timber was
less than one  fourth  of a  cubic meter.   The  results  of
the investigation of timber species (excluding plantation
species) are:
URI
The  existing  species  are Eombax kerri) (4'flh) and Grevie
mficrocos (Rom) and the density is 0.064 per Rai (1,600
square meter).
4-45



VR2
The existing species are Wrightle pubescens (lain), Vltex
pinnate (RuUn), and Bonbex kerrii, the density being 0.048
per Rai.
U'3
The existing species are Bombew kerril, Vrighti fzrubescens,
Grewle aicrocos, and Irvlngis mulayane (nszin) the density
being 0.068 per Rai.
The proposed site on the left bank area was found to be
covered   with  cassava  plantation  with  very  few  timber
species.   From  the  remnant  trees  the  species  found
were Irvingia melayans, Bomber kerrfi, Vrightle frubescers,
Spondias pinnate (iwnfn) and Crzatxylura formom  (s7I2),
and the density was 0.141 per Rai.
Wildlife Resources
The list of birds found on the right buk and on the left
bunk Is illustrated in Tables 4-17 and 4-18 respectively.
The right bank area was composed of fourty three species
in  whlch eight were visitors.   Seventeen  species of birds
were found on the left bank area with only one visitor iden-
tifLed.
For small mammals, only two lus musculus (rYu3Vj) were
trapped from one hundred and fifty life traps laid on the
right bank area, and no small mammal was trapped from fifty
traps laid on the left bank area.   There was no sign of big
gmse umamals, protected species or reserved species found
on both the left bank and the rlght bank areas.
4.4.4   IMPACT
Since the areas on both the left and the right banks are
mostly covered by cassava and cashew plantatlon and aban-
doned grassland with only small number of timber trees left,

the impact on then during the construction porlod and during
the operation period is belleved to be very slight.
There  were  no  big  game  mammals found,  thus  no  impact
during  the construction perlod and during operation  period
Is anticipated.   The birds  will face  some  impact  during
the projedt construction period but since the area of
the proposed slte is relatively m.all compared to the whole
area, the  project   construction will only slightly disturb
the  ecological  condition of the birds.   For the long term

5.1      IRRIGATION
5.1.1    INTRODUCTION
Irrigation is one of the major benefits of the development of
Lam Ta Khong basin.  The Lam Ta Khong pumped storage  project
may probably disturb the activlty and the' development of
irrigation in the service area due to the construction of the
upper  storage  reservoir.   In  order  to  Investigate   the
problem, the study of the Irrigation scheme in Lam Ta Khong
irrigation project was aimed to:
1) Investigate the condition of the existing
irrigation system.
2) Predict future demand for irrigation water
relating to the project development scheme.
3) Assess the impact of the project on the
existing irrigation system.
4) Recommend the development approach in order
to increase the irrigation efficiency.
The scope of studies will cover only the area of Lam Ta Khong
irrigation project that receives water from Lam Ta Khong
reservoir.
5.1.2    NETBODOLOGY
In order ato assess the impact of the Project on the existing
and the development of irrigation system the following
methodology was carried out:
1)  From   the  existing   irrigated   area   the
available information an the irrigated area,
crops, cropping patters, water requirement
were compiled.
5-1



2) The Information on the development of the
existing Lrrigation  system  and  the  future
demand for lrrigmtlon water were collected.
5.1.3    BXCTING mVIIRTO  CONDCITIONS
Lam Ta Khong Irrigation Project Is a diversion irrigatlon
system.   There are eleven  dlversion dams along  the  Lam Ta
Khong river to dlverse the water to the irrigated area. Each
diversion dam receives water supplied f'rom the Lam Ta Khong
reservoir and  the  local sideflow  along  the  river.   The
reservolr is located upstream and supplies the water to all
the diversion dam downstream with the total commanded area
of 127,540 rai. The project area and irrigated area for each
diversion dam are shown in Table 5-1.
In the wet season between September and January, paddy is
only one crop cultivated in all the irrigated area of 127,540
rai. Because of shortage of water supplied, in the dry
season of each year (during February - May) only small areas
of the project cultivated paddy, mungbean, soybean, peanut,
and some vegetables. The present cropping pattern are shown
in Table 5-2.
Irrlgation Water Requirement of the Project in Wet Season
Basic data required for the determination of crop water
requirement  are  potential  evaporation,   type   of   crop,
rainfall, land preparation, loss and irrigation efficiency..
Climatic data.    Evaporation  calculations   were  based  on
meteorological data observed at Nikhon Rachasima station.
Crop coefflcients. Crop consumptive use were determined from
the potentlal evapotranspiration in accordance with the
relationship.

Diversion water requirement. The irrigation water requirement
for the project in the wet season was  based  on  consumptive
use  of  crops,  additional  water   requirement   for   land
preparation and percolation  losses.    For  diversion  water
requirement the effective rainfall and irrigation efficien-
cies have been taken into account in the following standard
manner.
Irrigation Reqmnt - Effective Rainfall
Div Water Requirement  =
Irrigation Efficlency
Quantities of water to be supplied to project area during wet
season are summarized in Table 5-4, and Table 5-5.
The diversion water requirement In the wet  season  is  167.7
MCN which is about the same amount of water flow to the
reservoir at that period. Usually the water releas3d from
reservoir is much less than this amount due to sideflow along
the river, so the irrigation in the wet season will not be
affected.
Irrigation Water Requirements in Dry Season
The irrigation area for dry season crops of the Lam Ta Khong
Project depend on the availabillty of water in Lam Ta- thong
reservoir after  the  end  of  the  rainy  season.   With  an

assumption of Lam Ta Khong Irrigation project, that only 70
percent of available water left in the reservoir can be used
for irrigation water requirement for dry season  crops,   The
irrigation  project  estimated   that   every   one   million
cubimeters of water can supply 200 rais of paddy or 500 rais
of upland crops. The following is the example taken from the
end of October 1988:
Storage water        =  257 MCM
Dead storage         =   20 MCM
Available water      =  237 MCM
Irrigation water     =  237 x 0.7 = 166 MCM
Irrigation area for
paddy                =  200 x 166 =  33,200 rais
or   Irrigation area for
upland crop          =  500 x 166 =  83,000 rais
Future Irrigation Development
The only wet season crop of the Lam Ta Khong irrigation
project is paddy. If the farmers in the project areas plant
other crops. They will not affect the Project because paddy
consumes water more than any other crops. On the contrary,
other crops would be most benefitial to the irrigation system
due to the increase of available water for the next dry
season crops.
In the future, if the improvement of on-farm systems such
leaving the canals unlined for whole service areas, the
irrigation efficiency will be improved and there will be much
water to promote the dry season crops.
5.1.4    ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
5.1.4.1 Construction Period Impact
There is no any impact on irrigation system during the
construction period because the construction will not concern
any activity of the irrigation system.
5-10



5.1.4.2 Long Term Impact
In the wet season, the water level in the Lam Ta Khong
reservoir Is much higher than the dead storage level, so
there will be no impact on the irrigation system from the
pumped storage project at this period.
However, in the dry season the irrigated area will depend on
the amount  of  water  left  in  the  reservoir.   After  the
project, the upper reseroir will be constructed at the
capacity of 9.9 NCK. from the criteria in.the estimation of
dry crop area, the reduction of dry season crop area will be
1,400 rals and 3,500 rais for paddy and upland crops
respectively. In fact, the dry season cropping area will not
be affected at this amount, because the project will not use
the water directly. It will pump the water to the upper
reservoir and then release It to the reservoir. Although the
water level in the reservoir is below the dead storage, the
project still be operated the irrigation system will not be
affected during operation period.

5.2      WATER SUPPLY
5.2.1    INTRODUCTION
Water supply is one environmental aspect that must be
considered both in quantitative and qualitative points of
view.   Regardless of the water volume used  for irrigation,
water in Lam Ta Khong is used for domestic and industrial
supplies in urban areas.   It is  also its  withdrawn by the
nearby  villages  and  communitles  sited  along  downstream
areas.   The  project  activity may  affect the  quantity of
water in Lam Ta Khong reservoir depending an the stored
volume in the upper storage reservoir. Its effect tends to
reduce the water usage opportunity and to shorten the period
of water use in the downstream areas.
In order to investigate the water supply to be certain that
the volume used by the- project would not bring about
conflicts with other competing areas, the emphasis was on
the following studies.
1) To  investigate  the  status of existing  water
supply   activities  and  future water   supply
development in the downstream areas.
2) To evaluate the water demand for present and
future situations.
3) To evaluate the efficiency of the existing watpr
-  treatment  plants based on water quality  aspect
In the district areas.
4) To survey the water quality in the downstream
vicinities located in villages where water in
Lam Ta Khong is likely to be used for their
source of supply.
5) To assess the effects on water demand as opposed
to water volume In the existing reservoir and
the proposed upper reservoir.
6)-To recommend monitoring program to mitigate the
impact, caused by the proposed Project.
5-12



The scope of studies covered the downstream areas which
Include Nakhon Ratchasima municipality, other municipal
areas, and districts where raw waters were withdrawn form
Lam Ta Khong Reservoir, including the communities in the
areas where water from the reservoir might be needed for
water supply in the future.   Water demand was evaluated for
the present and the future. Water quality was surveyed in
the interested areas. The water quality data obtained
represented the dry season and the wet season conditions.
5.2.2    METHODOLOGY
In  order to assess the environmental Impact of the-proposed
project the following methodology was carried out :
a) Review and survey existing water supply in a
municipality of Nakhon Ratchasima and three
sanitary districts; Si Khiu, Kham Thale So, and
Sung Noen.
b) Investigate the water demand and water quality
at  the  village  level.    Five  villages  were
selected as representative areas, i.e., Ban Mai
Samrong, Ban Makrua Mal, Ban Krok Krahat, Ban
Kruay, and Ban Bu Thalat.
c) Investigate the water demand in other communi-
ties which are likely to rely on Lam Ta Khong.
This includes the demand for private industrial
use, for government sector, for other sanitary
districts, and for vicinity of Lam Ta Khong.
d) Water quality sampling : raw water and filtered
water from the municipal'ty, the three sanitary
districts and the five communities selected was
measured. Nine areas were emphasized for treat-
ment plant evaluation.   Parameters to be deter-
mined were: (1) pH, (2) turbidity and color,
(3)  chloride,  (4) iron,   (5) total  hardness,
(6) total coliforms; these were analyzed using
the procedures in the Standard Method (APHA,
(1985).   Elghteen water samples were determined
5-13



(i.e., one raw water sample and one treated
water sample in each area/season).
e) Conduct data analysis by drawing conclusions
from the data obtained so as to determined the
trends of water supply in the case where the
project does not exist, and in the case where
the project does exist.
f) Develop mitigation plan and monitoring program.
5.2.3    EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
The results of the studies were presented according to the
main  water uses in the Lam Ta Khong downstream areas  which
were categorized as follows:
- Water use in the municipal and sanitary districts.
- Water use for government sectors.
- Water use in rural areas.
- Water use for industry.
5.2.3.1 Water Use in Municipal and Sanitary Districts
Municipal Area
Nakhon Ratchasima city is the only one municipal area which
requires  raw  water  from  Lam  Ta  Khong.    The  area  is
37.50 sq.km., and the population totals 204,152 persons.
The city requires an annual water volume of 13.63 MCM/yr.
The water consumption rate in 1990 was 37,350 CMD. The
capacity of the old water treatment plant operated by
municipal water work Is 1,590 cu.m/hr. The increment rate
of water requirement per year, using the record of the year
1985 to 1990, is  approximately  3.65 percent.   At present,
the municipal water treatment plant was expanded under the
water supply expansion project of Korat City and is under
operation. The full capacity of the new treatment plant is
planned to increase up to 58,000 CMD at the end of the year
2000 (TAHAL, 1980). The amount of this capacity is appro-
ximately 1.50 folds of the existing water consumption. Raw
water from Lam Ta Khong was transmitted through closed
5-14



conduit into the reservofr of the new treatment plant at
Ban  Makham  Thao.   The  conduit  was also  planned for raw
water take off at Si Khiu, Sung Noen, and Kham Thale So
Districts In the future.   Another route was still delivered
through Lam Ta Khong into the storage of the old treatment
plant in municipal area. The water transmission development
plan was focused on raw water quality control and water
loss reduction during transmission. Table 5.2-1 summarizes
the annual water volume of a municipality and the sanitary
districts.
Sanitary Districts
There are three urban areas (district level) located along
the downstream, i.e., Si Khiu, Sung Noen, and Kham Thale So.
The Water  allocation for those communities  is 0.587 MCM/yr
for Si Khiu, 0.292 MCM/yr for Sung Noen,  and  0.107  MCM/yr
for Kham Thale So (see Table 5-6).    However,  three  other
communities (tambon level) called Kud Jik, Khok Kruad, and
Jaw Haw also use Lam Ta Khong downstreams for their raw
water supply. The existing water requirement for Kud Jik,
Khok Kruad,  and  Jaw Haw, is 0.057  MCM/yr,  0.248  MCM/yr,
and  0.438  MCM/yr,  respectively.   The increasing rate  of
water requirement of Kham Thale So, and Kud Jik sanitary
districts based on the data record in Table 5-6 is 11.35,
and 4.85 percent, respectively.
5.2.3.2 Water Use for GovernDment Sectors
In the studied area there are six major government sectors
as listed in Table 5-7.    All of these communities produced
treated water using raw water from Lam Ta Khong. Suranaree
and Suratham Pitak army bases are the significant consumers.
The water demand of the two communities is 1.095 MCM/yr, and
1.46 MCM/yr, respectively.   The total  water demand for all
of them is 3.035 MCM/yr.

5.2.3.3 Water Use in Rural Areas
The villages located along Lam Ta Khong downstream area and
their vicinity are classified Into 2 groups. The first group
comprises the communities where water supply system has
alerady been  installed.  The other group comprises the
commupities without any water supply system.  The Rural
Water Supply, Region 3, Department of Health plays an
important role in water treatment plant promotion In the
first group relying on water in Lam Ta Khong. Table 5-8 and
Table C-1(Appendix) are present data of village water supply
in four amphoes of Nakhon Ratchasima.  The total number of
households and population of the 13 villages supplied are
4,030 households, and 19,226 person, respectively. Based on
the water consumption rate of 80 lpcd (ESCAP, 1989), the
total water requirement for the first group is approximately
1,540 cu.m/d or 0.56 MCM/yr.  Figure 5-1 represents the
location of studied villages and communities.

Table 5-9 summarizes the data of the second group of
surveyed  villages.   The  details of surveyed data are pre-
sented in Tables C 5-2 to C 5-5 (Appendix).   Seventy  three
villages  in the  four  amphoes  were  surveyed.   The total
number of households and population are 10,403 households
and 46,215 persons, respectively.   Most of the villages are
sited along the main stream and its tributary and use
surface and ground water as additional water sources for
domestic and agricultural purposes.   It was found that most
of the villages use rainwater as a drinking water source.
Based on the water consumption rate of 50 lpcd (ESCAP, 1989),
the total daily water consumption is approximately 2,310
cu.m/d or equivalent to 0.843 MCM/yr.

5.2.3.4 Water Use for Industry
Factories situated along Mittraparp Highway are the main
industrial areas to be focussed on. The factories withdraw
the water in Lam Ta Khong through pumping stations which
5-19



are under the supervision of the Office of Irrigation Region
3 for the  allocation  of water.    The  amount of water was
recorded and used to charge the water tariff for each month
Fifteen factories listed in Table C-6 (Appendix) require the
water for their production processes and domestic supplies.
The total amount of water required is approximately 0.233
cu.m/month or 2.798 MCM/yr.
5.2.3.5 Existing Water Demand
Based on the water supply data mentioned earlier, the
present water demand in the studied areas is summarized in
Table 5-10 and is illustrated in Figures 5-2 and 5-3.   This
indicates  that   the   water  demand  for  communities  and
industries is 22.587 MCK/yr.   This  figure is equal to 7.80
percent when compared to the effective storage of the
reservoir of 290 MCM.   The  major  portion  of the water is
allocated for Nakhon Ratchasima city, i.e., 13.632 MCM/yr,
or 60.33 percent of the total demand.
5.2.3.6 Future Trend of Water Demand
The communal and industrial water demand in the future
should be pointed out in order to anticipate the trend of
water allocation for the project activities and for water
supply in the downstream areas. The growth rate water demand
of is projected for ten years by using the reliable data
available from the representative communities, i.e., Nakorn
Ratchasima, Kham Thale So, and Kud Jik.
Figure 5-4 and 5-5 represent the annual water demand and the
daily water consumption of Nakhon Ratchasima city using the
data recorded during 1985 to 1990 as shown in Table 5-6.
The figures indicate that the water demand in the next
decade will increase up to 95,400 CMD or 34.82 MCM/yr. The
increment rate of water requirement is 9.83 percent annually.
The figures of 9.83, 6.62, and 3.65 percents are used for
the maximum, average, and minimum growth rates, respectively.

The projected water demand during 1990 to 2000 is presented
in Table C-7 (Appendix) and depicted in Figure 5-6.
The results in Figure 5-6 indicates that during the next
decade water in Lam Ta Khong reservoir will probably be
allocated   into  the  downstream  area  for water   supply
activities at the range of 32.34 to 57.712 MCMIyr and the
average of 42.898 MCM/yr. On the other hand, the future
demand will be increased at approximately 1.50, 1.90, and
2.50 folds of the present water demand. The proportion of
withdrawn water from the reservoir will then be increased
from 7.80 percents of the effective storage to a maximum
probable value of 20 percents at the end of 2000.

5.2.3.7 Water Quality in the Studied Areas
The quality of water was investigated in the studied areas
which was  categorized  into three  main groups.   The first
group comprised the urban areas located in the municipality
and sanitary districts (amphoe level) in which water treat-
ment plant was completely provided. The second group was
composed of the interested areas which is the representative
community of each amphoe.   The third group is the represen-
tative village where a water treatment plant will be
provided.  The water  sampling  areas and  sources of  water
sample  are  shown in  Table 5-11.   The  details  of .water
analysis are presented in Tables C-8 and C-9 (Appendix).
The results are concluded as follows :
For Dry Season
Raw water in  Lan Ta Rhong:   There  was a  high  density of
total coliform over 2,400 MPN/100 ml.    The chloride, total
hardness, and iron content ranged from 12-1,170 mg/, .88-108
mg/l as CaCO3 to 0.38-0.76.
Treated water: The concentration of physical and chemical
parameters was mostly reduced to the limit of drinking
water standard (Table C-11, Appendix) except for chloride
content of 1,100 mg/l and total hardness of 348 mg/l as CaCO3
found  at  Ban Bu  Thalat.    For bacteriological parameter,
however, a high density oftotal caliform was found in Si
Khiu, Sung Noen sanitary districts, and Ban Ma Kruamai with
the values of 1,600, 350, and 240 MPN/100 ml, respectively.
This reflected a disinfection system of the treatment plant.
Ground water:   The iron content of 5.16 mg/l,  turbidity of
70 units, and total hardness of 264 mg/l as CaCO3 were
detected at Ban Kork Krahat.
Water in the pond: There was a high concentration of iron

(2.34 mg/1), color (78 units), and turbidity (132 units) at
Ban Na Yai. The Iron content of 0.69 mg/l was a significant
parameter detected in Ban Na Klang. A high chloride content
of 504 mg/l was found in Ban Pud Sa.
For Rainy Season
Raw water in Lam T K[hong: raw water for slow sand
filtration system at Ban Makham Thao reflected an excellent
quality in terms of physical, chemical, and biological
parameters.    But  a  total  coliform  density  in   Nakhon
Ratchasima and Amphoe Sung Noen revealed a high density of
total coliform of over 2,400 MPN/100 ml.
Treated water:  The concentration of physical  and  chemical
parameters  were  mostly  reduced to the limit  of  drinking
water standards. However, a coliform density is quite high
in A. Sung Noen (over 2,400 MPN/100 ml), A. Si Khiu (170
MPN/100 ml), B. Khon Chum (240 MPN/100 ml), and B. Ma
Kruamai (over 2,400 MPN/100 ml).
Ground water: The iron content of 2.9, and 3.8 mg/l were
detected at B. Na Klang, and B. Kork Krahat, respectively.
Moreover, a total hardness of 290-450 mg/l as CaCO3 was also
found in the three ground water sources.
Water in the ponds: A high chloride content of 506 mg/l was
still  detected at  Ban Pud Sa.   In the four villages,  the
high turbidity was found to be in the range of 20-600 NTU,
while the total coliform was 49 to over 2,400 MPN/100 ml. A
high iron content of 3.4 mg/l was found at B. Krok Krahat.
For the community at Ban Mai Samrong where raw water was
pumped into the plant without treatment, the quality of
water before and after treatment during the dry season was
similar. A very high coliform density over 2,400 MPN/100 ml
was  detected.   But  in the rainy season  its  density  was
reduced to 350 MPN/100 ml.

5.2.3.8 Efficiency of Water Treatment Plant
There are nine water treatment plants in which raw water was
withdrawn  from  Lam  Ta  Khong.   The  efficiency  of  each
treatment plant was evaluated by using the concept of Water
Quality Index (WQI) as introduced In Section C-3 (Appendix).
The results of analysis were presented in Table 5-12. The
WQI  values  show  out  the  relative   capability  of  each
treatment plant. Such values reflect that the new teratment
plant of Nakhon Ratchasima located at Ban Makham Thao was
the highest capability of treatment both in the dry and
rainy seasons, following by the old one of that city in the
dry season and Ban Kruay in the rainy season.
5.2.4    IMPACT ASSESSMENT
5.2.4.1  Construction Period Impact
There is no environmental impact on water supply in the
dawnstream areas during the construction period because the
water in Lam Ta Khong reservoir will not be pumped into the
proposed reservoir.
5.2.4.2 Long-Tern Impact
During the operation period the water volume of 9.9 MCH in
the reservoir will be withdrawn Into the proposed reservoir.
A portion of this amount will disturb the lower reservoir
only 3.41% by volume of the effective storage.   However, it
will be redischarged during the peak demand of electricity.
Based on the water supply data described in the previous
section, the water volume in the lower reservoir available
for other beneficial uses in the next decade is depicted in
Figure 5-7.

Under the condition of full capacity of the effective
storage in each year, the available volume will be reduced -
from  290 MCK to 247.1 MCI, by an average increasing rate of
water  demand,  at  the end of year 2000.   Consldering  the
minimum and maximum increasing rate, the resldual water in
the reservoir only 257.7 MCN,  and  232.3  MCK, respectively
wLll be available. If the volume of 232.3 XCM is considered,
the daily pumped water may disturb the residual volume. The
rest, 227.1 MCM, will then be usable for other purposes.
But less impact occurred due to the fact that the volume of
5-29



pumped water Is small with respect to the effective volume
of 290 MCM or to the  available  volume of  232.3 MCM.   The
amount of 9.9 MCM Is equivalent to one third of the average
annual demand to one fourth of the maximum annual demand at
the end of year 2000.   Moreover, the  intake of the pump is
elevated In the dead storage zone (259 m. MSL). The project
can be operated under the condition when there Is no dowan-
stream discharge without disturbing other water usage.   The
possible effect is the period of water use in the down-
stream areas if the volume of 9.9 MCK in Lam Ta Khong is
approaching the dead storage. The volume, In the reservoir,
however, will be naturally increased when annual runoff is
discharged into it.
Based on the relationship of area and discharge curve of Lam
Ta Khong reservoir (Figure 5-8) the available volume of
232.3 MCM is  stored at the elevation of 274.5 m. MSL.   Its
level is higher than thie dead storage elevation (261 m. MSL).
Therefore, the volume required for upper storage will not
conflict the water supply activities in the downstream areas.

5,3      WATER POLLUTION AND CONTROL
5.3.1    INTRODUCTION
Purposes
The three main purposes of the study on water pollution and
control of the concerned water regime are: (1) to assess the
existing water pollution condition and water pollution
control  measures  being  implemented,   (2) to predict  the
future trend of water pollution condition with a particular
emphasis on the effect from the Project implementation, and
(3) to identify and recommend effective measures for water
pollution control in the concerned water regime.
Objectives
The specific objectives of study are:
1) To' investigate  the   existing  conditions  and
future trends of the Lam Ta Khong reservoir and
the Lam Ta Khong river downstream regarding
water  quality,  pollutant   loading,  and water
pollution condition.
2) To analyze the environmental systems of the
reservoir and the river downstream using the
system analysis approach to describe causes and
consequences of water quality alterations.
3) To assess the primary and secondary impacts
of the Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project
on the water quality of the reservoir and the
river downstream.
4) To recommend the mitigation/development plan on
water  pollution  control   as   well   as   the
monitoring program.
5.3.2        ODETHOWLOGY
The two main components of the concerned water regime are:
5-33



the Lam Ta Khong reservoir which will be used as the lower
reservoir, and the Lam Ta Khong river downstream. The study
methodology concerning the assessment of these two water
regime components comprises:
1) The review of existing data on physical charac-
teristics of the water regime components, i.e.,
reservoir and stream geometry, meteo-hydrology
pollutant loading, and water quality.
2) Field   investigation   comprising   preliminary
Investigation, and definitive survey to verify
and update data as we.1l as to obtain data
describing seasonal variation with a particular
emphasis on the magnitude and duration of water
pollution durlng the critical periods of tha
year.
3) The development of mathematical models descri-
bing transport and reaction mechanisms of the
major  ecological  components  in  the   aquatic
ecosystem.
4) The calibration of the models against the
present data.
5) The use of the calibrated models to analyze the
present conditions and Project Impacts on future
water pollution situation, and identify appro-
priate counter-measures.
5.3.3    EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
5.3.3.1 Lower Lam Ta Khong Reservoir
The lower Lam Ta Khong reservoir can be characterized
according to the study findings as follows:
- The water body is considerably shallow with the
average water depths ranging from approximately
3.8 m to 8.2 m at low water level (elv 261 m msl)
and at normal high water level (elv 277 m msl).
- Due to its shallowness, the variations in water
5-34



surface area as well as the water volume with the
changing water level are considerably high.
- The reservoir water is unpolluted. Nutrients and
biological activities were considerably low.
- Spatial variation in the physico-chemical and
biological characteristics of the reservoir water
is low.   Thus, the  system  can  be  assumed  as
completely mixed.
- The temporal variations in both physico-chemical
and biological characteristics of the reservoir
water have been pronouncedly observed due to the
seasonal varlatlons of inflow, outflow, water
level, light penetration, temperature, sunlight
intensity/duration, etc.
Thus, a mathematical model of completely-mixed/non-steady-
state  type  has  been  considered  to  be  appropriate  for
predicting the reservoir behavior.
The Reservoir Model
The mathematical model used in this study along with the
model coefficients were adopted from the existing reservoir
model which had been calibrated and applied for a number
of small and medium-sized reservoirs in the Northeast
(Jindarojana, 1989).
The model mathematically describes the inter-relationships
among the major elements in the aquatic ecosystem which are
the water pollution parameters:
1)- Phytoplankton
2) Fish
3) Organic nitrogen
4) Ammonia nitrogen
5) Nitrate nitrogen.
6) Phosphate
7) Organic carbon as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
8) Dissolved oxygen (DO)
5-35



The relationships in the system are depicted conceptually In
Figure 5-9. The system mechanisms comprises:
1) Forcing functions which are time variables,
i.e.; temperature, light, Inflow/outflow, water
level, volume, mass input/output, harvesting;
including effects from the proposed pumping/
discharge operation of the Project.
2) Internal sources/sinks of the elements which are
ir.ter-related among themselves.
The detailed relatlonshlps of the model, the calibrated
model parameters, and the input parameters are shown in
Appendix (Volume V).
Analysis
The  model  was  used  in. the  analysis  of  the   existing
conditions by using the data of the hydrologic year 1990-91
(April 1990 to March 1991). Thus, the inflow, mass input
rate, and initial conditions were taken from the data of the
present  year.   Table  5-13  shows  the   estimated   input
parameters, and Table 5-14 shows rate of mass input.
Figure 5-10 shows the hydrologic condition of the reservoir
in the year 1990-91.
The calibrated model lines for the respective period are
shown in Figure 5-11 (a) to (j).
From the consideration of the aquatic ecological condition
of the hydrologic year 1990-91, an assessment can be made as
follows:
Hydrologic Conditions. As shown in Figure 5-10 the reservoir
water level was low at the end of the previous year and
continued lowering for approximately 6 months (from

April to September).   The  water  level  in  September  was
approximately 3 m above the reservoir death storage level.
Heavy rain occurring in October raised the reservoir water
level close to the reservoir normal high water level at the
end of October. This abrupt rising of water level together
with high slug of mass input in a short period  pronouncedly
affected  the  reservoir  physico-chemical  and   biological
activities.

Phytoplankton.  As shown in Figure 5-11 (a),  during the hot
season when the water was relatively clear and shallow
allowing deep penetration of sunlight into the water body
the phytoplankton photosynthesis  activity  was high.   This
resulted in a high  concentration of chlorophyll a.   At the
end of the hot season the availability of sunlight energy
was  less.   Thus,  the  photosyntesis  activity  decreased,
resulting  in  decreasing  phytoplankton   population   (low
chlorophyll a).    The  population  density was  still lower
during the high inflow period because. of the increase of.
water turbidity  and depth.   When the  hot season came, the
condition returned to the original cycle.
Fish Biomass.   Fish is the secondary product in the aquatic
ecosystem which utilizes  phytoplankton as basic  food stuff
in the food chain.   Thus,  its  population  is  dynamically
related to the availability of food, i.e., phytoplankton as
shown in Figure 5-11 (b).

Fish Production. Based on the reservoir geometry and the
estimated fish harvesting activities, the model accordingly
calculated fish production in terms of fish standing crop
per area (kg/ha), total fish standing crop (ton), and yearly
fish yleld (ton) as shown in Flgure 5-11 (c), (d), and (e)
respectively.   The data for fish standing crop are the data
obtained from the fishery study (Section 4.2).
Nutrients.    The constituents in the  reservoir  which  are
considered to be plant nutrients or primary resources in the
aquatlc food chain are  nitrogen  and  phosphorus.   In  the
model, nitrogen  was  expressed  in  three  forms:   organic
nitrogen (Org-N), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and nitrate
nitrogen (NO3-N). Phosphorus was expressed as phosphate
(P04-P).   As shown In  Figure 5-11 (f), (g)  and  (h),  the
available nutrients varied with the season due to the
variations of the environment, i.e.; hydrology, utilization
rate of phytoplankton, and decay of aquatic life.
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD).   As shown in  Figure  5-11
(i), BOD in the reservoir water was generally low.   BOD was
partly the result of decomposition of death aquatic plants
and animals, and partly the input from the inflowing water.
Dissolved  Oxygen  (DO).   As shown in  Figure 5-11 (j), the
available DO in the reservoir water was generally adequate
for supporting aquatic life as well as supporting aerobic
bacterial activtiles.   Small depletion of DO occurred for a
short duration because of the increase of BOD after heavy
rain.   However, due to surface reaeration induced by  wind/
current and photosynthetic oxygenation activities, combining
with good vertical mixing of the water body, DO level was
well maintained above 4 mg/l throughout the year.
It should be emphasized here that, the model analysis was
based on a set of assumption and estimation which reduce the
complicacy of the natural system down to a level which the
system can be represented by mathematical expressions. Thus,
the results are subject to various uncertainty. However,
5-45



the model can serve as a tool for baseline study and for
comparative analysis of potential impacts from the Project
which will be presented later.
5.3.3.2 La. Ta Thong River Downstream
As shown in Figure 5-12, the Lam Ta Rhong River downstream
reach from the Lam Ta Khong dam to the last hydraulic
control structure (Kan Phom barrage) extends a length of
approximately 110 km.   The river  serves as a  water trans-
mission canal for agricultural irrigation and community/
industrial water supply.    At the saute  time,  it  receives
waste load in the form of point and non-point wastewater,
and garbage.
From field investigation of water quality profiles during
low-flow period (April 1991), it was found that the river
water was generally in good condition in the first 90 km
reach before reaching Nakhon Ratchasima municipality.   Upon
reaching the municipality, the river received high organic
waste load in the form of domestic wastewater and garbage.
The municipality has already constructed and operated the
wastewater treatment plant to treat the municipal wastewater
at the capacity of 32,000 cu m/d in 1991. It Is estimated
that, in 1991, out of the total wastewater produced in the
municipal area of 23,331 cu m/d only 16,332 cu m/d (approx
70%) was collected  for  treatment.    The  remaining  6,990
cu m/d (approx 30%) was drained into the Lam Ta Khong
river. This amount of wastewater plus the direct dumping of
garbage  into  the  river  in  the  highly   populated  area
Increased organic load to the river ln the form of non-point
sources.
As a result, the river reach from the Nakhon Ratchasima
municipal area all the way downstream turned to be highly
polluted, especially during the 6 months of low flow
(January - June)

The River Model
An existing mathematical model which has been effectively
used nationwide was applied to the Lam Ta Khong river
(Jindarojana,  1988).   The  model  is  a  steady-state one-
dimension type.
Model Parameters. The water quality parameters selected for
modeling were those related to the water pollution problem
existed, i.e., DO depletion due  to  NBOD  and  CBOD  loads,
algal bloom due to high concentration of nutrients, and
chloride concentration resulting from municipal discharges.
Thus,  the  parameters  selected   are:   (1)   carbonaceous
biochemical uxygen demand (CBOD), (2) ammonia nitrogen
(NH3-N), (3) dissolved oxygen (DO), (4) nitrate (NoC), and
(5) Chloride (Cl-).
Processes.     The processes concerning water quality in the
river are: (1) advective transport due to river flow, (2)
dispersive transport due to molecular-mechanical dispersion,
and (3) transformation or sources/sinks of constituents due
to physical and biochemical processes.
In brief, DO is used by aerobic bacteria to assimilate
organic substances in the form of either' carbohydrate or
protein, which are represented by CBOD, while nitrite and
nitrate forming bacteria use DO to oxidize  NH3-N  to  final
product NO3. All these processes may be referred to as a
couple  system  of  DO  utilization.   Additionally,  DO  is
utilized through respiration and benthal demand processes.
In contrast,  DO  replenishment  can  result  from   surface
reaeration and photosynthesis processes.    Chloride is con-
servative, and so In modelling it was treated as a conser-
vative substance related to transport process only.
Assumptions and Mathematical Relationships. The established
assumptions of the model are: (1) the river is treated as a
one-dimensional advective-dispersive transport system; (2)
all transformation rates are first-order and temperature
dependent; and (3) the system is steady-state.

Analysis
The model was used In the analysis of the present conditions
using stream geometry, recorded water levels/discharges and
estimated pollutant loads to calibrate the model against the
river water quality data obtained from field survey during
the critical period of 1991 (April 1991). The detailed data
are provided in the Appendix.
The summuary of river characteristics arnd calibrated para-
meters are shown In Table 5-15, and the estimated pollutant
loads are summarized in Table 5-16.

Figure 5-13 (a) to (e) are the model calculation results
comparing to the field data for the critical period (April
1991).  The assessment can be done as follows:
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) As shown in Figure 5-13(a),
in the first 90 km reach of the river the water BOD5-d.y was
lower than 2 mgf/1. Upon receiving BOD loading from Nakhon
Ratchasima mumicipal area (point/non-point sources) the
rive-r water BOD increased to 12-13 mg/I1.

Ammonia Nitrogen (2H3-N)   As shown in Figure 5-13 (b),  the
same  pattern of  loading  occurred for NH3-N.   The concen-
tration of NH3-N in the first 90 km reach was very small,
not exceeding 0.2 mg/l; while the concentration In the river
reach downstream from the municipal area increased to
approximately 3.0 mg/l as a result-of high loading from the
municipal area.
Dissolved Oxygen (DO)   The variation  of  DO  concentration
along the river length as shown in  Figure 5-13 (c) was  due
to the sources and sinks of oxygen, i.e.; surface re-
aeration,  photosynthesis,  carbonaceous   and  nitrogeneons
deoxygenation, respiration, and benthal oxygen demand. These
sources/sinks of DO varled according to the geometry and
hydrological characteristics of the stream as well as the
amount of organic pollutant load to the river. In the first
90  klm  reach, DO  concentration was  generally   maintained
in the level close to the saturation concentration (DO
saturation at 25°C = 8.38 mg/i). The DO depletion occurre
pronouncedly in the downstream reach due to high DO utili-
zationr of the municipal organic substances loading, i.e.;
carbonaceous/nitrogeneous demand and benthal demand. The DO
5-53



in this reach was depleted to less than 2 mg/l, or even
close to zero. This condition prevailed bacterial anarobic
actlvlties which caused nuisance condition.
Nitrate (NO3-N) The calculated nitrate concentration as
shown in model line Figure 5-13 (d) was based on the
oxidation reaction of organic and ammonia nitrogen to the
end product.   Thus in the downstream reach where high algal
blooming has been observed, the uptake rate of nitrate
must  have  been  so  high  that  the  remaining   N03-N  in
solution form as shown by data points became lower than the
calculated values.
Chloride (C1-)      As shown in  Figure 5-13 (e) the  concen-
tration of chloride in the river water at low dilution rate
was greatly   increased  due  to  the  municipal  wastewater
discharge.    However, the chloride at this concentration is
not harmful to aquatic life.
5.3.4    IMPACT ASSESSHENT
The Project impact on the water regime in terms of water
pollution and control can be identified hereunder:
5.3.4.1 Construction Period Impact
Lower Lam Ta Khong Reservoir
The anticipated impacts consist of those resulting from soil
erosion at the construction sites/disposal areas during rain
seasons and the underwater work in the vicinity of the
intake/outlet  tunnel.   These can increase  water turbidity
and sedimentation. However, the Impacts are considered to
be local and of a short duration, and can be minimized by
appropriate   construction   practices    (the   recommended
counter- measures are presented in Volume III).
5-54



Lam Ta Khong River Downstream
No Impact on the river downstream is anticipated for the
Project construction impacts are confined in  the  construc-
tion area only.
5.3.4.2 Long-Term Impact
Lower Lam Ta Khong Reservoir
During the operation of the pumped storage power plant the
Project impact concerning water pollution and control in the
existing Lam Ta Khong reservoir will be due to the daily
pumping-storage-discharging  process.   In  the  process  an
average water volume of 9.9 MCN will be pumped/stored/
discharged daily.   The process will  partially  make  phy-
toplankton and fish in the water which passes through the
process die.
As a  result,  the   population  of  aquatic  life  will  be
decreased and the whole aquatic ecosystem will be disturbed.
New equilibrium stage will occur. These causes and con-
sequences can be elaborated by the following mathematical
model analysis:
Hydrological Condition. It has been found that the magnitude
of  Project  impact  directly  depends  on   the   reservoir
hydrological condition. In this analysis two prevailing
conditions taken from the past records were used, i.e.,
normal year, and dry year.    Figure 5-14  shows the monthly
variation of reservoir water level with the respective water
volume and depth of the two conditions.
Perishing fraction. It is expected that approximately 50O
of the phytoplankton population in the water passing
through the process will die and cannot be protected.
However, fish can be protected from entering the intake
tunnel, depending on the effectiveness of the protection

measures. The range of fish perishing fraction is expected
to vary from 50% in the worse case and down to 0t in the
most effective case. Thus, two scenarios were used:
I) Normal years, and
II) Dry years
For each secnarlo, four cases were run for comparlsion:
Case a: Without  the  Project.       The  respective
hydrological   conditions  (normal  years  or  dry
years) were used and no pumping - storing - dis-
charging  operation  takes  place.   Thus, neither
phytoplankton nor fish will be destroyed.
Case b (1) to (3):  With  the  Project.    For the
respective hydrological condition, with the pumped
storage Project in operation, The water in the Lam
Ta Khong reservoir will be pumped - stored - dis-
charged at the maximum rate of 9.9 MCM/d. By the
process 50% of the average phytoplankton concen-
tration in the pumped water is expected to be des-
troyed, Percentage of fish destruction depends on
the effectiveness of preventive measures in parti-
tioning out of fish  from the  pumped water.   The
expected portion of fish biomass In the water to
be pumped with the water range from 50% to 0% for
low to  high  effective  partitioning.   Thus case
b(l) to (3) representing the 50%, 25%, and 0% fish
being pumped with the intake water.   Were run for
comparision.
The four cases are summarized as follows:

Mathematical model analysis results are provide in the Ap-
pendix, the conclusion is as follows:
Scenario I: Normal Year    The model  analysis  results for
normal year condition indicate the Project impacts namlly:
Phytoplankton. A slight decrease in phytoplankton
chlorophyll a concentration from the condition
without Project to the condition with Project (3).
This considerably small decrease is due to two
main reasons: (1) the phytoplankton replacement
rate (growth) is considerably high and (2) the
ratio of pumping rate to the total reservoir volume
is considerably small.
Fish.   The  fish  biomase  concentration will pro-
nouncedly  decrease  from   the  condition  without
Project to the condition with Project mainly due to
fish destruction and because the replacement pro-
cess of  fish is  rather  slow.   For the case with
Project b(3) where fish kill can be absolutely
protected the fish biomass concentration   slightly
decreases due to the decrease of available phyto-
plankton.
Other Parameters. From model analysis, it can be
concluded that  no  detectable  impacts  from   the
Project operation on Org-N, NH3-N, P04, BOD, and
DO are expected.
5-59



Scenario II: Dry Year    The model analysis results for  dry
years can be described as follows:
Phytoplankton. The concentration of chlorophyll a
in the condition without Project In dry years is
higher than the normal year because of higher
concentration of nutrients and  light   penetration
(shallower water).    The decrease in concentration
due to the Project operation can be much observed
for  the  ratio  of   pumplng  rate  to  the  total
reservoir volume is higher.
Fish.  The  same   phenomena  as for  phytoplankton
also occurs for fish, i.e.; higher biomass concen-
tration. The impact is higher due to higher ratio
of pumping rate to the total reservoir water
volume.
Other Parameters   The concentration of Org-N, NH3-
N, NO3, P04, BOD, and DO demonstrates a variation
pattern  slightly   different  from the normal year
cases. However, no Project impact can be observed.
From the analysis, conclusion can be drawn as follows:
.1) The Project Impact on phytoplankton is consi-
derably small in normal-year conditions and
slightly high In dry-year conditions.
2) Fish population and yields could be lowered
which is mainly due to the Project operation.
Effective measures to protect the fish from
entering the intake tunnel is seriously needed
to effectively maintain fish population.
3) For a fixed pumping rate, the magnitude of
impact  is  inversely  related  to   the   total
reservoir  water  volume.   This  Indicates that
appropriate period for propagating fish is the
period of high water level.
5-60



4) Neither positive nor negative impact from the
Project operation on other physico-chemical pro-
perties of the reservoir water Is anticipated.
Lam Ta Khong River Downstream
The major concern from the Project operation on the river
downstream is the restriction of water availability which
can possibly occur when the water in the reservoir is close
to the death storage level (elv 261 m msl).
However, this water availability restriction would not
affect the existing water pollution control operation. This
is because even if the Project has not been operated the
available water is not enough for maintaining the base flow
to control water pollution problem during a critical period.
Actually, the main cause of water pollution is the pollutant
loading from the Nakhon Ratchasima  municipal  area.   Thus,
the effective solution to water pollution problem should be
fucused on reducing the municipal loading.
The  following  assessment  utilizing   mathematical   model
analysis will elaborate the above statements.
Alternative 1: Increase Base Flow
This alternative analysis was done by using the present
condition (April 1991) as the reference, and by increasing
the rate of discharge from the Lam Ta Thong reservoir which
will consequently increase the river flow in the critical
reach downstream of the municipal area. The reservoir
release were varied as follows:
Case            Reservoir Release, CMS
Present Condition                6
Alternative-1A                  12
Alternative-1B                  18
5-61



The predicted system responses on improvement of river water
quality according to the increasing discharge are shown in
the Appendices. It can be concluded that lf the water from
the reservoir is available to maintain the base flow
by releasing the water from the reservoir at the rate not
less  than  12  CMS  (approx  1.04  MCM/day)   the  existing
water  pollution  problems  will  be  alliviated.    In  the
future, this required base flow tends to increase due to the
community growth.   Nevertheless, for the water available at
present, the flow condition at this level is considerably
too high to be maintained throughout dry seasons.
Alternative 2: Reduce Pollutant Loading
This  is  a  realistic  approach  to  alliviate  the   water
pollution  problems.   That  is,  to  reduce  the  pollutant
loading which comprises: the non-point wastewater discharge
and garbage dumping into the river by:
1) Increasing the percentage of wastewater conllec-
ted to the treatment plant which consequently
reduces non-point discharge.
2) Reducing garbage dumping into the river.
The  estimated  future  pollutant   loading   from   Nakhorn
Ratchasima municipal area under this alternative management
is as follows:
Item          Present Alternative-2A Alternative-2B
(1991)       (1996)         (2001)
Wastewater (cu m/d)  23,331         27,396         32,095
Treated (cu m/d)      16,332        21,917         28,885
Untreated (cu m/d)    6,999          5,479          3,210

Reduction (%)
5-62



The system responses to the management alternatives are
shown ln the Appendix. It can be concluded that the river
condition  will   pronouncedly   improve  after  the  Nakhon
Ratchasima municlpality has expanded its sewerage service
ares to colled up to 80% of the wastewater to the treatment
plant plus the reduction of garbage disposal into the river.
According to the municipality plan, this is expected to be
done in 1996. Thus, at least a five-year perto4.: s required
for improving the water pollution under the normal flow
condition.

5.4      FLOOD CONTROL
5.4.1    INTRODUCTION
One advantage of a reservoir is flood control if the size of
reservoir is adequate to retain a lot of water and then
release a suitable amount downstream.
The pumped storage project will cause the water to move up
and down between the upper and lower reservoir. This may
disturb the reservoir operation during the peak flow:
Objective
To   investigate   the  impact  of  the   proposed   project
development on Lam Ta Khong reservoir operation for flood
control.
Scope of Work
The existing reservoir facilities and regulations for flood
control have  been  investigated.   The  evaluation of flood
control effectiveness was expected to be performed provided
that the proposed project operation was incorporated in to
the Lam Ta Khong Reservoir operation.
5.4.2    METHODOLOGY'
1) The data on physical characteristics of the
Lam Ta Khong reservoir, e.g., elevation-volume
relationship were reviewed.
2) The  rainfall  was  analyzed   statistically  to
forecast  the   rainfall  magnitude  at  variotis
return periods by using Gumbel or Log Peasson
Type III.
3) The flood control operation was evaluated com-
paring the existing condition and the condltion
with   the   proposed   project  development  to
5-64



identify the impact of the project and to recom-
mend appropriate mitigation.
5.4. 3    EXISTING EIVIRONHENTAL CONDITIONS
The Lam Ta Khong river regime and the flood control struc-
tures are shown in Figure 5-15 (a)-(b).   From the study of
rainfall-runoff data, the statistical analysis by Gumbel
method was used. The four return periods were based on to
forecast the amount of rain which turned out to be 151, 163,
171 and 176 mm.for 100, 200, 300 and 400 years, respectively
(Appendix). The obtained amount of rain was. used to generate
a hydrograph and reservoir routing by varying the spillway
discharge, as shown in Figure 5-16.
The simulated inflow Hydrograph was based on the SCS concept
U.S. Soil Conservation service, (1972). The shape and peak
of hydrograph were calculated from the watershed character-
istics and dimensionless form of unit hydrograph in terms of
t/tp (tp = time to peak) and  Q/Qp(Qp= peak flow) ratio.
In this study the flood from four return periods which are
100, 200, 300 and 400  years  were . studied.   The  initial
water levels in the reservoir were assumed to be 272.0,
274.6 and 277 m where the last value is the normal high
water level (NHWL).   It was found that the flood from 100,
200, 300 and 400 years were under control at the Ini-
tial water levels, The water level during the incoming
flood was allowed to rise over NHWL but not more than the
maximum water level. The volume between the NHWL and the
maximum water level was the temporary storage. By this way,
the maximum discharge and water level were found to be 51
cu m/sec and 280.11 m respectively. This amount of discharge
might be a problem to the upper part of the downstream area.
However, the Nakhon Ratchasima area is too far and the
discharge of 50 cu m/sec can be distributed to the lateral
canals along the Lam Ta Khong river. Detailed analysis is
shown in the Appendix. Channel routing can not be done

correctly due to the great number of weirs (53 weirs) and
also the splitting of Lam Ta Khong to Lam Bauriboon at
stations  69+300.   These two natural canals join at 109+800
km at Ban Kan Phom.    The Lam Ta Khong river joins the Moon
river at the next 3 km
The   eighteen  cross-sections  of  Lam  Ta  Khong  and  Lam
Bauriboon and the discharge-elevation relationships along
the Lam Ta Khong and Lam Bauriboon are shown in the Appendix.
The relationship may be effected by weirs dov-;tream.
However, these weirs will help to retard the flow and
distribute the water in the surrounding areas. Thus, the
flow to Nakhon Ratchasima V will be reduced.
5.4.4    IMPACT ASSESSMEXT
5.4.4.1 Construction Period Impact
There will be no Impact on flood control because the
construction site does not disturb the reservoir operation.
The   construction   site,  especially   the   intake/outlet
structure, occupies a small amount of area compared to the
water body.
5.4.4.2 Long-Term Impact
There may be a little problem when the water level is very
high for the water will move up, for example, during the
flood. The water level may be between the NHWL and the maxi-
mum water level. The discharge from the reservoir will cause
the water level in the lower reservoir to move up. However,
at that- situation the area of the water surface is a great
number and the total discharge from the upper reservoir is
9.9 MCM. which will cause a small change of water level.
This will not be a problem to the flood control program.

5.5      WATER BALANCE
5.5.1    INTRODUCTION
Water balance is necessary for a water management program.
It can be simulated to see what the water level In the
reservoir will be under the different inflow conditions and
the growth of the consumptive use. In addition, the water
balance program will ease the operation of reservoir and
prevent flood.
Objective
To perform a water balance analysis of the Lam Ta Khong
reservoir for water management evaluation and planning.
Scope of work
1) From the relevant information obtained during
the course of study, the water balance of Lam Ta
Khong reservoir was computed with the use of
computer modelling.   The  information consisted
of reservoir physical characteristics, meteoro-
logical data, water demands for irrigation, and
industrial and urban areas.
2) Different cases of water demand were simulated
according to the development plan in order to
determine the impact of the project.
3) The proper water management was recommended.
5.5.2    METHODOLOGY
1) A computer model for Lam Ta Khong reservoir
water balance computation was developed.
2) The relevant information was compiled for model
calculation: reservoir physical characteristics,
hydrology, water demands, and proposed project
operation scheme.
5-70



3) The reservoir operation and water management
schemes were analyzed in order to predict the
Project Impact on the existing water management.
4) Proper water management alternatives were recom-
mended.
5 .5.3    EXISTING ENVIRO MNTAL CONDITIONS
From the study of water releasing, water level, and inflow
records, the greatest inflow takes place in September and
October every year. The drought period lasts two to three
years Figures 5-17 and 5-18. Before the pumped water supply
was In operation in 1991, the Irrigation department by the
Lam Ta Khong irrigation project had to release about ten
times as much water as usual to meet the requirement of the
Nakorn Ratchasima municipal, sanitary districts and govern-
ment sectors.   This percentage of loss is very high and may
be very critical if the dirought period lasts longer than 3
years.    Another loss may be due to the irrigation programs
since the main canal of the irrigation, the Lam Ta Khong
river is the natural stream which has not been and will not
be lined.   Also, there are a  lot of  temporary  weirs (53)
along the Lam Ta Khong for private projects.
The existing environmental condition may be better than In
the past if the loss due to the need of Nakorn Ratchasima
municipal, sanitary districts and government sectors de-
creased by the direct pumping from the reservoir.
5.5.4    IMPACT  ASSESSMENT
5.5.4.1 Construction Period Impact
During the project construction period, there will be no
effect on the reservoir operation because the construction
will not disturb the water management program. The intake
and outlet construction in the lower reservoir can be
completed by making a coffer dam which will occupy some part
of the reservoir area.

5.5.4.2 Long-Term Impact
Flgures 5-19 and 5-20 were slmulated by assuming the 26
years Inflow from 1963 to 1988 as the lnflow in the next 26
years.   The  simulation  was made in the case of two  water
levels, the increasing rates of water demand which are i.e.
3.65%, 6.62%, 9.83%, and wlth irrigatlon control.   From the
simulatlon, it can be  seen that the  irrigated area must be
decreased for low inflow. It was assumed that the irrigated
area depended on the weekly lnflow in the growlng season and
on the  existing water  storage ln the reservolr.   The per-
centage of the irrigated area was computed from this amount
of water with no increase of the area inspite of the high
flow in October. The percentage of the irrLgated area varies
from 0.13  to 1.0.    The  detail  can  be  seen as shown ln
Figures 5-21 and 5-22.
In the case of very low inflow, ln the year 20, 24 and 25,
the irrigation must be stopped at the water demand grot-th
rate of 9.83%. Thls means that the Lam Ta Khong reservolr
will not have enough water for downstream requirement If the
water management is not planned very well. However, the
situation is still a little above the critlcal point if the
growth  rate  is  not  greater than 6.62%. The situation was
assumed at 25% and 50% of the storage at the initial condi-
tion.   From  the study, the initlal volume did not make any
differences.   In term of  evaporation loss, the comparision
was made between the without and with Project operation.
According to the reservoir geometry, it was found that at
100% storage level(227 m msl) the evaporation loss increased
4.15% of the annual inflow and at 25% storage level (268.5 in
msl) the  evaporation  loss  decreased  4.83%  of the annual
inflow. The comparision is shown in Figure 5.23.
The suggested rule curve was computed from the actual opera-
tion as shown in  Figure 5-24.   All  the levels of the same
month were averaged and adjusted to the normal high water
level.

However, in Lam Ta Khong reservoir, high inflow seems to
occur once every 4-5 years. So, this rule curve can not be
applicable every year. The real time rule curve will be more
suitable for the Lam Ta Khong reservoir.
The fluctuation of water during the releasing and pumping
will  affect  the  water  released from the lower reservoir.
This is shown in Figure 5-25.    The depth of water changed.
from 0.198 to 1.709 m where the water levels were at 279 m
and 261 m, respectively. It can be seen that, gate operation
must be set properly to prevent more or less water release.

5.6      LANDUSE AND DEDICATED AREA
5 .6.1    ITRODUCTION
The impact of the Project on landuse pattern is the concern
of multidisplinary  sectors.    The environmental assessment
of the changed landuse patterns in the future was attempted
to identify  short-term and  long-term  impacts.   The  term
landuse in this paper includes human activities acting upon
the landscape and land ecosystem in the area.
The available satellite imagery has been very useful in
current landuse inventory. The analysis of landuse pattern
and impact assessment were therefore based on satellite
imagery, field investigation and ancillary data. Due to the
dynamic characteristics of landuse, a wide range of landuse
patterns are given in this report.
Objectives
The objectives of this study can be summarized as follows:
1) To make an inventory of landuse patterns present
In the Lam Ta Rhong Area.
2) To evaluate the impact of Lam Ta Khong pumped
storage project on the landuse patterns.
Scope
The study area covers an area of about 35,919.818. ha
(224,498.86 rai) surrounding the Lam Ta Khong Reservoir. The
general landscape of the area is characterized by hills with
a wide range of soil types.   Degraded  form  of  forest  is
commonly found.
5.6.2  IHTEODOLOGY
The information of landuse patterns was compiled from the
following sources.
5-79



1) Topographic maps of the Royal Thai Survey
Department at a scale of 1:50,000.
2) Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, false colour
composite of band 2,3 and 4 acquired on November
1990 and January 1990.
3) SPOT HRV I. Panchromatic Transparencies acquired
on April 1989.
projection type instrument (Procom li) was used to derive
.atial information about landuse from the transparencies.
hierarchical scheme of Interpretation was  adopted.   This
pproach comprised several steps of interpretation level:
1) Directly observable features were identified,
which  included  water  body,  water   channels,
roads, etc.
2) The stratification of the target area, based on
the texture and pattern of image was carried
out.   At this level, the information of general
feature within the subarea was established. The
sampling sites for field investigation were also
located.
3) The delineation of terrain was inferred from
soil moisture condition and vegetation cover
through the analysis of image elements (tone,
pattern, texture, etc).
4) The Identification of landuse pattern was made
with particular reference to the terrain unit
carried out under item (3), taking into account
the additional features.
5) The field work carried out entailed the sampling
and   examination   of   terrain-soil-vegetation
relationship for producing reliable Information.
The production of landuse map was then carrled out using the
PAMAP geographic information system. Landuse polygons were
digitally encoded to a vector layer. Rasterization was then
performed to the layers to form  polygon  covers.   Relevant
5-80



attribute data on landuse were simultaneously attached to
each polygon. These polygons were then cross hatched to
enable production of low cost paper maps. The area occupied
by each mapping unit was calculated by the system.
5.6.3    EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
Existing Landuse Patterns
The spatial distribution of the present landuse in the area
obtained from salellite data Is shown in Figure  5-26.   The
map was made at a scale of 1:50,000.   The areas occupied by
each landuse type and its associated terrain are summarized
in Table 5-17. The description of landuse given hereafter
is elaborated with respect to terrain type.
5.6.3.1 Landuse in the flood plain
Riparian
Riparian vegetation is restricted to the levee and the banks
of Lam Ta Khong downstream area with a limited range of soil
types. The vegetation found include scrubs, shrubs and
thickets. It covers a small extent in the study area.
Paddy field
In the neighborhood of the streams, where slope gradient is
extremely low, is the flood plain.   The plain is subject to
regular flood in the second rainfall peak. Most of the area
is used for rice production in the rainy season and for
vegetables and legumes in the dry season. The soil is rich
in plant nutrients or has high exchange capacity. This area
covers only 129.3 ha (808.1 rai).

terrace. The major field crops, maize and cassava are found
in association with a wide range of tree cover (10-50%
ground cover). Small acreages of mulberry, kenaf and sugar
cane c.n be  observed.   The  main  soil is well drained and
inherently low in plant nutrient and organic matter content.
Association of field crops and fruit tree
Field crops are found in combination with fruit trees in
a mixed pattern, strip cropping or isolated pattern. In
terms of mapping, the seperate landuse type could *not be
mapped individually because the scale and data sources did
not permit doing so and the boundary of landuse type was not
large enough.    Thus, the  combined unit of association was
used. In fact two landuse types exist within the unit.
Reforestation
This unit is restricted  to the  well  drained  soil.   Fast
growing trees (Eucalyptus, Leucaena) are the main vegetation
grown in this area. This may be found in association with
fruit trees, woody weeds and young stands of tree.
5.6.3.3 Landuse in the dissected erosion surface
Field crops
This mapping unit occupies the area in connection with hilly
land where soils are residually derived from parent rocks or
colluvium. The major field crops in this urrit include sugar
cane and maize.   Soils are  moderate In fertility, and have
high base saturation.    The dominant soil types are members
of Lop. Buri and  Pak Chong  series.   This unit covers most
part of the study area (20.29%) or about 7288.7 ha (45,554.4
rai). Part of this area is left idle and covered by Yaa
Khachyon Chob(Pennisetum polystachyon) Saap Suea (Eupatorium
odoratum) and native  grasses  in  the  dry  season.   Small
remnants  of trees can be irregularly found.
5-84



Grazing
The pasture within the area is fulfilled by the feed and
feeding section of the army. This pasture field covers the
largest extent in the Northeast, approximately 1714.68 ha
(10,716.75 rai).  The soil is inherently high  in  fertility
and has high exchange capaclty.
Field crops/fruit trees
This unit includes field crops and fruit  trees.   The  main
field crops are under rainfed agriculture and include maize,
sweet corn and sorghum. The fruit trees are restricted to
those not requiring Intensive irrigation. The most exten-
sively found types are custard apple, mango, papaya, lack
fruit and tamarind.   The soils are considerably suitable in
production potential.
Shrub/Herbaceous
Th6 areas include dense to sparse shrubs and herbaceous with
sparse rock outcrops which are commonly found at foot hills.
The rest of the area is left idle.
5.6.3.4 Landuse in the mountain area
The area could be divided into two categories with reference
to slope gradient. This corresponded to the protected zone
as assigned in watershed classification.
Scarp zone
The areas are resticted to steeply sloping land and have
high erosion potential.   This  could be  subdivided into  3
categories according to vegetation cover.
Field crops
This is the most degraded form of land which is encroached
5-85



by cash crops on the forest reserves. A small remnant of
sparse trees exists in thls area. The most extensive land
is illegally occupied and used for field crops production
during the rainy season. In the dry season, the land is
left idle and covered with a wide variety of grasses,
Imperate and woody weeds.
Shrub/He rbac ecus
This unit is a moderately degraded form of forest.   A  com-
position of vegetation cover includes shrub, herbaceous,
young stand of trees and small extent of field crops.
Shallow soil and sparse rock outcrop are the typical surface
cover of this land type. In terms of land management, the
area should be reserved as forest.
Semi dense forest
This area is under forest succession and reforestation in
association with a small remnant of native trees. The unit
covers only about 928.4 ha or 5,802.5 rai (2.58%). The most
extensive trees are relatively young deciduous trees.
Landuse in the gently dipping plateau
This unit covers an area on the plateau where the slope
gradient is gently undulatlng. The soils are irregular in
depth. In terms of vegetation cover, the area can be
subdivided into 3 vegetation covers : Field crop/fruit tree,
shrublherbaceous and  semi dense  forest.   The  vegetation
composition is the same pattern as described in the scarp
zone.
5.6.3.5 Villages/Urban
Villages/Urban generally grow fruit trees (mango, coconut,
guava, etc). Most of the villages are situated on the upper
terrace where the soil is well drained.
5-86



5.6.3.6 Water body
The main water body in the area is Lam Ta Khong reservoir.
5.6.4    IMPACT ASSESSMENT
5.6.4.1  Construction Period Impact
The  superimposed  map  of  the  proposed   pumped   storage
reservoir, the disposal area, the power cable tunnel and the
project facilities on the landuse types is given (Figure
5-26).   The  upper  reservoir  falls  on the most part on a
gently dipping plateau of field crops and fruit trees. The
major vegetation covers In this area are maize, cassava,
cashew nut, mango, jackfruit, etc. Shrubs, small remnant of
trees, woody weed and a limited variety of grasses are also
found. In the dry season, only grass with woody weeds are
frequently observed. As a result, during the project cons-
truction period, no signlficant forest reserves and valuable
trees will be cleared. Underlain access tunnel and other
facilities passing through the scarp zone correspond to
shrub/herbaceous and a small extent of semidense forest.
The construction activities will not disturb the forest
around the reservoir including the access tunnel and other
facilities passing through the scarp zone. This zone cor-
responds to 1A watershed class.
5.6.4.2 Long-Term Impact
The project operation will change the agricultural area to
the pumped reservoir. As estimated, 1006 rais of agricul-
tural area as identified above will be affected.   A part of
the area is the project reservolr whereas the major land, at
the construction stage, is the disposal area. Reforestation
is proposed in the project area. In the long-term, it is
anticipated that the land ecosystem can be restored from
the  project  implementation.    In terms of landuse change,
there is no significant lmpact on other aspects of the
5-87



environment. It should be noted that the project area Is
not only used for field crops and fruit tree but also for
grazing.   This  may  have  conslderable  effects   on   the
livestock feeding.

5.7      AQUACULTURE
5.7.1   INTRODUCTION
In Korat, Thailand where fish bound in rivers, streams and
fish ponds, fish catching and fish raising are parts of a
subsistence life of most of the rural inhabitants. Fish and
fishery products have been, and still are, the cheapest
source of animal protein which is vital to the people whose
wealth and income are among the lowest in Korat.
Rowchai (1989) stated that aquaculture presents itself as a
promising and affordable alternative to the capture of wild
fish for consumption by the rural population. Despite the
elaborate network of the Department of Fisheries in the
region, the areas under aquaculture in the Northeast account
for only 16% of the country's total environmental limita-
tions. Undulating terrians, poor fertility of soil, erratic
and unadequate rainfalls are serious constraints to the
promotion of aquaculture.    The promotion of aquaculture in
Korat can be set up in confined areas, and promoted at the
river source in the irrigated areas.
Objectives
1) To study the existing fish production models in
the Lam Ta Khong reservoir and its vicinity.
2) To investigate the development potential in
aquaculture.
3) To predict impacts of the project on aquaculture
activities in the reservoir area.
4) To recommend the mitigation and development
guidelines to reduce the anticipated negative
impacts and to enhance the positive impacts.
Scope of Work
The major study areas on aquaculture were the Lam Ta Khong
Reservoir and the vlcinities. This study was designed to
5-90



investigate the present status of aquaculture activities and
practices   including the number of fish  farms,  cultivated
species, fish production and method of culture. Based on
the investigation results, the project impact on aquaculture
development  potential was to be identified.   Consequently,
appropriate mitigation and development guidelines would be
recommended.
5.7.2    METIODOLOGY
The study methodology comprised the following:
1) To collect data and reports on aquaculture
practices available for the proposed study areas
from agencies concerned especially the local
fishery stations and the Department of Fisheries.
This information was supportive to the field
investigation and impact assessment.
2) To review aquaculture techniques from technical
research and reports and from discussion with
fish researchers and local fish farmers.
3) Field survey
3.1) Preliminary survey: The survey wets designed
to locate the existing aquaculture system
in the reservoir and adjacent areas.
3.2) Survey on aquaculture practices:   A struc-
tural interview was designed for the inves-
tigation of the aquaculture system in-
cluding   cultivated   species  and  areas,
culturing techniques and fish production in
the project areas.
3.3) Additional survey on the water quality of
fish farms.
4) All technical information and fish statistical
data were analyzed and evaluated.

5.7,3    EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
A survey was conducted on fish farming in Amphoe Pakchong,
Amphoe Si Khiu, Amphoe Sung Noen, Amphoe Kham Thale So, and
Amphoe   Muang.   It was  found  that  the  model  of  fish
production and fish species differed a great deal among
these places (Table 5-18).
The number of fish farmers and type of fish in the areas of
concern are shown in Table 5-18.

It was found that the method of fish culture comprised two
major practices, namely pond culture and paddy field culture
and the type of fish species which were cultured by the
farmers  in  the  areas  of   concern  are   herbivores  and
carinivores (Table 5-19).
According to the fishery survey in Korat it was found that
there were two categories of fish farmers: the small scale
fish farmers and progressive fish farmers or large-scale
fish farmers.   The main purpose of small-scale fish farming
is to earn one's living and so a simple pattern is used.
Since the water quantity and quality of the areas is very
supportive, fish farming there should be promoted and
developed.   Moreover,  due to the high  potentiality of the
area in producing agricultural products, the local feed-
stuffs and animal manure can be readily used as the substi-
tutes for the conventional feeds for the small fish farmers.
However, most fish farmers lack knowledge and guideline to
use the feed properly.

A running water system could be introduced as a production
model.   A number of farmers are already using  windmills to
pump water from Lam Ta Khong river into their fish ponds.
Another high potential model of fish culture found was the
use  of  cage  in  Lam  Ta Khong.   This  method  was  under
experiment by Provincial Inland Fishery Station, Nakhon
Ratchasima. Farmers joining the project were satisfied with
5-94



this  method.   However,  if fish farming in the  cages  are
accepted by farmers along Lam Ta-Khong, the fish species
should comprise those demanded by the market and the ones
having high prices.   Fish farming of small-scale farmers in
Amphoe Muang is similar to Amphoe Pakchong, Amphoe Si Khiu,
Amphoe Sung Noen, and Amphoe Kham Thale So. Still, there are
a number of farmers practicing an integrated fish farming
system. These farmers grow crops as well as raise livestocks
in their fish ponds.
The large-scale farmers, who are referred to as progressive
farmers, breed and rear fish on a commercial scale. Their
farming model is somewhat better than the small-scale fish
farmers. The large-scale fish farmers in Amphoe Muang can
produce about 10-100 million fingerlings per year and
approximately 20,000 kg/y of market fish such as Thai cat
fish, African cat fish and the hybrid of Thai and African
cat fish (Table 5-20).
The farmers in Amphoe Muang are becoming more and more
interested in raising the hybrid of Thai and African cat
fish,    resulting   in   high-priced   fingerlings.      The
organization concerned should therefore find a means for the
farmers   to   produce  such  fingerlings   by   themselves.
Commercial feed should not be promoted among the farmers
raising the hybrid of Thai and African cat fish since it is
too expensive.
Finally, fish farmers who want to rear the Thai and African
cat fish should be encouraged to form into a group in order
to control the quantity and quality of cat fish for Nakhon
Ratchasima market.

5.8      REFORESTATION
5.8.1    INTRODUCTION
Although there are very few timber trees left at present and
the project construction will have very slight Impact upon
ecological condition of the proposed area (see-Task No. 4.4),
reforestation is still a necessity for the improvement of
the ecological conditions of the reservoir site :
Objectives :
1) To select suitable fast growing tree species for
plantation.
2) To set up plantation plan as scenic spot for
tourists.
3) To set up recommendation for forest plantation.
Scope of Work :
The tree  species  planted by the  inhibitants  on the right
bank area were  recorded.    The general information of soil
fertility pertaining to reforestation was obtained from Task
No. 3.6.   The potential of the proposed  reservoir site on
the right bank area as a tourist spot was obtained from Task
No. 5.12 and 6.5.    The tree  species  selected for refore-
station were of the similar types planted by the inhabitants.
5.8.2    METHODOLOGY
The tree species including herbaceous and annual flowering
plants that were planted by the inhibitant were recorded;
The information of soil fertility wase obtained from Task
No. 3.6 and the information of the recreation development
and the aesthetic value was gathered from Task No. 5.12 and
6.5 respectively.
5-99



5.8,3    EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
At present, there are very few reforestation activities on
the right bank area. This does not mean that reforestation
can not be done in this area. The results from field survey
indicated that there were some plants that could be florl-
shed on the right  bank area.    The tree species which help
enhance soil fertllity and aesthetic value such as Cessie
surattensis ("7nJlJIRR), Cassis siemea (filfan), Pinus kesiya
(fua107u), Delonix  regis  (M1HunU4W17),  Hibiscus   rose-
sinensis  (un1),  Bougafnvillee  spp. (Lis i,)  Cosmos  spp.
("nin7:viu), Zinnia elegans (znu%fu), Limonium sinuatum (IJ1u-
1017U), and  Lantana spp. (wnnnia4), could be planted. (The
results from Task No. reveal that soil fertility is generally
poor. From Task No. 5.12 and 6.5 the indication is that
the reservoir site on the right bank area has a high poten-
tial as a tourist spot).

5.9       AGRICULTURE
5.9.1     INTRODUCTION
The irrigated area along the downstream of Lam Ta Khong
shares the major proportion of the present demand for water
from Lam Ta Khong reservoir.   The proposed  construction of
the Pumped Storage Project by EGAT demands some seven
million cubic meter of water from the reservoir for its
operation.   The study of  agricultural activities and deve-
lopment in the Lam Ta Khong irrigated area that would be
affected  by  the  proposed  project  was  made   under  the
following objectives :-
1) To  Identify the  crops  and   their  cultural
systems currently practised in the area.
2) To Investigate/identify problems and practi-
cable appeoaches for crop production in the
area.
3) To recommend crops and cropping models appro-
priate for different irrigated conditions.
The scope of work for this study was concentrated on:
1) The crops that can be grown normally in the
area under the limited supply of irrigated
water and with less marketing problem.
Z) The crops and cropping models suitable for the
small scale farmers.
3) The crops and cropping models requiring simple
practices and low input.
5.9.2     METHODOLOGY
The study was conducted through the following steps:-
1) Reviewing  the   existing  data  and   related
information collected from the area and other
sources.
5-102



2) Making field survey and Investigation in the
area on the physical and biological envi-
ronrment, the existing crops and actual farming
practices, etc.
3) Grouping of data and information for analysis.
4) Identifying  the  crops  and  developing   the
possible cropping models suitable for dif-
ferent conditions.
5) Drawing the conclusion and making recommen-
dations on crops and cropping models for the
area.
6) Preparing the final report.
5.9.3     EXISTING ECOIROlilTL CONDITIONS
General Area condition   The downstream area of Lam Ta Khong
reservoir can be divided into 2 parts.
5.9.3.1   Non-Irrigated Area
The area along the bank of Lam Ta Khong starting from the
reservoir to Ban Maklua Mal Diversion Dam with the distant
of approximately 35 km. can be classified under this
category.   The land  is  undulated  in  topography  and not
suitable for the construction of irrigation system. A water
pump is commonly used for crop irrigation. Small earth dams
are also made in order to divert water into the paddy field.
About 42-45 pumping stations were set up along the river
upon the villagers' request to supply water to a maximum
area up to 25,000 rai.    The farmers can also use thelr own
pumps to irrigate their land for another 10,000 ral.
5.9.3.2   Irrigated Area
The area along the Lam Ta Khong and Lam Boribun from Ban
Maklau Mai to the last barrage at Ban Kan Phom was classi-
fied as the irrigated area.    The river is wide but shallow
and the area along both banks are flat; suitable for the
construction of an  irrigation  system.    The total area is
5-103



127,540 rai.   The actual  area  used for crop production is
about  104,735 ral in the rainy season.   The rest of 22,805
rai is used for housing project, fish ponds, etc. or is
covered with waste land. Less than 50,000 ral is used for
dry-season cropping due to the limited supply of water for
irrigation.
Soil Conditions
The soil in Lam Ta Khong Irrigated area can be classified
as well-drained fertile black soil with the texture of
sandy loam and sandy clay loam. Alluvial soil is also found
in the area as far as 5 km. from the bank of Lam Ta Khong.
The soil Is good for rice, corn, mungbean, peanut, soybean
and vegetables.
Rainfall
The average rainfall recorded in the selected areas of Lam
Ta Khong as follows:
Unit : mm
Location          Yearly rainfall           Rainy season
Amphoe Si Xhiu              1,047                    875
Amphoe Sung Noen            1,189                    994
Amphoe Muang                1,152                    950
Amphoe Jakrarat             1,281                  1,084
The  average   rainfall  for  Changwat   Nakhon   Ratchasima
during the 1969-1989 period is 934.40 mm., with the maximum
of 1,244.20 mm. in 1988-1989 and the minimum of 569.70 mm.
in 1981-1982.
Landuse and Crop Production:
The Lam Ta Khong Irriaation Project covers the total area
5-104



of 127,540 ral In five Amphoe of Changwat Nakhon Ratchasima.
The irrigated area for each Amphoe Is shown below:
Amphoe Si Khiu             =   4,180 ral
Amphoe Sung Noen           =  19,990 rai
Amphoe Kham Thale So       =   6,748 ral
Amphoe Muang                  8 84,765 rai
Amphoe Jakrarat            =  11,857 ral
Landuse  for  crop production for each  Amphoe  can be des-
cribed as follows:
Afphoe Si Khiu.   There are  28 villages In  4 Tambon of Si
Khiu using water from Lam Ta Khong for crop production.
Five of them are located in irrigated area. The number of
villages can be classified as follows:
Tambon        Irrigated   Non-irrigated   Total
Si Khiu            1             6            7
Mittraphap         1             3            4
Kud Noi            3         -   -            3
Lad Bua Khao      -             14           14
Total        5             23          28
Most of the irrigated areas are  utilized for rlce   growing
in the rainy season while mungbean is the major crop in the
dry season. Only small areas are grown with vegetable crops.
The non-irrigated area is used for planting rice and field
crops in the rainy season while in the dry season most of
the areas in 23 villages are cultivated with mungbean and
peanut. Vegetables such as Chinese mustard, Chinese cabbage,
cabbage and others are found cultivated in Ban Klong Ta
Bak and Ban Mai Samrong.
5-105



Auphos Sung Noen. covers the total area of 19,990 rai in
8 Tambon namely : Ban Maklua Mai, Maklua Kao, Sunq Noen,
Sema, Bung Khilek, Non Kah, Karat, and Tambon Kong Yang
all located in Lam Ta Khong Irrigation Project area. More
areas in Tambon Sema, Bung Rhilek and Korat are used for
crop  production  under an irrigation system.    Rice is the
most dominant crop grown in the area during the rainy season
while other field crops and vegetables are found grown in a
smaller  proportion  of area.   Most of the areas during the
dry season are planted with mungbean.
Amphoo Khan Thale So. The irrigated area is mainly found in
Tambon Kham Thale So. The water demand for crop production
in Tambon Prong Daeng is responded by the use of water
pumps.   Rice is the  most popular crop in both areas during
the  rainy season.   Mungbean  is the  dominant  crop in the
area in the dry season.  Some 1,800-2,000 rai of  off-season
rice  is  also found in Tambon Kham Thale So.   The  area of
about 300-400 rai in Tambon Kham Thale So along the road to
the town is used for vegetable crops such as yardlong bean,
chilies, egg plant, musk melon, etc.
Amphon Huang Nakhon Ratchasima.    The majority of the irri-
gated areas which total 84,765 ral are located in Amphoe
Muang, but the actual land used for irrigation is less than
the above figure.   Parts of the area  have been  shifted to
housing -project,  industrial  and  other   non-agricultural
purposes.   Most irrigated areas are located in   six Tambon
namely; Kok Kruad, Pon Krang, Phru Yal, Muen Wai, Nog Jabok
and Tambon Ban Mai.   Most areas are  used for planting rice
in the rainy season. Mungbean is more commonly grown in the
dry season following by some minor field crops.   Off-season
rice is also found in Tambon Kok Kruad and Pon Krang for
some years. The Irrigated areas In 4 Tambon of Muen Wai,
Phru Yai, Nong Jabok, and Ban Mai are considered as the
major vegetable producing center in the area. Various kinds
of  vegetables  are  grown   all  year  round  at  two-month
intervals.   Twenty  six  species  of  vegetabies  are found
5-106



cultivated In the area, but some 10 species with good market
demand include the popular species for farmers such as
Chinese kale, cabbage, multiplier onion, chillies, egg plant,
yard-long bean Chinese cabbage, Chinese mustard, Chinese
celery, Pe-tsai Chinese cabbage and others.   The vegetables
produce in this area will serve the demand of local markets
and other Northeast provinces as well as the customers in
Bangkok area.
Amphoo  Jakrarat.  The  irrigated  area  in this   Amphoe is
located in the last part a distance away from the re-
servoir. Most of the water released through Lam Ta Khong
will be consumed by immediate users, both for irrigation and
other purposes. Thus, little amount can reach the area. The
irrigation water for this area is mainly obtained from Mun
River by using the water pumps. Rice is the main crop grown
in the area in the rainy season.
Cropping System and Cultural Practices
Solid planting or monocropping is the system extensively
adopted for rice and other field -crops during both rainy
season and dry season cropping in the area.
Good quality tillers were found in the rice and peanut
plantation  but  no   tillage  was  practised  for  mungbean
planting. Rice straw is burnt after harvesting and before
the planting of dry season crops during the second half of
January.
Transplanting method is vastly used for growing rice. Hill
planting is applied for peanut and broadcasting is prac-
tised for mungbean.
No fertilizer is  applied to  mungbean  and none   or little
amount Is used in rice and peanut fields since the farmers
realize that their soil is sufficiently fertile.
5-107



Few  farmers  use chemicals to control insects -hd  diseases
in the rice fields. Only the spraying of chemicals is
done to control insects in mungbean field at the flowering
or pod-forming period. The spraying of chemical to control
insects and diseases is always found for peanut growing.
The Irrigation Authority supply supplementary water to the
rice fields in the rainy season, but more of ten during
the early planting season or during the dry period. The
supply of water for off-season rice is limited in some
areas. The water supply for dry season crops is provided
during February 1-10. This amount is enough for mungbean.
However, the peanut farmers should have their own pumps
to irrigate the peanut fields since peanut require 3 periods
of irrigation, i.e., at the planting, weeding and har-
vesting time.
Vegetable crops are grown five times annually at two-months
intervals.   The  cultivation is done with appropriate input
and technology.   Good soil preparation is carried out  with
the  heavy  application  of  fertilizers  and   chemicals in
order  to  increase  production.   No shortage of  water was
found since the vegetable growing areas are located in
the area where water can be supplied all year round.
5.9.4     IMPACT ASSESSME=T
Water resource is considered as the most important limiting
factor for crop production and development in the irrigated
area. The more water could be supplied, the more area could
be irrigated, and  hence  more crop could be produced.   The
construction and operation of the Lam Ta Khong Pumped
Storage Project will not affect the irrigation system as
discussed in Section 5.1.   The  results of this study  also
indicate that no possible impact would occur to agricultural
production and development in irrigated area. However, more
attention should be concentrated on the improvement of water
use efficiency as well as the proper management of cropping
practices.

5.10     HIGHWAY/RAILWAY/NAVIGATION SYSTEM
5.10.1 INTRODUCTION
The Mittraphap Highway (National Highway No.2) plays a vital
role as the major access road to the left-and right-bank
alternative sites (EL-1, UR-1, and UR-2) for constructing
the  Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project.   At approximately
187.50 and 196.50 km. along the Mittraphab Highway from
Bangkok to Nakhon Ratchasima, there are a single-surfaced
treatment road and an unpaved lateritic rdad, respectively.
These roads branch to the east at point A and south at point
B, and connect with the two right-bank alternative sites
(UR-1 and UR-2) (see Figure 5-27).
And at approximately the same distance as point B, but In
the opposite highway side, there is a double-surfaced
treatment road branching to the north at point C and linking
with the left-bank alternative site (UL-1). This study
principally focused on the environmental impact of the
pumped storage construction on the highway transportation
system. The impact on the rai-lway transportation and
navigation systems was also considered.
Objectives
1) To investigate the existing conditions of the
highway the railway and the navigation systems
and their traffic flow patterns.
2) To analyze the future trends of the highway,
railway and navigation systems and their traffic
flow patterns in response to the Lam Ta Khong
Pumped Storage Project.
3) To assess the impact of the Lam Ta Khong Pumped
Storage Project on the highway, railway and
navigation   systems  and  their  traffic   flow
patterns.

4) To recommend mitigatir Ievelopment plans on the
highway, railway and na.igation systems.
Scope of Work
The existing conditions of the highway, railway and navi-
gation systems, their related activities and their traffic
flow patterns were determined from the previous study
reports and data as well as from the data obtained from
actual field surveys and interviews.    The future trends of
these elements were based on the interrelation-ship among
such elements and on the expectation of the changes of each
element during the project construction and the early post
construction periods.    The proposed mitigation/development
plan was based on the  results  of the analysis.   A highway
study was intensively carried out in Areas I, II, and III.
For the railway and navigation, Area I was emphasized.
5.10.2 METHODOLOGY
The work was conducted through the following steps:
1) Reviewing the previous relevant study reports
and collecting data concerning the highway,
railway and navigation systems, their related
activities and their traffic flow patterns.
2) Conducting  field   surveys  and  interviews  to
achieve more detailed data regardlng the highway,
railway and navigation systems, their related
activities and their traffic flow patterns.
3) Analyzing the existing conditions of the highway,
railway and navigation systems, their related
actlvities and their traffic flow patterns and
analyzing their future trends as a result of the
Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project during con-
struction and early post construction periods.
4) Assessing the impact of the Lam Ta Khong Pumped
Storage Project on the highway, railway, and
navigation   systems  and  their  traffic   flow

patterns during construction and early post
construction periods.
5) Drawing   conclusions  from  the  analysis  and
assessment results and proposing the mitigation/
development plan on the highway, railway and
navigation systems.
5.10.3 EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
5.10.3.1 Highways
The Access Road System to Area II
Figure 5-27 illustrates the access road systems to the
left and right-bank alternative sites for constructing the
Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage  Project.   The existing highway
section of the Mittraphap Highway adjacent to the alterna-
tive sites is an undivided two 3.50 m. lane highway (one
lane in each traffic flow direction) with 2.50 m. wide
shoulders on both sides. The running surface of this high-
way section is an asphaltic pavement which is in relatively
good  conditions  as  shown  in  Photo 5-13.   This  highway
section is under improvement by the Department of Highway
(DOH) into a four 3.50 m lane highway (two lanes in each
traffic flow direction) with 2.50 m. (outside) and 1.50 m.
(inside) shoulders. Its running surface will be rehabiliated
to be a 25.0 cm. thick concrete pavement.   This improvement
will be completed in 1993.
At approximately 187.50 km. along the Mittraphap Highway
from Bangkok to Nakhon Ratchasima, there is a 3.00 m. wide
single-surfaced treatment road, namely the access road "A",
branching (at point A) approximately 3.5 km. long up hill
to the east and extending with an unpaved lateritic road,
approximately 0.5 and 2.50 km. long to connect to the UR-2
and UR-1 sites, respectively. The running surface of the
single-surfaced treatment road is in good condition as shown
in Photo 5-14. However, this road consists of a number of
sharp curves as shown is Photo 5-15 and its slopes are
5-112



quite steep (approximately 14-20%).   Based on the interview
with the concerned, many accidents frequently occur on this
road.   Because of the  sharp curves and steep slopes of the
access road "A", it is quite difficult and dangerous for
heavy trucks to travel up to the UR-1 and UR-2 sites on this
road.
And at proximately 196.50 km. along the Hittraphap highway
from Bangkok to Nakhon Ratchasima, there is an unpaved
lateritic road, namely the access road 'B", branching (at
point B), approximately 7.00 and 9.50 km. long up hill to
the south to connect to the UR-1 and UR-2 sites, respec-
tively.   This road is  about  5.00-6.00 m. wide.   At  some
sections of this access road, their running surface is in
bad conditions with plenty of rock pieces lying and water
erosion in the rainy season appearing on its surface as
shown in Photo 5-16.   In  addition,  longitudinal  ruts  as
shown in Photo 5-17 (approximately 8-19 cm. deep) generally
appear along this road.   Hence, Its  running  surface needs
to be improved. Its slope is moderately steep (the steepest
one is approximately 5-8%) and there is no sharp curve along
this unpaved lateritic road.
Eventhough its travelling distance is longer and its running
surface conditions are worse, the access road "B" should be
used  as  the main access route to the UR-1 and UR-2  sites.
This is because its slopes are significantly less steep than
those of the access road "Aw and there is no sharp curve
along the access road "B". Hence, it is more convenient and
safer for any vehicles, particularly heavy trucks, to travel
up to the two alternative sites when using the access road
"B".   However,  the running surface of the access road  "B"
needs to be improved.

+ 800 from 1986 to 1989.  In 1989, its AADT totalled 11,604
vehicles per day which was a very high number. Based on the
DOH annual report in 1989, the annual traffic growth rate
at this station was approximately 11.0%. This, coupled wlth
the very high percentage of heavy vehicle composition in the
traffic stream (56-62% from 1986 to 1989) could possibly
cause traffic congestion and accidents and accelerate the
pavement deterioration. It should be noted that during field
surveys, traffic congestion on the section of the Mittraphap
Highway adjacent to the Area II was also observed.

In Area II, there is only one village, namely Ban Khao
Yaitiang Mu 6 (group No.2), Tambol Klong Phai, Amphoe Si
Khiu, Nak:hon Ratchasima, located adjacent to the UR-1 and
UR-2 sites. This village group will, therefore, receive the
direct transportation impact from the project construction.
The village group consists of 66 households (approximately
300 villagers). The major occupation of these villagers is
farmer. Maize and cassava are the main crops whereas mangoes
5-117



and jackfruits are the common fruit trees.   These villagers
will employ the access road "A' and "B" as their tran-
sporting routes.
For the access road "A", the actually observed traffic
flows, recorded at location 1 from 8:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M. on
April 26, 1991, were very low (27 vehicles) as given In
Table 5-22.      This  was  because  the  number of villagers
living adjacent to the UR-1 and UR-2 sites were small. Most
of the observed vehicles were motorcycles (approximately
48%) and light truck (approximately 44%).    Motorcycles are
generally used as people transport and light tr,ucks are
primarily used for transportation of agricultural product.
However, somes light trucks including is pick-up trucks are
employed to transport people to and from the television
stations (Channel 3, 5, 7 and 9).
For the access road "B", the actual traffic flow obser-
vations were conducted at locations 2 and 3 from 8:00 A.M.
to 4:00 P.M. on December 14, 1990 (the first observation)
and April 26, 1991 (the secord observation) as given in
Table 5.10-2. The observed 8-hour traffic volumes were very
low during the first observation. The 8-hour traffic volumes
were 23 vehicles at locations 2 and 52 vehicles at location
3. During the second observation, the observed 8-hour
traffic volumes were 21 vehicles at location 2 and 42
vehicles at location 3.   Most of the  observed  vehicles in
the traffic stream both at location 2 and 3 during these two
observed days were motorcycles (approximately 63%) and light
trucks  (approximately  26%).       Motorcycles  are  typical
vehicles  for  people  transportation  and light  trucks are
mainly used for transportation of agricultural product.
Comparing among these three observed locations (1, 2 and 3),
the traffic volumes when orderly ranked according to its
greater value are at location 3, 1 and 2. This means that
the villagers living adjacent to the UR-1 and UR-2 sites
mostly employ the access road *B" for their transporting
activities.

The Access Road System to Area flI
The Mittraphap Highway serves as the crucial route linking
the UL-1 site to other areas in the northeast region and to
the central region of Thailand as previously mentioned.
Figure 5.10-1 illustrates the access road system to the left
-bank alternative site (UL-1).   At approximately 196.50 km.
along  the  Mittraphap  Highway  from Bangkok  to Nakhon
Ratchasima, there is the access road system, namely the
access road "C", branching (at point C) to the north and
connecting with the UL-1 site. This access road is approxi-
mately 11.0 km. long.    It is roughly divided  into  three
different road slctions. The first road section is a double
-surfaced treatment pavement having two 3.00 m. lanes (about
3.00 km. long) with its running surface In good conditions.
The second road section is a 6.00 m. wide unpaved lateritic
road (about 3.50 km. long) with its running surface in
relatively good conditions. However, the third road section
5-119



which directly leads to the UL-1 site is an earth road with
plenty of big pieces of rock on its surface. The running
surface   of  this  road  section  is  extremely  rocky  and
inaccessible by common cars and trucks, as shown in Photo
5-18. Consequently, its running surface needs to be improved.
It should be noted that the running surface condition of the
third road section (approximately 4.50 km. long) is signi-
ficantly worse than that of the access road "B" which leads
to the UR-1 and UR-2 sites.
Traffic Flow Characteristics of the Access Road System to
Area III
For the access road "C", the actual traffic flow observation
was performed at location 4 (representing the traffic flow
on the first road section) from 8:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M. on
May 10, 1991 as given in Table 5-22.       The observed 8-hour
traffic volume totalled 985 vehicles which were high.   Most
of the observed vehicle were motorcycles (approximately 60%)
and light trucks (approximately 24%) including 4-wheel
trucks and  pick-up trucks.    Motorcycles are  the  typical
vehicles for people transportation. Based on the interviews
with relevant prople, the existing traffic flows on the
second and third road sections are very low.   When compared
\comparing to those on the first road section.
5.10.3.2 Railways
There are four railway stations, namely Xhlong Phai Station,
Khlong Khanan Chit Station, Chan Thuk Station, and Sap Muang
Station which are adjacent  to the  Lam Ta Khong  Reservior.
The railway route connecting these four railway stations is
a single rail track which is in relatively good condition.
For each of the mentioned railway stations, regular trains
(Trains no. 61, 62, 63, 64 and 66) and diesel trains (Trains
no. 205, 206, 211, 212, 213, and 214) will stop (generally
for 1 minute) to pick up the passengers according to their
arrival time schedule as  shown in Table 5-23.        The rapid
trains, express trains, and freight transporting trains will
not stop at these four railway stations.

Navigation
Based on field surveys and interviews, most of the boats
sailing in the Lam Ta Khong Reservior are small. The typical
dimensions of these wooden boats are 0.80-0.90 m.- wide and
5.00-6.00 m. long. These boats are generally installed with
5.0-6.0 HP. power engine and can carry 2-5 persons depending
on the wave conditions.   The landing places are dispersedly
located around the reservior bank (generally in Zones 3-7).
For the big landing places, such as at the reservior bank
close to Ban Chan Thuk, Ban Pa Phai, and Ban Khoa Noy, there
are approximately 10-30 boats landing.   The main purpose of
the sailing of these boats is fishery.
5.10.4    FUTURE TRENDS
The effects of the Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Construction
upon nearby highway, railway, and navigation systems can be
examined during the project construction and early post
construction periods as follows :
5-121



5.10.4.1 Highways
Construction Period
(a) For UR-1 and UR-2 Sites
During the construction period, the pumped storage con-
struction activities will create short-term traffic volumes
on the access road system to the proposed construction site.
The main reason generating these traffic volumes is the
transport of construction materials (i.e.cement, reinforcing
bars, steel materials, aggregate, asphalt mixing materials,
etc.), construction workers, heavy equipments, machineries,
and supplies for workers at the proposed construction site.
The expected origins of these traffic volumes are Bangkok,
Saraburi, Nakhon Ratchasima, Amphoe Pak Chong, Amphoe Si
Khiu, and nearby villages. The major categories of vehicles
in   the  expected  traffic  stream  will  be   motorcycles,
passenger cars, small trucks and heavy trucks (i.e. 10-wheel
trucks,   10-wheel  truck  plus  fulltraller   combinations,
tractor-semitrailer  combinations).   Since this project  is
the first pumped storage construction in Thailand, it is,
therefore, difficult to estimate the traffic flow created
during the construction period. However, it is estimated
that 200 and 100 vehicles per day will be the traffic
volumes generated from the upper pondage construction site
and the other lower related construction facilities (i.e.
tailrace tunnel, switchyard, control building, tailrace
outlet, etc.).   This means that based on the constructional
purposes, the traffic volumes created on the Mittraphab
Highway and on the access road 'B" will be 300 and 200
vehicles per day, respectively.
In addition, another Important reason creating the traffic
volumes during the construction period is the removal of the
excavated muck of work adit for power cable tunnel, lower
access tunnel for penstock, access tunnel for powerhouse,
etc. to the disposal areas located along the lower Lam Ta
Rhong reservior on the southern side of tailrace outlet
5-122



through the Mittraphap highway. The major vehicle type used
to haul this excavated muck will be 10-wheel trucks. It is
estimated that 200 vehicles per day will be the truck
traffic volumes generated from muck transporting activity.
These trucks will travel only on the Mittraphap Highway
and not on the access road "B'.
Consequently, during the construction period, the total
traffic volumes generated on the highway and on the access
road "B" will be 500 and 200 vehicles per day respectively.
(b) For UL-1 site
The traffic flow pattern and traffic volumes created during
the construction period according to the (UR-1 and UR-2) and
UL-1  constructions  wfill  be generally similar.   The  only
differences between (UR-1 and UR-2) and UL-1 construction
sites are as follows: (i) the traffic volumes of 200
vehicles per day generated from the upper pondage con-
struction site and 100 vehicles from the other lower related
facilities will travel on both the Mittraphap Highway and
the access road "C" which leads directly to the UL-1 site;
and (ii)  the  traffic  volumes  of  200  vehicles  per  day
generated from the excavated muck transportation will not
affect both the highway and tie access road "C".
Hence, during the construction period, the total traffic
volumes of 300 vehicles per day will be generated on both
the highway and the access road "C'.
Early Post Construction Period
(a) For UR-1 and UR-2 Sites
The traffic flow pattern generated from the Project during
the early post construction period will be significantly
different from that during the construction period. This is
because the trip purpose of the traffic volumes created
during these two periods are markedly different.   The major
5-123
a



trips generated during the early post construction period
are the daily working trips between personnel's homes and
the pumped storage work places and recreational trips. It
is expected that the project working personnel will live
near the project work places. Consequently, the anticipated
origins of the daily working trips are at Amphoe Pak Chong,
Amphoe  Si Khiu,  and  nearby  villages.   The major vehicle
categories will be passenger cars, pick-up trucks, and
motorcycles.   It is  estimated  that  the  traffic  volumes
including the daily working trips at the upper pondage work
place and the recreational trips will be 100 vehicles per
day.    The daily working traffic volumes at the other lower
related work places such as at central building, etc. will
be 50  vehicles  per day.   It  should be  noted  that these
traffic volumes exclude bicycles, tricycles, motorcycles,
and others.
Consequently, during the early post construction period, the
total traffic volumes generated on the Mittraphap Highway
and on the access road "Bt to the upper pondage work place
will be 150 and 100 vehicles per day respectively.
(b) For UL-1 site
The traffic flow pattern and traffic volumes generated
during the early post construction period according to the
(UR-1 and UR-2) and UL-1 constructions are generally similar.
The only difference is that the traffic volumes of 100
vehicles per day combining the daily working trips at the
upper pondage work place and the daily traffic volumes of 50
vehicles per day generated at the other lower related work
places will travel on both the Mittraphap Highway and the
access road "C".
Therefore, during the early post construction period, the
total traffic volumes of 150 vehicles per day will be
created on both the highway and the access road "C'.
5-124



5.10.4.2 Railways
The   Lam  Ta  Khong  Pumped  Storage  Construction  at  any
alternative sites will not affect the adjacent railway
transportation system during the construction and early post
construction periods.
5.10.4.3 Navigation
The   Lam  Ta  Khong  Pumped  Storage  Construction  at  any
alternative  sites  will  not affect t4   nearby  navigation
system during the construction and early post construction
periods.
5.10.5    3EPACT ASSESSEkNt
The assessment of the expected environment impact of the Lam
Ta Khong Pumped Storage Construction was performed only on
the highway transportation system. This was because the
pumped storage construction at any alternative sites would
not  affect the nearby railway and navigation systems.   The
environmental impact of the pumped storage construction on
highway transportation system among UR-1, UR-2, and UL-1
sites rather than the five alternative layouts was examined.
5.10.5.1 Construction and Early Post Construction Periods.
Impact
(a) The Access Road System to UR-1 and UR-2 Sites
In 1989, the annual average daily traffic (AADT) observed by
DOH on the highway at stations 181 + 800 was very high
(11,604 vehicles per day). This, coupled with the very
high percentage of heavy vehicle composition (56-62%) in the
traffic stream and the relatively high annual traffic growth
rate of approximately 11% can cause traffic congestion and
accidents and also accelerate pavement deterioration. This
highway section is, however, under improvement by DOH. This
improvement is that the highway section will be reconstructed
5-125



The improvement is expected to be completed In 1993 and to
considerably  reduce   traffic  congestion,  accidents,  and
pavement deterioration on the highway section. Consequently,
the traffic volumes of 500 and 150 vehicles per day
generated from the pumped storage construction during the
construction and early post construction periods, respecti-
vely, will have little effects on the traffic flow charac-
teristics (in terms of traffic congestion and accidents) and
on  the  pavement  conditions  of  the  highway.    However,
parts of the traffic volume generated during the construc-
truction period, especially from heavy trucks, may possi-
bly cause traffic congestion and accidents during their
turning manoeuvre to the upper pondage construction site,
lower related construction sites, and lower disposal areas.
The access road "B", an unpaved lateritic road is a
principal access route directly leading to the UR-1 and UR-2
site.   The  existing  tra-ffic volumes on this  access  road
observed at locations 2 and 3 are very low. For example, the
traffic flows (regardless bicycles, tricycle, motorcycles,
and the 'others") observed at location 2 and 3 were 12 and
25 vehicles  per day, respectively.   It should be noted the
multiplying factor of 1.5 was applied to convert observed
vehicles per  8-hour period to  vehicles per day.   This was
because the number of villagers living in the village group
adjacent to the UR-1 and UR-2 sites was small. Consequently,
the 200 and 100 vehicles per day created from the pumped
storage construction during the construction and early post
construction periods will not bring about traffic congestion
dn this access road. However, the traffic volume generated
during the construction period partly will consist of heavy
trucks (i.e.10-wheel trucks, 10-wheel truck plus fulltrailer
combinations, tractor-semitrailer combinations, etc.). This
coupled with the existing bad access road surface conditions
will rapidly deteriorate the existing road surface (parti-
cularly in the rainy season) and will easily cause traffic
accidents. Hence, its running surface needs to be improved.
It should be pointed out that the major difference between
the access road system leading to the UR-1 site and that to
5-126



UR-2 site lies in their travelling distances which is
approximately 2.5 km.
(b) The Access Road System to UL-1 Site
The Impact of the Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage on the
Mittraphap highway is generally similar to what already
assessed   in  the  previous  section.   However,  the  only
difference is that the traffic volumes of 300 rather than
500 vehicles per day will be generated from the pumped
storpge construction during the construction period. The
access road 'C", is the main access road approaching to the
UL-1 site as  detailed in  section 5.10.3.1.    The  running
surface of an earth road section is In extremely bad
conditions. The existing traffic volume of 560 vehicles per
day (regardless of their being bicycles, motorcycles, or
others) on the first road section (a double-surfaced treat-
ment pavement) observed at location 4 was relatively high.
The factor of 1.5 was again applied to convert vehicles per
8-hour  period  to  vehicles per day.   Hence,  the  traffic
volumes of 300 and 150 vehicles per day generated during
construction    and   early   post   construction   periods,
respectively, will possibly cause traffic congestion and
accidents. However, this is not the case for the second (an
unpaved lateritic road) and the third (an earth road) road
sections, because the existing traffic volumes on these two
road sections are very low compared to that on the first
road section. Some of the traffic volumes generated during
the construction period will be from heavy trucks. Con-
sequently, to prevent severe road damages on the second road
section due to heavy truck passes (particular in the rainy
season) and to allow these heavy trucks an access to the
UL-1 site via the third road section, the second and the
third road sections need to be improved.
It should be noted that the Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage
construction sites when orderly ranked according to their
preferable transportation impact characteristics, are UR-1,
UR-2 and UL-1, respectively.

5.11     ELECTRICITY GENERATION AND TRANSMISSION
5.11.1   INTRODUCTION
Electric power demand in Thailand recorded an annual growth
rate of 14 percent in 1990 as a result of the domestic
economy, rapid industrialization, tourism and business. In
EGAT regions, There was a 13.8 time difference between peak
generation and  peak demand  in 1990.   For  energy  balance
electricity must be supplied continually from EGAT regions 1
and 3 by transmission  line system.    It is clear  that the
development  of  a   hydropower  project  will  increase the
peak load generation capacity of the overall power genera-
tion system. The optimum scale of divelopment of the Lam Ta
Khong pumped storage power plant is 1,000 MW having the
capability of 8 hours' continuous operation.
There   are  three  standard  voltages  used  presently  for
electric  power  transmission  in  the  EGAT   system  which
consists of 230 KV, 115 KV and 69 Ky, all of which have a 50
Hertz frequency.   The power generated from the Lam Ta Khong
pumped storage plants would be connected to the adjacent
existing northeast line system.
Objectives
1) To investigate the need for electricity genera-
tion and transmission lines in the existing
condition.
2) To determine a suitable electricity generation
system configuration that meets the system peak
demand.
Scope of Work
1) The most suitable site from the upper reservoir
(II or III) will be elaborated for generation
and transmission requirements.
5-128



2) The need for electric energy before and after
this project.
3) The benefits of power generatlon and tran-
smission.
5. 11  .2 METHODOLOGY
1) Review the actual and estimated data concerning
power demand for EGAT Region 2.
2) Field investigation and estimation of alternative
sites.
5.11.3   EXISTING EHVIRONNENT L CONDITION
5.11.3.1 Existing Power Capacity and Future of
GAT's, Region 2
The capacities of existing power generation plants, plants
under construction and future plants of EGAT's region 2 up
to 2006 A.D. are summarized in Table 5-24 and shown in
Figure 5-28.
The existing power plants in Regioni 2, as of August 1990,
are categorized as; hydropower plants (1OB.06 MW), gas
turbine (Diesel) power plants (28.0 MW), power from region 1
(200 MW), power from region 4 (400 MW) and power purchased
from Laos (30 MW).
The planned future power plants comprising hydropower (1
project), combine cycle (1 project) and retirement (1
project) would have a total installed capacity of 1,456.06
MW by the year 2006.
5.11.3.2 Load Forecasts of EGAT's Region 2
Due to rapid expansion of electrification, the demand for

1.43% and 12.4% respectively. For the load forecast, the
annual average growth is 8.2t for peak demand and 8.4t for
energy generation (in 1992-1996, Table 5.11-2).
Comparing Table 5-25 with Table 5-24 it is clear that the
existlng power generatlon In Region 2 is in balance with the
regional demand.

5.11.3.3 Transmission System
The records of substations and transmission lines in EGAT's
Region 2 as of August 1990 are presented in Table 5-26.
A total of 35 substations had been installed in northeastern
Thailand. These were 230 KV. (12.5 percent); 115 KV. (79.6
percent); and 69 KV. (7.9 percent). As for the Lam Ta Khong
pumped storage project, the transmission line plan (PDP
90-06) also shown ln this table would support this project.
The transmission line would be relatively short (15 km
in length), because there is a main 230 KV. line running
close to the proposed project sites from Nakhon Ratchasima
2 (NR 2) to Saraburi 2 (SR 2). The power generated from the
project could easily be phased into the transmission line
system.
5-132



For pumping power, the project could gain the power from
this line and from the 230 KV. line which links between Tha
Tako (TTK) and Khon Kaen 3.
5.11.3.4 Suitable Power Generation System
There are three types of alternative power generation plants
that have the capacity to meet peak demands and are sum-
marized In Table 5-27. For hydropower plant (Pumped storage)
a pumped storage power plant need to have a machine that can
be worked as a generator and a pump in itself. When the
machine is  working as the generator, it supplies the-energy
to the system.   On the contrary, when it works as the pump.,
it consumes an energy from the system. If the system has an
abundance of energy for the latter case, there will not be
so much difference  in the  variation of  loads.   Thus, the
unit committment of the thermal power plant will enable the
plant to operate at maximum efficiency.
- The plant will be operated during peak load
hours, however, the plant can also be operated as
an operating reserve In case of failures of other
power sources or a sudden change in energy demand.
- Unit capacity can be designed to meet the
requirement of the existing system.
The effective storage capacity of-Lam Ta Khong reservoir at
NHWL is 290 MCM.    The upper reservoir effective storage is
9.9 MCM, which at 383 meters high, does not affect the
irrigation purpose of the Lam Ta Khong reservoir. According
to the data concerning the unit capacity, and the load curve
provided by EGAT, pumping energy for the Lam Ta Khong power
plant was studied and the result showed that enough pumplng
energy could be supplied from the available thermal power
plant.

5.11.3.5 Probable  Effects
1) The  power  and energy generated for the Lam  Ta
Khong pumped storage project would be sapplied
mainly for peak period.
2) The base load  equipment can operate efficiently
by pumping water at  off-peak hours.   This will
reduce fuel expenses, and will replace the low
efficiency base load power plant.
3) The environmental  effects  of the project tran-
smission  line   construction,  would  be  minor
because the transmission line is very short and
there already exists main transmission lines in
this region.

5.12      RECREATION DEVELOPMENT
5.12.1    INTRODUCTION
The Lam Ta Khong dam is one of the prominent tour4sm
resource in Nakhon Rachasima Province. On Mittraphap High-
way, which passes the Lam Ta Khong area, tourists and
passers-by to the Northeast usually stop to rest or sto&
for leisure at Lam Ta Khong area. The quality of vista
along the dam edge attracts tourists to spend their
recreation time there. The restaurants and food shops are
the attached components that also increase visitors to the
Lam Ta Khong. It is beleived that the construction of the
Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project will hav0 an effect
on land development in the areas:- on the hill top (upper
reservoir area) and the lower reservoir area along Mittra-
phap Highway.
Objectives
1) To evaluate and assess the beneficial and
detrimental effects of environmental changes
associated with the Project development on  the
veiwpoint of recreation.
2) To identify the recreational activities at the
Lam Ta Khong Reservoir and the upper reservoir
for the benefits of tourism network.
- 3) To identify and evaluate the project potential
upon  the  regional  recreation   and   tourism
activities and development.
4) To recommend the mitigation plan to lessen the
adverse impacts and/or to enhance the Project
potential upon the regional tourism and recrea-
tion development.
Scope
The study covered the investigation of the existing seasonal
features and conditions of both recreation activities and
5-138



tourism system for delineating and characterizing their
components In the Project area.   Then the  beneficial  gain
and or losses were estimated and the  mltigation/devel6pment
plan recommended.
5.12.2 MBTHODOLOGY
In  order  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  this  task  the
following investigation activities were conducted:
1) Reviewing  literature,  plans   and   projects
related to recreation activitles and tourism
development  in  the  Project  area   and   its
vicinity.
2) Collecting and analyzing data on recreation and
tourism  demand  and  supply  through   various
sources during each season.
3) Conducting field surveys to collect data on
attitudes of tourists, government officials,
local residents and tourism related businessmen
in  Nakhon  Ratchasima  towards  the   proposed
Project.
4) Assessing adverse and beneficial impacts of the
proposed Project on recreation and tourism.
5) Recommending recreation and tourism mitigation
and development plans as a guideline for future
development.
5.12.3    EXISTING ENVIRON ENTAL CONDITIONS

have been updated by field survey investigation. Question-
aires  were  used  to  gather  opinions  and  attitudes   on
recreation activities as well as suggestions from citizens;
tourists, passers-by, food sellers in the area as well as
the dam officials.
The investigation conducted at the lower reservoir and its.
vicinity  revealed  that   the   most   popular   recreation
5-139



components especially during the National holidays comprised
sight-seeing locations and restaurants and food stalls along
Mittraphap Highway. From the 88 returned questionnaires,
the most popular vislt was on Songkran Day (47.5%) following
by Loy Kratong Day (20%) and New Year Day (5%). 27.5% said
they visited  the  places on other occasions.   About 73.86%
percent of the samples visited the Lam Ta Khong Dam s'te
with the main purpose for sight seeing. The attitudes about
the aesthetic values which were related to recreation
activities depended on seasonal features and atmospheres;
water level, sky, cloud, vegetation, people etc.    The most
appreciated season Is the winter because the   water. is  in
the most beautiful condition with its highest level, lts
deep blue green color and the clear and brights sky, Many
trees and shrubs have some attractive colors and textures on
both their  foliages  and  flowers.   All these enhance  the
recreation activities in the lower project sites.
The suggestions and opinions about the recreation develop-
ment in the lower project site were collected from the
questionaires. 92.05 percent of 88 samples recommended that
some recreation activities should be established in this
area such as public park, reforestation and landscaping.
The second desirable activities are souvenir shops and
camping sites along the drive around the lower reservoir
(75.00% and 73.86%). Suggestions for boat cruising in the
reservoir, marina sports club, carnival/festival annual
sites and fishing accounted for 70.46%, 69.32%, 68.18%,
59.09% and 50.00% respectively.
The  opinions  for  the  project  sites  on  the  hill   top
especially UR-1 site were collected by questionaires. About
25.00% used to go up there, about 28.41% never went there
and about 7.96% only heard about it.
And most of the hill top visitors used to see the vista of
the  lower  reservoir  from the hill top and about 28.41% of
the 88 samples have never seen it. The most beautiful vista
that viewers can observe is in the western side of the hill
5-140



which means the view of the lower reservoir that one can
sees from UR-1 site.
From the opinions and attltudes of the 88 samples about the
upper reservoir project on the hill top 31.82% agreed that
the project would enhance the aesthetic values of the site,
6.82% said   "it will be ln the same  values as usual,"  and
5.68% said that it would decrease the aesthetic values of
the site.
The proposed activities on the hill top recommended by the
most  hill top  visitors  are;  camping   ground,   resorts,
recreation parks, souvenir shops, reforestation, athletic
yards  (22.73%,  18.18%,  13.63%,  9.09%, 9.09%, and  4.55%,
respectively).
The tourism Authority of Thailand and Nakhon Ratchasima
Province  realize  the  popularity  of  the  Lam  Ta   Khong
reservoir as a tourism resource. Studies for development of
tourism resources have been conducted by the province and by
educational  agencies  funded  by TAT.   Recommendations  to
improve the  quality of the  rest  areas and to provide more
tourism facilities have been made, but there has been no
co-operation between implementation and responslble agencies
yet.
5.12.4    IMPACT ASSESSMENT
5.12.4.1 Construction Period Impact
During the construction the view of the lower reservior
which can be seen from Mittraphap Highway will become less
attractive because of the excavation activities and con-
struction plant and material storage.   However,  this  does
not seriously affect the recreation activities because all
of the mentioned activities are on the proposed deposed area
lower than the highway and so they will not disturb the
popular existing sight-seeing locations.
5-141
l



The construction activitles on the hill top will cover a
vast area but will not disturb the recreation activities
which are not so many according to the investigation.
5.12.4.2 Long-Term Impact
During the operation period, the recreation activities which
will be provided both in the disposal areas near the lower
reservoir and in the upper zone area will not be disturbed
from operatlon activities because the water level in the
lower reservoir will not change so much enough to affect the
aesthetic values that viewers can clearly observe.   'And on
the upper reservoir the water level will go down in the
night time, so the viewers wlll not easily have a chance to
see it. As for the transmission line which was laid on the
hill side higher and further from the main Highway, it will
not give any dangerous nor obstruct the views of the area.

6.1       SOCIO-ECONOMICS/INSTITUTION
6.1.1     INTRODUCTION
Of the three Areas studied, our survey indicates that two
of these Areas will be affected soclo-economically by the
Project. These include:
Area I    - will receive a slight impact from the Project as
this is the Area surrounding the Lam Ta Khong
reservoir.
Area II   - will receive most of the impact from the Project.
However, the construction site affects only the
farming not the settlement area.
Area IV   - This area is situated on the lower  part  of the
landscape that receives irrigation water from
the Lam Ta Khong Dam. It will receive no impact
from the Project.
Objectives
1) To investigate the socio-economic structure in
the Project Area.
2) To collect the baseline information of the
people in the Project area.
3) To   develop   necessary  recommendations   and
mitigation measures.
Scope of Work
1) The area receiving direct impact from the
Project:   The study will focus on  demographic
structure, housing conditions and facilities,
land holding and land use, cropping pattern,
farm   and  non-farm  activities,  sources   of
6-1



income, debt problems, net cash income from
main crop, obstacles confronted by the people,
and attitudes of the people.
2) The area receiving no impact from the Project:
The study will focus on the structure of popu-
lation, land holding, their occupation and
main sources of income.
6.1.2     METHODOLOGY
The major methods of study involved a series of household
interviews  and  questionnaires.    The  additional  methods
included   the  Interviewing  of  the  village  leaders  and
related government officials, and the gathering of available
official reports from related governmental agencies. For
the major methods the following sample design was used:
Basis for Selection of Sample Villages
Area I    - Two villages were  intentionally selected from a
total of 7 villages surrounding the Lam Ta Khong
reservoir. The two villages selected are nearest
to the Project Area, namely Ban Khao Noi   LOJI
unu),  Mu 12, Tambol Nong Sarai (nua4n1au)
and  Ban  Ta-Ngoi (Zivni4su)  Mu 13,  Tambol Jan
Tuek (Fiuainu), Amphoe Pakchong as shown in
Figure 6-1.
Area II   - The village to  receive the  direct  impact from
the Project is Ban Khao Yai Tiang (i1utvlu¶u-
LIu4),  Mu  6,  Tambol  Klong  Phai (Wiva"B0,11),
Amphoe Si  Khiu (D'L4n4f1),  Nakhon  Ratchasima
province as shown in Figure 6-1.   The land held
by the households in this village was officially
assigned by the local official units under the
Royal Forest Department. The village was sub-
divided Into 3 groups i.e. Agro-Forestry Village
(MxZIunlU) Group I, II and III.    Among these,
the farm land of Agro-Forestry village Group II

Household Sampling Criteria
Area I    - A systematic  sampling  method  was  used  which
Included 50 percent of the housheolds in the two
villages. From this, a total of 34 and 64
households from Ban Khao Noi and Ban Ta-Ngol
were selected respectively.
Area II   - Fifty-four households (81.8%) from a total of 66
households were included In this study.  (The 12
households not accounted for were absent during
the survey period.
Area IV   - All 35 selected villages were studied,  based on
the report No.2 of the community Development
Department.    More  detailed  study  was   also
conducted with 19 villages.   Ten families from
each village were sampled systematically.
6-6



6.1.3     EXISTING ENVIRONHENTAL CONDITIONS
The socio-economic structure of the households in the
studied Area can be summarized as follows
Area I
1) Household, population and occupation.
Most of the households (66.3%) migrated from
almost  every  region  of  the  country.       The
majority  of  these  households  (58.5%)  either
moved into the Area from other parts of the
province or other provinces within the northeast
region.   Seventy five per cent of these house-
holds had a settlement record of more than 10
years.
The average .size of these households was 4.8
persons/household with almost equal sex dis-
tribution. The average size of the working age
(15-59 years) was 2.8 persons/household.
The level of education of the heads of these
households (i.e. husband and wife) was rather.
low.   Most  of  them  (74.5%)  only  completed
Pratom 4 (lower than the present compulsory
elementary education standard).
Most households (about 50%) were engaged in
agriculture.   Maize  was a  major upland crop.
The occupation of the remaining sector were
casual labour, trading, government employees
and fishery.
2) Land holding and-land use.
The average land holding of these households
was 22.6 rai/household.    Most  households had
their own farm land and very few households
need to rent it.   However, our study indicated
that the proportion of the households owning no
6-7



farm land was about 34.7%. As the land In Area
I belongs to various governmental agencies e.g.
military, Royal Irrigation Department, these
households settled down in the area without any
official land owning certificates.
Most of the farm land (78.3%) was suitable for
upland  crops.   The main crops were maize and
cassava.   The  remaining  area  was  used  for
cultivation of paddy rice, vegetables, trees or
pasture.
3) Crop production (1990 season).
The  whole  Area  was   seriously  affected  by
drought in 1990.    This led to low crop yields
of maize (both seasons) (<200 kg/rai), cassava
(1.43 ton/rai) and baby corn (350-400 kg/rai,
normal yield is  1,000 kg/rai).    To the least
extent, vegetables were grown along the edge of
the reservoir.   Chinese mustard  was the major
vegetable  crop;  about  17.3%  of the  growers
cultivated this vegetable. Fruit trees were
grown for domestic consumption only.
4) Livestock production and fishery.
Beef cattle production can be regarded as the
most important livestock In this Area. The
animal were raised by 43.9% of the households
at a  commercial  scale.    Chicken raising was
very common but was mostly done for household
consumption.   To a minor extent  (1-2%), other
animals being raised included dairy cattle,
ducks and geese.   About 3.1% of the households
were involved in fishery.   The  major  purpose
was again for household consumption.
5) Household income and expenditure.
The total average annual household income of
the Area was  86,555.5 Baht.    This was rather
6-8
AL



high compared with the regional  average.   The
main reason was that all the farm products were
completely sold each year. Unlike rice, which
some of the product was generally stored in the
barns.    The proportions of the on-farm income
(from beef cattle, maize and vegetables) and
off-farm Income were 47 and 53% respectively.
Our study also Indicated the average annual
expenditure was 59,639.4 Baht.    About  65% of
this was for the cost of living and the
remaining part comprised on-farm expenditure.
The high cost of living was due to the fact
that  these   households,  unlike   paddy  rlce
growers, had to buy necessary food and articles
(see Table 6-1).
The average household income and expenditure of
different main occupation of the household head
are shown in Table 6-2.
Area II
1) Household, population, education and occupation.
The Area is located in the National Forest
reserve (Pah Khao Tian-Khao  Khuen Lan =
YU1J-LT1LTuaU).      The  affected  village  is
situated on Khao Yal Tiang.   All households in
this village moved into the Area from other
parts, 70.4% of these were from Nakhon Ratcha-
sima province. Others were from other parts of
the northeast, the central region and Bangkok.
Over 80% of the households had a settlement
period of more than 10 years.
The average household size of this Area was 4.6
persons with almost equal sex distribution. Our
study also revealed the average working age of
2.8. person/household and the dependency ratio
of 63 percent.

Most of the heads of household (92.6%) com-
pleted elementary education (cPratom 4) and the
majority   (85.1%)  of  these  households  were
engaged in agriculture. The major crops culti-
vated were maize, cassava and cashew.   A small
proportion of these households also raised beef
cattle as a source of income.
2) Households and assets.
In general, the households In this Area owned
the land aIlocated by the units under the Royal
Forest Department.   The  actual  size of resi-
dential land per household varied slightly but
the average holding per household was 0.71 rai.
The majority (68.5%) of the houses were one-
storey houses built on high poles.    Other two
common  types were - one-storey  houses  built
directly on the ground and two-storey houses
built from wood and cement blocks. Most houses
had corrugated iron roof wlth wobden wall. The
area  underneath the   high-pole,   one-storey
houses was generally left as -an empty ground.
Electrical  appliances  can not be used as  the
village -had no access to the power line.
Battery-operated radios were owned by most
households (75.9%). About 33.3% of the house-
holds had motorbikes.-
3) Land holding and Land use.
Only about 3.7% of the households in this Area
did not possesr their own farm land. In general,
these households will be provided with a farm
land of 14.5 ra/ifamily- by- the Royal Forest
Department.-7For a household having a member of
over 20 years 6-od, another bi-ock of land of the
- - same size w-lllbe additionally allocated.  As a
result,- some oif these householdi Wad more than
6-14



one  block  of farm  land.    Furthermore, some
households also owned the land which was not
affected by the land allocation program. These
led to  unequal  land  holding.    However, the
average land holding of the households in thls
Area was 34.3 rail/household.
The land use pattern of this Area gradually
changed  with time.   Orlginally,  most  of the
farm land was used to cultivate upland crops
and later this was increasingly replaced by
jackfrult.    Cashew was introduced to the Area
1986 by the support of the Bank of Agriculture
and   Agricultural  Cooperatives  (BAAC).    At
present, the proportlons of the land used for
upland crops, fruit trees and trees were 55.1,
33.1 and 11.8%r respectively.
4) Crop production.
The major upland  crops continually  cultivated
in  the  Area  were  maize  and  cassava.   The
average yields of the crops were relatively
low: i.e.,160-170 and 2,300 kgfrai for maize
and cassava respectively. The net cash Incomes
derived from these crops were 150-170 Baht/rai
for malze and 1,412.70 baht/rai for cassava. A
rather high income from cassava was largely due
to the high cassava price In the year 1990. In
addition, mango, cashew and jackfruit were also
cultivated, the average numbers of these fruit
trees per household belng 182, 48.5 and 26.7
for cashew, mango and jackfruit respectively.
Due to unsuitable land conditions, no paddy
rice was cultivated.
5) Livestock production.
The only livestock being raised commercially
was beef cattle. About 42.6% of these house-
holds owned this type of llvestock, the averagp
number being 5.6 animals/household.
6-15



6) IXnoom, ezpanditurs amd assets.
The average annual income of the households in
this Area was 80,518.30 Baht.   The On-farm and
-off-farm proportions of this Income were 63 and
37%  respectively.    The  off-farm  income was
malnly derived from wages.
Thesm  households,  however,   had  an  average
annual expenditure of 78,233.40 Baht. Therefore,
on average these households had a net cash
income  of only  2,284.90  BMhttyear.   The low
lncome condition had led to indebtedness among
the 61.1t of the households.   The average size
of debt was 12,409.40 Baht/household at the
survey period.
7) Problems.
-All households experlenced various types of
diLfficulties and problems. These include:
o Deterioratlon of soil fertility. The problem
was  a  major cause  of  low   crop  yields.
Application of  chemlcal  fertilizers  raised
the cost of investment. Fairly little profit
was made in the year the crop price was too
low.
O Water.  As the cultlvation being done in the
whole area was rainfed, the crop yield was
therefore subject to drought.
o Fluctuation and conditions of low crop prices
were also the major problem that put the
people in this area at economic risx.
o These households lacked appropriate facility
to dry their product especially maize seeds.
They had to sell the product imediately
after  threshing   while  the -seeds  contain
exceedingly high moisture content to obtain a
good price.
6-16



Another problem was related to the increaslng
cost  of  Investment   regardlng fertilizers,
labour and higher  interest  rate.   Coupling
all  these   with  the  unpredictabilLty  and
fluctuation of crop prices, the households ln
this area were in a serious economical con-
dition.
8) Attitudes towards the development of the Lam Ta
Khong Pumpod Storage Project.
At the day the survey was conducted about 81.5%
of the  households  agreed with the development
of the Project.   Only 1.8%  disagreed  with lt
and 9.3% were still uncertain and about 7.4%
had no  knowledge  of  the  project.   The main
reasons for the people disagreeing with or
uncertain of the Project were resulted from
fearness that their land would be taken away
If the Project was developed (see Table 6-3).
The average household income and expenditure of
different main occupation of the household head
are shown in Tgble 6-4.
Data on range of income of household, cost of
of production and net cash-income of maize and
cassava are shown in Table 6-5, 6-6 and 6-7
respectively. -
Area IV
1) Household, population, education and occupation.
Most of the people were born in the area with
only 26.3% migrating from other parts within
the region, or from Nakhon Ratchasima province.
These migrating households had a settllment
perlod of more than 10 years.

On average, the household size was 4.7 persons/
household,  with   almost   equal  distrlbution
between male and female.   Most-of the heads of
these   households  completed  only  elementary
education (Pratom 4).
Farming and labour were the main occupation.
The proportions of the households engaged in
farming and labour were 49% and 31.5% respec-
tively.   The remaining  sections were Involved
in trading, government and private employment.
2) Lanu  holding and land use.
About 90% of these households farmed on thelr
own land (average holding = 13.8 rai/household).
Host of the farm land  in thls  Area  (65%) had
access  to  irrigation  water.   The  land  use
patterns Included paddy rice (63.1%) and upland
crops (28.2%).   Fruit  trees,  vegetables  and
pasture species were also grown but to a minor
extent  on the  remaining  section  of the farm
land.
3) Crop production in 1990 season.
The maln crops cultivated In the 1990 season
Included paddy rice, maize, cassava and mung-
bean.    The  yields  obtained  were  generally
higher than other Areas as most of the farm
land was irrigated (see Table 6-8).
4) Livestock production.
The livestock animals being raised in this area
were be}f  cattle, swines and  ducks.  Very few
- households did this commercially. Fishery was
practised  mainly  to  fulfill   domestic  con-
sumption. - -                      -

5) Household income.
The average annual Income of the households In
this area was 52, 665.80 Baht. The proportions
of the on farm and off-farm incomes were 65% and
35%   respectively.   Most  of the  on-farm  In-
come was derived from crop production (see
Table 6-8).
6.1.4    ZUIPACT ABSESHEET
6.1.4.1 Project Construction Impact
Negative Impact:
Forty-five households in the Project site (Ban
Khao Yai Tiang, Mu 6, or the second group of the
forest coizunity village) will lose 1,393.75 rai
(223 hectares) of land, which is about 64% of
the total farm land of the vlllage. As a result,
the majority of the households will permanently
lose their subsistence land as well as their net
cash income of 16,450 Baht/year from upland
crops. The findings indlcate that the Project
will not bring about any impact to the houses or
other  construction materia2s  at  Ban Khao Yai
Tiang.
Positive lmpact:
1) The inhabitants of working age in the above
village,  villages   along the   edge   of   the
reservoir, and the areas nearby will have more
opportunity to work and obtain  an  income  from
the Project.  Some of the villagers will be able
to run small businesses  and  services  for  the
wokrs and the project engineers..
2) There will be an increase in the amount of
circulating money provlding a continuous flow of
6-29



trading and businesses both at the dlstrict and
provincial  levels.   This   will   consequently
improve the overall economical conditions of the
people in Pak Chong Distsict, Si Khlu Distrlct,
and Muang District, Nakhon Ratchasima province.
This impact will eventually benefit the economy
of the country as a whole.
6.1.4.2 Long-Term Impact
Negatiwe Impact:
1) Forty-five households in Ban Khao Yal Tiang,
Mu 6 will permanently lose their subsistence
land as well as incomes from growing field
crops, fruit trees, and perennials, as mentioned
before for the construction period.
2) Inhabitants of villages along.the edge of the
reservoir  who  used  to  fish   for   household
consumption and for selling will catch less fish
due to the fact that their fishing area infront
of the intake outlet will be decreased about
0.25 km2 or about 0.7t of the reservoir area at
NHWL.
Positive Impact:
1) Inhabltants of Ban Khao Yai :Tiang In the upper
reservoir and the vicinity are likely to obtain
more income from doing business with and giving
service to tourists visiting the area.   With an
increase in torist number, services in Pak Chong
District, Si Khiu District, and Huang Distriet
will improve. This will eventually bear good
results on the country's economy as a whole.
2) The road that goes through Ban Khao Yai Tiang
will be improved.

6.2       RESETLE  T/R3LOCATION/CDHPEMBSATON
6.2.1     INTRODUCTION
As  a  consequence  of the development of the  Project,  the
properties  and  assets of the people especlally In Area  II
(Ban Khao Yal Tiang Mu 6  Tumbol Klong  Phai = ZLU I1UnU1'U4
6 fslaflaea') will be unavoidably affected.   This study
was conducted to evaluate the compensation costs which will
be required if the Project Is to be developed.
Objectives
L) To   investigate  the  existing. conditions  of
income and assets of the households receiving
impact from the Project.
2) To assess the cost of land, houses and other
possessions of the households.
3) To give recom endations concerning the  methods
and   procedures   of   compensation   to   the
households.
Scope of Work
1) Villages   receiving  direct  impact  from  the
Project were investigated.
2) The    cost   of   house,   rice   barn   other
constructions,   land   and   crops   of   each
households receiving impact from the Project
were appraised.
3) Alternative areas were recommended.
6.Z2 2     B2NODOLO5Y
6.2.2.1   Components of campensation cost
As there were no  houses in the affected Area, the calcula-
tion   method  for Total Compensation  Cost   (TCC)    which
generally includes the compensation cost for housing was not
6-31



used in this case. The compensation costs were therefore
worked out to cover the followings :-
2.1.1 Compensation cost for land (CL).
and 2.1.2 Compensation cost for trees and fruit trees
(CT).
The equation was
TCC = CL + CT
CL  =  Compensation  cost for 1 rai of land x the total area
(rai) to be affected by the Project.
CT  =  Compensation  cost  for each individual type of  tree
and fruit tree x the total numbers of trees and frult
tree existing In the affected area.
6.2.2.2 Calculation methods for compensation costs
Compensation cost for Iand
As the Area is situated in the National Forest Reservation
Area, these households have no eligibility to obtain any
form  of  land  certificates.    They only hold receipts for
payments of local land tax (POR BOR TOWP = n.u.in.5) which
can not  be used  to certify land right.   According to the
laws, the government reserves the full right to either
reclaim the land without compensation payment or to make a
minimal payment in terms of land development cost. However,
as these households have been settling down in the Area for
more than 10 years, such actlons will certainly cause
enormous conflicts and suffer among the people which can
lead to varlous forms of antigovernment confrontatlon. As a
result, estimates of compensation for land were computed
based on the actual land price of the Area.   This price was
quoted from sellers, buyers, brokers as well as the people
living in the Area in general.
6-33



Compensation cost for trees and fruit trees
The steps being taken when the compensation was calculated
were as follows:
1) Classifying the trees and fruit trees into
2   groups,   non-yielding  and  yielding,
according to their stages of development.
2) The   compensation -for the   non-yielding
plants by the Investment costs incurred
since   plantation   commenced   plus   the
interest of the Investment costs. This was
then added to the opportunity cost expected
if these households are to plant the trees
and fruit trees to the same stage of
growth.  To  avoid or minimize   possible
conflicts, the ages of the non-yielding
plants of all species were averaged and
used to calculate for the compensation.
The total compensation for trees and fruit
trees were then calculated for all tree
types   taking   their  total  number  into
account.
3) Compensation assessment for fruit trees and
perennials at yielding periods. The method
applied in the assessment was adding the
compensation cost of a  certain tree during
the year prior to its yielding period to
the net income the farmer should receive
from such tree when It is cut down.
For instance, If a tree starts yielding
when It is 5 years old and it is to be cut
down at this yielding period, the compensa-
tion cost computed when it was 4 years old
(non-yielding stage or one year before Its
yielding period) plus the net income the
farmer should receive from this tree when
it is 5 years old.
6-34



6.2.3    IMPACT ABERHMEUT
Based on the  above  methodology,   The  Total Compensation
Costs (TCC) in the year 1990 were estimated as follows:
6.2.3.1   Compensation cost for land
The compensation cost for land was estimated at 22,996,875
Baht for a total area of 1,393.75 rai (= 223 hectares),
using the estimated land price of 16,500 Baht/ral.
6.2.3.2   Coupensation for treas ed fruit trues
The compensation costs for both yielding and non-yielding
plants are presented in  Table 6-9.   The  total  individual
counts of trees and fruit trees were made. The types and
numbers of trees and fruit trees to be affected by the
Project are presented in Table 6-10.
From  the  information  in  these  two  Tables,  the  total
estimated compensation cost is 4,306,356 Baht (Table 6-11)
Combining all these items together the Total Compensation
Cost (TCC) for the affected Area becomes 27,303,231 Baht as
summarized-below.
(1) Compensation cost for land 22,996,875 Baht
(2) Compensation cost for trees
and fruit trees               aQLf6.lj Baht
Total        3Z.-231 Baht
However, if the land price in the construction site is
estimated on the theory that the value of land price does
not exceed the overall income to be derived from that price
of land, the compensation rate/rai will be 19,23011 Baht.
Hence , the  total  compensation cost   for  the  land   of
2.23 square kilometer or- 1,393.75 ral (the construction
site) in this case will be 26,801,813 Daht.
6-35



A summary of the assets to be affected by the Project.
1) Farm land of 1,393.75 ral or 223 hectares.
2) 13,916 trees or fruit trees.
3) 45 affected households.
N.gtn ]f The compensation cost for land was calculated from
net cash income from the following equation :
V = R/i
Where R = Average net Income per rai of the farm
land
I - Interest rate
and   V = Land price
For this case, which R = 2,307.50 Baht, I = 12%
the Land Price   (V)     2,307.50/0.12  =  19,230

6.3      PUBLIC IEALTS AND PUBLIC AarrTr
6.3.1    INTRODUCTION
Among the most important resources of the country, human
being  Is  the most  vluable  asset.   It  has  been  well
accepted that a healthy population Is the ultimate goal of
socio-economic and social developments. In turn, population
in good health could contribute more to national economic
growth, and health is a substantial factor for the quality
of life. Public health is therefore regarded as a multidis-
ciplinary and multisectoral concern as well as an integral
part  of  general  community  development.    A  development
project, while primarily  aiming at improving socio-economic
condition of the population,  commonly covers Improvement of
public  health  as  one  of its  purposes.   Nevertheless, a
development project that results In an ecological change
like the construction of "A Pumped Storage Project" might
have direct adverse effects on certain aspects of public
health. - This Is why a public health study is needed in the
pre-construction stage, with a particular respect to setting
up a plan to minimize any serious unavoidable effects.
Objectives
The objectives of thls study were as follows:
1) To study base line data of the community.
2) -To identify causes and consequences along the
course of the project development relating to
public health and public safety.
3) To develop public health, public safety mitiga-
tion measures and monitoring programs.
Scope of.Work
This  study  was  divided  into 2 major  parts, analysis of
existing data  and  survey  data.    The existing data, were
further  divided  into  3 parts:  (i) health facilities and
4-40



health personnels; (ii) morbidity and mortality, outpatients,
inpatients, food and water-borne diseases, diseases of the
respiratory system, mosquito-borne diseases, vaccine preven-
table  diseases,  sexually  transmitted   diseases  and  HIV
infections, accidents, and parasitic diseases; (Mii) other
health status, environmental sanitation, nutritional status,
maternal and child health, and family  planing.   The survey
data, on the other hand, were sub-divided into 4 parts:
(i) morbidity, causes of illness, accidents and injuries,
and parasitic diseases; (1i) mortality; (iiI) disability;
(iv) other health status, environmental sanitation, nutri-
tional status, maternal and child health, family planing,
and mental health and stress.
6.3.2  DETHODOLCOY
The methods of this study consisted of the following
procedures:
1) Data on demography, health facilities or health
delivery system, health personnel, morbidity
and mortality rates, and other health status
were collected from reports and records of
various government agencies In Nakhon Ratchasima
Province.
2) The survey on community health was carried out
by an interview technique based on a structured
interview schedule and an observational form to
gather data on people health (illness and in-
juries)  and   environmental  sanitation.    The
villages studied included Ban Khao Nol (ZIUL11-
usi), Ban Tha Ngoi (?iuiiomu) of Pak Chong
district, and Ban Khao Yai Tiang (1Luh1JLnu%),
and Ban Sub Sri Chan (Z1s9UrnUffiUW7) of Si Khiu
district (See Figure 6-3).
3) Stool examination for parasitic diseases and
nutritional status assessment.
4) Projection of the consequences of public health
changes due to the proposed project.

6.3.3   EUISTZUG EaVI NOMNTIL CONDITIONS
6.3.3.1 Existing Data
The Minlstry of Public Health Is responsible in provlding
care for all people ln the whole country lncluding health
promotion, disease prevention and control, and treatment and
rehabilltation.   In Nakhon Ratchaslma  provlnce,  curative
services were mainly conducted by the regional and dlstrict
hospitals while health promotion and disease prevention and
control services were mainly provided by health centers
located in tambons and villages. Private medical clinlcs
and the private health sectors which were mostly located in
urban  areas  maLnly provided curative services.   In  rural
areas, people usually sought medical and health care from
drug stores, local traditional healers, community health
volunteers and government health centers. The findings of
existLng data analysis were summarlzed as follows:
Public Health Pacilities and Personnels
There were many head quarters of government health agencLes,
private  hospitals,  clinics,  and   midwLfery  and  nursing
schools.   The Nakhon Ratchasima regional  hospital,  namely
Maharatch, also served as a provinclal or general hospital
that supported community hospitals and general hospitals in
other provinces. There were 21 community hospitals served
In all dlstricts (except Muang distrlct), 267 health centers,
1 extended hospital, 3,174 health post volunteers, 25,915
health educators, 2,670 model mothers, 930 traditional birth
attendants, 826 vlllage sanitation mechanics, 6 private hos-
pitals (395 beds), 130 medlcal clinics, 35 dental clinics,
and 78 midwifery clinics. (see Table 6-12)
In general, it was considered that the health facilities and
personnels of Nakhon Ratchasima province were adequate with
a very solld foundation of primary health care programs ln
the community.

Morbidity
a) Outpatients   The  leading  causes of morbidity In  out-
patients  were  the  diseases  of the   respiratory   tract
system, diseases of the digestive system and ill-defined
conditions.  Morbidity rates  which  were  147.5,  99;5  and
81.1 per 100,000 population respectively, were not dif-
ferent when compared-to morbidity rates of the whole region.
(see Table 6-13)
b) Inpatients The most leading causes of morbidity of in-
patients In 1990   were diseases of  enteritis and  diarrhea
(272.1 per 100,000 pop.). The morbidity rate was whigher
than that in 1989 (246.7 per 100,000 pop.), and 1.32 times
higher than that of the whole region.
The next leading cause of morbidity was infections and
others (229.1 per 100,000 pop.). The morbidity rate in 1990
was 1.56 times higher than that In 1989 and 1.74 times
higher than that for the whole region.
The third leading cause was the symptom and ill-defined
condition.   The morbidity rate in 1989 and 1990 were  218.3
and 226.4 per 100,000 pop. respectively. The morbidity rate
for the whole regLon was 1.5 time hiqher than that in Nakhon
Ratchasima prorince.
Other important diseases were pneumonia and malaria. The
morbidity rate was less than that for whole region. The
morbidity rates of malaria in 1989 and 1990 were 19.3 and
23.6 per 100,000 pop. respectively while the morbidity rates
for the whole region were 111.6 and 79.0 per 100,000 pop.
respectively.    The pneumonia morbidity rate was lower than
that for the whole region too.
The morbidity rates from other diseases such as Dengue
Haemorrhagic  fever, anemia, accidents and so on. were not
significantly different from those -for the whole region.

c) Food and Water Borne Diseaaes
Nakhon  Ratchas 1a Province.       Using  data  from
epidemiological surveillance system, it was found
that the most notificational disease was diarrhea,
the morbidlty rate of which was 948.01 per 100,000
pop. In 1989 and increased to 1,103.62 per 100,000
pop. in 1990. The other important diseases in this
group were dysentery, food poisoning, typhoid and
hepatitis.    Their morbidity  rates in  1990 were
181.70, 133.61, 15.73 and 18.54 per 100,000 pop.
respectively.    So  diarrheal disease was the most
important  cause of morbidity  in the  population.
(see Table 6-15)
Pak Chong and Si Dhiu Dlstricts. Diarrheal disease
was the highest  morbidity rate In Pak Chong and Si
Khiu  distrlcts  too.   In  Si  Khiu  district, the
morbidity rate in 1988 was 1,384.47 per 100,000 pop.
It then decreased to 931.55 and 852.4 per 100,000
pop. In 1989 and 1990 respectively. In 1990, the
morbidity rate of diarrhea in Pak Chong was 1.6
times higher than that in Si Khiu district.
For other important diseases in this group In Pak
Chong district in 1990, the morbidity rates of food
poisoning, dysentery (unspeciried) and infectious
hepatitis were 162.8, :84.8 and 24.8 per 100,000 pop.
respectively.   In Si Khiu  district, the important
diseases in this group were dysentery (unspecified),
food poisoning, typhoid and becillary dysentery
(118.7,  78.3,  43.5  and  3.6  per   100,000  pop.
respectively).
It was noticed that the morbidity rates of typhoid
fever and bacillary dysentery in Si Rhlu were 4.5
and 17.2 times higher than those in Pak Chong
district respectively, but the morbidity rates of
enteric fever and food poisoning In Pak Cong were
6-51

8.23 and  2.1 times  higher than  those in Si  Khlu
dlstriet respectively.
d) Mosquito-borne Diseases.   Using data from a health deve-
lopment report of reglon 3 in 1990, it was found that :
Dangue Ilmmorrhagic Fever     The morbidity rate of
D.H.F. in 1989 which was 129.1 per 100,000 pop.
increased to 157.7 per 100,000 pop. in 1990. Never-
theless, the morbidity  rate In Nakhon Ratchasl.a
province was lower than that In the whole region.
The morbidity rate of D.H.F. ln Pak Chong district
was 24.07 per 100,000 pop. in 1988 and increased to
61.95 and 82.8 per 100,000 pop. In 1989 and 1990
respectively.   In Si Khiu district,  the morbidity
rate was Increasing too, 63.24, 150.42 and 222.0
per 100,000 pop. In 1988, 1989 and 1990 respec-
tlvely.   It was 1.4-1.7 times  higher than that in
Pak Chong district.
Enephalitis The morbidity rate of encephalitis in
Nakhon  Ratchasima  province was   about  2.0  per
100,000 pop., a lLttle lower than that in the whole
region. (The morbidity rate of encephalitis in the
whole  region  was  1.6  per  100,000  pop).    The
morbidity rate in Si Khiu was 2 times higher than
that in Pak Chong district (2.6 and 1.4 per 100,000
pop. respectively)
Malaria   Incidence rates of malaria  in 1990 ln Si
Rhlu and Pak Chong district were 0.1-0.3 per 1,000
pop. approxlmately equal to those ln Nakhon Ratcha-
sima province (0.27 per 1,000 pop.) and 18-41 times
lower than those In the whole country. It was
noticed that the incidence rate of malaria in the
two districts was decreasing. And according to the
slide positive rate, it was found that the slide
6-5'



positive rate in the two distriets was 7.57-8.85
times lower than those in the whole country, and
the trend were decreasing also.
Meningitis    The morbidity rates of  menlngitis in
Nakhon Ratchasima province in 1989 and 1990 were
3.1 and 3.3 per 100,000 pop. respectively (see
Table 6-16)
O) Diseases of Respiratory  Bystes.    It was found that the
morbidity rates of pneumonia and Influenza were decreasing.
Nevertheless, the morbidity rates of penumonia and influenza
were still hlgh (100-170 per 100,000 pop.) (see Table 6-17)
f) Vaccine Preventable Diseases.      In this group, diseases
whose morbidity rates were lower than 1.0 per 100,000 pop.
were  poliomyelitis,  diphtheria,  tetanus  neonatorum,  and
pertussis (0.00, 0.04, 0.19 and 0.52 per 100,000 pop.
respectively).    Measles  caused the highest morbidity rate
in  this  group,  52.68 per  100,000 pop. In 1990, 2.9 times
higher than in  1989.    Tuberculosis  was the  next leading
cause in this group, 31.0, 39.0 per 100,000 pop. in 1989 and
1990 respectively. (see Table 6-18)
g) 8exually Transmitted  Diseases and EIV Infection.   Data
from health development reports and monthly reports from
Nakhon Ratchasima provincial public health office in 1991,
revealed  that  HIV Infection were  increasing from 4.91 per
100,000 pop. in 1989 to 28.59 per 100,000 pop. in 1990, 5.72
times higher.   But other sexually transmitted diseases were
decreasing, especially gnonorrhea, which was 2 times lower.
(see Table 6-19)
h) Accidents.   Based on  data from  accident  surveillance
reports, and special reports, of Nakhon Ratchasima province,
12 groups of accidents  were  categorized.    In  Pak Chong
district, there were 5,353 accidents and 41 deaths in 1990.
6-54



The most  leading cause was traffic  accidents (39.7%).   In
Si Rhiu, In 1990, there were 5,438 accidents, and the most
leading cause was also trafflc accidents (2,241 cases).
(see Table 6-20)
1) Parasitic Diseases. Information on stool examination for
parasitlc lnfectlon was collected from community hospitals.
26-36% of the total stool samples (217,482 samples) were
positive for parasitic infections. Hookworm infections were
the most frequent parasitic infection (85.9% and 65.9% in
Pak Chong  and  Si Rhiu  district respectively).   Opisthor-
chiasis was the secondary parasltic infection (13.81% and
24.14%  in Pak Chong and Si Khiu dlstrict respectively), the
third was Taenia species infection (0.5B% and 0.61% in Pak
Chong and Si Khiu district respectively), and the others
(less than 1%) were Intestinal fluk, ascariasis, strongyloi-
dasis and so on.    It was noticed that schistosomiasis was
not found in the studied area. (see Table 6-21)
Mortality
The important leading causes of deaths were heart failures,
diseases of the respiratory system, cancer, accidents,
hypertension, and coronary diseases (42.7, 37.6, 31.5, 16.4
and 15.6 per  100,000 pop. respectively).   Notice that the
important  leading  causes of death were  non-comunicable
diseases, and the  mortality  rate of diseases of the respi-
ratory system, hypertension and coronary diseases were 2-3
times higher than those for the whole reglon. (see Table
6-22)

approach.    Thus, 239  households  were  studied.  A health
survey was conducted by uslng a structured questlonnalre.
The fi ndings were summarized as follows:
Morbidity
a) Accldents and Injuries.   About 60%-70% of all the house-
holds In the  studied  area  used  to go to Lam Ta Khong for
fishing, animal feeding, recreation and  fetching  water for
domestic and agricultural uses.   Regarding accidents ln the
Lam Ta Khong area, the morbldity  rate of  accidents In  Ban
Sub Srl Chan,  Ban Rhao Nol, Ban Khao Yal Tiang, and Ban Tha
Ngol were  4.62%,  3.4%,  3.3%  and 0.81' respectively.  The
leading causes of  accidents  were the  lnjurles by wood and
broken bottles or  glasses  (54.17%),  nails (25%),  fish (2
cases) and drownlng (1 case). (see Table 6-30)
b) Parasitic Dissases.   A survey for parasitic diseases was
conduction In Tambon Khlong Phai, where the villagers were
encouraged by the local health personnel to send in their
stools for parasitlc examination (The Kato Thick smear
method). The local health personnel In Tambon Khlong Phai
received 3B2 stool specimens for examination.   It was found
that 226 samples were positive for parasitic Infection
(59.15%),  43  cases  (19.03')  for  opisthorchis, 194 cases
(85.84') for hookworm  infection,  4 cases (9.5.%) for Taenli
species, and others (4 cases). (see Table 6-31)
Mortality
There were 11 deaths in the studied areas, tLe crude death
ra-te was 1.02 per 100 pop. The most leading cause of death
was accidents (6 cases). (see Table 6-32)
Disability
The area with the greatest number of disability cases was
Ban  Khao  Yal  Tiang  (3.82%  of  total  populatlon).   The

6.3.4.1  Construction Period Iuapct
During the project constructicn period, immigration of
labour force from outside may tortribute to more health pro-
blems including:
Food and Water-Borne Diseases.    The  incidence of diseases
in this group were found to be g4ite high still,  especially
diarrhea.   The  people  from  O'tside  may  contract  local
diseases and get ill  due to  lPSufficient immunity.   There
may be an  outbreak of diseases particularly In an area with
poor environmental sanitation sieh as a camp for workers.
Mosquito-Borne Diseases.   DengJet haemorrhagic fever was the
highest incidence found in this group. Malaria and encepha-
l-itis, on the other hand, did not pose a serious threat
because of their low lncidence and because there were very
good control programs organlsed by the malaria center.

outside who come with their parents may get ill because of
their insufficient immunity.
Vacclne Preventable Diseases.   The incidence of diseases in
this group was very low (except measles) and the coverage of
immunization was very complete.    Nevertheless,  all of the
workers'children should receive full courses of immunization
from local health personnel on a routine basis.
Sexually Transmitted Diseases.   Nakhon Ratchaslma is a very
big province.   There are a  lot of  recreation  places  and
brothels. It was found that HIV infectlon in thls province
was increasing while other sexually transmitted diseases
were not but their incidences was still high. So the workers
in this project may spread and contract these diseases.
AccLdents and Injuries.  Since this project will be situated
at the top of the hill and the road was not good enough,
traffic  accidents  should be  considered.    Preventions of
accidents and injuries during working time that are caused
by engines, instruments, and so on should be considered as
well.
Parasltic Diseases.    Hookworm  infection was  found to be
quite high especially in Ban Khao Yal Tiang, where there
was a low percentage of households having latrine (50%). If
the workers do not take precautlons, they may be infected by
this  parasite and  finally  get anemia.  As for oplsthor-
chiasis, the incidence was low and there were a good
campaign. Nevertheless, if the workers keep the habit of
eating raw or fermented fishe, they may get opisthorchiasts.
Other parasites did not pose a serions threat.
Enviromnental Sanitation.    There was  a low  percentage of
latrine and clean drinking water, while the incidence of
food and water-borne diseases and parasitic infection was
high. As a result, an outbreak of these diseases may easily
occur  particularly  in areas  with  poor   environmental
sanitation.
6-79



Nutritional Status. During the project construction period,
some parents who go to work for this project do not have
enough time to take-good  care of their children.   For thls
reason, there may be more cases of first degree malnutrition
that was already quite high in the studied areas.
Maternal and Child Health.    Although maternal  and  child
health care services in the studied areas were very well
provided by local health personnel, fertility women and
children   from  outside  should  receive  complete  routine
services.
6.3.4.2 Long-Torm Impact
It Is believed that after the construction period, the
project -area will be a new recreational area and many people
will come to visit.   The  impacts  that may  occure are as
follows:
Food and Water-Borne Diseases.    Outbreaks of diseases that
result from poor food sanitation and unclean water are
caused by (i) people who come for recreation and bring food
and water with them to consume; (11) food stores that have
business in the project area.
Accidents and Injuries. The more people come to visit the
project area, the more accidents may occur, both traffic
accidents and other accidents such as injury from broken
bottles or glasses.
Environmental Sanitation.   Poor environmental sanitation in
the project area will be caused by both people who come to
visit and food stores in the project area.

6.4.2    METhODOLOGY
The method of study employed in the assessment of impact of
the Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project on historical and
archaeological sites Includes several stages of work as
follows :
1) Documentary research
This includes the review of the literatures,
reports   and  publications   on   history   and
archaeology of  the project area.
2) Pield Survey
In this step, the project area was intenslvely
surveyed   as   the  villagers  in  the   nearby
communities were Interviewed in order that the
historical and archaeological sites, if any, can
be  located exactly  and  fully  recorded   and
analyzed. Topographic maps (1:50,000) and aerial
photographs were also utilized in the surveys.
3) Data Analysis
All of the data collected through the literature
reviews and archaeological field investigations
were analyzed so that historical/archaeological
significance of the area can be evaluated.
6.4.3    EXISTING MlYflONTRL CONDITION
6.4.3.1 Archaeological and Historical Background of the
Xorat Baud n of Northeast Thailand.
Intensive archaeological research in the Karat Basin of the
Northeast Thailand Plateau during the past few years has
shown  that  thls region has a long history.   The  earliest
evidence indicating human occupation in this basin can be
dated back to around 3,000 years ago, if not earlier. This
was found in several provinces of the lower basin of the
Plateau.
6-B2



The archaeological investigations so far conducted indicate
that most of the 3,000 years old prehistoric sltes are
located on the remnants of the middle terrace along both the
major  rivers and their tributaries.   These  archaeological
sites  were   either   occupation   areas   or   cemeteries.
Archaeological evidence found so far also points out that
the   population  of  this  period  already  practiced  rice
agriculture and animal domestication. Bronze metallurgy was
also very well known. The presence of bronze artifiacts as
well as other objects made of non local materials shows
clearly that a regional exchange network was well developed
during that time.
During the later prehistoric period, which is marked by the
appearance of iron, and can be dated around 2,700-1,600
years ago, human settlements increased in number. This time
the low terrace and high terrace were occupied even though
these two types of landforms were not well suited for rice
agriculture.    Population  increase is suggested to be  one
of the major factors leading to the expansion of settlements
into those less attractive  environmental  zones.   Abundant
resources of Iron ore and salt, In turn, are belived to be
the factors that encouraged the people to settle in the less
fertile lands during the late prehistoric period.
In the successive Early Historic Period, the beginning of
which can be dated to around 1,500 years ago, the Korat
Basin became even more densely populated. Hundreds of early
historic moated settlements have already been identified on
the flat low lying plain of the basin. There was also a
number of religious sites or monuments of this period
distributed widely in the area. These are the sites with
boundary or 'sima stones.
The Korat Basin continued its importance down to the Lopburi
Period, which is dated around the llth-13th century A.D., as
is evident by the presence of numerous moated settlements
and  religious  buildings  with  ancient   Khmer   art   and
architectural styles. A large number of man-made reservoirs
6-84



of this period were also found in various part of the Korat
Basin.
Durlng the Ayutthaya and Early Bangkok periods, the Korat as
well as the Sakon Nakhon Basins to the North became
territories   under the  sovereignty  of  the  Klngdoms  of
Ayutthaya and Ratanakosin respectively.
Archaeological and historical evidences of all the time
periods described above were also found in the area of the
present   Nakhon   Ratchasima   province.    For   instance,
prehistoric   cemeteries  and villages  have  already  been
located in Amphoe Si Khiu, Sung Noen, Phimai, Pak Thongchai,
Prathai, Bua Yai, Non Sung, Non Thai, Dan Khun Thod,
Chumphuang and Khong. The early historic or "Dvaravati" and
*Lopburi" moated settlements and religious buildings have
been found in all of the districts of this province. Phimai
seems to be one among the most important ancient monuments
and towns in Thailand. Historical records also point out
clearly that Nakhon Ratchasima had maintained its Importance
as one of the major outpost towns in Northeast Thailand down
to the Ayutthaya and Early Bangkok Periods.
6.4.3.2  Historical  and Archaeological Sites in the Project
Area and Its Vicinity
The historical/archaeological investigation in the area of
the Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project includes both the
lntensive ground surveys and the interviewing of the local
villagers in the nearby settlements. Neither archaeological
artifact nor trace of ancient settlement was found from the
ground surveys. No information lndicating the existence of
any archaeological/historical sites was obtained through the
Interview  of  the  local  inhabitants.    Thus, lt  can  be
concluded that there is no archaeological/historical site in
the  project area on the top of Khao Yai Thiang.   Based  on
the information derived from the analysis of the pattern of
ancient settlement locations in the Northeast Thailand, the
probable explanation for the absence of historical/archa

eological site in the project area ls that the area is on
an elevation so high that it becomes unsuitable for a
permanent settlement.
However, there are 9 important archaeological and historical
sites in the viclnity of the project area as shown In
Figure 6-4. These sites are located at the distance varying
from about 5 to 35 kilometres from the targeted upper
reservoir area. The study team also visited these sites in
order to assess If there would be any impact of the project
on the sites. The detailed descriptions of the sites are as
follows.
Site No.1
Site Name : Khao  Chan  Ngum Rock Painting, Ban Lert  Sawad,
Amphoe Si Khiu, Changwat Nakhon Ratchasima.
Geographical Location  : Lat. .140 48' 50' N.
Long. 101° 34' 15" E.
Pariod  :     Prehistoric/ca. 3000-2500 years ago.
This prehistoric rock painting site is found in a rock
shelter on the northeastern slope of Khao Khuan Lan at an
elevation of about 400 meters above the mean sea level.
There are altogether 40 individual paintings. Among them, 31
are human figures, 4 are animal figures, and 5 are probably
some kinds of symbolic paintings.   All of the paintings are
in red. The most famous scene depicts a ceremony in which
men, women and children take part.   There  is  also another
important scene depicting a man shooting with bow and arrow,
with his dog standing nearby him.
This site is now well protected by the abbot of Wat Khao
Chan Ngam, and is a well known tourist attraction.

the northern edge of the site.
Some rectangular and cubic blocks of sandstone are found at
this  site.   Numerous  parallel chiseled cut  from  ancient
sandstone quarry can be readilv observed throughout the
exposed sandstone outcrop here. This site could have been
one of the sandstone resources for the construction of some
of the  Lopburi period shrines and sculptures found in  the
Nakhon Ratchasima Province.
The site is now developed as a tourist attraction.

The implementation of the Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage
Project will not create significant impacts on archaeolo-
gical/historical values of the project area. This is based
on the facts that there Is no archaeological/historical site
in the targeted upper reservoir area, and that the existing
important ancient activity areas and monuments are located
quite  far  away  from  the  project  site.   All   of   the
historical/archaeological sites, furthermore, have already
been developed and well protected legistatively. - --

6.5      hESTar=ZC VALUES
6.5.1     NTRODUCTION
In order to investigate the aesthetic values of Lam Ta Khong
areas and its vicinity, the objectives of the work will be
undertaken as follow:
1) To evaluate and assess the beneficial as well
as detrimental effects  of the   environmental
changes assoclated with the project development
in the aesthetic viewpoint.
2) To identify the aesthetic values related to
other activities, especially recreation and
tourism.
3) To identify and evaluate the project potential
upon the aesthetic values as perceived and
viewed by the public.
4) To recommend the mltigation plan to lessen the
adverse impact and/or to enhance the project
potential upon the aesthetic values.
SCOPE OF WORK
The  existing  seasonal   characteristics  and  features  of
natural and pultural aesthetic and amenity values in the
project area and its vicinity were studied (Areas I and II).
The benefit and loss of aesthetic values associated with the
project  development were  evaluated.   Then, mitigation and
development plans were established to enhance the aesthetic
and amenity values in the project area.
6.5.2     TBODOLOGY
The methods of study were as follows.
1) Reviewing the literature, plans and Project on
the basis of aesthetical aspects and amenity in
the project area and Its vicinity.

2) Conducting field surveys on existing conditions,
attitudes, and perception both in terms of
cultural and aesthetic values of the people
from various occupations.
3) Interpreting and evaluating adverse as well as
beneficial impacts of the proposed project on
aesthetic values and amenity.
4) Recommending the guidelines for future mitiga-
tion development in terms of aesthetic and
amenity values.
6.5.3    EXISTING ENVIRONNEMTAL CONDITIONS
The study of the existing environmental conditions of the
project was conducted in two  major  areas.   The first area
was the Lam Ta Khong Reservoir and its vicinity, and the
second was the three proposed upper reservior sites on the
surrounding mountains.
6.5.3.1 The Lam Ta thong Reservoir
There is a seasonal variations of the environmental features
and conditions of the Lam Ta Khong Reservoir, namely the
water   level,  the   characteristics  of   vegetation,  the
topography of the reservoir and the surrounding area. The
aesthetic values of the reservoir are one of the important
factor worth considering as they can be observed by the
passers-by both on Mittraphab Highway and on the railway
beside the reservoir itself.
In the rainy season (September-October 1990) the water level
of the reservoir was very low and there was some attractive
scenery from the red color of the water that came from
western upstream contrasting with the old deep green color.
Vegetations in the surrounding area also enhanced the beauty
because of its fresh green color.   However, the atmospheric
conditions were rather gloomy because the weather was so
cloudy and stormy. The vegetation was wet and green.
6-96



In the winter (December 1990 - January 1991) the water level
of the reservoir was higher than in the rainy season.   Thls
greatly increased its attraction. The color of the water was
deep bluish green, almost being in a static condition which
gave much reflections  of the  surrounding sceneries.   This
could be seen very easily from every direction. The sky Was
clear with some light clouds. So the visualization was very
bright. There were some attractive red and orange indigenous
flowers and foliages surrounding the reservoir.
In the summer (March-April 1991) the water level did not
affect the aesthetic values which were in a moderate level.
The colors were blue and green with some reflections of the
surrounding mountains and the sky above.
Most trees  and  shrubs gave the atmosphere of a dry season.
Many trees had fewer  foliage.   This offerred broader views
and longer vision to the viewers.   Occasionally the Lam Ta
Khong Reservoir seen from the highland was not clear because
there were a lot of fogs covering the water surface below.
6.5.3.2 The Upper Reservoir
The three proposed project sites on the mountains near the
Lam Ta Khong Reservoir have specific seasonal features of
landform, topography and vegetation. UR-1 is the best site
for Its accessibility and its location which have great
potential to enhance more aesthetic aspects for recreation
development.
In the rainy season, the moisture made the trees green and
attractive. However, the access from Mittraphab Highway to
UR-1 site was dangerous due to the slippery road.
In the winter season, the site UR-1 had some atmosphere of
dry season. Most shrubs and field crops died and many trees
had  fever  foliages.    From  this  site, the  Lam Ta Khong
Reservoir could be seen only occasionally.
6-97



In summer, the environmental conditions were the same as in
the winter time.   But there were  some  attractlve  aspects
from the features of vegetation and topography.   There were
some red, yellow, orange and purple indigenous flowers on
the mountain along the access to UR-1 site.
6.5.4    IMPACT ASSESSHMET
6.5.4.1 Construction Period Impact
During the Project construction period the aesthetic values
of Lam Ta Rhong Reservoir will not be much disturbed because
most of the construction activities will be on the high land
of the upper reservoir and the underground tunnel wlli not
disturb the existing environment  conditions.   However, the
excavation of the two disposal areas near the reservoir
shore along the western side of Nittraphab Highway will be
seen from the highway but this is not a serious problem.
On the highland, the construction of the proposed reservior
at site UR-1 will -have some effect to the land and people
on the mountain.   During  the  construction  the  aesthelic
values on landform topography, vegetation, and viewpoints
will be disturbed or will be missing from viewers.
As regards the construction of the access road to the
Project sites and the construction of the transmittion line,
only little disturbance from the transportation system on
the highway will be faced by the communities around the
Project area since the access road to the Project site and
the transmission line are on the mountain far from the main
public activities.
6.5.4.2 Long-Term Impact
After the construction the aesthetic values of the Project
area during the operation period will not be much affected
from the operation activities provided that the environ-
6-98



mental conditions and the features of the area are main-
tained in the good and proper conditions.   The Lam Ta Khong
Reservoir's aesthetlc values will still remain as they used
to be.   The water level will change a little daily and will
not affect the overall pictures of the scenery of the
reservoir.    Beside this If good management is observed at
the two disposal areas beside Mittraphab Highway more
attractive visions will be enhanced to the area.
On the highland the new the topography and landform will be
alt-ered to a better condltlon.    Thus, the aesthetic values
of this site will naturally be improved as a result of the
construction.

C:FAI'lnEl  7
7.1 X.TRODUCTION
The assessment,presented in the previous chapters (Chapter 3
to 6) has been carried out for the individual environmental
resources/values according to the NEE guidelines.   For each
environmental resource/value, the existing condition and the
Project impacts have been identified and described in
details.   This Chapter will present the overall view of the
assessment by drawing relevant findings from the assessments
item by item into integrated analysis.
Approach
The ecological system analysis approach was used in this
Integrated assessment.    The overall ecological system  was
considered to be continuously Inter-related. The ecological
components were catagorized into three sub-systems of: (1)
land, (2) water, and (3) human.   For the three sub-systems,
the Project construction and the subsequent environmental
impacts were identified, quantified and/or qualified in
alignment with the two Project development stages, i.e.; the
Project construction period, and the Project operation
period.
Accordingly, the needed mitigation/development measures were
indicated.
7.2       LAND
7.2.1     CONCERNED LAWD AREAS
The development of the Lam Ta Rhong Pumped Storage Project
will affect the following land areas:
7-1



- the proposed sites for the upper reservoir,
switchyard, water way, and their peripheries.
- the proposed disposal areas which includes the
area along the eastern side of the upper
reservoir  and  the  area   along   the   lower
reservoir on the sides of the tailrace outlet.
- the proposed access road and its vicinity.
The affected areas are depicted in Figure 7-1.
7.2.2    IMPACT FROM TBE PROJECT CONSTRUCTION
Actions Causing Impacts
In the project coustruction period, the actions causing
impacts upon the concerned land areas are:
-) Constructlon of the Upper Reservoir. The upper
reservoir is a large scale pool type reservoir
in the form of a square with a side of about
750 m and a large curve at  each  corner.   The
reservoir will be constructed by excavating and
partially embanking a slow-sloped plateau.   In
order to conserve proper environmental condi-
tlon and to comply with the watershed classifi-
cation  regulation  designated  by   NEB,   the
selected  site  for  the  upper  reservoir   is
located in the watershed class 1 B where
restriction  is  not  so  strict  as   in   the
watershed class 1 A.
2) Construction of the Waterway. The route of the
waterway is designed in such a way that the
distance of the waterway on the mountaln ridge
Is mostly  confined.   Since  the  penstock Is
installed across the watershed class 1A, it has
to be underground to be in accordance with the
environmental control.

3) Construction   of  the   Powerhouse   and  the
.Switchyard.  Just as In the case of the water-
way, the power statlon is  constructed  under-
ground and the entrance of the access tunnel of
the -powerhouse  and   the   opening   of   the
swltchyard are minlmized in order to avoid
disturbing the watershed class IA.
4) Disposal of the Muck.   The  disposal  area for
the muck from the upper reservoir and the
penstock upper horizontal tunnel Is provided
along the eastern side of the upper reservoir.
The muck from the powerhouse and the waterway
Ls dumped into the disposal area provided along
the lower reservoir on the  sides  of  tailrace
outlet.  The surface of the upper disposal area
is designed to be gradually inclined (1:5). The
level of the top end Is the same level with the
dam crest. A wide area Is provlded on the top
end to enable effective use in the future and
to ensure that this area is kept in harmony
with  the  surrounding area.   For  the  lower
disposal area, the surface of this area is
designed to be wide and on the same level with
the Highway No.2.   This area is intended to be
developed as a park in the future.
5) Improvement of the Access Road and Increase  of
Traffic  Volumes.  The  existing  access  road
needs to be improved due to Its bad existing
condition. The increase of traffic volumes
could dlsturb the existing land ecosystem.
6) Xnstallation of Transmission Line.    The tran-
smission line Is expected to connect with the
three substations totalling a dlstance of about
95 km. The installation. wil be carried out
almost along the entire route of the national
hlighway.

Environmental Iupacts
The two major aspects covered in this integrated assessment
of the impact from the project construction include landuse,
soil erosion, and forest/wildlife/rare species.
Lzaduse and Soil Erosion.    Accordlng to the fact
that the watershed class 1A as designated by NEB
will be avoided In the project construction,
proper landuse and environmental conditions can
therefore be conserved. *The major part of the
project areas, i.e. the proposed upper reservoir
and the proposed disposal area are low-productive
farmland with very low to low soil fertility.   In
these land areas the anticipated negatlve impact
in terms of landuse and soil erosion is therefore
only slight. However, ln the case of the proposed
areas  for  the waterway,  the   powerhouse   and
switchyard, and the access road, soil erosion
problem has a wide range of severity depending
upon slope factor.   To prevent  or  reduce  this
negative Impact, soil conservation measures must
be taken during the construction period.
Forest/Wildlife/Rare Species. The proposed project
areas are mostly used for crop plantation or left
Idle suitable for only limited number of wildlife
species.    No  threatened, rare,  or  endangered
species was found.   The existing wildlife species
will be affected by the consequent activities from
the project construction and from pollutants like
noise, vibration, exhaust gas, etc during the
construction period. Since the proposed areas are
relatively small with only a limited number of
wildlife species common to other parts of the
country and the proposed activities are temporary,
only   slight   and   short-term    impacts    are
anticipated.

7.2.3    IMPACTS FROM TEE PROJECT OPERLITON
Actions Causing Impacts
The completion of the project construction will end most of
the nuisance activities occurring during the construction
period.    However, in the project operation  perlod  the
traffic volume of the access roads will increase slightly.
Increase in traffic volume. The Increased traffic
volume  induced  by  the  Project   operation   is
anticipated to cause small negatlve impacts due to
air pollution, noise pollution, vibration, dis-
turbance of the natural ecosystem, etc.
Environmental Impacts
Landuse and Soil Erosion. After the completion of
the project constr-uction period the degree of
seriousness of soil erosion problem will gradually
decrease as the appropriate reforestation and soil
erosion prevention schemes are applied.
Forest/Wildlife/Pare Species.   The  impacts  from
the increased traffic volume are anticipated to
exert only  a slight  negative  Lapact  on   the
existing  land ecosystem.   In  the long  run the
affected ecosystems will be able to adapt them-
selves and maintain their stability.
7.3       WATER
7.3.1     CONCERNED WATER BODIE a
The Project will use the exlsting Lam Ta Khong reservoir as
the lower reservoir. Consequently, the Lam Ta Khong river
downstream/irrigation system and other related water supply
7-7



systems downstream  will be indirectly affected.   Thus, the
assessment will concentrate on these two water bodies:
1) the Lam Ta Thong reservoir.
2) the Lam Ta Khong river and irrigation system
downstream.
Fiqurer 7-2 and 7-3 show physical features of the two water
bodies.
7.3.2     zuPACT FROu THE PROJaCT COSfUCTION
Actions Causing Impacts
Durinq the Project construction the following actions can
cause impact to the ecology of water sub-system:
1) Earth Work.     The construction  will  concern
ground cover openning, excavating, hauling,
embanking, and disposing of soil, dirt, and
muck. These actions can cause soil erosion, and
consequent transport of soil particles, sus-
pended and soluble materials to the reservoir
during  the  rain   period.    Here   are   the
construction activities likely to cause some
impacts: (1) The excavation of tailrace tunnel,
access  tunnel,   and   power   cable   tunnel.
resulting excavated muck to be disposed of at
the  provided  area  on  the   reservoir   rim.
(Period:Feb 94 - Feb 95) (2) Ground preparing
work for the switchyard and access roads.
(Period:Dec 95 to Jun 96)
2) Underwater Work.    The  construction  at  the
tailrace outlet will require underwater work.
The bottom of the reservoir located in front of
the outlet will be excavated to a trapezoid
section gradually widened outward to the length
of approximately 700 m. A cofferdam is to be

Dnvironmental Impacts
The Project actions during the construction period can cause
short-term impacts on the aquatic ecology of Lam Ta Khong
reservoir. The impacts are confined In the action areas,
i.e., the muck disposal area and the talirace  outlet  area.
The two periods where severe lmpacts on the water body could
occur are the period when the cofferdam is built around the
site where underwater work is required and. the finishlng
period when the cofferdam ls removed. During construction,
the water pumped from the construction site could slightly
affect the main water body of the reservoir.
The anticipated impacts are:
i) The water quality in the vicinity will be
deteriorated  in terms  of  higher   suspended
solids  and turbidity   resulting   from   the
Lncrease eroslon in rainy periods and from the
underwater  work   (building   the   cofferdam,
pumping out water, etc.)
2) Aquatic life will be disturbed partly as a
consequence of water quality deterioration and
partly from the direct disturbance of the
Project actions: muck disposal and underwater
work at the tailrace outlet. The anticipated
affect is the lowering of aquatic biological
activities, i.e., phytoplankton, zoo-plankton,
including the restriction of habitat area for
fish.
No further impacts from Project construction is expected to
occur on the reservoir main water body and the Lam Ta Thong
river downstream.
7-12



7.3.3     IMPACT FRO! PRO=Cr OPERATION
Actions Causing Impacts
The Project operation action that directly cause impacts on
the water bodies is the daily operation of pumping-storing-
discharging of water at the maximum amount of 9.9 MCM per
cycle.
This amount of water which Is pumped from the reservoir will
cause daily drawdown of water level in the reservoir as
shown in Figure 7-4. The affected drawdown depth ranges
from 0.28 m to 2.20 a at normal high water level (NHWL 277 m
msl) and low water level (LWL 161 m msl), and the  resultlng
drawdown area ranges from 0.75 sq km to 1.55 sq km at NHWL
and LWL.    ComparLng to the normal condition, the  ratlo of
drawdown depth to normal depth ranges from 0.03 to 0.60 at
HWL and LWL, and the ratio of drawdown area to normal area
ranges from 0.01 to 0.32 at NHWL and LWL.
In considering the lower reservoir capacity, it was found to
correspond with the turnover period in the range  of  appro-
ximately 2.0 days to 31.3 days at LWL (reservoir volume 20
MCM) and NHWL (reservoir volume 310 MCM).
Envlrozmental Impacts
The environmental impacts on water sub-system caused by the
Project actions are:
1) Restriction  of Water  Availability.         The
available water for the  existing  requirement,
i.e.,  irrigation,  water   supply,   pollution
control will be restricted only in the case
when the reservoir water level comes close to
the formerly designed LWL.  On the other hand,
the reservoir LWL should be raised to the level
corresponding to the existing death storage

volume plus 9.9 NCM. Thus, the LWL should be
raised from 261.00 m msl to LWL 263.00 m msl
for reservoir operation.
2) Plankton and Fish  Kill.   The  daily  pumping,
storage, and discharge (9.9 MCM per day) will
result in plankton and' fish kill, and con-
sequently reduce the aquatic life population
and  fish yield.   The  magnitude  of  impacts
varies Inversely with the reservoir storage
volume. Thus, the impact in a dry year will be
higher than In a met year.   Mathematical model
analysis indicated that the Project impact on
decreasing  phytoplankton is  small in  normal-
year conditions mainly because of its high
replacement rate.   However, the impact on dry-
year conditions Is a little higher.   For  fish
which use plankton as basic food stuff and Its
replacement process is slow, the Project impact
on  fish  population  is  high.   However,  the
impact can be reduced by effective partitioning
fish from entering the intake tunnel.   With an
effective protection it is expected that the
reduction in fish yield will be caused mainly
by the decrease in available food i.e. plankton
about 10% in a normal year and 17% in a dry
year. Without protecti3n the reduction in fish
yield can be tremendous.
Besides the above impacts, no other impacts are significant.
7.4       HUMA
7.4.1     ONCERNED AREA
Resulting from the Project impacts on the two ecological
resources, i.e., land and water, people in the concerned
areas as mentioned in the previous two sections will be
disturbed. In addition, the Project itself will cause both
1i                                      7-17



positive and negative impacts on the people in the local
area, and on the people in the sourounding regions.
7.4.2     INPACT PROM PROM=CT CONSTRUCTION
Negative Impact
1) Forty-five household in the Project site (Ban
Xhao Yai Thiang, Croup 6, or the second group
of the  forest  community  village)  will  lose
1393.75 rai (223 hectares) of farm land. As a
result, the majority of the households will
permanently lose thier subsistence land as
well as cash income of 22,232 Baht/year from
fruit trees and perennials.
2) The inhabitants of Ban Khao Yai Thiang which Is
on the route to the Project site will be
disturbed by the dust arising from passing
vehicles and by the construction noise.
3) Owing to the fact that there will be a great
number of workers  during   the   construction
period at the Project site, there is a tendency
for more accildents among these workers.   Also,
if their eating halits and sanitation are poor,
diaerhoea and illness from hook worms can occur
as a sesult.
4) Fishing area around the Project construction
site will be restricted for approximately 0.3
km2 or about 0.7%  of  the  reservoir  area  at
NSWL.
Positive Impact
1) The lnhabitants of working age in the above
village,  villages  along  the  edge   of   the
reservoir, and the areas nearby will have more
opportunity to work and obtain an income from
the Project. Some of the villagers will be
7-18



able to run small businesses and services for
the workers and the Project personnel.
2) There will be an increase in the amount of
circulating money providing a continuous flow
of trading and businesses both at the district
and provincial lvels.   This  will consequently
improve the overall economical conditions of
the people In Pak Chong District, Si Khiu
District,and Muang District, Nakhon Ratchasima.
This impact will eventually benefit the economy
of the country as a whole.
7.4.3     IMPACT PROM PROJECT OPERATION
Negative Impact
1) Forty-five households in Ban Khao Yai Thiang,
Group 6 will permanently lose their subsistence
land as well as incomes from growing field
crops,  fruit  trees,   and  perennials,   as
mentioned before for the construction period.
2) Inhabitants of villages along the edge of the
reservoir  who  used  to  fish  for   household
consumption and for selling will be slighly
affected  for  their  fishing  area   will   be
decreased.
3) There may be more accidents as there will be
more tourists.
Positive Impact
1) Inhabitants of Ban Khao Yai Thiang in the upper
reservoir and the vicinity are likely to obtain
more income from doing business with and giving
services to tourists visiting the  area.   With
an increase in tourist number, services in Pak
Chong District, Si Khiu District, and Muang
District will improve.   This  will  eventually
7-19



bear good results on the country's economy as a
whole.
2) The road that goes through Ban Khao Yal Thianq
wl1 be improved.
After the upper reservoir on the hill top of
Khao Yai Thiang has been fully constructed and
all the trees being planted around the con-
struction site, the surrounding environment and
asthetic value will be considerably improved
compared wilth the conditions existing in the
present days.
7.5      AmSoBs"E= OF BoVIRONEr=IL ZMPACI ON THE VAIERSHED
AV= J1A
During the Project construction, some parts of the com-
ponents, i.e.,the powerhouse and some parts of the penstock,
tail race tunnel, power cable tunnel, and access tunnel will
be built underground within the watershed area class 1A
(Figure 7-1). The area Is the protected forest and headwater
source by law and so it should remain in permanent forest
cover. In order to avoid any disturbance to the protection
forest area, the structures should be located deep under-
ground at the depth 100-300 m below the ground surface of 1A
area.
However, to as certain the safety of both physical and
biological environmental  resources  in the  area from  any
disturbance, specific environmental assessment for 1A area
has been carried out, the results of which are presented
hereunder.
7.5.1    E=ST3I3G ZNVIRONMEETAL COkDIT=ON
Morphology.    The   concerned  watershed   11  area    is
characterLzed as a table land plateau. The ground surface
elevation ranges from 450 to 650 m (NSL)  with *a  slope  of
T-20



approxlmately 1:2. The geological formation consists of
siltstone,fino-grained sandstone, claystone, and alternation
of  fine-grained  sandstone  and  siltstone.   The  relation
between the layers are conformable, the strlkes of the
layers are N 300W to N 700, and the dips 5O to 100 NE.
Sail and Landuo. The soil in the area consists of colluvial
deposit and talus deposit which attain approximately 2-8 m
ln thickness. Soll fertllity in the area ranges from low to
very low, since the area is subjected to very severe
erosion. The remaining soil, thus, is low in fertility. The
dominant ground cover consists of grasses, bamboo, and some
remnant  trees.    Neither   agricultural   activities   nor
construction exists In the area.
Forest and Wildlife.    From the survey, neigther big  trees
nor economically valuable trees were found. The forest is of
secondary type. The plants found mostly were weeds and
bamboo.
As for wildlife, no sign of biq game mammals, rare, or
endangered species  were found.   Birds  are most frequently
observed.  However, they are common in other areas as well.
Geology.  The bed rock of the Project site consists  of  two
rock formations: the Phu Kradung formation with an approxi-
mate thickness of 300 a, and the Phra Wihan formation with
an approximate thickness of .250 a. The Phu Kradung formation
consists of siltstone, fine-grained sandstone, and partly
conglomerate. The Phra Wihan formation consists of coarse-
grained sandstone, claystone, alternation of fine-grained
sandstone and siltstone. In terms of hardness of rock, the
sandstones are generally massive and hard while the degree
of consolidation of siltstone is slightly low and that of
claystone Is lows The relations between the layers are con-
formable and the strikes of the layers are N 30°W to N 70°
and the dips 5P to 100 (average 60) NE.   Colluvial  deposit
and talus deposit which attain 30 m in thickness are
distributed in the slope above the waterway tunnel.
7-21



In this area no fault was found in the  outcrop.   However,
the drilling resulted In small-scale faults.
Hydro-geology.    The  results  from  hydrogeological  study
indicate that groundwater is present at the depth 38-40 m
from the ground surface at the upper reservoir site and at
the depth 6-38 m from the ground surface along the waterway
in 1A area. The aquifers are the formation of coarse-graind
sandstone and siltstone overlaid by the impervious layers of
clay and claystone. Yield of the aquifers In the area is
low except at some locations where cracks, joints, and
porous rock exist. In general the water permeability of the
aquifer is less than lxlO-5 cmfsec, making the aquifer
unsuitable for groundwater resource development.
7.5.Z    XDPaCT PROM PROJECT CONSTRUCTION
Actions Causing IXpactx
The actlvitles which can possibly cause environmental impact
to 1A area are those concerning the construction of the
underground structures, i.e., the powerhouse, the  penstock,
the tailrace tundel, the power cable tunnel, and the  access
tunnel.  The activities of concern are as follows:
a) Blasting
The steps in performing the blastlng activities
are:
1) Drilling. Before blasting the area to be
blasted will be drilled all over at 25 um
diameter and 2 m deep for dynamite packing.
2) Blasting. Dynamite will be packed in the
drilled holes. An appropriate amount of
dynamite will be used dependlng on the
hardness of rock to be blasted. In the Lam
Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project, the amount
of dynamite expected to be used will not be
over 50 lbs.
7-23



After packing the dynamite and installing
triggering cable which will be operated from
outside  the  blasting   process   will   be
triggered.   The  blasting will  proceed for
approxlmately 10 second. All workers must
be evacuated to a safe place during the
operation.
3) Ventilating. After the blastlng dust and
smoke will disperse within approximately 40
m from the blasting point.   These  di t and
smoke will be  blown out of  the  tunnel  by
fanblowers.
b) Muck Conveying
The size of the muck from blasting will be less
than 50 cm. Small vehicles will be used for
conveying the muck to the tunnel portal and
transferred to dump trucks for conveying it to
the proposed disposal area.
a) Vibration
The calculated vibrations on ground surface in
terms of particle velocity from blasting of 50
lb-dymamite at the depth 50 a, 100 m, and 300 m
are  18  m/sec,  a am/sec,  and  1.3  mr/sec
respectively. According to the US Bureau of
Mines  which   has  set   the  maximum   safety
vlbration not to exceed 50 mm/sec, the Project
blasting operation is considerably safe.
d) Noise
The source of noise will be from the blasting
and muck conveying which will occur 3-4 times
per day and the conveying will take approxi-
mately 6-8 hours per one blastlng.
7-24



Environmental Xnpacts
The impact from the Project construction on 1A area is
estimated to be trivial.  The  impact  analysis  to  support
this statement is as follows.
Soil Erosion. Since the excavation/blasting activities will
be performed at a considerable depth of 100-300 a, no
disturbance to the soil of ILA area will occur.
Forest/Wildlife. Neither direct nor Indirect disturbance to
the existing forest and wildlife in 1A area will occur. The
impact on groundwater will be confined to the deep aquifer
thus, it will have no effect related to the water table or
soil moisture.
Geological structure. The geologlcal formation of the area
is so stable that the vibration from blasting will not cause
any effect to the geological condition.
groundwater. The tunnel excavation will slightly affect the
piezometric pressure in the aquifer during the construction
period expecially in  the high  permeable  area.   However,
after finish concrete lining the effect will be alliviated.
Noise. Noise from blastinq and muck conveying will go
toward the tunnel portal. The noise intensity diminishes
with distance and direction deflecting from the tunnel
portal.    1A  area  boundary  at  the  closest   point   is
sufficiently far from the portal (approximately 500 m) and
is in the direction of about 1800 against tunnel portal.
Therefore, the noise effect in IA area is estimated to be
fairly small.

negative impact and/or enhance the positive impacts are as
follow.
7-25



Preliminary Measures
1) Public relation Implementation to create good/
clear understanding and good attitude among the
people toward the Project.
2) Compensation for the people whose farm land is
to be inundated at the upper reservoir site.
Construction-Period Measures
1) Measures for minimizing soil erosion/transport/
sedimentation.
2) Measures for minimizing nuisance from dust,
noise, and vibration.
3) Measures  for  traffic  control   to   prevent
accident.
4) Measures for health and safety.
Long Term Measures
1) Land rehabilitation and development at the
construction sites, disposal areas, and the
vicinities.
2) Fishery resource conservation in the existing
Lam Ta Khong reservoir (the Lower reservoir).
3) Management  of  water  resource  to   properly
allocate and plan for the operation of the Lam
Ta Khong reservoir in accordance with the
Project operation.
Details of the required measures and monitoring programs are
presented in Volume III:   Environmental  Impact Mitigation
Plan.
7.7       myVIROUNETAL DEVELOPMENT REC IEHDkflON
In addition to the required mitigation measures which are
necessary to mitigate the adverse Project lmpacts, the study
results  have  also   indicated  environmental   development

potential to further enhance the environmental quality  and/
or enhance efflcient uses of tl'he environmental resources/
values.   The environmental potentials and possible develop-
ment are outlined ln the following paralraphs.
Occupatlonal Development
Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project will bring about an
impact on approximately 45 households living in the Project
site, or in the area of Kao Yai Tiang Village Hu 6  (V1uT1_
uJIJJ LWn Muin 6).    The  total of  land loss will  be. around
1,393.75 rai (223 hectare), which is about 64A. of the total
aqricultural land of the village.   This means  that  the
affected population will lose the opportunities in carrying
out farminq activities as they used to do.
In order to assist these unfortunate villagers to find new
occupation,  SGAT may  need  to  initiate   an   occupation
development plan which will involve the villagers who cannot
help themselves to find new jobs. The study team sees that
beef cattle raising is appropriate for the area because of
its good return. The marketing conditions of beef cattle,
both at present and ln the future are also promLsing.
Moreover, beef cattle raising would not be difficult for the
villagers  to  carry  out  since they  already  have   some
background knowledge and experience on it. This can be seen
by the fact that the villagers in the area are already
raising an average of 5.6 animals of local-bred cattle.
The operation should be under the responsibility of EGAT, by
coordinating with relevant units.   Loaning   services  are
viable through  the Agricultural  Cooperative  Group.   The
Department of Livestock may provide technical and marketing
knowledge. The Royal forest- Department can be asked to
cooperate. Then monitoring and evaluation work can be
achieved by asking different units to cooperate. Then moni-
ring and evaluation work can be achieved by another neutral
unit.
7-27



In this beef cattle program, the farmers In each household
should begin by raising a beef bull of genuine Brahman bred,
five over 50% Brah-bred hybrid pregnant cows (2-4 months),
and another five over 50% Brahman-bred hybrid heifers.
Within ten years, the rate of return Is calculated to be as
follows:
From the survey, it can be evaluated that the total
agricultural land of the population in this area is 2,180
rai (348.8 hectare). Part of this is the land allocated by
the Royal Forest Department and the other part belongs to
the populatlon and is outside the forner area.
Benefit/cost ratio         =  1.2
(9% interest rate)
Payback period             =  3.6 years
Internal rate of return    =  16%
Average annual net benefit = 19,462 Baht
The Implementation of this program will cost an amount not
exceeding  11.65  million  Baht.   The  maximum  of program
members of 45 households will  require  250,000  Baht  each,
totalling 11.25 million Baht. The remaining amount of Baht
400,000 will be for other supplementary expenses such as
breeds, etc.
Living Condition Dwewlopoant
From  the  socio-econamic  study  in  Area   II,   problems
concerning the lack of basic infrastructures are still
evident in the area. The population still face the shortage
of water supply for their households. When the dry season
comes, villagers have to buy water for use, or struggle to
trqvel long  distances  for  water.   This  is  because the
village weir is small and leaks, and so cannot store enough
water for consumption throughout the dry period.
7-28



Thus, the improvement of water supply is the essential
requirement of the villagers that can be supported by EGAT,
which Is already well-equlpped.
The method seen as appropriate by the study team is the
improvement of the existing village weir so that its depth
and width are enlarged, and the leakage repaired. This ill
double the storage capacity and wlll be able to supply the
population all through the year. In addition to this, pipe
laying similar to waterwork system to draw water directly
from the weir to every household would satisfy the people.
The  amount  of  budget  assessed  for  the  above-mentioned
program will be about three million Baht.
Tourism Promotion
It can be expected that the technology of the Project which
will occur on the top of Khao Khuan Lan Mountain and other
Project areas of significant natural aesthetic values will
attract a number of visitors.   From a certain  location  of
the Project area tourists will be able to view nearly all
the Project's area as well as the beautiful cenery of Lam
Ta Khong  reservoir.   In addition, when more  tourism   and
recreation activities are established more service jobs  can
be created as a result. This means there will be a good
chance for the provincial economic growth. Results from the
study   reveal  a  lot   of   population-suggested   tourism
activities, for example, construction of a road around the
upper reservoir for visitors, a campinq ground, souvenir
shops, flower  gardens,  forest  growing.   Cruising  boats,
water sports, and fishing sports are also suggested  ln  Lam
Ta Rhong reservoir.
The  objectives  of  this  recommendation  is  to  plan  the
improvement and development of the Project area so as to
create good surrounding and aesthetic values, which  will  ln
turn efficiently support tourism activities. Achievement of
the stated objectives is recommended through the following
steps:
7-29



1) Determine the princlple concept for the develop-
ment of the selected Project site, or determine
the tourism-enhancing development. This can be
achieved  by  maintaining  and   improving   the
existing aesthetic values and the ones to be
created,  both  natural  and  man-made   values.
Tourism and recreation should be emphasized in
the plan.
2) Determine the' pattern and  details of  buildings
and surrouxading characteristics of each area In
order to control the quality and beauty to con-
form with human utilization.  This can include a
good scenic area for recreation and tourism
purposes, a reception building for tourists,
commercial  sites,   accommodation   places   or
camping grounds, which will not lessen the
aesthetic values.
