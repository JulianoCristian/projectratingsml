MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE ELECTRICITY GENERAT'ING AUTHORITY OF THAILAND
FOR A LAM TAKHIGNG PUMP STORAGE PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) with the guarantee of the Kingdom of Thailand
for the equivalent of US$100 million to help finance a project for the generation of peaking power using a
pump storage scheme. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 17
years, including 5 years of grace. The project would be cofinanced by a loan from the Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund of Japan (OECF) for the equivalent of US$184 million, with a maturity of 25 years,
including 5 years of grace and an interest of 3.0% p.a..
Background
2.         Thailand experienced an ec'nomic boom in the late eighties when GDP and power demand
registered growths of 12% and 14% p. a., respectively. During the early nineties, GDP growth moderated to
8% p.a. while power demand increased at 11% p.a. With robust medium term growth outlook, power
demand is forecast to increase at 9.5% p.a. during 1993-98. The ongoing demand-side management (DSM)
program is expected to save about 300 MW  over the next 5 years, about 2% of the demand in 1998.
Thailand would have to add over 1,000 MW of aew generating capacity every year over the next decade.
With Government's approval and support, EGAT has embarked on a major program of investments averaging
US$2 billion p.a. during 1993-98.
3.         Thailand's domestic resources for power generation are lirnited. Natural gas, environmentally
the most benign fuel, is fu!ly committed, lignite poses serious envirorunental problems needing costly flue gas
desulfurisers, while hydropower development invites strong protests from opponents of dams. Thailand would
thus need to rely heavily on imported energy for power generation, and for this it has several options,
including piped natural gas from Malaysia and Myanmar, LNG from the international market, coal from the
Pacific rim countries and hydro power from Laos. The Bank's 1993 Fuel Option Study (Report No 11948-
TH) analyzes these prospects in depth, and in the course of the project the Bank expects to assist the
Government in firming up its fuel choices.
4.         Over the last decade, the Govermnent has looked to privatization as a means of reducing public
sector borrowing and increasing enterprise efficiency. It has reduced the number of state enterprises from
about 100 to 63, and has made a concerted effort to involve the private sector in state enterprises through the
partial sale of shares, private participation in the enterprises, contracting out of services, and joint ventures.
The Bank's operational involvement in the Thai power sector has facilitated continuing inputs to its
privatization process. Under Bank advice, and as a first step towards commercialization, an organizational
efficiency study of EGAT was conducted by consultants. The EGAT orgunization is currently being
restructured in line with the study's recommendations. In September 1992, the Goverrnent approved a plan
for deregulation, restructuring, and privatization of the power subsector. At the center of the structure would
be a corporatized EGAT which, while continuing to be a major power producer, would purchase electricity
from independent power producers (IPPs) and neighboring countries, and transmit and sell it to the
Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA), the Provincial Power Authority (PEA) and major industrial users.
The regulator of the subsector would be the National Energy Policy Office (NEPO).



-2-
5.         Tlhe cconceptual framework of the Govcrnment policy and the steps of its privatizationl master
plan are: Step-_  (a) Subject to meeting criteria for a "Good State Enterprise" including ability to remit 30% of
its net income to the Government (the corporate tax rate). EGAT would be substantially deregulated; (h) 51 %,
of the stock of the Electricity Generating Company (EGCO), an EGAT subsidiary created in 1992. wouid he
sold to the public; (c) EGCO would buy over about 2.000 MW of EGAT's power plants; Sten-2 (a) EGAT
would solicit Build. Own, Operate (BOO) proposals for new generating plants from IPE's and EGCOt; (b)
EGAT would restructure its organization into business units and spin off some of its operations into
subsidiaries ; (c) Preparation towards the corporatization of the distribution agencies, the Metropolilan
Electricity Authority (MEA) and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) would follow and PEA would be
progressively regionalized; Step-3 (a) EGAT would be corporatized: (b) MEA and PEA would also he
corporatized subject to passage of legislation to allow this; and Step-4 (a) EGAT stock would he sold to the
public, with Government retaining majority holding; (b) PEA would be split up into regional companies in
preparation for privatization. The plan is expected to be completed by 1997/98. EGCO was listed on the
stock exchange in January 1995. EGAT is expected to achieve "Good State Enterprise" status by June 1995.
It has already signed contracts with 20 small IPPs for an aggregate capacity of 210 MW. finalized
comprehensive documents for contracting 3.800 MW of capacity over 1995-2003 and expects to receive IPP
proposals for the first 1,000 MW by June 1995. It is expected that the proposed framework would attract
IPPs, as evidenced by the interest shown by dozens of IPPs at a recent seminar conducted by EGAT and the
Government. The Government has already undertaken a road show for soliciting private power finance.
6.         The privatization framework and implementation steps that the Government has proposed for the
power sector are well planned and well tailored to the circumstances in Thailand. Privatization is now on a
steady path and its pace is being accelerated. The Government has deftly resolved serious opposition from the
unions to corporatization of the power sector entities. The Government has shown keen interest in associating
the Bank in its privatization efforts across the board by: (a) requesting the Bank to undertake a comprehensive
revi.w of privatization of its state enterprises (Bank's Report No. 1312-TH, 'Increasing Private Participation
and Improving Efficiency in State Enterprises"); and (b) conducting seminars to discuss privatization issues
between highest levels in the Bank and the Government, including the Prime Minister. In regard to the power
sector, the Bank has recommended several measures to enhance competition, notably: in the near term: (a)
EGCO to be fully divested and its management made independent of EGAT; and (b) the pace of introducing
IPPs to be accelerated; in the lonzer term: (a) EGAT to be divested into a number of generation companies,
with EGAT becoming a transmission and power pool company; and (b) distribution companies and large
industrial consumers to be allowed to purchase directly from any power producer. The Government is
receptive to the Bank's suggestions and would solicit Bank's assistance in working out details as the
privatization program proceeds.
7.         The current bulk supply arrangements between EGAT and MEA/PEA would no longer be
appropriate when the electricity sector is restructured; EGAT, MEA and PEA are corporatized; and IPPs
begin to function on the grid. AP important prerequisite to the power sector restructuring and privatization is
the rationalization of bulk supply tariff, which would be addressed under the proposed project.
8.         While pursuing a large power development program, the Government has planned a thrust
towards energy conservation. Its DSM program, supported by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) under
the Bank's Distribution System and Energy Efficiency Project (Loan 3598-TH), has a four-pronged approach:
(a) provision of user and manufacturer incentives and consumer education to direct practices and attitudes
toward energy efficient technologies; (b) development of efficiency standards and testing capabilities to
exercise control and monitor efficiency improvements; (c) development and promulgation of building and



-3-
appliance codes to allow for the enforcement of minimum standards; and (d) continued pursuit of techlnological
improvements and adaptation to Thai conditions. The project is progressing satisfactorily.
9.         In the last few years, the Government has placed a strong emphasis on environmentally sound
and sustainable development. Its 1992 Energy Conservation Promotion Act, created an Energy Conservation
Fund. financed by surcharges on petroleum products and electricity. The Act provides for a rigorous
enforcement of energy conservation in factories and buildings. The Environmental Quality Act of 1992: (a)
substantially reorganized the environmental bureaucracy making it more responsive to environmental
protection; (b) established a Central Envirommental Fund for concessional financing of environmental projects
by the private and public sectors; and (c) recognized for the first time the importance of involving Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in development.
10.        Gaining from its experience under the Bank's Third Power System Development Project (Loan
3423-TH). the Govemment has increasingly emphasized involvement of affected people and selected NGOs in
environmentally sensitive projects and formalized this in the evaluation of Environmental Impact Assessments
(EIAs). In regard to atmospheric emissions from power plants, the Government has decided to fit (and
retrofit as appropriate) flue gas desulfurizers on lignite-fired thermal power units and use low sulfur oil
(costing 20% more) in oil fired thermal power units. It has also introduced stringent short-term SO2 ambient
standards to safeguard the health of the people, especially irf the vicinity of the Mae Moh mining-power
complex.
Project Objectives
i1.        The main objectives of the proposed project are: (a) to assist EGAT in optimizing its investment
decisions and help meet the system's peak power demand from 2000 onwards at least cost; (b) to strengthen
the environmental capabilities of EGAT; and (c) to assist the Government in rationalizing the bulk supply
tariff to PEA and MEA as a prelude to the corporatization and privatization of the generation, transmission
and distribution utilities. In addition, the Bank expects, during the project's tenure, to continue rendering
techinical advice to the Government in the implementation of power sub-sector and environmental reforms.
ProjecL Description
12.        The proposed_project is the first stage (2x250 MW) of the 1,000 MW Lam Takhong Pump
Storage Scheme. The scheme involves: (a) pumping during off-peak hours of about 9 million cubic meters
(MCM) of water from the existing Lam Takhong reservoir to a new upper level reservoir; and (b) releasing
water into the Lam Takhong reservoir generating about 1,000 MW of power during the system peak period.
The project involves: (a) an upstream reservoir of 10 MCM4 capacity; (b) water conduit systems comprising
tunnels and penstocks for the full development; (c) an underground power house for all the four units; (d)
2x250 MW reversible pump-turbine units; (e) an outdoor switchyard; (f) 2x230 kV double-circuit transmission
lines of about 15 km route length; (g) consulting services for design and construction supervision; (h)
environmental impact mitigation and rehabilitation of affected persons; (i) computer hardware, software and
training for strengthening the environmental capabilities of EGAT; and () a consulting study for
rationalization of the bulk supply tariff. Under component (i), EGAT would undertake the development of an
Integrated Environmental Information Management System, the objective of which would be to accept,
manage, analyze and structure different sources and types of information required for environmental
management and monitoring.



-4-
13.        The Lain Takhong reservoir is an existing reservoir on the Lam Takhong River. an upstreami
tributary of the Mun River. The Mun River is a tributary of the Mekong River, an international watcrway.
The project involves pumping in and out only about 3% of the reservoir volume and creates no net deprivation
oF water. Thle project's impac; on the flow of water in thc Lam Takhong River is insigniiicant and the impact
on the flow of the Mun and the Mekong rivers even less so.
14.        The downstream  riparian states are Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam.  Togetlher with
Thailand, these countries are members of the Mekong Committee, established in 1957 by them as an
autonomous inter-governmental agency to promote, coordinate, supervise and control the planning.
investigation and implementation of water resources development projects on the lower Mekong basin
(including international projects on the Mekong River as well as national projects on tributaries). The
Mekong Committee was suspended in 1991 and has apparently not functioned since that date. However,
recently, representatives of Thailand, Viet Narn, Cambodia and Lao PDR have pledged to establish a new
framework of cooperation for the sustainable development of the Mekong River Basin. As far as the Bank has
been able to ascertain, that framework has not yet been formally established. The Lhree downstream riparian
states (Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam) were notified on December 15, 1994 of the project by the Bank.
through their Executive Directors and were given until February 28, 1995 to respond. No communication
was received From Lao PDR and Cambodia by the stipulated time. Viet Nam asked for more information for
studying the project and wanted to be assured that Thailand would notify this project to the newly constituted
Mekong Committee at its first meeting in April 1995. Full details of the project were provided by the Bank
to the Vietnamese on March 14, 1995 together with written assurances from EGAT that Thailand would
indeed notify the project to the Mekong Committee. No further comnunication was received from Viet Nam
by the subsequently established stipulated date of April 3, 1995. As none of the downstream riparians have
raised objections to the project and in view of the Bank's staff assessment that the project will neither cause
harm to the interests of the other riparians, nor be harmcd by other riparians' possible water use, it was
decided to proceed with the processing of the project.
15.        Total financing required for the project is US$585.6 million equivalent (including IDC), with a
foreign exchange cost of US$308.4 million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. The proposed loan would finance about 33% of the project's foreign exchange cost. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
Retroactive financing equivalent to about 3% of the proposed loan would be permitted to the extent of
US$250,000 equivalent for payments made for expenditures on consulting services for the Tariff Study, prior
to the date of the Project Agreement but after August 4, 1994. A timetable of key processing events and
status of Bank Group operations in Thailand are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 13108-TH, dated April 5, 1995 is being distributed separately.
Project Implementation
16.        EGAT would be the implementing agency for the project. It would prepare he civil designs,
drawings and technical specifications under the supervision of the consultants, while the consultants would
develop the technical specifications for the mechanical and electrical equipment and would be fully involved in
construction supervision. A project team has been set up and a project manager has been appointed for
project construction. A Project Implemen.'ation Plan, following the Bank guidelines, has been prepared and is
satisfactory.
17.        An International Board of Experts has been appointed to review dam safety aspects relating to
design and construction of the upper reservoir, and to advise on design and construction aspects of all other



-5-
elemenits of' tlie project.  lthe Bank has appointed an internationally recognized Etivironinental Fxpert to
review and advise on thle environmental and social aspects of [he project. The bid documents ior thc main
eletroiueclhaniical equipmiienit, thouglh not financed by the Bank, would he subject to review by the Bank.
I1roJ ecl Sustainability
18.         I'lhe techlniologies for puump-turbine systems and the associated civil works are well proven. The
river hydrology has been adequately studied and geological conditions are favorable. The project's physical
sustainabilitv is thus assured.  Thc project has substanitial economic benefits over the next best alternative of
intcrnal combustion turbines. EGAT is a technically advanced utility which will operate andn maintain (tie
pr(oject in a sound manner. EGAT's financial performance is robust and Government's policies for the sector
are conmlucive to the project's financial sustainability.
Lessonts from Previous Bank Iivolvement
19.         Three main lessons have been learnt from the Bank's previous and ongoing projects with EGAT.
First: the need for thorough investigations of geological conditions and provision of adequate contingencies for
civil works for hydro projects; Second: the need for involvement of: (a) relevant people and agencies in
project design; (b) at'fected people in designing the compensation scheme; (c) external experts in reviewing
project ElAs; and (d) al'fected persons in oversight committees; and Third: the need for providing adequate
reserves in cost estimates for environmental impact mitigation and compensation. These lessons have been
f'ully applied in the design of the proposed project. In particular, extensive field testing has been undertaker. to
establish the soundness of the site's geological conditions.
Rationale ror Bank Involvement
20.         Througlh sustained involvement over a number of years, the Bank has contributcd significantly to
the development of the Thai energy sector. With a modest level of lerudiiig, the Bank has been able to
exercise significant policy leverage. Bank advice and assistance have helped the Goverrnent effectively
address the issues of: (a) lcast-cost investment planning, particularly with regard to fuel choices; (b) supply-
and demand- side management and resource pricing; (c) power sector restructuring and privatization; (d)
environmental reforms: and (e) participatory development. However, further work remains to be done in
actual implementation ot the proposed sector strategies. The project is expected to make a significant
contribution in reformning the tariff structure and strengthening the environmental capabilities of the power
sector's dominant entity. In its formulatiorn itself, the project has provided an opportunity for putting into
practice the policy for involvement of affected persons in rehabilitation/compensation and the Bank expects to
supervise this process closely during implementation. In addition to its inputs through specific sector work,
the Bank's continuing operational involvement in the Thai power sector is essential to exercise significant
influence on Government policies towards e. olution of the sector in an economically efficient, financially
sound and environmentally sustainable manner, and for its orderly progress towards reform, restructuring and
privatization.
21.         The policies and programs pursued by the Government in the power sector are in compliance
with the Bank's policies and guidelines. The project is also consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS, Report No. 13458-TH). As discussed in the CAS, which wps presented to the Board on
September 22, 1994, Bank's support to Thailand aims at providing value added in terms of helping Thailand
address the most important long-term development issues. Among the priority areas for Bank assistance
identified in the CAS are development of the physical infrastructure and improvement in environmental



-6-
management to whicli this project would contribute. Rationalization of the bulk supply tariff would facilitate
powcr sector restructuring and privatization. Slrcngthening EGAT's cnvironmncntal capabilities and imiprovinig
the process ol consultation with aflccted communities would upgrade the framework for coyvironnental
managcimient.
Agreed Actions
22.        During negotiations, agreement was reached with EGAT and the Government on the following:
(a)  an annual revicwv and update of EGAT's power development plan and exchange of views witl
the Bank;
(h)  implementation of the environmental impact mitigation plans and rehabilitation/compensation
plans as detailed in documents agreed with the Bank;
(c)  rationalization (and subsequent imolementation) of bulk supply tariff including conducting of
associated consulting study according to terms of reference agreed with the Bank;
(d)  a continuation of a previous financial covenant specifying that EGAT will earn a self-financing
ratio of not less than 25%, based on a three-year average of capital expenditures; and
(g)  a debt-to-equity ratio not exceeding 60:40 and a ratio of short and medium-term debt to total
debt not exceeding 15% for EGAT.
Environmental Aspects
23.        The project falls under Category A and its environmental impacts have been adequately identified
through a detailed EIA undertaken by the Khon Kaen University. The project doEs not pose any impacts of a
nature that cannot be eliminated, minimized to acceptable levels or mitigated through project design, location
and operation and it is unlikely to result in significant residual impacts. The mitigation measures for
environmental impacts are embodied in the Environmental Mitigation and Development Plan which includes a
plan for environmental mitigation and development during and aftei construction and a plan for monitoring
and evaluating forest rehabilitation, aquatic biology and fishery in the reservoir, and water resources
management. The project does not involve resettlement of any families. However, about 72 families residing
in nearby villages, and who currently cultivate some crops in the area that will be flooded by the upper
reservoir, will lose this means of livelihood and will need to be suitably compensated and rehabilitated in
accordance with a detailed rehabilitation policy framed by EGAT specifically for the project.
24.        The EIA and the supplementary documentation developed by EGAT has undergone the newly
constituted review process involving the Office of Environmental Policy and Planning (OEPP) (including
review by an Environmental Expert Committee having NGO representation) and the National Environmental
Board, and the project and the EIA have been approved by the National Economic and Social Development
Board and de facto by the Cabinet. The people in the district have been informed about the project through
seminars and the affected villagers have been fully involved in designing the August 1994 adderdum to the
Implementation Plan, Enviromnental Mitigation and Development. This plan, which was finalized and
published by OEPP, inter-alia calls for the appointment of a coordinating and supervisory committee named
the Committee for the Coordination of Assistance to the Affected People and Environmental Development,
comnrising representatives from  all concerned departments and agencies, from  local and provincial

Benefits and Risks
25.         In supporting the timely development of the power sub-sector, the loan to EGAT' would help
sustain Thailand's econiomic growth. The pump storage schieme would not only provide the much needed
peaking power tor the Thai grid at least cost, but would considerably improve the system's dynamilic
performance enabling it to meet rapidly chaniging loads, while optimizing output from its generators. The
project faces risks generally associated with any hydro project - cost and scheduic overruns due to geological
and hydrological uncertainties, and contractor and construction supervision inadequacies. Geological risk is
small due to the uniform nature of the site geology and has been further lessened by very comprehensive site
testing and investigations. Hydrological uncertainties are low; the river hydrology is well established and the
project actually consumes no water.  Flood risk is low since the small amount of work needed in the
river/reservoir would be carried out in the dry season, and sudden rises in the reservoir water level could be
prevented by operation of the outlet works. Care has been taken in the prequalification process to ensure a
fully qualified contractor and the full involvement of experienced international consultants in construction
supervision would reduce the project management risks to a minimum.  Finally. EGAT's excellent track
record in overall management of hydro projects and its state of preparedness gives a substantial degree of
assurance for timely completion of the project and achievement of development objectives.
Recommendation
26.         1 am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank
and recommend that the Executive Directors Vpprove it.
