Nakhon Ratchasima urban area and\n            districts in the vicity.  The assessment study was conducted\n            on the four major environmental resources and values as\n            stipulated by the National Environmental Board (NEB),\n            namely: 1) physical resources; 2) ecological resources; 3)\n            human use values; and 4) quality of life values.  The study\n            covered all of the above areas according to their direct and\n            indirect environmental relationships with the project.  In\n            addition, environmental economics were analyzed."}, "docdt": "1992-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
