Economic Development
Upon The Office of the Prime Ministets remission of the implementtion plan for the
environmntal mitgation and development of LamTa Khong Pumped Storage Project together wit the
recent Project cost 'fom the electricity prouction plan of EGAT (1992-2006), the Board of the
National Social and Economic Development has smtdied the appropriateness of the Project on
December 20, 1993. and has arrived at the following opinions:
1. EGAT should curry out Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project which has a capacity of
1.000 Megawat on a total investnent cost of about 21.800 million Bahlt divided into foreign currency
of 10.915 million Baht and TMai currency of 10,885 million Baht. The Ministy of Fiance will be
responsible for the foreign currncy. As for the Thai currency, the amount could be allocated from
EGATs revenue or from local loans.
2. A coordinating and supevisory committee should be appoined which would comprse
representtives from related units, firm local units, and from local -people's orgamizaions. The
committee will coordinate work, solve the arising problms, follow up the progress. and proclaim the
work results. As such. public proclamations and resetlement of the people should be placed as the
most important elements.
3. The Mis  of Sciene, Technology, and Environment should monitor the inplementation
plan on the enviromnental mitigation and development, and should coordinate with relevant agencies in
the evaluation processes so as to report to tie National Environent Board and the Board of the

to be completed by Febmary 2002.
2.4 Investment Cost: Total of 21,800 million Baht dividing into foreign currency 10.915
million Baht and Thai Baht currencv of 10.885 million BahL The foreign currency will be
obtained from foreign loan. The domestic currency will be provided from EGATs income
and/or domestc loan.
2.5 Project Benefit: The Project benefit is esimated at 46.97%
3. Project Analysis by the Office
3.1 Overview of EGAT's Electric Power System
(1) The EGATs geneating network consists of 132 power plants widh total capacity of 12,178
Mewatw. This can be classified as thermal power plants of 50.1%. combined thermal plants
of 28.1%. hydro-electic plants of 19.9%, gas murbine of 1.8%, and others of 0.1%; and 163
sub-stations totaling of 26;375.95 MVA and transmission system totaling of 20.696.885
circuit-km.
(2) At present. the power plants geneate at 62-290.67 million units, consisting of power genemed
in the country of 99.3', and imported (frm Loa PDR and Malaysia) of 0.7%/
(3) Problems in production that EGAT is facing arc: fiil to regulate volage, power going offE lack
of reliability of supply, incrase in power demand in the county, and demiand for invesunent
fund.
3.2 Agreement to the National Economic Development Plan No. 7.
The project agrees with the national economic development plan for it will help maintain the
stabic growth of economic by developing power supply sources to meet the nationes power
demand. In additimo, the project will reduce the proportion of power that is drawn from
outside the county, and will result in proper distnbution of types of energy used in the
county. Furthermore, the project will provide low cost energy for the peak demanding period
that wiU result in more economic opeation of the whole systm.
3.3 Urgent Need of the Project
The projec needs to -be implemented immediately because the growth in power demand. As
fore d by the Power Demand Forecasting Committee, the demand will increase from a
peak of 9,978 Megawatt and total of 62,797 million units in the year 1993 to a peak of 16,446



Megawan and total of 106.891 million units in year 1999; and the peak demand will be 20.237
Megawatt with a total of 132,330 million units in the year 2002.
The Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project that is one of the projects in the
Electricity Development Plan (1992-2006) will help supplying the demand at peak load. For
its lower generating cost in comparison to other sources, the project implementation will help
maintaining the power system reserved capacity in the designed figure. and will make the
system more stable. If EGAT can implement the project as planned, the generation capacity
will increase from 12,173 Megawatt in the year 1993 to 20,553 Megawart in year 1999. and to
25,639 Megawatt in year 2002. The reserved capacity will be 15.3% and 22.4% in vear 1999
and year 2002 respectively.
3.4 Technical Feasibility
(1) The Lam Ta Khong lower reservoir constructed by the Royal ITrigation Departnent (RID)
in 1969 has maximum storage capacitv of; 10 million cubic meters with available storage
of 290 million cubic meters From the pass 30-year record, the avenge yearly inflow was
245 million cubic meters. The yearly water demand at present is 230 million cubic
meters: dividg into domestic and industrial demand for Nakhoa Ratchasima area of
23 1%, and for irigation demand of 72.9%
(2) lThe pumped stoage technique to be used for electricity generation will cause no effect to
the existing water demand. ie., irrigaton and water supply, because the water is
adequately available. The water being pumped to the upper reservoir will be released
back to the lower reservoir for electricity generation. Thus, there will be no loss of water
in the operation. For these reasons, the project is proved to be not only feasible in
electricity generation technique but also feasible in making efficient use of the water
resource.
3.5 Investment FeasibiliW
From the invesument analysis that has taken into consideration the need for power generating at
peak loading period, this project is proved to be economically feasible. This is because the
compaison between the project and other peak-load plan, i.e., gas turbine, showed that for a
45-year project life it will retum benefit at 46&97% based on diesel fuel calculation, and at
39.52%Je based on nanural gas calculationL
However, if the cost of natural gas changes accordig to the price change in the world
market, the project investment feasibility will be affected. EGAT has also cried out
sensitivity analysis for the cases that the prices of nanural gas decrease 10%O to 20@% and
increase 10%o to 20%. The analysis results show that the project benefit for every case will
still be considerably high.

3.6 Financial Status of EGAT
The assessment of fiancial stams of EGAT as of September 30,1993 was made under the
following assumptions:
* Power demand as forecasted by the Sub-committee for Power Demand Forecasting in June
1993 and the EGATs Electricity Developnent Plan (B.E. 2535-2549), reviewed on
October 5.1993
* Prices of power for both selling and buying are based on the new price stucmrte
* Income paid to the government at 30h>C of net profit
* Investment from EGATs income at 25% of the total investent cost
The fnancial assessment is shown follows:
Fiscal Year (BE.)                2536   2537   2538   2539   2540   2541   2542
Net benefit (million Baht)      7,351  8,915 14,473 10,490 23,602 25,090 33,466
Cashremainingartheendofperiod   1,500  1,500  1,500  1,500  2,246  1,500  1.500

Debt/equity ratio                0.79   0.87   0.97   1.02   0.98   1.02   0.83
Debtservicecoverageratio         1;0    A48   1.71   1.23   1.40   1.35   1.34
From the above estmation, it can be said that EGArs financial status during the year
1993 to 1999 is in the level that can afford the proposed invement plan. The reason is that
EGATs rend of net profit is considerably high at 17.626 million Baht annually. The major
fnancial ratios (e.g. the ratio of revenue to income, the debt to equity ratio) are within the
established ranges. Despite the debt service coverage is lower than the smndard, this will not
affect the loan because the fignue is only rittle below the established standard.



Ratio                        Average            Standard
* Debt smvice coverage         1.40          not less than 1.50
* debt to equity               0.92          not less an 1.50
3.7 Project Feasibility with Respected to Environmental Impact Assessment
EGAT has carried out the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study and submitted the
reports to the Office of the Environmental Policy and Plan (OEPP) as required by the
Enhancement and Conservation of National Envirownental Quality Act (B.E. 2535). The
study reports including the environmental mitigation plan were acknowledged by OEPP on
November 1.1992. The major issues of consideration are as follows:
(1) Environmental Impact
The Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project impacts on enviromnent are:
(1.1) Terrestrial Ecology. Th ee areas will be affectedc (I) the upper reservoir area, (2)
the soil disposal area, and (3) the road construction area The major impact are:
soil erosion and disurbance of wildlife habitat that are not rare or endangered
species
(1.2) Aquatic Ecology. Two areas are affected by the Project. the upper reservoir. and
the Lam Ta Khong reservoir. The major impact during construction is the
degradaton of water quality due to increase of trbidity. During operation period.
the operation will cause daily fluctuation of the water level in the Lam Ta Khong
reservoir, and some aquatic lives may enter the tunnel during pumnping operation.
(1.3) Socio-economics. The 74 plots of agricultural land in the project area that are
occupied by 45 household. will be affected. However, during construction period
the project will enhance income and money circulation to the local people.
Furthcrmore, local road condtiron will be improved.
(1.4) Water Supply. The use of water for the pumped storage operation may cause
restriction of water availability for irrigation, public water supply, and domestic
consumption in dry period when the rservoir storage is less than 30 million cubic
meterS.
(2) Environmental Mitigation and Development Plan
OEPP. EGAT, and related agencies have jointly prepared the implemenaion plan for
mitigatng the environmental impact from the Lmn Ta Khong Pmnped Storage
Project This plan seves as a frame work for the environmental mitigation
implementation so as to minimize the impact. The plan is divided intO 4 phases as:
before constuction, during constuction, after constuction, and monitoring and



evaluation ihat consists 15 work plans, i.e., public reladon, compensation, life quality
development, agriculture cooperation establishment, occupation development.
pollution prevention and safety during consmuction, environmenLtal rehabilitation,
fishery resource conservation, water management, monitoring and evaluation. etc.
The estimated total budget for implementaion is 219.15 million Baht.
4. Resolution of the National Economic and Social Development
Board.
1. The board ageed that EGAT proceed on the Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project at
generating capacity of 1,00 Megawatt with a total estimated investment of 21,800 million Baht being
divided intD foreign currecies of 10,915 million Bait and a counter part fund in Thai Baht currency of
10,835 million BahL The Ministry of Finance is responsible for seeking the sources of foreign find.
The Thai Bat counter pan fun is to be provided from EGArs income and/or from domestic loans.
2. A working committee should be appointed for coordinating and advising the project
implementation. The committee should include the conceming governmental agencies, representatives
from local government. and representatives from local people's organization. The responsibility of this
committee is to provide coordination, to solve problems. to monitor project progress, and to inforn the
pubiic about the project Special emphasis should be placed on public relation, land compensation
and/or resettlement so that the project will be accepted from all concerns.
3. The Ministry of Science, Technology, and Enviroment should be responsible for monitoring
the environmental mitigation and development implementations in accordance wit the proposed plan.
The ministry should also serve as coordinatg agency for evahlation and report to NEB and NESDB at
various implementation stages.



IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
Environmental Mitigation and Development
LAM TA KHONG PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT
Office of the Environmental Policy and Plan
Janu  1994



EXECUTIVE SUNMARY
The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) has
developed a Project for effectively use of the water in Lam Ta Khong
reservoir for the benefit of the country, especially the Nqrtheast. The
Project's concept is to use the excess electric power during low-
demanding period of the day for pumping the water from the existing
Lam Ta Khong reservoir to a relatively small reservoir that is proposed to
be constructed on the mountain. The stored water on the mountain will be
used for generating electric power during high-demanding period of the
day by releasing it down trough electric generating turbines. EGAT has
carefully carried out studies on environment, engineering, and economic
of the project and has provided chances for the public to participate
through the process of the Project development.
EGAT has prepared this implementation plan for environmental
mitigation and development with the objective to maximize the project
benefit to the country as well as to  inime  adverse environmental
impacts, and to rehabilitate and develop the environmental condition in
the Project area and the vicinities. This implementation plan developed
on the basis of the recommendation obtained from the Environmental
Impact Assessment study and the recommendation obtained from the
Environmental Expert Committee of the Office of the Environmental
Policy and Plan (OEPP). The plan is developed for environmental
mitigation and development before the Project construction, during
construction,and after construction, including the monitoring and
evaluation. This plan consists of 4 major plans that comprise 15 minor
plans at a total budget of 219.15 million Bahts. This amount is included
in the Project investment budget that has been proposed to the
government on October 13, 1993.
OEPP has organized a meeting among the concerning agencies on
November 1,1993 to conclude the Project implementation and required
budget (detailed in Appendix A).
The summary of environmental mitigation and development plan
for the Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project as acknowledged by
OEPP is shown in the attached Table.
In evaluating the implementation results, EGAT will submit the
environmental reports to OEPP; and the budget reports to Office of the
National Economic and Social Development.

Implementation Plan for Environmental Mitigation and Development
LA.M TA KHONG PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT
Part 1: INTRODUCTION
1.1 BACKGROUND
The Enviromnenmal IMpact Assessment Study of Lam Ta Khong Pumped Stoage Project is an
activity under the responsibility of the Electriciry Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) that aims
at developing source for electric power generation to serve the increasing power demand of the nation
along with the rehabilitating and developing of the enviromnent
The major components ofthe Project include an upper reservoir, an underground power house,
tunnels. a switchyard and tansmission lines. The exising Lam Ta Khong reservoir that is under the
responsibility of the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) will be used as the lower reservoir. An upper
reservoir will be constructed on top of a mountain so that water from the lower reservoir can be pumped
up and stred in the upper reservoir. The stored water will be released with pressure to generate power
during the peak demanding period.
The Project will inevitably involve certain environmental aspects. namely the requirement of
an area for the constmction site and the use of the existing Lam Ta Khong reservoir as the lower
reservoir. These two points can possiblv cause impacts on the environmenal resources and values.
This is particularly true with the construction site that covers an area of three sq kan being located in the
area categorized under the watershed classification lB. A detailed environmental impact study must be
carried out in order that the Project can be taken under the consideration of the National Environment
Board (NEE).
Khon Kaen Universitv (KKU) was assigned the task to carrv out this enviromnental impact
study during an 18-month period from August 1990 to Febmary 1992. On the basis of the study result.
EGAT in corporation with KKtI has developed the environmenta mitigation plan in addition to the
main Project plan by taking into consideration the comments and suggestion obtained from the
environmental expert committee of the Office of the Enviromental Policy and Plan (Appendix B).
1.2 PROJECT smn rND osacivEs
Lam Ta Klhong Pumped Storagc Project is a hydro-vlectric power project situated at the border
line between Si Khiu and Pak Chong districts, Nakhon Ratchasina. The distances from Muang
Saraburi District and Muang Naklhon Ratchasina District are 82 kan and 70 km respectively.

The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) was supported by Japan Intemational
Coopemtion Agency (JICA) to conduct the feasibility study of the Project This study was conducted
on the primary appropriateness in terms of engineering, economics, and environmental and was
completed in 1991. The operation of the Project will comprise two phases: the first is the installation of
two 250 Megawatt generators, totaling a capacity of 500 Mepwatt and the second phase is the
installation of other 500 Megawatt generators. Thus. the total capacity will be 1,000 Megawatt
The objective of Lamn Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project is to generate electricity as a
supplement for the generation during peak period of demand. This will reduce the investment cost for
the increase of generation capacity because the cost per unit of production of this system is relatively
low.
1.3 PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS
The Lam Ta [(hong Pumped Storge Project consisms of constructions of a reservoir on a
mountain     undergound power house, underground tunnels, switchyard. and transmission lines
joining the project with the existing systm. Brief charactermstics of each of the Project components are
as follows:
Upper Reservoir. 'The reservoir is of rock-filled type wit an asphalt facing to prevent water
from seeping out. The dam crest height of the reservoir is 60 m. The volume of rocks used in
consnctig the basin is 6.2 mil cu m the reservoir can store water up to the height of 660 m (MSL) and
the volume of 103 mlU cu m, with the water sfe  area of 0.34 sq km.
Underground Powerhoue The underground powerhouse is 300 m below the ground surface
with a widt of 22 m a length of 117 m anda height of 45.7 m. The genear  will be insaled intwo
phases.
Phase 1: 2 x 250 Megawart
Phase 2: 2 x 250 Megawatt
Penstocks. The pen stock joins the upper reservoir with the undergrotmd powerhouse with an
inner diameter of 5.8-2.6 m and a length of 690 m.
TaOirace Tunnels. The water tnmnel joins the underground powerhouse and Lam Ta KLong
reservoir. It has an inner diameter of 4.9-6.6 m and a length of 1,470 rn.
Transmission Lins  During the fist phase, transmission line's capacity of 230 KV for 4
circuits is used to connect with the existing 230 KV lines from Saraburi sub-station 2 and Nakhon
Ratchasima sub-station 2 with a connected disance of 7.5 km. As forthe second phase, double-circuit
230 KV lines are used to connect with Tha Lan substtion 3 for a distce of 95 kmn.
Switchyard and Control Buildings. The area of the switchyard and the control building is 40
m wide and ll0 m long. Gas Insulned Switchyard (GIS) wil be used.

1.4 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY
The EIA shties and development of environmental mitigation covered 4 groups of important
issues according to environmental resources and values. TIbe are:
Physical resources consist of 7 topics conceming water, air, and land
Ecological resources consist of 4 topics concerning biological resources of aquatic and
terresial pes.
Human Use Values consist of 12 topics concerning water resource management. laud use.
agriculture, transportation, electrical energy, and recraion.
Quality of Life Values consist of 5 topics conerning socio-economics, culture, and aesthetics
In addition, the environental ecnomic anlysis of the project was also sudied.
In the final stage of the studies, the impacts and the development potentials were ntegatedly
analyzed. Important issues were brought into considerations in the planning for mitigating the impacts
and developing the enviromentaL



Part 2: ENVIRONMENTAL MIPACT AND
GUIDELINES FOR MITIGATION AND
DEVELOPMENT
The evaluation of environmenal impacts in this chapter presents an overview of the impacs
that comes from considering all of the results of related studies. The impacts are considered according
to an ecological analysis that divides the ecological system into three parts: land, water, and socio-
economics. Each part will discuss the activities that cause the impacts and the impacts themselves.
There will be quantitative and qualitative evaluation in relation to the two periods of the Project that are
the construction and operation periods. Moreover, guidelines and measures to be taken will be
suggested in order to mitigate the impacts. There will also be plans for maonitoring of the environment
of the Project area to estimate long-term impacts that tie Project may impose on the environment.
2.1 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
2.1.1 Land
Concerned Areas
The areas that will be affected by the Project construction consist of:
1. Area in Khao Tian - Khao Khuan Lun forest that will be used for constuction of the upper
reservoir, swirchyard, and naer tnnels
2. Areas that will be used for soil disposal locatd to The east and soth of the upper resrvoir and
along the edge of the Lam Ta Khong resenroir
3. Areas that will be used for road constucion and the vicinity.
Impacts During the Project Construction Period
Impact causing activties-:
1. Construction of the upper reservoir. The construction area is situatd in the watershed
classification area lB. This is in avoidance of the watershed area IA the use of which is strictly
forbidden by the resolution of the cabinet
2. Consrction of the water tunnehs. It is determined that the kngth of the tumnel will be the
shortest and avoid any distrbance to the IA area by excavating under the area
3. Construction of the power plant and switchyard. Except for the entrance to ihe plant and the
switchyard chat are constructed on the ground, the plant itself is built underground. They are
designed for minimum land use and avoidance of the IA area.
4. Disposal areas. Ihe disposal area around the upper reservoir is designed for a side slope of 1:5,
and will be designated as a forest plntation area to improve the ecological quality, and to prvent



erosion. The lower disposal area along the edge of Lam Ta Khong reservoir is sa to be on the
same level as the highway and can be developed into a recreation area.
S. Road improvement and traffic increase. This will disturb the ecological system of the land in
the area. The disturbance will occur only during the project consraction.
6. Transmission line's installation. The line wifl be mostlv along the highway.
Environmental Impacts::
1. Impacts on land use and soil erosion. The construction area is a low yield agricultural area with
low soil fertility. Thus. it is expected that there will be very little impact on land use. The erosion
problem. however. is at various severity levels depending on the slop of the area. It is necessary
that prevention or conservation measures be well taken during the construction period.
Impacts on forest, wildlife, and rare species. The majority of the constrction area is an
agricultural area. Wildlife, rare species of flora, nor plants of near extinction were not found. The
existing plants and animals will be affectd by the construction activities and pollution. but the
damage wil be snail because the construction area is sma   The impacts will be short-tern and
temporary.
Impacts During the Project Operation
Impact Causing Activities:
Change of landuse and system operation. Aft finishing the coustruction, the landuse at the Project
site will permanently alter. This will include the rehabilitation and enviromnental development in the
forms of forest plantation, community forest, and forest agriculure in order to rehabilitate the ecology
as well as to prevent soil erosion in the whole Project area.
Environmental Impacts:
1. Impacts on land use and erosion. After the construction period, the severity level of the damage
will gradually decrese as a result of a careful plan forreforestation and erosion control.
2. Impacts on forests, widlife, and rare species. It is expected that there will be a minimal damage
to the ecology of the area as a result of the increasing traffic. In the long run, the ecological system
will come to balance by itself.
2.12 Water
Concerned arm:
l. Lam Ta Khong reservoir
2. Lam Ta Khong river and the irigation system in the downsrem areas.



Construction period impacts
Impact causing actiities:
1. Work related to excavation and landfill. These activities cause erosion, contamination of soil
particles, suspended solids, and dissolved solids into watr sources during the rainy season.
2. Underwater works. In perfonning underwater works at the intakleoutlet. a coffer dam must be
built into the reservoir that will disturb the habitat of living organisms in the reservoir.
Environmental Impacts:
1. Water quality. 'he quality of water in the affected area will be lowered due to turbidity and
contaminants that flow into the water.
2. Living organismns. Living organisms in the water will be distrbed due tO the degraded water
quality and disturbance from the consrucuion activities to their habitaL
Operation Period Impacts
Impact Causing Activities:
Daily water pumping and relesing. The volume of water that is regulary pumped and relased will
cause the water level m the lower reservoir to fluctuate. Te range of flutmation depends on the water
level in the lower reservoir and tie quantity of pumped water. The maximaum pumped water is 10
MCM, that is the capacity of the upper reservoir, will cause fluctuation betwecn 0.30 to 0-70 mn.
Environmental impacts:
1. Restriction of available water. When the water level comes close to LWL, the amount of  r
that can be available will be restricted.
2. Destruction of plankton aad rish. The tremendously increased water pressure in the water tunnel
wiU kill plankton and fish in the water. The severity level of the impact varies inversely with the
volune of water in the resevoir resulting a less severe impact on the plankton in the year when
water is abundant and a more severe impact in a drought year. Impact on die fish can be severe,
but the damage can be reduced by preventng fish from being pumped mto the runneL
2.1.3 Socio-Economics
Concerned Areas
These are areas in the forest of Kbao Tian-Khao Khuan LuD and the area around die Lam Ta Khong
reservoir.
Construction Period Impacts
Negative Impacts
1. The project will affect 74 plots of agricultual lnd each 14.5 ri that belong to 45 households
2. Those whose houses are near the consauction size will be disturbed by noise and dust



3. There will be mor rsks for accident, diarrhea, and hookworm diseases due w the large number of
people working in the area
4. Fishery area at the cousuction site in the reservoir will be reduced.
Positive Impacts
I. There will be more work and income for people in the area and those from outside.
2. There will be more money circulation improving the economy of the area and vicinitv which will
eventually bring good results on the national economy as a whole.
Operation Period Impacts
Negative Impacts
1. The owner of 74 plots of agricultual land wiU permanently lose their usable land and income.
2. The number of fish cugt may decrease if thre is no effective mitigation.
Positive Impacts
1. ehe mad that passes the Khao Yai Tiang village will be improved to a better condition.
2. The environment in general will be improved and revived into a bettr condition.
2.2 GUIDELINES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION AND
DEVELOPMENT
The above mentioned impact necessiaes measures to prevet and remedy the negative
impacts in order to minimize the effects ofthe Project while at the same time tying to promote as many
positive effes as possible. The mitigation and development action plan is categorized into four main

Part 3: IMIPLEMENTATION PLAN
3.1 ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION AND DEVELOPMENT
BEFORE PROJECT CONSTRUCTION
3.1.1 Public Relation
Rationale
EGATs effort to develop electicity genemrng sources within the past decade often drew a
widespread opposition from the public and various organizations to the point that some projects were
forced to be cancelled. momentarily put on hold, or delayed. Oppositions to the EGArs projects not
only affect new EGATs projects. but also create a negative image for EGAT as a whole.
The Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project is a power generating project ta will least affect
the environment, ecology and way of lifi of the people in the areas. The project also prepares plans to
mitigate and reduce enviromnental impacts. however small Yet, past lessons indicatc that without
suffcient communication on a large scale to bring about positive attitudes, there are chances that
opposition movements could grow to the extent of becoming obstacles to the Project operation. Thus.
the Project deems it highly necessary to establish procedures for public relations from the time of the
project proposal in order to crate good undending among every concerned group and organization
at all levels. This should resuk in a smooth operation, and lead to success for later EGATs
hydroelectricity generation projec2s
Objectives
1. For relaed private and governmental units; to obtain good cooperation with the Project
2. For the people afmcted by the Project; to obtain acceptance for the usefulness and
ncessity of the Project so that they will be willing to cooperate with dte Project
3. For organizations that influence the public in general; to create good understanding,
appreciation, and support the Project.
Responsible Units
EGAT and relted agencies; after the Cabinets approval of the Project, three groups of public
relation personnel should be appointed, nayir:
1. Public Relation Advisory Committee consists of.
e Public relations experts



e  A mass communication professional, one each from the branches of jounalism. radio, and
television
* A famous environmentalist
This committee is responsible for giving advice on public relations guidelines and strategy as
well as problem solving.
2. Joint Public Relation Committee consists of:
* EGArs public relations director
* Nakhon Rarchasima public relations officer
*  Public relations directors for departments of imporant role in the early stage of the
project These departments are: Royal Forestry Department (RFD), Royal rrigation
Department (RID), Deparment of Fishery (DOF), Deparnt of Highway (DOHw).
*  Chairperson or public relation officer from  the Nakhon Ratchasina Chamber of
Commerce.
This committe is responsible for making public stemets or arranging for press reles by
the authority in each depmar t in order to provide information that is supportive of the Project This
is to guard against and correct misunderstndings as soon as the Projcct is presented to the public.
3. Project Public Relations Committee consists of EGArs public relations staff who has been
decy appointed to the ProjecL
This committee is rsponsible for coordinatng infonnation and public relations procedures
with other responsible units in the areas. It also acts as a liaison who organize actvities, produces or
looks for materials for all kids of dissemination in the plan, as well as coordins with the joint public
relations committee. Production of public relatios materials may need the assistnce of the EGATs
public relations or the experdse of a hired professional
Implementation Areas
The public relation is targeted at the people in the vicinity of the Project site and Nakhon
Ratchasima, and the whole country. The majority ofthe operation sites wiU be:
1. The Project site location
2. Nakhon Ratchasina province
3. Bangkok
Methods of Implementation
The procedures will be categorized into three phases as follows:
1. Appointing commitees and working groups
2. Estblishing public relations units for the project
3. Communicating, producing materials, disseminating infomation, and organizing activities
for the following public relations targets

Supporting Activities
Public relation for the Lain Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project needs to be carried out
simultaneously with that to correct EGATs overall image. Thus, EGAT should organize the following
activities:
I. Opinion examination
*  Regula examination of news and articles on the mass media
*  Research on people's artiudes rward EGAT or itsage tO be used as daa for image
corrction
*  Research on forms of opposition movements against EGArs projects m the past This
could be carried out as document studies. The data derived could be used for carefu
public reation plans.
2. Communicating EGArs work
There should be an effort to communicate EGArs work in television and newspapers. This
can be done in the forms of: documentaries, spots, support for environment related progrms.
Newspaper space or bmadcast rime needs to be purchased.
3. Formulating programs for living condition and occupational development.
Period of Implementation
Public relations must be carried our continuouslv all through the Project emphasized on
understanding of mass media groups, conservaion organizations, people in Nakhon Ratchasima, and
people in generaL
Foilowing the Cabinets approval of the Project, public rnlation procedures should be carried
out in four phases:
1. At the begining period



.2. During construction
3. During the phase I of the generation peiiod
4. During the phase 2 of the generation period.

3.1.5 Plan for Occupational Promotion
Rationale
The constuction of Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project will be the cause of impact on 74
cases of inhabimants of Ban Khao Yai Tiang, or 45 households (the subsistence land of 14.5 rai). The
villagars will lose their subsence land and the chance to use the land for fauming purposes. The
estimaed aveage net earnmg from agiculture on tbis land of each household is 16.500 Baht per year.
EGAT therefore has stipulatd a mitgation plan by promoting occupations which are appropriate to the
environmental conditions and at the sme time allocate subsistence land for the inhabitants after the



upper reservoir has been constructed and completed. The establishment of Cooperatives will also be a
long-tern promotion of their occupation.
The occupational promodon plan includes the promotion of animal farming, the employment
of local laborers during the construction, occupational training, and the instruction of new agricultural
technologies. These activities will compensate for their farming income. After the construction is
completed. EGAT has a plan to give 5 rai of land to each villager to grow good fruit trees.
Objectives
To promote and develop occupaton for the inhabitants receiving impact from the Project
construction so that they have stable earnings from animal fanming, cultivation, employment. and other
supplementuy occupations being trained, such as factory skill workers and construction.
Responsible units
EGAT, the established Cooperazives, the committee assigned by the Govenmeunt. and other
related units
Implementation Area
The community areas of Ban Khao Yai Tiang Groups 6 and 10, Khlong Phai Sub-district. Si
Khiu District where the Projects impact will :rist
Methods of Implementation
Occupation promotion to the villages will be conducted in tree phases:
Phase 1: Occupation Promotion during the First Four Years. This phase strting from the
approval of the Project until the completion of the upper reservoir construction (before land allocation)
includes:
A. Promotion of animal farming. This is a major occupaion thLat can replace cropping.
Participanng villagers will obtai the following benefits:
* EGAT allocates a reseve fimd for animal fanming such as beeves for loaning at a
maximum of 250.000 Baht per case, through the Agiculurl Cooperatives.
*  During the fis four years, EGAT will support 2,000 Baht/month (24,000 Bahtlyear)
to each of the 74 cases for their occupation. If any inhabitt wishes to invest in odter
occupatins, the committee will make consideration.
*  The land to accommodate for aninal farming is the aras of forest garden and the
national preserved fores around the village that cover 10,600 rai (Map No. 3).

B. Promotiou of hiring occupation. During the period of construction the affected
villagers at Ban Khao Yai Tiang have a chance to be employed by the contractors, in the
planting of forest areas, or by EGAT.
C. Occupational training. The ainuing will be cooperated by EGAT and the College of
Different Skill Workers, Non-formal Education Center, Nakhon Ratchasimna. The
occupations being trained will include, indusnrial skill workers and construcwrs. general
agriculure, weaving, and dress makers or tailors. EGAT will be responsible for material
expenses and teache' remuneration. Upon the completion of training, the Non-formal
Education Center will offer a certificate to each trainee so that she or he will be able to
subsist in the future. Occupation trauiing and teaching of other knowledge to both
affected and unaffected villagers at Ban Khao Yai rlang Groups 6 and 10 will be in
parallel.
Phase 2: Occupation Promotion during the Fifth to the Tenth Year. This phase strts fom
the period of land allocation until there is a yield:
A. Animalfa ..riug promction. This will be a continuation from the first phase.
Be Promotion of hirinlg occpation. This will be continued unil the consruction is
completed.
C. Cropping promotion. After the consruction of reservoir is completed. EGAT will clear
the dumping area of 450 rai to reallocate to 74 cases of affected inhabitans, each of which
will receive 5 rai. Roads will be built past the plots of land to promote cropping occupation.
*  EGAT provides budget for buying fruit ftes such as jack fiuit mangoes, and good
tamarinds so that each villager ca grow on the 5 ra. Good field crop breeds such as
coms will be provided as supplementary crops.
d EGAT subsidizes budget for the planting of fruit tres and crops during the first year,
and the maintenance of fiuit es before they yield fruits.
* During the beginning stage of fruit trees EGAT will coordinate with the Agricultural
Cooperatives in the provision of water for the village' plots during the dry period. The
amount of waxer requied is 40,000 m3. A dripping irnigation system will be built
Phase 3: Occupation Promotion from the Eleventh Year. At this sage, the inhabitants will
have obtained benefits both from animal farming and orchards. The imnplementaion from the eleventh
year will be coordinated by EGAT and the Cooperatves to promote occupation and manage continuous
farming businesses.
Imuplementation Period
Work will be continuous and long-nmed, staring from the approval of Project until the
elevenith year.



Personnel
This will be deermiined by the responsible units.
Budget
1. The amount of 7.114 million Baht to assist in occupation during the first four vears.
2. The amount of one million Baht for the training expenses.
3. Costs of fruit trees and crops' seeds for growing in the subsistence land of 5 rai. This will
be 0.60 million Bahts.
4. The amount of 10.656 million Bihts for the planting and maintenance in each 5 rai
S. The amount of 4.5 million Baht for water provision to the villagers' land, applying the
dripping irrigation system.
The total budget under the occupation promotion plan is 23.S7 million Bahts (Table I1).
Evaluation of Work
The responsible units make a progrss report ei'ery six month and a conclusion report every
year to present to OEPP and EGAT. An account for expenses for each payment period of six months
and one year will be made aid submitted to NESDB.

3.2. ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION AND DEVELOPMENT
DURING PROJECT CONSTRUCTION
3.2.1 Plan for Environmental Impact Mitigation During Project
Construction
Rationale
The construction of the Pumped Storage Project causes various aspects of environmental
impacts both on a short-tenn basis during construction period 6 d on a long-tenn basis after the project
is in bmplementation. Especial during consltuction, there are changes in landuse. labor exploits. and use
of machinery. These activities cause a number of impacts on the enviroment of the Project area, e.g.,
soil eosion, sedinent, air pollution, noise pollution, vibrations, traffic increase, public health for the
worker. All these impacts require effective mitigation.
Objectives
1. To prevent erosion and sediment during constuction
2. To control and prvent scouring of the reservoir bottom sediment
3. To prvent air and noise pollution, and vibrations
4. To prevent, rectfy, and develop traffcs
5. To prepare for hygiene of the workers in the constrction areas
Responsible Units
BGAT takes main responsibility incorporated with Nakhon Ratchasima Public Healh Office,
Department of Highway, and the Office of the Environmental Policy and Plan.
Implementation Areas
The construction areas in Khao Tian - Khao Khunlun Forest and the area around the edge of
the Lam Ta Khong reservoir.
Procedures
1. Prevention of erosion during co.strnction
Upper reservoir area:
The underground water flowing fom the excavated soil that is piled in the disposal area
can reach the excavated site at varying rate depending on seasons of the year. The
solution for this problem is to provide for pumping wells to pump the water away from the
site.



.* The soil that is piled will have slope not more than 1:5. Drain ditch will be provided for
intercepting rain waler around the piling area. A stiling pond will be provided with at
least 2-hour detention time to allow the suspended particle to settled as shown in Map No.
4.
* Plant trees to rehabilitate the environment and protect soil erosion.
Areas along the edge of Lam Ta Kbong Reservoir:
*  Soil and excavated rock will be conveyed through the mtnne under the Mitraphab
Highway tO the disposal area along the edge of Lam Ta Khong Reservoir.
*  Level off the piled soil and rock to the same elevation of the highwvay and construct a
coffer dam to prevent the eroded soil from entering the reseoir.
* When the tunnel excavation is done. top soil will be placed on top of the disposed rock,
and grow vegetative cover immediately. Typical soil piling and coffer dam is shown in
Map No. 5.
*  Plant ground cover plants and tree ft.  sthetic to serve as recreational area of
approximaely 15 rai
Area under transmuission Ies:
* Trees to be cut are those only necessary.
* The area that the trees are cut will require growing of vegetative covers.
*  Provide appropriae drainage in the areas that are likely to have high nm-ofE
Site preparation in various locations in project area should start in the dry season. Appropriate
protection should be done befre the rainy season.
2. Control and prevent scouring of the reservoir bottom sediment
*  During the project constuction, the measures for protecting soil erosion and soil transport
will be pacticed in order to contol the sedimentation problem in te reservoir.
*  During electric power genrating when the water in the reservoir is at minimum water
level (26 1.0 m msI) the flow velocities of the water at the oudet and at the taflrace channel
'vill be controlled to not more than 058 m/sec and 0.56 m/sec respectively. When the
water in the reservoir is at maximum water level (2777.0 m mst) the velocities wiU be
controlled to not more than 058 tn/sec and 0.13 mrsec respectvely.
* The tailtace channel is designed for a length of 50 mr and gradually widened in order to
reduce scouring of the sediment.
3. Prevention of air pollution, noise, and vibration
* Air pollution, top soil and stone excavation during consIuctioL There will be a spread of
dusL Theref  water should be spryed over the work area every time before starting
work. Soil-piling aras should be sprayed with water from tine to time to reduce the
amoumt of dust The construction being on an open area on the mountain that is windy
that causes the spread of the soil dam This cam disturb people near the construction area.

Persons working in the area should wear protection for the noise. fice and head to prevent
inhalation of the dust and injury from flying particles.
*  Annoyance from noise and vibrations The construction should rake place during the
day for the most part though it may be necessary to work at night times. Such disturbance
will not be too strngly feMt as the construction site is far from local people's houses.
4. Mitigation sand development of traffic
*  Preparation period. Fist the Highway Deparunents plans for improving Mittraphap
Highway need to be studied and followed. Such plans are the positions and sizes of the
areas where heavy trucks on or making U-un, and consmiction of traffic lanes for
turning vehicles. Next. traffic signs are set up. These signs are for speed limits and
warnings for vehicles on the highway about the constuction activities such as the point
where stones are transported across the highway to be piled along the edge of the
reservoir. Moreover. the laterite road that leads to the Project site on the hill must be
upgraded into a double surfaced trament romd before heavy machinery and, and other
merials are brought into the construction area
*  Construction period. By means of public relations, people in the consauction area those
traveling the road will be notified of operation time when they have to be careful as there
may be more accidents due to the increase of traffic. They wiu also be notifed of the
ime when ther is transportation of heavy machinery and construction matrials as well dS
soil and sone trnspormtion   Cooperation of the highway police will be sought in
enforcing highway traffic laws for drivers and truck owats so that they stictly obey die
laws such as speed limits and size and weight Limits. This will decrease the number of
accidents and damage to the road surfice. For the soil and stones  at are tmnorted
across the highway, officers should be assigned to give stop-and-go flag signlls for
vehicles on the highway.
S. Preparation for the Hygiene of people worldng in the construcdon area
Since it is the large scale Project in which a lot of manpower is required. Some are the worker
who lives in the adjacent areas of the construction site and some are moving in from other places and
they must be provided with temporary dwellings. If there is no provision for good sanitation the
distrbution of communicable diseases i.e. dissenter, hook-worm, and AIDS may occur. Those may
infect to the workers or t the outside through the villagers. Thus mitigation mesures must be
provided-
*  Safety equipnent must be available all the time, e.g., safety helmet, gloves, shoes, noise
and dust preventmg devices. In the tunnel excavation there must be enough air circulation
equipment. The workers must be well educated about safety.
*  Monitoring water bome disease is required. The new workers need health eamination
before start to work.



* Keep good envirornmental health sanitation and waste disposal system in the worker camp
site. Provide first-aid units for the workers.
In the tnnel excavation, There must be adequate communication devices that are able to
CDmmunicate to outside at all time for safety purpose.
Implementation Period
Implement continuously during the construction period until completion of Phase I. totalling 4
years. (Table 12)
Man Power
To be specified by the responsible units
Budget
A total budget of 125 million Bahts is provided for the concering agencies. This is not
included in the budget for construction that EGAT will specitf in the contract agreement that the
contracnrs must foUow the .avironmemal mitigation plan during the construction.
Work Evaluation
The responsible unis are requied to submit reports on work progress every 6 month and
annual report every year. OEPP and EGAT wil rview the report and prepare financial report every 6
month and I year submitted to NESDB.

3.3 ENVIRONMENTAL MIIGATION AND DEVELOPMENT
AFrER PROJECT CONSTRUCTION
3.3.1 Rehabilitadon and Environmental Development in the Project
Area
Rationale
The Lm Ta Khong Pumped Storage Projea rquie land area of 1,364 rai on Khao Khuanlan.
The area will be used for the constrction of reservoir. soil disposal and related constuction activities.
To use the land. EGAT has to obtain approval from RFD. The EIA that was studied by KKU indicated
that the area is within the watershed classification class IB  The forest bi the area has been destryed
and RFD has allocated puat of the land to farmers who joint the forest planttion project in Khao Tien -
Khao Khuanlan. Since the ara is within lB watershed area that is sensitive to alteration of landuse and
environat, it is essential tat after the project consucto, the area enviroment is properly
rehabilitted and developed The concept is to create landuse plan that is suitable to the natxe, ta is to
combine agiculture to the forest plantation is order to maintain the ecological balance. Furtheermoe,
the areas where the tmnis and underground powerhouse are located are in the watshed class IA that
the cabinet has approved for EGA7s use as a special car on March 17,l993L-hccording to the approval
condition, EGAT has to carry out faoest plantation to control soil erosion as suggested by toe Royal
Forest Deparmnent (RFD). (Appendix C)
Objective
1. To rehabilitate and improve the area conditions after the consmco in order that they are
suppotive to the balance of naare, tO aosion protection, and to aesthetic enhancement of
the projectarea.
2. To carry out fors plantion in the Khao lien - Khao Khuanlan National Resered Forest
that is arouid the project area in order to rehabilitate the forst condition in the watershed.
Responsible Units
RFD and EGAT
Implementation Areas
1. T.he upper reservoir area that EGAT bas obaied permission for use of 1364 rta
2  The Khao Tun - Kbao Khuanlan National Reserved Forest near the Project area for
carying out forest plantation of 7,685 mi.
3. The soil and rock disposal area along the edge of Lamn Ta Khong reservoir (Lower
reservoir) of 136 raL



Methods of Implementation
1. The upper reservoir area or1,364 rai
The implementation area for the environmental rehabilitation is divided into 6 areas (Map No.
6):
Area 1: The area provided for preparing construction work and storing of equipment.
After the construction is completed, appropriate measures for erosion prevention will be
implemened. This will be done by improving the ground condition and planting forest in the
area of 430 rai. To do this. EGAT will allocate a budget of Baht 860,000 to RFD to carry out
forest plantation. After that, EGAT will return the area to RFD.
Area 2: The area on the slope around the upper reservoir. This area of 125 ai will be
restricted for safety purpose. In order to conserve the environment. ie.. the soil and the
landscape aesthetic. EGAT will carry out ground cover plantation in this area
Area 3: The area provided for soil disposal during Project constrction. In order to help
the 74 inbabitants whose agriculturl lands were taken for the Project construction, EGAT will
improve this area of 459 rai and allocate to them. Each inhabimtat will recive 5 rai of land for
creating agriculal forest system. This will include the promotion of growing good breeds of
fruit trees. and EGAT will incorporate with RFD to provide fast growing trees for planting
along their boundary of each plot of lancL
Area 4: The area provided for community forest plantation of 80 rai. This area of
aproximaely "W% of the area allocated to the inhabi    will be used for community forest
plantaion to serve as source of wood for their use and for prevnting the near by forest from
being encroached. To implement, EGAT will provide a budget of Baht 208,000 for the
plantation.
Area 5: The upper reservoir area of 288 rai
Area 6: The road surface and vehicle parling area of 51 raL
2.   The Khao Tien - Khao Khuaolan Reserved Forest Area
The implementation plan for this aea is developed according to the Cabinet resolution on
March 17,1992 that allow EGAT to use the watershed area clss IA as a special case for the
construction of underground tnnels and power house. The condition for this approval is that EGAT
must carry out forest plantation in the area to prevent soil erosion and strictly follow preventive
measures to be sure that the consuction activities will not disturb the environmental, condition of the
area

3.3.2 Plan for Conservation of Fishery Resource in Lam Ta Khong
Reservoir
Rationale
During the operation penod of the Pumped Storage Project, the pumping and releasing of
water between Lam Ta Khang Reservoir and the upper reservoir for electricity generation will bring
about an ill efflect to fish and animal species in the reservoir. This is especially tme for plankton, fish
eggs, fingerlings, and various species of fish. From the study of the present conditions of Lam Ta
Khong rservoir, it was found that many types of fingerlings and fish feed at the area near the tunnel
inoeL Therefore, they are likely to be pumped into the tunnel during the pumping period. The sudden
high pressure in the nmnel will possibly kill these fish. The study also indicated the fish catch at present
is at approximately 100 tonlyear.
In order to lessen the problem, and to conserve the existing fishery resource as weUl as to
develop the resource so as to increase fish producdon, fish-protecting equipment should be inslled
coupled with stir'uiating fishery resource conservation plan.
Objective
1. To insall device for protecting fish from being pumped into the tumeL
2. To conserve and develop fishery resource in the reservoir by breeding and releasing fish
breed that are economically valuable in order to inerease fish productin
3. To promote fishery resource conseraon in the -  and promote appropriate fish
farming among the fairmer in the area
Responsible Units

Implementation Area
Lam Ta Khong Reservoir, Nakhon Ratchasima Province.
Methods of Implemetation
The methods for mnimizing the adverse effects on fishery resource, and for conseving and
developing the fishery rsource are:
1. Instafltiom of rub protectng equipment Nylon net of 05 cm mesh will be installed
amrd the area in front of the inlet tumneL. The approimated length of net is 550 m that
will provide appropriate cear disance from the uel inlet (Map No. 7). EGAT will be
responsible for the installation untder supervisin of DOF.

2. Fishery resource conservation. EOAT will support the existig fishery resource
conservation unit at the Lam Ta Khong resrvoir to increase its capability. The unit will
be responsible for protecting fish spawning ara, watch for illegally fiuhig. e.g., electric
shock toxic kilL etc. The implementation will be under the Inland Fishery Control Office.
Fishery Resource Conservation Section of DOF
3. Fish breeding and releasing. In fish breeding, EGAT will support the Inland Fishery
Section (DOF) to construct breeding ponds, nursery ponds. and water reatnent system.
The produced fingerings will be released to the reservoir. In addition, technical mfts and
fish cages will be introduced tothe reservoir.
4. Evaluation and report prepartion. Trhe acual impact to fishery resource firom the Lam
Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project operation will be assessed by the Fishery Environment
Section. The report will be prepared by the Policy and Plan Section.
Implementation Period
The period is apprmamely 7 years as deailed in Table 16.

3.3.3 Water Resources Management
Rationale
The Lam Ta Khong rescrvoir that is at present under the responsibility of the Royal Irrigation
Department will become the lower reservoir in Lam Ta Khon Pumped Storage Project The electricity
generating system will involve uSing excess power dunng low-dmanading period to pump the water
from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir on the mountain. The stored water in the upper reservoir
will be released through a set of electricity-generating turbincs down to the lower reservoir to serve
peak-demand.
The maxinum amount of water to be pumped up and released is 10 million cubic me1    per
day, and this amount will be reduced as the available water in the lower resrvoir is low in order to
avoid high fluctation of water level



-The above-mentioned power plant system will be another way of utilizing the Lam Ta Khong
water resource that there will be no loss of water from the operation. Nevertheless, this method of
water ulization will be related to the present water provision for irrgation. water supply, and industry.
There is also a tendency that the demand for the two later consumption types will increase in the fimre.
Thus, there should be an appropriate management for the allocation of water from Lam Ta
Khong water reservoir so that the resource will be available for use in the long tErm.
The environmental impact study of Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project reveals that the
operation of the power plant will affbc the existing Lam Ta Khong reservoir in two major ways: (1)
daily pumping and releasing of water will change the water level and the amount of storage water for
use. which is equal to the amount being pumped up, (2) the operation will directly affect the limitation
of water amount to be released from Lam Ta Ehong reservoir when the water in the reservoir is low.
Therefore. appropiate measures must be established for the management of water resource.
Objectives
To improve water resource aliocation of Lam Ta [ohang resevoir to march the operation of the
pumped storage project so as to serve the present water demands.
Responsible unit
RID and EGAT
Implementation Area
Lam Ta nhong Irigaton Project
Miethods of Implementation
1. Establisb rules for the pumped storage operation.
The established rules for the pumped storage opeation are: (1) the maximum amount of water
to be pumped up is 10 miDlion cu m that is equal to the upper reservoir capacity, (2) the amount of water
to be pumped up will not be grmater ththe 10% of the water storing m the lower resmvoir water. and
(3) when the water storing in the lower reservoir iles        30 million cu m ther will be no pumping.
According to the rule, the opeantion of the Project will be as foUows:
1. When the watr volume in the lower reservoir is greater Than 100 million cu m, the upper
reservoir will be filled up evey day (at 10 million cu m).
2. When the water volume in te lower reservoir is in the range 30 - 40 million cu m,
pumping will be limited to 0If of the lower reservoir water volume. That is the pumping
volume will be limiedto 3 - 1 million cu m per day.



.3. When the water volume in the lower rservoir is less tan 30 million cu m. there will be
no pumping.
2. Wster allocation.
The allocation of the available water in the reservoir will be adjusted so as to sufficiently meet
the demand of the existing irrigation areas and other water-consuming activities.
3. Control of the spillwy of Lam Ta Khong dam.
The control of the spillway at the dan will need to be adjusted periodically according to the
raising and lowering of the water levels.
Implementation Period
The implementation will be continuous for 6 years from the completion of the Project phase I
(Table 18).
Personnel
The personnel will be the regular personnel working in RID and EGAT.
Budget
Required budget is 1.0 million Bahts (Table 19).
Evaluation of Work
The responsible units submit implementation repors at every 6 month and summary reports
yearly to OEPP and EGAT. The budget expense reports are to be submiutted every 6 month and yearly
to NESDB.

3.3.4 Plan for Land Allocation to the Affected Inhabitants
Rationale
The constucton of Lam Ta Khoilg Pumped Storage Project wil require the land area of 1,364
rai on the Khao Yai Tieng for constructing the upper reservoir, dposing excavated soil, and prparing
works. This will affect the 74 inhabitants whom the Royal Foresty Depament has allocated this land
of 14-5 rai each for agricultual use. Thus besides the compensation payment that these inhabitants will
receive, EGAT has a plan for allocate lands to tm  so that they can continue their agricultue
occupation.
The EGATs plan is to develop the soil disposal area of 450 rai into agricultual land and
allocate the lanid tD the 74 inhabitants of 5 rai each. The agro-foresty system will be applied. EGAT
will improve the land to be suitable for orchard planting and will promote growing of good breed fruit
trees. This will include providing of water supply and budget for caring the plants during the first
period when the plants do not producc fruits.
Objective
To allocate land forthe 74 affected inhabitants of 5 rai each for agricultural use parallel to the
occupation promotion in livestock raising.

The commimtee to be appointed by the Govermnent and EGAT.



Implementation Area
The soil disposal area in the upper reservoir coasnuaction site of 450 rai that is presently used
by the inhabitants.
Methods of Implementation
I. Improve the ara at is used for soil disposal during the construction of 450 rai (Map No.
8) to be suitable for planting fruittrees and crops.
2. Divide the area into 74 plots for the affected inhabitants. Construct access roads to every
poLL Each inhabitant will obtain the right to use the area of 5 rai for agriculture.
3. Provide good breed plants. c.g. jack fiuit trmes corn seeds, tc.. to them for planting in the
provided land.
4. Corporae with RFD to obtain fast growing trees, e.g., Sadao for planting around each plot
to fomi a agro-forest system.
5. EGAT wiU provide water supply in dry period in the form of dipping irrigation.
6. In the early period when the plants have no product EGAT will provide budget for
planting and caring of the plants to the inhabitants.
Implementation Period
The implemetantion in allocating land to the inhabiants takes 3 yeas, that is to bc finish
within one year after the compltion of the upper reservoir (Table 20).
Personnel
To be indicated bv EGAT
Budget
1. A budget of 7.0 million Bahts is required for improving the area, dividing plot,

3A  MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF THE
ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION AND DEVELOPMENT
3.4.1 Plan for Monitoring and Evaluation of Forest Plantation
Rationale
he Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project wil use an area of 1,364 mi iu the watershed
class IB for consiicuon. In addition, the constuction of water tunnel will be under the watershed class
IA. Of this concern. the National Environental Board has reached a resolution that the use of land in
these watershed classes must be under special control. Any modification of the area condition must be
well planed to harmonize with the environment and the balance of nature. Thus, the deforested area
must be reforested to enhance the watershed quality. If there is any consruction. the a-a must be well
protecd from soil erosion. This is to prevent the tanspart of soil to water sources that wiU be banmful
to aquatic lives and human
For this project the environmental mitigation and development measure will be applied by
caying out forest plantaion after completion of the Project consmictoL  This measure aims at
preventing soil erosion and creating wildlife habitat Thus, in order to make this measure fully
effective, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness ofthe implemented measure.
Objectives
1. To monitor and evaluate the effectivenss of the implemented measure for mitigating the
Project impact on the watershed class lB.
2. To monitor and evaluate the work achievement in forest plantation in the Khao Tien -
Khao Khuanlan National Reseved Forest near the construction site.
3. To be sure that the inplementadon is highly effective and be able to solve any problem
ha may occur immediately.

3.4.2 Plan for Monitoring and Evaluating Aquatic Biology and
Fishery Resource in Lam Ta Khong Reservoir.
Rationale
Lam Ta Khong Pmped Storage Project is different from normal hydr-electic power projecL
The accurate predicton of the Projects impact an the aquatic envirnment and fishay resources is a
complicate task, possibly involving problems from the envirmental changes from what have been
expcted. It is therefore necessary to investigate and monitor the environmental changes both arising
from the namre and from the development of the Project
Hence, in order to streamline the mitigation of impact on the aquatic enviromnent and fishery
resources, close monitoring and evaluation of the operation should be underaken so that the work wili
be in line with the objectives. In addition, the environental expert committee dtat has admowledged
the Project EIA has suggested da  EGAT should have a plan for monoring the envirnental impact
on water quality, aquatic biology, and the effect on phytoplankton and zooplankton due the pumping
operation of the Project
Objectives
1. To monitor the changes of water quality, aquatic biology, and fishery resource in the Lam
Ta Khong reservoir after dte Project is in opationL



2. To evaluate the effectiveness of the action on conservation and development of fishery

3.43 Plan for Monitoring and Evaluation of Water Resource
Management
Rationale
Owing to the fact that Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project will act as a part of reservoir
water consumption, there is a need to manage the water resource so that it meets with the Long-cenn
demands from various activities. The management of waxer resource wili emphasize on the following
two main points:
* Appropriate annual allocation of water in conformity with the demand and storage
volume.
*  Increase of the efficiency of irgation system through the improvement of canals and
systen controL
The above long-term  management requires accurate ifi   on for the planning and
implementation together with a contnuous evaluation Thus, it is necessary to monitor and evaluat the
work by collecting data, compiling, and analyzing them so dt  they are utilized to the greater extent
Objectives
l. To collect and compile necessazy data for the coninuous management af LAm Ta Khong
water resource.
2. To conduct regular compilation and analysis of data for the future adaptation of water
resource management pianning in Lan Ta Khong reservoir.
Responsible Unit
OEPP
Implementation Area
The watshed and downsm  areas of Lam Ta Khong reservoir.
Methods of Implementation
1. The Collection and Compilation of Data. This task has been on the most part performed
by Lam Ta Khong Irrigaton Project RID. What should be done now is to semnline the dama-compiling
system trough the use of computer. The data wili consist of:
*  Meteorological data of the wateshed areas and irigated areas, temperate, and
evaporation rate.



*  Hydrological data such as the inflow rate to Lam Ta Khong reservoir, discharge rate. and
the side flow rate from the reservoir downsem.
*  Data on water irrigation and agriculture in the irrigated area companng between the
annual plan and actual
* Data on water utilization by communities industries, and other activities that use the
water from the Lam Ta Khong Reservoir and the river downstream.
The compilation system could be on a daily, monthly, or annually basis depending on the
nature of data and the existing systems.
2. The Classification and Analysis of DataL TMis task should be a cooperative activity
between RID and EGAT. The collected data that have been systmatically and continuously compiled
can be analyzed in terms of engineering in order to be able to determine the following situation aspecs:
*  The hydrological changes of the watershed upslream of the reservoir. as the hydrological
characteristics will effect amount water mftlow and the water management schemes.
* Evaluation of irrigation efficiency and provide improvement guidelines.
* The trends in water demand of the communities, industries, and various water-consuming
activities.
The results of trh above situation analysis will be used in the improvement of water
managenent in advance.
Implementation Period
The monitorng will be implemented continuously for 6 years beginning from the
commencement of phase 1 operation. Data will be collected monthly. Compilation will be carried out
once a year (Table 26).
Personnel
To be specified by the responsible unit
Budget
Budget for this actvity is 2.501 million Bahts (Baht Two MiUion Five-hundred-one Thousand)
as shown in Table 27.
Evaluation of Work
The responsible units produce a work progress report every six mouth and a conclusion report
every year to submit to OEPP. An account for xpenses must be made after every budget paymet i.e..
every six month and one year o NESDB.

3A.4 Plan for Monitoring and Evaluation of Socio-economic
Rationale
Lamn Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project will bring about the followmg  mportant
environmental changes. On the one band. approximately 1393.75 rai (223 hect;ues) of agricultual land
will have to be converted int the Projects constru  area, with the restvoir on the mountain top as
the major componenL This change will cause some impact among the people who lose their
subsistnce land. Consequently, it becomes necessay for EGAT to asses the compensation costs for
the people as appropriate.



In the long rm, the impacts from Lan Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project will cermainly cause
some changes in the socio-econamic conditions of the people living in and around the area
notwithstanding the fact that cautions, prevention measures and enviromnental development plans have
been well provided for. Future conditions, as we all know, are not entirely foreseeabl-. Ccrtain socio-
economic changes might tam out to cause better or worse effects than what have been expected. Thus.
regular monitoring of the socio-economic conditions of the people living in this area will contribute to
the continuous long-term impact assessment plan. This. in urn, will enable the responsible personnel or
units to recommend mitigation measures for the imaprovement of the peoples socio-economic
conditions.
Objectives
To monitor the socio-economic conditions of the people affected by the Projects impacts.
which will lead to appropriate mitigaton measures in The fitume.

3.4.5. Plan for Monitoring and Evaluation of Public Health
Rationale
The results from the Environmental Impact Asses¶ment (EIA) Study of the Lam Ta Khong
Pumped Storage Project indicated that the causes of illness of patients in the Project area are water
related parasitic diseases, i.e., malaria, dengue haemorrhagic fever (D.I.F.), some parasitic diseases.
and cholea Vectors of these diseases are mosquitoes, and some species of mollusks. The outbreaks of
diseases and their vectors are closely related to water development The EIA study did not cover
sufficient technical data on parasitology aid vectors of these diseases. The Environmental Expert
Committee that has acknowledged the Project has a strong suggested that there should be an additional
smdy on the mentioned matters to obtain detailed baseline information for use in disease prventive
planning in the fumr.
Thus, it is necessay to monitor the outbreaks of the eported diseases continuously through the
Project operation period in order that appropriate preventive measures can be implemented. before the
diseases spread out to cause health problems to the people in the future.
Objective
1. To monitor the outbreak of major diseases that are relates to water, ie.. malaria dengue
haemorrhac fever (D.H.F.), cholera, and parasitic diseases.
2. To moniwr the parasitology and vectors of these diseases, ie., mosquitoes, and some
species of moilusks in water bodies in the Project area, includig the study on bacteria of
fecal coliform and total colifolm types
3. To find approprie  methods for minimizing the dises problems, and the monitoring
methods.
Responsible Unit

* 3. Survey and inspect the distribution and trmnsmission of disease vectors that are related to
water, i.e., mosquitoes. and all species of mollusks in the area around Lam Ta Khong
reservoir, the downstream area and the vicinities. The study will be carried out twice a
year. i.e.. one in the raining season and one in Ehe dry season.
Implementation Period
The monitoring will continue over a 6 year period starting from the first phase of Project
operation (Table 30).
Personnel
The personnel to be responsible for the monitoring consist of 12 specialists in public health and

First Agenda
-1he president informed the  ndants of an official occupation of the Secretary-Genral of the
Office of Enviromnmental Policy and Plan, who has assigned him, the Deputy Secremrytopresideover
themeeting.He went on wo infonm the atdants of the approval of the analysis on environmnal
impact, and the mitigation plans to solve the impact by the specialists. for Lam Ta Khong Pumped
Storage ProjecL EGAT has produced an environmemal mitigation anddevelopment plan. and has
assigned the responsible agencies and included the arising expenditwe in the investmenL The meeting
on this date is thus to discuss the following items.
Second Agenda: Items to discs:
Implementation procedures according to the environmental mitigation plan
of Lam Ta Thong Pumped Storage Project
The Director of the Division of Eaviromnmetal Impact Analysis, the Office of Enviromnental
Policy and Plan (OEPP), explained the procedures in water resource development projects, as
esablished in the Royal Decree on the Promotion and Maintenance of the National Enviromnental
Quality, 1992, namely:
1. The Project owner should perform a feasibility study in parallel to an environmental impact
assessment
2. The Project owner then proposes EIA to OEPP who in tum makes an initial conclusion to be
proposed to a specialized committee to consider the enviromental impact as related to water resource
development before submission to the Cabinet for approval.
In order that his submission is in line with the decree on die promotion and maintenance of
environmenmal quality, 1992. the Project owner must attach the implementation plans for the proposed
measures, for the specialists to consider.



Thus, two aspects of the recommendations will be proposed to the cabinet one on the economic
and the other on the environment The first will be provided by the National Social and Economic
Development Board (NESDB) and the second by the National Enviromment Board (NEB).
However. Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project is a project under EGArs Power Production
Development Plan (1992-2006) which has been approved by the Cabinet on condition that EGAT
proposes he report and carries out the plan in accordance with the decree and that OEPP considers the
environmental aspects before each projeces approval. If any project has an enviromnental aspect which
deviates from what has been approved by the cabinet. the cabinet will have to review it.
The representative from NESDB) informed the president that this Project does not deviate from what
has been approved, therefore it does not need to be reviewed by the cabinet.
The president added that after this discussion OEPP will submit the recommendations directly to
NESDB.
Third Agenda: [tem to discuss:
The  Environmental Miftigption  and  Development Plan, Lam  Ta Khong
Pumped Storage Project, Nakhon Ratchasima
The Director of the Division of Environmental Impact Analysis reporte dtat EGAT has made an
enviromnental mitigation and development plan for Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project in
accordance wit the environmental mitigation measures approved by OEPP. This plan is divided into
fbur main programs:
1. Pre-constuction environmental mitigation
2. During-construction environmental mI
3. Post-construction environmental mitigation
4. Monitoring and assessment of enviromnental mitigation
Each program will be under dte responsibility of an assigned uniL A budget is allocated for the
inplementation of each program.
Each program will consist of sub-plans, mosdy under EGAT. The followings are the sub-plans to
be responsible by odter unis:



1. . The Department of Agricultural Cooperative Extension is responsible to establish an
agricultural cooperative at Ban Kao Yai Tiang within one and a half years after the Projects approval.
An amount of 24.43 million Baht is allocated, I A3 million for its establishment and 23 million for the
operation of the cooperative.
2. The Enviromnental Rehabilitation. The Departnent of Forestry and EGAT are responsible to
rehabilitate and improve the Project's area aftr the construction and to plant trees around the area with
a budget of 50.84 million Baht, 40.53 million for planting trees in two areas of 8,195 rai (by the Royal
Forestry Deparmient), and 10.30 million for landscaping at the soil disposal areas on the edge of Lam
Ta Khong Reservoir which is 136 rai (by EGAT).
3. The Conservation of Fishery Resources in Lam Ta Khong Reservoir. The Deparlnent of
Fishery will take responsibility on the installment of protective equipment to prevnt fish and
fingerlings from being punped into the tunnel, and on the conservation and investigation of fishery
resource to prevent and solve the inpact on fishery in the reservoir. ITe budget allocated is 10.75
million.
4. The monitoring and assessment of enviromenmal mitigation There are five sub-plans under
this aspect which will be under OEPP, with a budget of 12.61 million BaiL
There were discussions on these plans with the following conclusions:
1. The implementation plans under the charge of EGAT and oter agencies, such as the
management of water resourcs has as its aim the peention of wate shortages for the people. For
such plans. EGAT and the Royal Inigatio Departnent (KID) already coordinat work. Therefore. it is
not necesary to allocate budget
2. The establishment of an agricukuri cooperative group is decided by the Depmment of
Cooperative Exesion that the budget is appropriate.
3. For the rehabilitation of the Projects areas, the Royal Forestry Departmenamd (RFD) and
EGAT will carry out the reforesttion program at Kao Tian and Kao Kuan Lan, which comprise 7,685
rai. The budgcl is derived fomm the reforestaion cost made by the Budget Bure     Thus, the
representative from (RFD) does not object to the allocation. But for the additional area of forestation in
dte community of 80 rai, the budget will not cover it since the wait cost for community forestion is
higher than reforestaion for a rehabiliating purpose. For the re-allocation of 5 rai to eacinhabitant, a
commtee will be assigned aftrr the approval of the Project by the cabinet tO cary on. RFD will tale
this responsibility.



4. The conservation of fishery resources in the reservoir comprises the conservation of fishery,
the installation of protective equipment. fish breeding, and research and information gathering. The
Departnent of Fishery (DOF) suggested that the amount of water stored in the upper reservoir will be
higher than the amount discharged due to evaporation. This will change the level of the water in Lam
Ta Khong Reservoir and may affect the laying of eggs of fish. The water being punped and discharged
could also bear an impact on the fish. Therefore, more fish breeds should be supplied into the reservoir.
The fish breeds should be those of big-sized fish in order to survive. Small fish cannot normally adapt
themselves to the conditions. Big-sized fishcould be bought from the comercial sector, which means
a five-time increase in the cosL
The agreement made was that EGAT will cooperate with RID in the control of water fluctuation in
the reservoir within 70 cmn. If the level exceeds this lImit OEPP will inform DOF. The adfitional cost
will be taken from the construction cost. EGAT could draw 3.3 million Baht from the construction to
install the required equipment DOF could use this amount for fish breeding. However, in the long run,
work should be emphasized on the strengthening of the capability to breed bigger fish for he reservoir
inead of buying from private breeders.
5. The monitoring and evaluation of environmental mitigation compnises five sub-plans as
foilowed
I. Monitoring and evaluation of areas after reforestaion
2. Monitoring and evaludon of biological resources and fisheries in Lam Ta KHong
Reservoir
3. Monitoring and evaluation of water resource management
4. Monitoring and evahation of socio-economic conditions
5. Monitoring and evaluation of public health conditions
The above sub-plans are the monitoring and evaluation plans for enviromental mitigation.
The OEPP has requested to adjust the budget of the five sub-plans from 12.61 million to 19.21
million Bahts since the work will be long-term whereas the budget allocated is based on an annual
basis. Besides, the coilection of samples and the analysis of variables require a higher cost than the
amount determined. The office has considered the request and grunted - amount of 18.21 million Bahts
because from past experience, the budget was allocated on the same basis. The president asked the
Office to investigate the standard costs for sample collection and analysis, together with the principles
in budget adjustment for each year. EGAT-believed that the increasing budget will not be a problem
because the extra cost could be drawn from the reserve fimd of 10%.



The rpresentative from the NESDB suggested that an imnplementation plan for environmental
mitigation must specify clearly the agencies esponsible for the monitopring and evalation work. If the
work under the responsibility of OEPP needs to be investigated by a hired agency, E{AT could manage
the employment The office will determine the scope of study and allocate budget from the Project
management The fonnarion of any work plan should also have the budget for every part clearlv stated
for the easc in the following proposal procedures.
The President infonned the members that the monitoring and assessnt work of the
enviromnental mitigation plan at Lan Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project is carried out by OEPP
because this duty is estblished in the royal decree on the promotion and maintenanc of the national
environrelit, 1992.
Resolution It was determined that each related unit adjusted and improved the plans according

Preventive and Monitoring Measures of the Environmental Impact
Lam Ta Khong Pumped Storage Project, Nakhom Ratchasima
The Electricity Generation Authority Thailand
1. Preventive and Monitoring Measur of the Enviromental Impact
1. 1 Preventive and Controlling Measures for the Diffusion of Sediment
- During he operation of power generation, the speed of water at the oulet and tailrace
channel will be controled. At tde lowest water level in Lam Ta Khong reservoir (261.0 m MSL). the
speed will be limited to within 0.5BmIs and 0.56m/s respectvely. At dhe peak level (277.0 m MSL),
it will be controUed at 0.58m/s and 0. [3m/s.
- The mailrace channel is designed to be 50 meter long with a widened end which wil
lessen the diffusion.
1.2 Preventive Measures for Erosion
Upper Reservoir:
- This is designed with a gradient of 1:5. Washing is preented by digging a sewer for
rain water to collect at the sediment weil before being drained away.
-  Mant foret trees wO rehabilitae the area and to prevet washing of soil surface.
Edge of Lower Lam Ta Thong Reservoir
- Remove rocls and soil fommnmel digging trough tnel under Miuaparp Highway to be
piled at the edge of the reservoir.
- Adjust the pes of rocks and soil so that the level is the same as the highway surface.
Build a cofferdam to prevent wasbing away of soil into th reservoir.
- Plant uees and crops on soil surface to enhance the aesdteic values and to create a
recreaion area on 15 rai of land.
Under the Traxsmission Lie:
-  Cut down trees ony where necessary.



- Where big trees are cut, surface crops should be planted.
- Build drainage at the flooding areas.
The construction and operation should commence in the dry sean. Landfill should be
completed before the rainy season.
1.3 Conservative Measu  for FisheryResources in Lam Ta Khong Reservoir
- Install equipmen to prevent fish from enteng the tumel. This could be a 550 mier 0.5
mesh net fdixe at an appropriate distance from the tunnel inlet.
- Release economic fish breeds to increase the umber of fish in the reservoir. The breeds
could be broght in from Khbn Ta Tug Na Fish-breeding Stati. Kanjanaburi.
- Conduct a further research study on the use of specal equipmen to scare away fish from
the tumnel inleL
1.4 Enviromeal Rehabflitato Measures at the Project Area
-  Plt  forest trees at the dumpig area and the area around the upper reservoir to
rehabiliate the enviroome  according to lB watershed conditio. 430 rai will be reforesed. 126 rai
will be landscaped and covered with soil-surface crops, whereas 450 rai wil be allocated for
subsistam land and 80 rai for community forest area. (Details are provided in Map No.2)
- Improve tedumping area of 15 rai at the edge of Lam Ta Khong Reservoir so as to crea
a recreational area
- Lay asphalt on the road leading to the village.
1.5 Preventive Measures of Water Use Impact
- EGAT will coordinate with the Royal Irrigatin Department to
1. Improve the annual criterion for water allocaton by inrasing the level of water in the
reservoir basin at 261 mn MSL (during discharging penod) to reduce the strage amount from 290
milln m3 to 280 million m3. This amount will be sufficie  for irrigational and other puposes.



storage amount from 290 million m3 o 280 million m3.  This amount will be sufficient for
irrigational and other purposes.
2. Control the spillway in accordance with the water tide levels.
- Establish the following principles for water pumping and discharge for power generation:
the maximum amount to be pumped will be equal to the reservoir capacity of 10 million  m3 and will
not exceed 10 percent of the amount in the reservoir. When the amount is less than 30 million m3
pumping should be swpped. The following three cases should be observed:
1. If the water level in the reservoir is over 100 million m3, pumping can be operated to the
maximum capacity of the upper reservoir. (10 million m3)
2. If the waer level in the lower reservoi is 30 million m3, pumping may not exceed 10%
i.e.. 3 million m3.
3. Stop pumping operatio when the level is below 30 million m3.
1.6 Recompensation Measures for Affected Inhabitants
- Appoint a committee to consider the compensation and stipulate suitable compensation and
subsistence land for the inhabitants. A right proportion of representatves should be appointed from
villagers receiving the impact.
- Allocat ares- compensation of 14.5 rni per family for land, fruit trees and perennials.
The total is 1,364 rai and 74 households.
- Provide subsistence land of 5 mi per household for 74 households together with a
monetery support for growng fruit trees such as jaclcfmits. supply water for cultivation. and plant a
community forest on 80 rai of land for common purposes.
- Set up an agncultural cooperative in the village. EGAT will support money for low-
interest loans.
- Promote occupations among villagers on the basis that affected villagers must earn more
income and have a better quality of life than evcr before. Occupations such as animal fmaing could
be promoted so that the villagers wll ea  2,000 baht per mouth for a period of 4 years. or
orcharding from which the villagers may earn 2,000 baht maonhly for 5 years and 1,000 baht during
the Last two years.



Organize occupationral trmuning, support money for public health care, education, and
religion.
1.7 Preventive Measures for Public Health Care
- Provide accident-preventing equipment at the sire such as helmets, gloves. booms, noise-
and dust-protecting equipment. Aeration must be provided during mnneWng work. Workers should
also be trained In the operadon of equipment and in safe-working practices.
-  Car  oUt surveillance of water-bome disease  which could be carried by workers
themselves. Workers should be inspected before being enlisted, especially if they are from other
areas.
- Improve the environmental sanitary and garbage disposal at the workers' resideutial area.
Set up a primary heath care unit for the workers.
- Provide a telephone system at tunneling so that workers inside can communicate with the
people outside at al time.
2. Enviroam.ntal Monitoring Measures
2.1 Investigate the water quality following these procedures:
- Invesigate water quality at four points in Lam Ta Khong reseroir and one point at the
upper reservoir.
- Sampling shoultd be done twice a year during the dry period and the rainy sao from the
timle of Project's approval and continumly afler the geneaion of power for five yars.
- The items to be tested are: temperature.  nsparency, DO, BOD. TKN, Organic N
*                     Nitrate, Phosphate, Pesticides, Plank, Primary productivity, Chborophyl a content, aquatc weeds,
and Benthos.
2.2 Monitor the water sworage and usage, compile and analyze data foLowing a cmot us plan.
2.3 Monitor the conditio of areas of reforestion and areas where thee is soil erosion from
the approval of Project until three years after eltricity generatio



2.4 Monitor the socio-economic codiutions of the inhabit   at lest once a year for five years.
2'5 Monitor the public health conditions, investigame mosqtios which could carry diseases such
as malaria and hemorrhage, disase-carrying snails, investigaLe fecal coliform and tota coliform
from the consruction period until six years after. Samples could be colleceed from Ban Khao Yai
Tiang.
3. MNake a conclusion of the work outcome and report to the OMce of Environmental Poliy
and Plan at least once a year.
4. Since the proposed enviromental impact analysis is not complete, but only covers the
potential impact, EGAT should thus propose a monioring plan to the Board of specalist
before implementaion of the following plans:
4.1 Monitoring plan t control dth spreading of cholera especially among the workes during
conswicton.
4.2 Monitorng plan to rest the amount of pumped water so as to prvent impact on agriculmre.
4.3 Monitoring plan w  wnesigate t  change of the number of plant and animai plankaons as a
result of the pumping and discharge and the stir up of watr.
