Bank performance\n            overall is considered as fully satisfactory, while Borrower\n            performance overall is judged as highly satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned are as follows: Large pump storage schemes\n            can be constructed at much lower than hitherto imagined\n            capital costs and could provide an economic source of\n            peaking power for systems in which surplus off-peak energy\n            can be drawn from large efficient thermal or combined cycle\n            plants. Globalization, leading to large international\n            equipment suppliers moving manufacturing to their facilities\n            in developing countries could pose equipment quality and\n            delivery problems. An efficient buttress needs to be set up\n            in the implementing agency's project management\n            resources to counter claims made by civil contractors.\n            Equipment and construction contractor problems could delay\n            otherwise well-designed and managed hydropower projects.\n            Beside these technical lessons, economic/financial lessons\n            included: Sudden economic/financial crisis, especially in a\n            country that has been experiencing a prolonged period of\n            growth, could severely impact power demand and render large,\n            long gestation power development schemes uneconomic in\n            comparison to (otherwise less economic) smaller ones. Under\n            crisis conditions, utilities need to exercise great\n            financial discipline, drastically cut down operating\n            expenses, and strike an appropriate balance between\n            curtailing and carrying on with investments."}, "docdt": "2002-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
