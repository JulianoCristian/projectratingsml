﻿1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1    Context at Appraisal
1. The Context The Jordan Rift Valley (JRV) critical geographical location and great scenic interest,
combined with the most productive agricultural land resources in Jordan, has made it a focal area for
large-scale infrastructure, tourism development and land conversion, and climate change, all of which
threaten its unique ecological and cultural values. In this context, continued unsustainable natural
resources management practices have resulted in intensified land degradation in this region, which in
turn has led to a deterioration of the local communities' livelihoods and water resource management
issues.
2. The Government of Jordan (GOJ) has long recognized the need for targeted interventions to secure
the JRV economic and ecological integrity and retain key ecological functions for the benefit of its
people. While there had been a number of individual environmental and resource protection projects
in the JRV, most of these had not been biodiversity-centered and had not accommodated all three
pillars of the Integrated Ecosystem Management (IEM) approach: ecological, social and economic.
There had been no attempt to view the JRV in development terms as a single ecological system,
except with one notable exception: the JRV Master Plan developed in 2004. While the Master Plan
represented a major milestone in development control by providing a large scale designation map that
defines preliminary development zones and shows key conservation sites, it lacked the consultative
planning processes that enable it to function effectively. As a result the degradation of this region's
habitat continued, resulting in increasing biodiversity loss.
3. Rationale for Bank Assistance. The project was in line with the Jordan Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for the period 2006-2010, which includes program clusters focused on supporting local
development through increased access to services and economic opportunities. Issues of gender,
environment, water and energy are crosscutting through all the program clusters. The CAS
recommended environmental issues "be addressed selectively, building on their link with local
development-in particular the impact of eco-system degradation on poor populations". By
addressing environmental issues and promoting linkages with local development, the project was
designed to show that, with proper capacities and appropriate financing mechanisms, biodiversity and
conversation efforts can have positive impacts on the livelihoods of the most vulnerable communities
in the region. In the context of this project, this was to be achieved through an IEM approach and
local development program. The IEM was defined as a holistic and participatory approach to
land use that balances and manages ecological, social and economic components of ecosystems
to ensure that biodiversity and ecological processes can be sustained under development
pressure and social change.
4. The project further provided the opportunity for an exchange of ideas and cross-fertilization with
other Global Environment Facility (GEF) projects (such as the Soaring Birds Project) thus giving the
possibility for the creation of an integrated ecosystem management network. At the time, national
efforts to introduce, regulate, and institutionalize integrated ecosystem management were limited, and
there was little integration in Jordan between conservation and rural development activities. Training
programs addressing these issues and enhancing the knowledge base hardly existed, and the
involvement of communities and local stakeholders in ecosystem management and land use planning
remained limited.
5. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes. The establishment of protected areas in the
Jordan Rift Valley supports the recommendations of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action
Plan (NBSAP), adopted by the government in 2003, and the earlier National Environment Strategy
(NES) (1992). It also helps Jordan to meet its obligations under the Convention on Biological
1


﻿Diversity (CBD), the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), and the Convention
on Migratory Species (CMS) by furthering national strategies for biodiversity conservation. The
Initial Communication Report to UNFCCC recognized the need to expand Jordan's protected areas
(as identified in the NES), and also the need to estimate impact of climate change on the water
resources of Jordan. These plans and strategies also reinforce the importance of securing community
participation and community benefits in biodiversity programs, principles that are an integral part of
the project's IEM-centered approach. The project's attention to socio-economic programs likewise
supports the policies of the National Poverty Alleviation Strategy (2002), which emphasizes the need
to create more employment opportunities in rural areas. Furthermore, the intention to capitalize on the
ecotourism potential of the proposed protected area network will support the MOTA's recently
adopted national tourism strategy, which encourages further development of this niche sector.
1.2    Original Project Development Objective (PDO) / Global Environment Objective (GEO) and
Key Indicators.
6. There was a slight discrepancy between the Project Development Objective (PDO) as stated in the
Grant Agreement and the PDO as stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). The table below
summarizes the different definitions:

7. In the context of this project, the concept of Integrated Ecosystem Management (EM) is
defined as a holistic and participatory approach to land use that balances and manages
ecological, social and economic components of ecosystems to ensure that biodiversity and
ecological processes can be sustained under development pressure and social change. This
approach was to be applied in the JRV through small-scale, targeted interventions in the current land
use planning framework and through the setting up of a network of conservation sites to be developed
as models of the IEM approach.
8. The project development objectives were to be achieved through the following outcomes:
2


﻿* Consultative planning and management procedures involving all relevant stakeholders, and
based on IEM principles, successfully introduced to the Rift Valley to support the conservation
of key biodiversity sites.
* A network of 4 Protected Areas (PAs) (c. 57,000 ha) and 7 SCAs in the JRV legally established
and operating as models of IEM principles to support biodiversity conservation.
* Elements for 'climate proofing' biodiversity conservation within PAs and SCAs introduced into
the conservation planning and implementation stages of the project.
* Sustainable financing mechanisms for PAs strengthened through increased capitalization of $2
million for the endowment fund, and adoption of economically viable, nature-based livelihood
options by local communities in PAs and SCAs.
* Project managed successfully, and development objective achieved through an effective
monitoring program.
1.3    Revised PDO/GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification.
9. The PDO and GEO were not revised during the Project implementation period. However, there was a
discrepancy between the formulation of the Project Development Objective (PDO) as stated in the
Grant Agreement and the PDO as stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) (see section 1.2
above). Considering the Grant Agreement contains a more detailed definition (with reference to
SCAs) and is a legally binding document, this ICR will use the definition of the PDO as stated in
the latter.
1.4    Main Beneficiaries
10. The primary beneficiaries of the project were expected to be the communities living in and around the
seven pilot areas. Marginalized groups, including women, herders and other underprivileged groups
were to be actively targeted to ensure that they receive their share of benefits from project activities
and are able to effectively participate in decisions regarding land use planning in general and the
development of their community in particular. In accordance, the training and capacity building
activities of the project were to include participatory techniques and gender sensitization as topics in
the training program.
1.5    Original Components
11. The Project had five components: (1) Assessment and strategic planning for integrated ecosystem
management; (2) Development of a network of biodiversity conservation sites, embodying the
principles of integrated ecosystem management; (3) Integrated assessments of climate change impacts
on biodiversity conservation in the JRV developed to support conservation planning and
implementation; (4) Sustainable financing mechanisms for PAs strengthened; and (5) Project
management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation.
12. Component 1: Assessment and Strategic Planning for Integrated Ecosystem Management in the
Jordan Rift Valley - The objective of this component was to lay the groundwork for integrated
ecosystem management in the JRV by introducing biodiversity conservation and community
participation measures into the existing land use planning framework, using the proposed protected
3


﻿areas and special conservation areas as pilot sites. It will also support the development of national
policies for protected areas in Jordan that will embrace the principles of IEM.
13. Outcome. The expected outcome of this component was to successfully introduce consultative
planning and management procedures involving all relevant stakeholders, and based on IEM
principles, to the JRV to support the conservation of key biodiversity sites.
14. Component 2: Development of a network of biodiversity conservation sites, embodying the
principles of integrated ecosystem management - The objective of this component was to legally
establish the network of protected areas and special conservation areas defined under the land use
planning framework above, and to develop management systems for these sites that become working
models of IEM principles. A total of four new protected areas and seven special conservation areas
were to comprise the network, representing a cross section of all key habitats and ecosystem types in
the JRV. The PAs would cover a total area of 56,950 hectares and were all delineated on the JVA's
land use master plan. As for the SCAs, the delineations and total areas were to be agreed upon in
consultation with relevant stakeholders.
15. Outcome. The expected outcome of this component was to legally establish a network of 4 PAs (c.
57,000 ha) and 7 SCAs in the JRV which are operating as models of IEM principles to support
biodiversity conservation.
16. Component 3: Integrated     Assessments of Climate Change Impacts on         Biodiversity
Conservation in the JRV Developed to Support Conservation Planning and Implementation -
The objective of this component was to assess the regional impacts of climate change on the future
distribution of some major floristic groups and ecosystems dynamics in the JRV, in terms of
biodiversity conservation, and incorporate the results into the conservation planning and management
of PAs and SCAs. This entailed an assessment of the shifts in climatic patterns, shifts in species range
(range expansion, range contraction, range extinction) and other key parameters in the context of the
conservation planning (including the demarcation of boundaries, and the long-term management of
PAs and SCAs). The impacts of climate change and the development of climate proofing measures
would be assessed against their potential to generate social benefits.
17. Outcome. The expected outcome of this component was to introduce elements for 'climate proofing'
biodiversity conservation within PAs and SCAs into the conservation planning and implementation
stages of the project.
18. Component 4: Sustainable Financing Mechanisms for PAs Strengthened - Efforts were to be
directed at strengthening the financial and capital bases of the Project Implementing Entity (RSCN)
through the development of sustainable financing mechanisms and the raising of funds to support the
management of the PAs and SCAs. This entailed to increase the capital base of RSCN's existing
endowment fund, known as the Jordan Fund for Nature, from $8.5 million to $10.5 million. Apart
from endowment fund income, several other options for meeting recurrent costs were to be pursued,
including entrance charges, eco-tourism services, sales of craft products and private sector
concessions.
19. Outcome. The expected outcome of this component was to strengthen sustainable financing
mechanisms for PAs through increased capitalization of $2 million for the endowment fund and
adoption of economically viable, nature-based livelihood options by local communities in PAs and
SCAs.
4


﻿20. Component 5: Project Management, Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation - The objective
of this component was to establish an effective project management unit capable of directing and
supporting project implementation, liaising with stakeholders and carrying out monitoring and
evaluation according to agreed indicators and support its work through the provision of goods, works,
training, incremental operating costs and consultants' services.
21. Outcome: The expected outcome of this component was for the project to be managed successfully
and development objective achieved through an effective monitoring program.
1.6    Revised Components
22. Components were not revised.
1.7    Other significant changes.
23. The need for a restructuring of the project was encouraged during the mid-term review (MTR) and
the Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP-2), mainly to (i) adjust indicators, (ii) extend the
project closing date and (iii) reallocate grant proceeds to reflect the proper project needs in terms of
implementation. Nonetheless, although the restructuring process was initiated twice it was never
completed. An extension of the project closing date was requested in a letter dated December 13,
2012 from Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) to the World Bank, however
the decision was taken to close following six years of implementation (closing date was July 14,
2013) (see section 2.2 Implementation below).
24. The Project's design, scope, and implementation arrangements remained substantially unchanged.
However, it must be noted that during the life cycle of the project there were changes in formal
authority for land use planning and management. The Government of Jordan engaged in the
decentralization of the land use planning authority from the single Jordan Valley Authority (JVA) to a
number of regional bodies (Development Authorities), including: the Dead Sea Development Zone,
Petra Development and Tourism Regional Authority (PDTRA), Aqaba Special Economic Zone
Authority (ASEZA), etc. In order to align with institutional and legal changes resulting from the
creation of these new regional economic development authorities, whose legal jurisdiction now
superseded that of the JVA in significant areas of the Jordan Valley, the PMU was proactive and
worked closely with the regional authorities to mainstream the project objectives with the regional
authorities' agenda.
25. Initially, the four proposed PAs to be targeted were: Fifa, Jabal Masuda, Qatar and Yarmouk.
However, it was agreed by RSCN and the World Bank that it was of benefit to the project to pull out
of Jabal Masuda which was politically intractable and where tensions with local communities
persisted, and Shoubak was proposed as an alternative area representing the targeted
ecosystem/habitat.
26. A correction was carried out: In a letter from the GOJ dated February 22, 2007, it was requested that
all disbursements under the Project be exempted from duty and tax, including general sales tax.
However, the GEF Grant Agreement signed on August 9, 2007, did not include the correct
withdrawal table and the percentage of eligible expenditures under each Category that may be
financed using the Grant and was revised from 90 to 100%.
5


﻿2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes.
2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
27. This was the first major project in Jordan to focus on Integrated Ecosystem Management (IEM). As
such, its design has drawn on lessons learned from several previous biodiversity centered projects in
the country. The projects that have contributed particularly relevant experiences and lessons learned
were the GEF funded Conservation of the Dana Wildlands and Institutional Strengthening of RSCN
project (1994-1999), the World Bank Second Tourism Development Project (1998-2003), the
European Commission (EC) funded Birds and People in the Jordan Rift Valley Project (2001-2004),
the USAID funded Socio-economic Development for Nature Conservation project (2000-2006) and
the medium-sized GEF funded Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity in the Dibeen
Nature Reserve project (2004-2007).
28. Building on Institutional Strengths. The Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) was
selected as the implementing entity for the project. RSCN is legally mandated by the Government of
Jordan to set up and manage protected area network in Jordan, and has played a special role
throughout its existence in the national biodiversity programs.It has over 40 years of experience in
protecting biodiversity in Jordan, during which it acquired considerable institutional and technical
experience. It also has a long experience of working with other agencies, and especially government
departments, giving it a wider remit than most for conservation. Therefore, the choice of RSCN as the
implementing entity for this project was a logical choice taking into consideration that the RSCN was
well positioned to implement this type of large-scale multi-disciplinary project, and its clear legal
mandate for establishing and managing Jordan's protected areas.
29. In addition, a number of organizations were designed as partners in project implementation, either
responsible for carrying out activities or as advisers, consulters or representatives of government
agencies with related statutory responsibilities. While it may seem unusual for the implementing
entity to be an NGO when the project requires government involvement, RSCN has a 'special
standing power in the larger pools of NGOs'. However this special relationship may also limit its role
whenever the interests of conservation run against the interests of stronger government agencies who
may see opportunities for higher financial gains in the area.
30. Building Strategy on Sound Scientific Information. Through the GEF Dana Project the approach to
protected areas management was revolutionized in Jordan. Since there has been an attempt to link
conservation management planning to socio-economic development as well as to carry out full-scale
ecological survey baselines and socio-economic assessments. These lessons have been
institutionalized within RSCN, which now has a division capable of conducting baseline and social
studies across a wide range of ecological and social parameters. For this reason, the Rift Valley
project has incorporated a sizeable survey and assessment program under Component 1 to provide
data for the IEM centered land use plans and for developing conservation strategies in PAs and SCAs.
31. Stakeholder Involvement. Learning from GEF project experience of establishing the Dana nature
reserve, which saw continued local community resistance due to perceived lack of proper consultation
and wide community engagement, the Jordan IEM project, sought to ensure that local communities
(in particular) and all key stakeholders were involved in the various stages of PA and SCA
designation. Therefore, from its launch, the Jordan IEM project carried out extensive consultations
with local communities to promote ownership and participation - a cornerstone of the IEM approach.
Brand, L. A. 2001, 'Development in Wadi Rum? State Bureaucracy, External Funders, and Civil Society', International Journal
of Middle East Studies 33: 575

﻿Moreover, the project began its local community development activities early on before the actual
designation took place - thus allaying local community fears of being excluded from developments
that come from outside (Amman), building mutual trust between local communities and the project,
and thus fostering local support for the PAs and SCAs. Engaging in broad-based consultation with
national, state and local beneficiaries and stakeholders at the time of project preparation as well as a
detailed socio-political assessment of the areas would have greatly facilitated project implementation
to identify potential sources of risks and conflict and mitigate them before engaging in the
establishment of PAs.
32. Quality of Design. The project was grounded in good technical analysis and drew on RSCN and
government counterpart experience as well as on lessons learned from previous projects. PA selection
process was based on a ranking system in which a set of criteria (including criteria on conservation
value) was used for evaluating proposed sites (these criteria and sites were used and became part of
the National Nature Reserve Network (MOE and RSCN 2008)); and the PAD included GEF's
required management effectiveness tracking analysis of the four PAs. SCAs were carefully selected in
partnership with counterpart organizations (ministries, agencies as well as the Steering Committee),
and took into consideration a set of criteria to ensure an appropriate coverage of ecologically and
biodiversity rich sites. A Quality Assessment of the Lending Portfolio (QALP) of the project,
conducted in 2010, noted the following positive aspects of design which the ICR team concurs with:
clear explanation of issues and challenges facing biodiversity conservation in the Jordan Valley;
Jordan's commitment to improved environmental management; choice of RSCN as implementing
entity; integration of civil society (JOHUD); and the intention to establish strong linkages with the
JVA for the purpose of influencing larger land-use decisions in biodiversity-friendly ways well
beyond the boundaries of existing and proposed protected areas. In addition to the above, the design
of this project had inherent flexibility which allowed the Jordan IEM project to adapt to the changing
context and wider political economy within the bounds of existing results framework.
33. PD0/GEO. The GEO expressed the higher level and longer term objective of what the project
could achieve in longer term - which was securing the ecological integrity of the Jordan Rift Valley.
The PDO, as formulated in the Grant Agreement, to 'assist the recipient in implementing generally
accepted principles of IEM pertaining to land use in the JRV and establishing a network of IEM for
PAs and SCAs in the JRV' offers an actual intended measurable outcome for the project, and puts in
place a set of important accomplishments (capacity building, awareness raising, management plans,
ecological knowledge, etc.) and partnerships which set the ground towards the achievement of the
longer term and higher level objectives expressed in the GEO.
34. Risk assessment. Overall Project Risk was assessed as Moderate at appraisal. The PAD correctly
identified a number of risks including: (i) large/complex scope of planning issues in the JRV risk to
limit impact of project intervention; (ii) designating protected areas through government channels will
be time consuming; (iii) community-driven conservation management will not be sustained after
project ends; (iv) RSCN capacity would not be able to cope with expanding number of PAs; (v) lack
of coordination/decision with partner agencies who could withdraw from the project; and (vi) the
uncertainty associated with climatic shifts may undermine predictive capacity of range shifts of key
species groups and the 'climatic proofing' objective. One substantial risk was identified which was
that neighboring conflicts may deter international tourists from visiting Jordan. This risk materialized,
particularly as a result of the Arab Spring and the ongoing conflict in neighboring Syria which is
having a spillover effect on tourism trends in the country. On the whole, these risks were realistic and
the risk mitigation measures were appropriate. Nonetheless, a risk which may have been identified in
the PAD, given the lessons learned in the establishment of Dana reserve, was the issue of local
communities' resistance to the establishment of PAs.
7


﻿35. Land issues and local community support. A risk that the PAD was not able to predict, since the PAs
were due to be established on public lands, was the delays associated with local communities'
resistance to the designation of PAs due to land issues. The Arab Spring, has provided an expanded
public space for gathering and expression, and several tribes took the opportunity to call for solving
the issue of 'tribal fronts' - public lands that were historically located adjacent to locations of tribal
settlements, and which some perceive as rights for these tribes, even though officially these are public
lands. Some of the areas to be designated as protected by the project were affected by this issue, as
was the case for instance in Jabal Masuda and Shoubak PAs, where local communities feared that
designation of PAs will prevent chances of their future claims to these lands, and possibility of
benefiting from any future increase in land value of these lands. Jabal Masuda PA was replaced with
Shoubak PA, and the project carried out extensive consultations and started local community
development activities early to mitigate these fears. A detailed analysis of land tenure of the potential
protected areas during project design may have provided insights on the socio-political complexities
on the ground.
36. Local community engagement. Moreover, as mentioned above, facilitating the engagement of local
communities prior to project implementation would have released some of the pressure from the
implementing agency, which had to spend a significant amount of time for stakeholder mobilization,
setting up implementation arrangements, and policy-level engagements for the establishment of PAs
and SCAs, and thereby resulted in longer leg-time before actual implementation could begin. It may
also have been pertinent in the design phase, to place more emphasis on how to achieve the stated
outcomes though participatory processes.
2.2 Implementation
37. The project implemented the majority of the planned activities with visible results in terms of the
improvement in biodiversity conservation management in the Jordan Rift Valley including the
designation of three PAs, the preparation of the designation file for the fourth PA, and the
establishment of 10 SCAs.
38. The Project became effective on September 19, 2007. At the Mid-term review (MTR) in March 2011,
the PDO/GEO and Implementation progress were rated as "Moderately Unsatisfactory" (MU) due to
the slow activity and disbursement progress. The project, however, made a remarkable turnaround
after the MTR: by the end of 2011 disbursement increased from 22% to 44%, a reflection of the much
improved ongoing execution of project activities and operations, the recruitment of key individuals to
deliver on the project components with the mainstream of climate change, community development
and land use planning functions into RSCN, as well as improvement in communications with key
government agencies which led to several breakthrough discussions with the Ministry of
Environment, JVA, and Ministry of Agriculture, among other partners. By March 2012 (one year
after the MTR), both the PDO and the Implementation Performance (IP) rating were raised to
Satisfactory. The project was able to maintain the high pace that it established following the MTR
until its closure in July 2013. Maintaining such high pace of activities that has allowed the project its
remarkable turnaround, would not have been possible without the candidness and support of the Bank
supervising team.
Key factors that affected project implementation included:
39. Slow project progress up to the MTR. Two factors contributed towards the slow project progress:
i) Key staff turnover: The absence of a project manager in place in the periods from October 2008 to
August 2009 and from January to November 2010 substantially delayed project implementation in the
8


﻿first three years of the project. This issue was subsequently resolved with the reappointment of the
project manager in 2010, and with a consolidated and fully operational PMU team there was a rapid
acceleration in the implementation of project activities; and
ii) PMU Lines of Reporting. As the project started, the PMU was reporting to the head of the
Research Department at the RSCN. This lead to a lengthy and difficult decision making process. In
addition, following extensive consultations, it was decided on an exceptional basis to outsource key
assessments to RSCN. The single source contract was signed by the MOE as chair of the Steering
Committee. This limited to some extent the range of actions that the PMU could undertake to speed
the delivery of key assessments. In 2010, changes were made to shift the reporting lines for the PMU
from the Research Department to the RSCN Director, which provided the PMU space and authority
for better and faster decision making.
40. Studies/consultations taking longer than expected. A number of studies, surveys and consultations
were planned to lay the groundwork for IEM in the JRV. These were delayed by several factors: (i)
initial difficulties in gaining security clearance to access some of the conservation sites that are close
to international boundaries; (ii) difficulties recruiting international consultants; and (iii) changes in
formal authority for land use planning and management that could not have been envisaged at the
time of project preparation.
41. High level of cooperation and partnerships was a notable feature of this project, building on and
further strengthening existing inter-agency collaboration to promote conservation in the JRV. In
particular the leadership and professionalism of the dedicated Project Management Unit (PMU) was
critical in building strong collaboration through for instance frequent Project Steering Committee
Meetings promoting information exchange among relevant partners. In addition, the project provided
considerable technical assistance to local communities to help them access additional financing (for
example, financing from the GEF Small Grants Program, JOHUD, etc).
42. Applying lessons learned from previous projects. Building on the lessons learnt in earlier projects
(Dana and Dibeen nature reserves), the project did not wait for the official designation of the
protected areas to start work and consultations with the local communities. Considerable
consultations and local community development activities were carried out prior to formal
designation of PAs and SCAs.
43. Changing organizational, political, and regional landscape resulted in delays to designation of PAs
and SCAs. Delays were encountered in obtaining the official designations for PAs and SCAs. This
was partly related to high turnover at the Ministerial levels, meaning that the base understanding on
the part of new appointed Ministers of the role of the RSCN has been variable, requiring the project
manager and RSCN Board to make efforts to build new relationships and explain the operational
needs of the project that must be supported by the Ministry. Resistance to the legal establishment of
PAs among primary stakeholders has also been an obstacle, particularly in Jabal Masuda, Shoubak
and Qatar, but also to a lesser extent in Yarmouk. Moreover, the political situation with the Arab
Spring spurred a higher level of resistance on the ground which could not have been envisaged.
Finally, PA and SCA designation was also slowed down by development projects on the ground, for
instance, the designation of Qatar PA and Wadi Bin Hammad SCA being delayed since the
implementing entity was advised to wait with the designation of the sites until the completion of the
Red Sea - Dead Sea Water Conveyance Study.
44. Project extension and delays in building activities. Given the delays noted above, the Project could
have benefited from a one-year extension, especially to ensure the consolidation of project activities
and to permit the materialization of project outputs in more perceptible outcomes. The PMU faced a
9


﻿number of difficulties in finding suitable contractors for the construction of project site based
management, community development and tourism and outreach facilities and stations planned under
the project. This was mainly due to difficulties in finding competitive offers from the local
contractors after almost eight months of preparation and bidding. In order to deal with these delays,
the PMU was advised to apply for a level one restructuring for a one-year extension of the project
closing date. However, 6 months prior to project closure, the decision was taken to close following
six years of implementation (on July 14, 2013), which is consistent with the new GEF policy. The
PMU noted in its last progress report for the first quarter of 2013, 'that it perceives this unanticipated
decision as seriously problematic for the project implementation and added a critical challenge to its
successful completion'. In order to deliver on all project activities by the closing date, the PMU
adopted an emergency plan to finalize key project activities and disburse all remaining funds. The
PMU should be applauded for their ability to change gears quickly in their project planning and to
contract and supervise speedily and closely the remaining civil works contracts.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
45. M&E Design. Two outcome indicators were identified: 'coverage of key vegetation types increased
in each PA' and 'number of hectares in which users have more environmentally benign land use
practice in accordance with land use guideline and management plans'. The first outcome indicator
was relevant to the GEO, while the second was relevant to the PDO, and the results indicators were
relevant to the components. Moreover, the results framework provided sufficient flexibility to allow
interpretation by the PMU without the need for formal restructuring. However, considering the social
and economic objectives of the IEM approach, indicators should have been included to measure the
economic activity/ improvements on wellbeing in the project areas, or in any case the number of
project beneficiaries. There were some inconsistencies between the indicators in the PAD and the
ones monitored in the ISRs, some were phrased differently and a number of indicators were missing
and thus not monitored in the operations portal. However, these were adequately reported in the
World Bank mission aide memoires.
46. M&E Implementation and utilization. Project monitoring and evaluation arrangements were clear as
to who will do what and what will be measured. The project team used an adaptive approach to
measure each indicator and adjusted the results according to their understanding, in part, because the
Results Framework in the PAD was flexibly designed, allowing room for interpretation. Accordingly,
the original indicators have been reported on in this ICR and the adjusted interpretation of the
indicators is provided (see comments in Data Sheet). The completion of project baseline
measurements was delayed and did not occur until the MTR. The PMU hired an M&E specialist, in
charge of monitoring indicators and progress reports. Accurate and well-prepared project progress
reports were submitted in a timely manner, and progress reporting was decentralized to each
component and project site.
47. Protected Area Management Effectiveness. In line with GEF requirements, all designated protected
areas used the GEF's Protected Area Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (PAMETT). The tool
rates overall protected area management according to a large number of measurable criteria. The
project prepared the PAMETT every two years. Overall, the protected area management effectiveness
ranged between 14% (for Shoubak PA) to 70% for Qatar and Fifa PAs, with Yarmouk PA just behind
at 61%.
48. Based on the above, the M&E is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
10


﻿2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)
A. Safeguards
49. Safeguard policies identified in the PAD included (i) Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), (ii)
Natural Habitats (OP 4.04), (iii) Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11), and (iv) Involuntary
Resettlement (OP 4.12).
50. Environmental Assessment. The project was classified as a Category B and the GOJ prepared an
Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA), an Environmental and Social Management Plan
(ESMP), and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). The PMU was responsible for the
development and implementation of a detailed M&E system to ensure the implementation of the
ESMP and possible implementation of the RPF.
51. Environmental Safeguards Compliance. The Project Director, who has good environmental and
social safeguards capacity, directly implemented and monitored ESMP compliance. Small-scale civil
works construction was completed with careful PMU supervision and physical documentation. The
project as designed was to have employed a part-time dedicated environment and social safeguards
consultants. However, there were (i) substantial delays in the submission of the environmental
safeguards biannual progress reports; as well as (ii) concurrent reports of weak to nonexistent
presence in the field in support of PA and SCA staff and operations. In addition, there were
substantial delays in hiring adequate social staffing support to supplement the technical skills of the
environmental safeguards consultant. Hence, in addition to the delays, the project was without
safeguards staffing for the last year. Nonetheless, environmental compliance on-the-ground was
satisfactory.
52. Social Safeguards Compliance. The GOJ prepared a RPF in the case that there were OP 4.12
associated issues with the designation and implementation of PAs and SCAs. The PAs as designated
were previously public lands, which prohibited any grazing, hunting, agriculture, or wood collection.
Nonetheless, PA lands had been used for such purposes. Numerous stakeholder consultations
preceded PA designation, and all PA implementation proceeded with a "soft designation", whereas
the community support of ecosystem based economic activity has proceeded, but any PA fencing,
signage, or site-usage monitoring has not.
B. Fiduciary Compliance.
53. Early in the Project, World Bank procurement and financial specialists provided training on the
Bank's required procurement procedures - which was reinforced when there were changes in staff.
Throughout the project, procurement was rated Satisfactory, and financial management was mostly
rated Satisfactory. Both procurement and financial management closed with Satisfactory ratings.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
54. Transition arrangements. The project has shown considerable foresight and success in initiating
transition arrangements well in advance of project closure. This included: mainstreaming its climate
change, community development and land use functions from its PMU into RSCN two years ahead of
project closure, so that by project closure these units were well integrated into the RSCN
organizational structure; and the RSCN contracted the PMU staff for periods ranging from three to six
months following the official closure of the project in order to ensure a smooth closure and transition.
11


﻿55. In addition, the multiple field offices that must be able to make decisions in a decentralized
environment, yet continuing trainings and visits to and from the RSCN offices in Amman will
continue to infuse a common sense of project objectives across the PAs and SCAs. The completion of
the construction of project site based management, community development and tourism and outreach
facilities and stations planned under the project, and the recent operationalization of management
plans, gains and achievements should be more fully realized and sustained with continuing activities
building on the achievements of the past 6 years.
56. The financial sustainability of the protected areas designated as part of the project will be covered
through the following: Government of Jordan contributions; the increase in the RSCN endowment
fund; and through additional co-financing and the establishment of revenue-generating socio-
economic and tourism activities through Wild Jordan. The RSCN business model acknowledges that
some PAs will be able to cover the conservation costs more fully than others, and that some PAs will
always require to be cross-subsidized by Wild Jordan commercial activities. As such, the project
contributed towards the build-out of the interior space for the Wild Jordan shop at the Queen Alia
International Airport, which will provide an additional important outlet for marketing products from
the socio-economic projects. The 350 page RSCN transformation strategy discusses these aspects in
detail.
57. RSCN, with donor support, will continue to collaborate closely with the relevant Ministries (MOE,
MoPIC and the Ministry of Municipal Affairs (MOMA)), the JVA, as well as the Development Zones
Authorities on issues of common interest in working towards sustainability of the sites. Moreover, the
designation file for Shoubak protected area has been transferred to RSCN who will continue to work
towards ensuring the designation of the site in collaboration with local communities, as well as in
trying to resolve existing tensions in Qatar to be able to implement concrete activities on the ground.
The GEF-UNDP project "Mainstreaming Biodiversity Conservation in Tourism Sector Development
in Jordan", which aims to mainstream biodiversity conservation into tourism sector development in
Jordan as a whole and more specifically in critical areas for biodiversity in the Jordan Rift Valley,
will further strengthen the achievements and will help reduce threats to biodiversity from the current
and future tourism sector development in the JRV.
58. Next phase. Based on Government's priorities, and as established in the Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) FY12 -FY15, the Bank does not envisage any follow-on operation in the Rift Valley, at least
for the remaining period of the CPS. RSCN, is also a key partner in the recently launched GEF Badia
Ecosystem and Livelihoods Project which will contribute to enhancing the sustainability of the Badia
region, and will manage activities revolving around setting up and managing PAs; raising awareness
of environmental issues; creating job opportunities for rural communities through ecotourism and
other nature-based businesses; providing training and capacity building for environmental
practitioners and other institutions; and running environmental education campaigns.
12


﻿3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
59. The project objective was and continues to remain highly relevant to the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan and to the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems. Biodiversity conservation is an area of
significant progress in Jordan, with rapid growth in the land area under protection over the last couple
of decades, (expected to reach over 6% of total land area in the country, i.e. double the average of the
MNA region), and a model of decentralized Protected Area (PA) management operated through a
partnership with RSCN.
60. The project remains strongly aligned with existing policies on biodiversity conservation and in terms
of global priorities, the Project is well aligned with global commitments and agreements. The
establishment of protected areas in the JRV supports the recommendations of the National
Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, adopted by the government in 2003, and the earlier National
Environment Strategy (NES) (1992). In the Jordan National Agenda for 2006-2015, one of the
selected performance indicators for the Environment is the 'number of nature reserves', with targets
set for 2012 at 29 nature reserves, and 33 for 2017. It also helps Jordan to meet its obligations under
the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change,
and the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) by furthering national strategies for biodiversity
conservation. The Initial Communication Report to UNFCCC recognized the need to expand Jordan's
protected areas (as identified in the NES), and also the need to estimate impact of climate change on
the water resources of Jordan. These plans and strategies also reinforce the importance of securing
community participation and community benefits in biodiversity programs, principles that are an
integral part of the project's IEM-centered approach. The project's attention to socio-economic
programs likewise supports the policies of the National Poverty Alleviation Strategy (2002), which
emphasizes the need to create more employment opportunities in rural areas. Furthermore, the
intention to capitalize on the ecotourism potential of the proposed protected area network will support
the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities' (MOTA) recently adopted national tourism strategy, which
encourages further development of this niche sector.
61. In terms of the Bank's assistance strategy, the Project's objective contributes to the outcomes
envisioned in the 2012-2015 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Jordan (Report No 58114). The
Jordan CPS outcomes matrix includes better conservation and harnessing of values from natural
ecosystems under the results area 11.1.2: Support selected priority infrastructure (environment/waste
management, which is part of the Pillar 2 of 'strengthening the foundation for sustainable growth with
a focus on competitiveness'.
62. The project as implemented has resulted in an internationally-recognized successful piloting of the
landscape approach to biodiversity conservation. All of the above supports a determination that the
relevance of objectives, as well as the project at design and at implementation close, has been
Substantial.
3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objective and Project Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory
63. The project has made a major contribution towards achieving the longer term Global Environmental
Objective (GEO) and has been Satisfactory in achieving both parts of the Project Development
Objective (PDO).
13


﻿64. The Global Environmental Objective (GEO). Considerable progress has been made in achieving
the Global Environmental Objective of 'securing the ecological integrity of the Jordan Rift Valley as
globally important corridor'. The project has built a solid foundation for the long-term conservation
of the Jordan Rift Valley, with the establishment of a corridor of PAs and SCAs through the
institutionalization of an integrated ecosystem management approach of the sites by encouraging the
involvement of local stakeholders and communities in the planning. Moreover, the project has been
opportunistic in establishing private-public partnerships, including land set-asides of more than
$160M (for a $6.15M GEF investment) and several signed MOUs for long-term collaboration beyond
the project. Through small-scale, targeted interventions in the current land use planning framework
and through the setting up of a network of conservation sites the project encouraged a holistic and
participatory approach to land use that help sustain biodiversity and ecological processes under
existing development pressure and social change.
65. Project Development Objectives (PDO). The Project disbursed all grant funds and managed to
attain tangible results in achieving project development objectives to a Satisfactory extent, despite
important start-up delays in the first three years of project implementation. The achievements of
project objectives are evidenced by the successful attainment of the majority of the outcome
indicators (see Table 2 below), and the fact that a number of achievements will be sustained in the
long term. Moreover, the Jordan IEM project was particularly innovative in Jordan by mainstreaming
biodiversity conservation into the land use planning using a participatory approach, and through the
introduction and the application of the principles of integrated ecosystem management in the Rift
Valley. Moreover, it must be noted, that the JO-IEM was the first project examining the effects of
climate change on biodiversity, with pilot approaches to measure change. Finally, the project drew on
important lessons learned from the Dana Nature Reserve project, carried out in the 1990s,
particularly, on the need to apply a 'bottom-up' approach, with great emphasis on community
participation and capacity building, by for instance ensuring the recruitment of local staff to manage
protected areas.
66. The subsequent paragraph, will review in more details how project objectives were achieved by
examining individually each objective of the two-fold PDO as defined in the Grant Agreement:
(i)'Implementing generally accepted principles of integrated ecosystem management pertaining
to land use in the Jordan Rift Valley'.
Rating: Satisfactory
In order to ensure IEM principles are integrated within the broader JRV landscape, the following
activities were successfully completed:
The ecosystem approach and biodiversity conservation was mainstreamed into the land use
planning frameworks, processes and plans of five national and regional development agencies
(Development Zone Commission (DZC), Petra Development and Tourism Regional Authority
(PDTRA), Ministry of Municipal Affairs (MOMA), Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority
(ASEZA), and JVA) rather than just one JVA as envisaged during project design. During the
project, in order to align with institutional and legal changes resulting from the creation of new
regional economic development authorities, whose legal jurisdiction now supersedes that of the
JVA in significant areas of the Jordan Valley, the PMU was proactive and worked closely with
the regional authorities to mainstream project objectives with the regional authorities' agenda.
Moreover, the project developed and adopted three biodiversity oriented land use guidelines with
MOMA, MOE, and the DZC.
14


﻿*  Increased awareness at local, national and regional levels of the importance of biodiversity, the
need for protected areas, and the linkages between environmental management and livelihood
opportunities. The development of a number of knowledge management products for the sites, as
well as a number of capacity building training activities in the targeted areas have increased
awareness on the ecological importance of the sites and enhanced capacity for biodiversity
conservation through targeted training. Moreover, in response to the changing institutional
context, the project implemented a comprehensive awareness raising program for all project
stakeholders twice - at inception and midterm - rather than once as per the project design.
*  Developing a biodiversity oriented climate change program within RSCN. Initially, the project
only intended to undertake baseline assessment for climate change and biodiversity. However, the
project mainstreamed climate change and land use functions from its PMU into RSCN two years
ahead of project closure and was able to go all the way to institutionalizing the climate change
program nationally within the Department of Meteorology. Additionally, RSCN went beyond the
objectives originally envisioned within this component by preparing a set of adaptation strategies
to be implemented within and beyond PAs, the implementation of a series of pilot adaptation
projects in project sites, and the development of a long term development strategy for its newly
established climate change unit.
*   The project has shown considerable foresight and success in mainstreaming climate change
and land use functions from its PMU into RSCN two years ahead of project closure. This
includes progress on establishing land use planning and climate change units in RSCN, with a
mandate to mainstream IEM into national and regional land use planning initiatives. The
integration of these two functions within RSCN should contribute to sustain project achievements
in the long term.
*  Improved ecological and socio-economic knowledge of the sites. RSCN      project team
successfully completed all ecological, social and economic assessments in the selected PAs and
SCAs, and hence enhancing the existing knowledge on the biodiversity value of these sites, and
monitoring of biodiversity. The project conducted baselines assessments (ecological and socio-
economic) for five protected areas (Yarmouk, Fifa, Masuda, Qatar and Shoubak) and ten SCAs
(Shuleh, Tal Al Arbaeen, Birket Al-Arayes, Ma'awa, Khayyouf, Swaimah Park and Homret
Maeen, Wadi Bin Hammad, Rahmah, and ABO) originally intended for four protected areas and
seven SCAs.
*  Additional co-financing secured to that anticipated at project design. The project successfully
raised its endowment fund by $2 million as envisaged, prepared two pilot business plans (1 PA
and 1 SCA) and developed four strategic business development plans (2 PAs and 2 SCAs).
Moreover, despite the global financial crisis and associated limitations in funding, the project
achieved its intended co-financing targets. Whilst some agencies reduced the originally envisaged
co-financing amount, RSCN was able to secure new sources of co-financing, in addition to the
land set asides estimated at $120M.
(ii) Establishing a network of integrated ecosystem management for protected areas and special
conservation areas in the Jordan Rift Valley.
Rating: Satisfactory
* A total of 3 Protected Areas out of the 4 originally planned in the PAD have been legally
designated under the project. Moreover, whereas the PAD specifies that the project would
15


﻿establish 7 SCAs, the project has been opportunistic in facilitating the establishment of 10 SCAs.
Biodiversity is now better conserved in the 3 designated PAs and the 10 SCAs, with the
consolidation and validation of Management Plans which were prepared through participatory
consultations with local communities.
The project introduced in Jordan the concept of Special Conservation Areas (SCAs). The SCAs
are a new concept to Jordan and represent a departure from more conventional notion of protected
sites. SCAs are locally based management structures developed for integrating community action
with the land-use planning, and in the network are generally smaller sites, and as such they play
specific ecological roles, and help through the implementation of sustainable land use practices to
ensure the ecological connectivity along the JRV. Besides, the establishment of SCAs offers an
innovative management alternative to PAs towards a more community based and private sector
based management model to conservation. Like the PA management plans, the Community-
Driven Conservation Plans prepared under the project embody the principles of IEM. With the
establishment of 10 SCAs, situated in different habitat types, the project improved the ecological
connectivity along the existing network of PAs in the JRV.
* The Project established three protected areas (Qatar, Fifa, and Yarmouk) and set up important
groundwork to facilitate the designation of Shoubak in the near future. The project
successfully designated three conventional protected areas and was able to operationalize two. A
set of socio economic activities and initiatives were developed for each protected area based on
participatory consultations. The designation file for the Shoubak protected area was transferred to
RSCN before project closure and RSCN will continue to work towards ensuring the designation
of the site in collaboration with local communities, as well as in trying to resolve existing
tensions in Qatar to be able to implement in a near future concrete activities on the ground.
Nevertheless, the designation of Shoubak remains a major challenge, although RSCN has been
proactive in working towards the designation of the site. As a matter of fact, RSCN has held more
than 60 community consultations and through the IEM project it has hired rangers and is
supporting local community initiatives implemented in the area which are of benefit to the locals.
Furthermore, the IEM has launched a new strategy for the development of tourism as an incentive
to gain local awareness and support, and an ecotourism master plan has been prepared to form the
basis for stakeholders' engagement and consultation on the strategic development options for the
region. Thus, it would not be surprising, if in the coming months, Shoubak is officially
designated. The remaining activities left incomplete in the already-designated PAs, as well as
implementation of the management plan for Shoubak once designated, have been financed.
* Through the preparation of PA Management Plans and SCA Community Development Plans,
local communities defined options for alternative livelihoods and sustainable management of
their natural environment and associated biodiversity. Through the preparation of management
plans the economic development of PAs and SCAs is now better integrated with conservation
strategies and social programs, in line with IEM principles. For that purpose, new on-site staff
teams have been recruited and trained and essential infrastructure and equipment were provided
(management stations, staff offices, ranger posts and visitor centers and ecotourism facilities).
* Ecotourism and other socio-economic enterprises developed within and around PAs/SCAs.
Moreover, a set of pilot socio-economic activities were developed for PAs and SCAs based on
local needs and context. These initiatives included activities related to ecotourism, sustainable
agriculture and handicraft but also activities that sometimes went beyond the conventional models
16


﻿such as the first highway rest-house and commercial outlets in community based management
stations.
* Lessons learned from the application of the IEM documented, promoted and institutionalized.
The Project team worked towards the development of a comprehensive knowledge management
system with the preparation of over 50 knowledge products, which included among others, fact
sheets, posters, a picture book, short films as well as a set of brochures for the sites).
67. The achievements of project objectives are evidenced by the successful attainment of the majority of
the outcome indicators presented in Table 2 below:

Rating: Substantial
68. The Project was a stand-alone GEF project with a GEF grant of US$6.15 million and counterpart
funding from partner government agencies and non-governmental organizations.
69. In accordance with the GEF requirements, an incremental cost analysis was carried out during project
preparation. The objective of the incremental cost analysis was to assess the additional costs accruing
to Jordan for protecting its important biodiversity base. The GEF incremental costs were estimated at
US$6.15 million, and additional non-GEF incremental costs were estimated at US$6.55 million, with
a total of US$12.70 million (World Bank 2007). At the time the Project was designed, financial or
economic analyses were not prepared, and no standard cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness parameters
were calculated. As such, these would be difficult to calculate ex-post. However, the following are
used as indicators of the cost effectiveness of the project activities:
70. Project results are achieved within planned timeframe and budget: The GEF funds were fully
disbursed as originally planned: within the originally planned timeframe and per the originally
planned expenditure categories (unaudited final financial report provided by the RSCN), and the
project achieved its intended outcomes and objectives to a satisfactory degree, as detailed in Annex 2,
achieving and exceeding its targets with the level of GEF funding available at appraisal.
71. Cost of establishment of PAs and SCAs and management costs are in line with ranges reported
in literature: Bruner et al (2009) estimated a range for establishing new protected areas up to
US$31,180 per km2, depending on whether land purchase or compensation is required. The study
noted that establishment costs of new protected areas are always higher than the management costs
for existing areas due to potential requirements of land purchases or compensation, as well as definite
need for construction of infrastructure and purchase of equipment.
72. The total project is $6.15 million, of these approximately $3 million were the cost for the
establishment of new PAs and SCAs with an approximate area of 361km2. This translates into an
average cost of establishing new PAs and SCAs of $8,310/Km2, which is in line with the range
determined in literature taking into consideration that no land purchase or compensation is included in
this figure, as all lands were either public lands or land set asides.
73. The project also provided some level of management activities for the PAs and SCAs. The cost of
management activities is approximately $475,000, for an average of 6 years for most PAs and SCAs
(since in many cases the management plans and work with community preceded the official
designation). This translates to about US$219/km2 /year (approximately $2.2/Ha/year) - which is in
line with ranges reported in literature (Bruner et al 2009, James et al 1999).
74. The project resulted in increase of Jordan Rift Valley area under legally established network of
PAs and SCAs by 4%: As a total, the Jordan Rift Valley in Jordan consists of the Northern Ghor,
Middle Ghor and the Southern Ghor areas with a total land area of approximately 30,961 Ha. For the
18


﻿purpose of this project, the Jordan Rift Valley was considered in its broadest terms to include also the
valley floor (i.e. Jordan River Valley, Wadi Araba and its extension up to Aqaba) and the adjacent
highlands parallel to the valley bottom - with a total estimated area of approximately 910,000
hectares. The project has contributed towards establishment of three protected areas with a total land
area of 15,320 Ha and 10 special conservation areas with a total land area of 13,050 Ha. As such, the
project has resulted in increase in 3% in area of Jordan Rift Valley that is part of a legally established
network of PAs and SCAs. It has also set the foundation (including completing needed assessments
and consultations, preparing a management plan and local community development activities) for the
establishment of a fourth protected area (Shoubak PA with an estimated area of 7,740 Ha) - which
will raise the land area under PAs and SCAs to 4%.
75. The significance of the established PAs and SCAs is higher when considering the vegetation
representation: the project led to increase in vegetation cover types under integrated ecosystem
management, such as the deciduous oak (increase from 0% to 3.65%), and mudflat and saline
vegetation (increase from less than 1% to almost 4% each) that were not previously reflected in
Jordan's national protected area network.
76. The project generated considerable co-financing: Project co-financing of US$6.55 million was
expected during project appraisal from RSCN, JOHUD, IUCN, enhanced productivity program,
MOE, and MOTA. Not all of the originally envisaged co-financing came through (e.g. the enhanced
productivity program closed by time project activities were in full swing), nevertheless the project
managed to leverage considerable co-financing. In 2012, the co-financing was estimated at US$3.5
million. In addition the project successfully leveraged additional resources, e.g. the MOTA provided
resources to support the special conservation areas such as the Umm Qais complex (estimated in kind
at US$24,000), rest area in Wadi Bin Hammad (estimated in kind contribution at US$250,000), and
the Dead Sea Panorama (estimated in kind contribution at US$360,000). Table 3 below details the
estimated additional resources for PAs and SCAs.

﻿77. The project resulted in a number of catalytic activities: These included:
a.   Mainstreaming of climate change, land use planning and community development into
core RSCN work. This is an important byproduct of the project given that RSCN is one of the
largest local NGOs with the official mandate to manage protected areas in Jordan. The shift
from strictly conservation focus to working with local communities was especially noted by the
project and the RSCN staff with whom the ICR team met.
b.   Leveraging additional resources for community needs: The SCAs and the PAs are located in
areas with increased poverty and some in identified pockets of poverty areas (e.g. Fifa protected
area). The communities have benefited not only in terms of protection and use of the natural
resources, but also in terms of leveraging funds both for biodiversity conservation needs (the
project was successful in bridging local cooperatives in some of the SCA areas with the GEF
Small Grants Program in Wadi Bin Hammad; Tal Al Arbaeen; and Fifa) but also their own
community needs (e.g. the project supported the local community cooperatives by providing
premises and technical assistance. This allowed these cooperatives to better support their
members and to reach out to other agencies and organizations for support with technical
assistance from the project). The project activities helped highlight the needs of these
communities, also resulting in increased attention to their needs from both the Government and
private sector (e.g. the Arab Potash Company director visited a community event, and
committed approximately USD 500 thousand for the needs of local communities).
c.   Creating champions in local communities, private sector and government agencies: the
project was successful in creating champions for continued integrated ecosystem management
in PAs and SCAs among the local communities, and private sector and government agencies.
For example, the Dead Sea Company provided land set asides and integrated the SCA into
their land use maps. The Ministry of Environment relied on guidelines prepared by the project
for the approval of SCAs and which remain in their use following completion of project
activities. Reliance on PA staff from local communities and training creates local champions
close to the PAs within the local communities. The SCA concept also proved popular among
local communities keen on safeguarding the local environmental resources with local
organizations mobilizing to establish 6 additional SCAs beyond those envisioned by the project
(files for 6 additional SCAs were submitted for MOE for approval).
78. Based on the above, it is possible to conclude that the implementation of this project was: (i)
Efficient in terms of leveraging GEF funds and (ii) Cost-effective in terms of achieving the PDO.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement ofPDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
79. Based on the combination of substantial relevance of objectives, design and implementation;
satisfactory achievement of both parts of the PDO; and substantial efficiency; the overall outcome
rating is Moderately Satisfactory.
80. The project was able to achieve most of its set targets and to generate important and significant
outcomes as mentioned above, and with more details provided in Annex 2. A wealth of research
results has been produced about the fauna and flora in the project sites, and strong collaborative
partnerships have been established with local research institutions. Moreover, long term involvement
and collaboration has been reinforced in project sites with the signature of a number of MOUs with
20


﻿relevant Ministries (MOE, MoPIC and the Ministry of Municipal Affairs (MOMA)), the JVA, as well
as the Development Zone Authorities on issues of common interest in working towards sustainability
of the sites. The management and planning capacity of the parks has been upgraded with the
preparation of management plans, the recruitment of locally hired rangers and the construction of
necessary basic infrastructures.
81. Minor shortcomings have resulted from two issues: (i) Project efficiency; which stagnated in years 2
and 3 without a Project Manager to lead staff; and (ii) Changes in country conditions and sectoral
context; which prompted minor deviations from activities as designed during preparation. These
shortcomings may possibly have been prevented if the project would have been granted a one-year
extension. Shoubak was not designated by the end of the project, and only 2 out of the 4 PAs were
operational (Fifa and Yarmouk). Although Qatar PA has been legally designated, it is in the early
stages of management plan implementation. Furthermore, the necessary basic infrastructures were
constructed just on time before project closure, and these delays and the lack of a project extension
has meant that a lot of activities have not resumed on the ground yet, especially with regards to
ecotourism and the operationalization of related activities as established in the management plans.
While, the project has established a solid foundation for the long-term conservation of the JRV, a lot
of the project outcomes should be more perceptible in the coming months when activities resume on
the ground.
82. The GEO also overstates what a project of this scale can achieve, 'restore the ecological integrity of
the JRV'. Hence, despite a considerable number of project achievements and the likelihood that a lot
of the project outcomes will be more visible in the coming years, it is too premature to assert that all
project objectives have been attained and a lot will depend on the developments in the coming months
and the consolidation of project achievements. Hence, for all these reasons, the rating at this stage is
deemed to be Moderately Satisfactory.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
83. Poverty and gender impacts: The protected areas and the special conservation areas are located in
rural areas that are often characterized by high incidence of poverty and high unemployment rates.
The project's contribution to the livelihood of the local communities has also demonstrated tangible
benefits. The project aimed to ensure that the communities perceive that the projects work not only
for the benefit of 'conservation' but also that they see direct benefits to themselves. This aspect has
been highlighted in several conversations with local communities.
84. The construction/rehabilitation of social infrastructures as well as the promotion of income generating
activities resulted in concrete improvements in the living conditions of the local populations. The
project has entailed the recruitment of over 30 rangers for the management of the sites. Furthermore,
a number of small livelihood options and nature enterprises have been launched in some of the project
sites, with for instance small cooperatives having benefited from training in soap and mushroom
production as well as aquaculture, and now starting to work towards the marketing of these products.
In particular, women are benefiting since they are directly involved in several of the income
generating activities. Moreover, as was raised by some of the project beneficiaries in Fifa, prior to the
project there was no interest in the region, however now they noted an influx of private sector
investments. Finally, the development of ecotourism in the sites should in the long term offer a
window of opportunities for the economic development of the targeted sites.
21


﻿85. As mentioned above, the total number of beneficiaries that were estimated from community
development work by the project is over 66,000, half of whom are estimated to be women. This
estimate is based on the number of beneficiaries from partnership and socio-economic initiatives
carried out by the project in the vicinity of PAs and SCAs, and include members of local and women
cooperatives who carried out the initiatives, users of the infrastructure developed by the project,
visitors to the Umm Qais center (estimated at 10,000) and Forestry Department Staff (estimated at
750). However, this is a conservative number as it does not take into consideration results from the
catalytic activities (those initiatives that were supported by other agencies as a result of raising
awareness on these communities due to establishment of PAs and SCAs).
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
86. The project activities have resulted in the mainstreaming of three new units within the structure of the
RSCN: Climate Change, Land Use, and Community Development. The project has also made
important contribution towards changing RSCN's approach towards the establishment of protected
areas and special conservation areas. In the past, RSCN used to apply a more scientific focus on
biodiversity and conservation through scientific and ecological assessments. One of the main lesson
learnt which the ICR team heard from many RSCN and project staff, is the shift towards working
together with local communities through the application of participatory processes to mainstream the
ownership feeling of the sites before proceeding with the official designation of a protected area or an
SCA.
87. One of the specific aims of the project has been to increase local capacity for conservation of the
sites, and towards that end the project has achieved the following concrete levels of institutional
strengthening: (i) a better management structure in the sites with management plans, infrastructure
and by providing the minimum essential tools and staffing, targeted training of protected area
management and rangers, setting up the systems for monitoring and follow up, (ii) initiation of
partnerships with the key partners for collaboration in the management and development of the sites,
(iii) institutionalizing the mechanisms of involvement of the communities in the management of the
sites. All in all, given the scope and funds of the project, these activities should be seen as a key first
step and pilot demonstration towards improved protected area management at the national level.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
88. There are several encouraging signs that the project's activities and outcomes are generating catalytic
effects. A major outcome has been the introduction of the SCA concept which is new for Jordan, and
which through the project has fuelled an increasing interest from local communities who see SCAs as
an opportunity for local development but also to ensure the sustainability of their natural
environment. As a matter of fact, the ICR mission was informed both by RSCN and the MOE of an
increasing demand by local communities in the designation of these areas. Moreover, this has also
encouraged within the existing SCAs more fostered and formal organization of local community
groups, which has been facilitated by the project and the construction of needed infrastructure
including buildings for the management of the SCAs.
89. Furthermore, an unintended positive outcome, already mentioned above, is that project investments
and the designation of SCAs and PAs has attracted the interest of outside investors and agencies in
some of the sites, which was non-existent prior to the Project.
90. RSCN through the project, has also reinforced with the creation of a land use unit within its quarters,
its capacity to influence larger land-use activities and the integration of biodiversity conservation
principles through the creation of SCAs but also through the implementation of additional activities
22


﻿which were not originally planned under the scope of the project including (i) the preparation of an
ecological sensitivity maps which will be used by MOMA and to identify potential future SCAs; (ii)
the preparation of guidelines for wind energy project, particularly since the JRV is an important bird
area; and (iii) the preparation of clear guidelines and criteria for Environmental Impact Assessments
(EIA).
23


﻿4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate.
91. The Risk that the PDO outcomes will not be sustained is assessed as moderate. The project has
achieved solid outcomes which have enhanced the local capacity to conserve the ecological integrity
of the JRV. Nevertheless, the broader development patterns in and around the PAs and SCAs could
jeopardize the sustainability of the project.
92. In addition, the established PAs / SCAs may be overshadowed by the Red Sea-Dead Sea Water
Conveyance Project should it go ahead. This refers in particular to the prospect of an ambitious water
transfer scheme between the Red Sea and the Dead Sea, which would be to traverse two of the
project's intended sites (Qatar and Fifa), and for which the feasibility studies have been funded by the
World Bank. The Jordan IEM project has contributed towards the environmental assessment studies
for the Red Sea - Dead Sea Water Conveyance Project - particularly to the baseline survey. The ICR
team will also share the ICR report with the concerned team at the Bank. Moreover, this identified
risk is mitigated by increased cooperation between Bank projects and within relevant agencies in the
government of Jordan.
93. Political Instability. Political instability in the region and neighboring conflicts may deter
international tourists from visiting Jordan. This could have a spillover effect on tourism trends in the
country, and as such on the economic sustainability of the sites, and could jeopardize their capacity to
exploit the ecotourism potential of the sites.
24


﻿5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
94. The project initiation coincided with global, regional and national circumstances that significantly
changed the realities on the ground. These included: financial crisis (2008); Jordan's decentralization
efforts which resulted in establishment of new regional authorities in the JRV; the Arab Spring and
regional conflict. These changes required the project to adapt, and one of the key strengths of the
design was that it had inherent flexibility that allowed the project to adapt to the changing political
economy without the need to modify the outcomes and outputs of the project. The project design also
took into consideration lessons learnt from earlier projects, including building strategy on sound
scientific information; stakeholder involvement in PAs designation; and community participation in
PAs and the role of economic incentives.
95. QALP-2 review acknowledged the following strengths of the design: good explanation of issues and
challenges in the appraisal report, the demonstrated good commitment by Jordan to improve
environmental management, the choice of RSCN, the connections with the JOHUD and other NGOs
for the community development activities, as well as the linkages with the JVA for the purpose of
influencing larger land-use decisions in biodiversity-friendly ways.
96. In terms of design flaws, the project design underestimated the risks associated with land ownership
issues. In addition, as identified in QALP-2: the design had an insufficient incorporation of regionally
driven political risks into the project design; and lack of discussion of alternative approaches.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
97. The project was supervised by two task team leaders over its lifetime, both based in Washington DC.
The World Bank staff provided regular (generally twice per year) supervision inputs during Project
implementation, with additional support from the Cairo and Beirut offices for procurement and
financial management issues as needed. Findings and recommendations from supervision missions
were documented in detailed aide memoires throughout Project implementation. The Project
benefited from constructive suggestions from Bank's mid-term review.
98. Bank supervision missions were staffed with specialists covering the main subject matters, who
provided regular guidance and support to the client during implementation. The Bank supervision
teams were proactive in proposing remedial actions to help RSCN make up for the startup delays in
project implementation and pending issues, and supporting the client in aligning the project to the
priority needs and the changing context. Moreover, the missions consistently raised the main issues as
they emerged - including: the shortcomings in the general management of the project in the first
years of implementation, the absence of a safeguard specialist and the need for restructuring and
project extension. Next steps matrices were prepared in the Aide-M6moire that clearly summarized
the main outstanding issues to be addressed.
99. The QALP-2 identified weaknesses in Bank supervision related to budget, time in the field, attention
from management, and candor and realism of ISR reporting. In addition, there was delay in notifying
the project that the requested one year extension was not granted. However, it should be noted that
25


﻿Bank supervision was instrumental in helping the PMU to turn around the project, after the MTR,
from its problem project status with low disbursement and slow activities, to achieving all the
intended outcomes and the full disbursement within the initially planned time. Also, the supervision
team went above and beyond in assisting the PMU during the final months after it became clear that
the extension was not granted. The turnaround of the project and the timely completion of its
activities would not have been possible without the dedication and concerted effort of the Bank
supervision team including the TTL, and the procurement and financial management specialists.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
100. Taking into consideration the quality at entry and the quality of supervision, the overall Bank
performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Bank provided significant technical guidance
and support to the client during project implementation, which has contributed to the overall
successful project outcome.
5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
101. The Government of Jordan showed excellent commitment to this project embracing the participatory
protected area management approach and integrating it into its national biodiversity strategy. Over
the lifetime of the project, the Government demonstrated commitment through regular follow-up and
support from the relevant government agencies, including:
i.   MOE who supported the establishment of SCAs (relying on instructions number 4719 /
2005 allowing the Minister of Environment to designate SCAs), and prepared and
submitted for approval the designation files for the PAs (up to 3 times for the Shoubak
PA which however ended up not being designated);
ii.  MOPIC in its coordination role provided the chairmanship for the project steering
committee as well as follow up with the Ministry of Interior;
iii.  MOTA in its support in the implementation of the 2011-2015 tourism development
strategy, which emphasized the need to improve opportunities for local tourism and
accessibility of the Kingdom's natural assets to the general public, was particularly
supportive of the projects pilots in introducing local collaborative arrangements for
improving the sustainable management of recreational sites; and
iv.   Cooperation with the JVA was instrumental with regards to mainstreaming biodiversity
conservation into land use planning and the IEM approach into its master plan.
v.   Finally, it must be noted the JVA, the Dead Sea Development Zone Company and the
MOTA provided considerable cofinancing for this project (mostly in facilities (Umm
Qais, Wadi Bin Hammad rest area, and Dead Sea Panorama) and land set asides for PAs
and SCAs (JVA). These agencies have also been participating in regular project Steering
Committee meetings.
102. There were also shortcomings, including: (i) high turnover in project Steering Committee meetings
which reduced their effectiveness; (ii) delays associated with designation of PAs due to Government
moratorium on management plans for Fifa and Qatar until the Red Sea- Dead Sea Water
Conveyance Study was completed and alignment was clarified; (iii) more support could have been
provided to the RSCN/PMU in reaching out to the new regional development agencies following
26


﻿the decentralization process which changed the agency landscape in the Jordan Valley and pushed
the IEM to deal and bring on board new players.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
103. The leadership, cohesion, and professional skills displayed by the PMU in the last 3 years of
project life were integral to the successful implementation of the Project and full disbursement
of the Grant amount. The PMU effectively took this project on board and supported it through
management, various departments, and through their mandate and expertise. The PMU was
adequately staffed with most of the personnel recommended, yet it had no dedicated safeguard
specialist in the last years of implementation. Progress reports were submitted in a timely manner
and were well structured. The Implementing Agency successfully:
i.   Lead the designation of 3 PAs and 10 SCAs in a changing political and economic climate
ii.  Maneuvered to align with the ongoing changes in the institutional landscape
(decentralization from a centrally planned JVA to regional development agencies) that
significantly challenged one of the key outcomes of the project and chose the correct
strategy to bring the new players on board;
iii.  Substituted Jabal Masuda site by the Shoubak site considering it represented the targeted
ecosystem/habitat, and accepted to take on the designation file for Shoubak following
project closure to continue to work towards its designation in collaboration with local
communities;
iv.   Mobilized important co-financing to the project from different sources; and
v.   Mainstreamed the climate change, community development, and land use units during the
3rd year of the project to ensure full integration into RSCN organizational chart.
104. Shortcomings included:
1.   Delay in modifying the reporting lines of the PMU from the Head of the Research
Department to the Director General, which allowed faster decision making to the PMU;
11.  Delay in executing the assessments that were sole contracted to RSCN;
Iii.  Weaknesses in implementing monitoring and evaluation for the project.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
105. On a whole, the performance of the Borrower is deemed Moderately Satisfactory, in recognition of
the moderately satisfactory performance of the Government and the implementing agency. The
project was a pioneering pilot, which managed during the latter years to turn around its performance
and meet, and in some instances surpass, its set objectives. Moreover, RSCN has taken
important, positive steps to follow up with the project objectives and thereby to sustain and
consolidate Project achievements.
27


﻿6. Lessons Learned
106. Readiness for implementation is key to effective start up and participatory planning needs to
be started at the preparatory stage. Considering project performance stagnated in the first 3 years
of implementation with the absence of a Project Manager, it proves critical to allow for effective
start-up upon effectiveness, to ensure the necessary institutional set up is in place and a fully
operational team available. Moreover, given the importance of the participatory planning process in
this project, engaging in broad-based consultation with national, state and local beneficiaries and
stakeholders at the time of project preparation as well as a detailed socio-political assessment of the
areas would have greatly facilitated project implementation to identify potential sources of risks and
conflict and mitigate them before engaging in the establishment of PAs.
107. The project demonstrated non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as RSCN with strong
technical capacity, a clear mandate, and proven experience in nature conservation make it a
unique candidate to implement this type of project. Hence, a unique feature of this project was
the fact that the implementing agency was an NGO. However, it must be noted that RSCN, is the
largest environmental organization in Jordan, and as such has been granted a special mandate in
Jordan to manage and control the national system of protected areas, which guarantees a certain level
of stability in the project.
108. The development of sustainable socio-economic and conservation projects as an entry point to
strengthening relationships with local communities prior to Protected Area designation. This
has been a lessons learned for RSCN, which in the case of Shoubak is currently working on
developing ecotourism for the benefit of local communities in an attempt to gain communities trust
to subsequently designate the site as a PA. A similar approach is being applied in the Badia
Ecosystems and Livelihoods Project (P127861), where engaging on the ground with communities
and working on the development of an ecotourism corridor is regarded as a first step to work
towards future designation of some of the sites.
109. Identifying priority needs in the targeted areas as parallel activities to finance in order to gain
community support for the designation of the sites. RSCN funded several infrastructural needs
that were demanded by local communities during stakeholder consultations which facilitated the
adhesion of local stakeholders to the project. This included for instance the restoration of a heritage
Mosque in Yarmouk PA as well as the construction of 10 bus stops in Fifa PA. This type of
initiatives coupled with consultations and community involvement build a sense of ownership to
local communities that not only contributes to engagement during the period of the project but also
beyond the project's life.
110. Need to address land tenure complexities at the time of project design. A key issue the PAD
failed to identify is the sensitivity of land ownership in Jordan. This to some extent delayed project
implementation, since for instance in Shoubak, Bedouin herders who have claims on tribal land
which adjoin the proposed national protected area feared that designation of the PA would restrict
their access to those lands or that they might lose the economic opportunity ascribed to those lands.
A detailed analysis of land tenure of the potential protected areas during project design, could have
provided valuable insights on the socio-political complexities on the ground, and may have been a
warning on the need to go the extra mile in gaining the trust of local communities before engaging in
the establishment of PAs.
111. Setting-up a results-oriented M&E system that serve as a dynamic management tool, with
precise objective and indicators that adequately reflect results achieved on the ground. The
results framework could have been adjusted with a formal restructuring to ensure it adequately
28


﻿reflects results achieved on the ground and ensure the integration of socio-economic indicators that
adequately reflect project performance and changes in country conditions and sectoral context.
Moreover, considering the social and economic objectives of the project, indicators should be
included to measure the economic activity/ improvements on wellbeing in the project areas, or in any
case the number of project beneficiaries. Furthermore, it could be pertinent in projects using the
IEM, to select a number of indicators that can be monitored by community representatives to create
a feedback from beneficiaries to the decision makers. Finally, given the delays in the completion of
project baseline measurements which did not occur until the MTR, defining project baselines prior to
project implementation could facilitate data collection and M&E design.
112. Ensure alignment of the GEO and the PDO. The GEO tends to have sweeping objectives which
envision global impacts from localized activities. In the case of this project, the GEO described the
higher level objectives that could be achieved in the longer term (requiring longer time frame than
the six years period of this project). The project rather puts in place a set of important
accomplishments (capacity building, awareness raising, management plans, ecological knowledge,
etc.) and partnerships which set the ground towards that longer term objective. The PDO defined
more realistic and grounded project objectives. Future efforts should work towards ensuring the
PDO and GEO are complimentary, since achieving both can be difficult to deliver.
113. The qualifications of the project teams and their adequate staffing and presence on the
ground, as well as their close and regular contact with beneficiaries promote confidence and
credibility of the project and its institutions. RSCN presence on the field, and holding regular
consultation was a cornerstone of the project success and proved critical to gain communities trust
and support. Moreover, the importance of having a competent and motivated Project Manager in
place was also instrumental in this project, while his leadership allowed efficient and timely decision
making and key to fully deliver on project objectives as well as to ensure the GEF grant amounts are
fully disbursed.
114. Broader development patterns in and around the PAs and SCAs plans/projects may delay
project implementation. Development patterns in and around the PAs and SCAs delayed project
implementation. This was the case for instance with the feasibility studies related to the Red Sea -
Dead Sea Water Conveyance Study, funded by the Bank, which delayed the designation of Qatar
and Fifa PA.
115. The project demonstrated that a conjunction of mechanisms and initiatives tailored to the local
conditions and context specific demands is needed to engage communities in conservation
management. The project effectively combined decentralized, participatory governance
mechanisms, private sector participation, stakeholder education and training, as well as
dissemination of results and tailored management plans and the identification of economic
opportunities through participatory processes and in accordance to the natural environment.

﻿Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component 1 - Assessment and Planning for Integrated Ecosystem Management.
1. The majority of activities falling under this component have been completed. The only output that is
yet to be finalized is the adoption of the land use guidelines for the protected areas by the Ministry of
Municipal Affairs (MOMA) and for the instructions on SCAs by the MOE.
2. Baseline studies and economic assessments. RSCN conducted all baseline studies and ecological,
social and economic assessments for designated PAs and SCAs, including for the originally selected
sites which ended up not being designated (e.g. Shoubak and Jabal Masuda). These assessments
formed the basis for site management and designation, and were used to shape the management plans
of the PAs and SCAs.
3. Land use guidelines and maps. Under this component land use guidelines and maps were prepared
and incorporated into the Jordan Rift Valley Master Plan of the JVA, and into the Master Plans of the
regional bodies designated following the decentralization of authority, including the Jordan Dead Sea
Company, the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Area (ASEZA) and Petra Special Economic Area
(PTSEA).
4. Awareness and capacity building programs. A Training Needs Assessment (TNA) was carried out for
project staff and stakeholders. Using process-oriented learning methodology training was provided to
all relevant project staff and stakeholders on sites. The main themes covered included: environmental
education, ecology, conservation & law enforcement, local community development, protected area
management and ecotourism.
5. Other contributions. Under this component contributions which were not originally planned but
eligible under the Grant, included: (i) the full integration of the Land Use Unit established as part of
the IEM project into the RSCN organizational chart; (ii) the conception of an Ecological Sensitive
Map Area to be used by the JVA and the MOMA to inform land use planning outside PAs; and (iii)
land use guidelines on wind energy project.

Component 2 - Development of a network of biodiversity conservation sites, embodying the
principles of integrated ecosystem management.
6. Protected Areas. To date, a network of three PAs (Fifa, Yarmouk, and Qatar PAs) out of the four
originally envisaged were legally established. Shoubak PA, which was originally chosen as an
alternative site for Jabal Masuda PA, was not designated due to continued reluctance of local
communities. The designation file for the Shoubak PA was transferred to the RSCN to continue to
implement post GEF-project intervention (with donor support). In the case of Qatar PA, it must be
noted that although the site was legally established, the PA is not fully operational due to remaining
tensions with the local communities.
7. Special Conservation Areas. With regards to the designation of SCAs, to date 10 SCAs were
designated out of the 7 originally planned, and conservation plans were prepared. Moreover, the
Mission was informed by the MOE, that requests for the establishment of 6 additional SCAs were
received.
8. Management Plans. The Management Plans for all three PAs were prepared and approved, and an
interim management plan for Shoubak PA was prepared. All legally designated SCAs also have their
respective management plans in place.
9. Infrastructure and construction works. The buildings for the sites' management units were
constructed. The Mission had the opportunity to visit construction works which were underway in
Yarmouk and Fifa PAs, and in Aqaba Bird Observatory and Wadi Bin Hammad SCA (in June 2013).
10. Eco-tourism and other socio-economic enterprises developed within and around the protected areas.
All sites identified as eligible for ecotourism had a marketing strategy developed, and some sites had
ecotourism facilities. Moreover, other economic enterprises in place included: soap, mushrooms,
shops and restaurants shops in visitor center/management units.
11. Other contributions. A sub-component on knowledge management (KM) activities eligible under the
Grant was further developed to the project design in the last year. Products developed included: (1)
fact sheets (climate change, land use, community based organizations and Aqaba Bird Observatory);
three case studies (a new paradigm for PAs, IEM, and community based organizations); leaflets and
posters for each site and program; a Jordan Valley "coffee table" book to be sold by Wild Jordan; and
videos. Moreover a RSCN-wide knowledge mapping exercise was carried out, to ensure sustainability
of KM activities associated with the GEF project.

Component 3: Integrated Assessments of Climate Change Impacts on Biodiversity Conservation in
the Jordan Rift Valley Developed to Support Conservation Planning and Implementation.
12. Work on this component relied on collaboration with the Jordan Meteorology Department and the
Ministry of Environment. This component aimed to climate proof the protected area network and to
mainstream climate change considerations into the management plans. In order to do so, studies were
first prepared on impact of climate change on vegetation, fire and run off and on selected indicators
species from different PAs. The next step required the Project to consider how to integrate this
information into their work. They carried out higher resolution models and chose 4 PAs (Yarmouk
and Shuleh, Mujib, Dana, and Fifa) for further work, and adaptation plots were built. Furthermore, a
report on local communities' adaptive capacity to climate change was prepared. For mainstreaming,
the Project collaborated with the MOMA through the national exercise of land use analysis of the
whole country. An important collaboration now with the preparation of the sensitivity map which will
be used to influence land use approaches. Other element of influence is policy dialogue done through
the guidelines and capacity building, to learn how to incorporate a decision support arrangements
system to make better decisions on resource allocation and planning taking into consideration

Component 4: Sustainable Financing Mechanisms Strengthened.
13. The sustainable financing mechanisms relied on three pillars: increasing the RSCN endowment fund
that would contribute towards the core operational expenses of the newly created PAs and SCAs;
identifying business plans for the newly created PAs and SCAs, and private sector engagement to
increase financing sustainability.
14. The RSCN assigned a higher committee that followed specifically on the endowment fund. A US$2
million increase in endowment fund was secured through USAID. In addition, collaboration was
fostered with the private sector, Housing Bank for Investment, with whom the RSCN managed
fundraising. A number of income generating activities were identified in the business plans (one
business plan prepared for Yarmouk PA and one for Homret Maeen SCA, the rest had tourism
strategies whenever relevant (6). However, the plans relied on tourism (local and international) for
income generation. Agreements with the private sector included for example: arrangement with
Movenpick Hotel in Aqaba to advertise the ABO and provide shuttles for hotel guests to go there;
work with the Dead Sea Company; and the agreements with local companies (soap, mushrooms). In
addition, at the time of ICR report preparation discussions were underway on concessions for camp
sites in Yarmouk and Wadi Bin Hammad.

Component 5: Project Management, Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation.
15. The project underwent a number of staff rotations that impacted the progress of the project over the
implementation of the project (including changes in project management, lack of safeguard specialist
since 2011). A number of functions were integrated into the RSCN, including the climate change
unit, land use unit, and community development function. As part of the project, 12 project steering
committee meetings were held, and minutes and summary of meetings were drafted. Participants were
not requested to sign on minutes, which according to some of the participants weakened the
implementation of the project steering committee meetings' recommendations, particularly when
follow up was required by some of the agencies attending the meeting. Monitoring and evaluation
tables were adjusted periodically to allow better fit.

1) Project design
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The project idea was conceived in the beginning of 2004, however, its date of effectiveness was not
before mid-2007. The overall project goal was to further mainstream the conservation of biodiversity
using the ecosystems approach into the land-use planning and management frameworks across the Rift
Valley. Upon the project effectiveness date, several components of the project were in need for review as
they had changed during the course of the project preparation phase driven by the rapid changes in legal,
economic and institutional frameworks in Jordan. This included some of the project specific outputs (e.g.
change in project stakeholders' and project activity pricing such as construction of facilities).
The project design and preparation period was very long mainly due to donor's bureaucracy and
43


﻿procedures, causing a significant shortcoming to respond to the accelerating change in the project
implementation environment.
This shortcoming included some very critical changes in the governance, institutional and legal set up of
the Jordan Rift Valley as a result of major decisions taken by the government on the privatization
program and the emergence of key independent agencies governing major components of the project
intervention area.
During the first three years of the project the WB TTL was well informed of such dramatic changes and
pressing challenges, however, no actions were proposed in response, including project restructuring.
Attempts by the second TTL and RSCN in year four to introduce such restructuring were rejected by the
World Bank management, justified by stating that project restructuring will only need to take place six
months before its termination. A full proposal for restructuring by the project team was put together upon
the project midterm, however, was fully wasted as a result of the World Bank rejection (please see project
midterm reports). By year two of the project, JVA was no longer the main agency responsible for land-
use planning and management across the Rift Valley, and several other special economic zones were
introduced such as; the economic zones commission, the Petra Development and Tourism Regional
Authority (PDTRA), and the Ministry of Municipal Affairs (MOMA) master plan program. RSCN had to
work and negotiate with several new agencies on the same components agreed with JVA upon the project
design, and each of these had its own development agenda associated with little sense of obligation
towards the project implementation.
A second major event which influenced the project design was the Global economic crisis which started
to affect Jordan and the project in 2009. The exponential increase in prices of goods, works and services
caused a serious problem for the project delivery as per the designed components.
The third and most influential development affecting the overall project delivery, and in particular in
regard to component two addressing protected areas, was the socio-political instability described by the
Arab Spring. The capability of the government and RSCN to negotiate the establishment of new protected
areas declined severely as the country was facing much bigger challenges and priorities (in their view)
than protected areas and biodiversity conservation. This caused total paralysis in component two for over
two years which required a much more structured response from the World Bank in calling for and/or
accepting a project restructuring exercise.
There was a real need to revisit the project design on the outcome and components level right after the
first year (late 2008) and upon mid-term (late 2010) of its implementation. Because this did not take
place, the project continued with a serious design shortcoming, leading to serious implementation
impediments.
2) Project implementation modality
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Arrangements for project implementation had serious weaknesses by design. The project was governed by
a steering committee chaired by the Ministry of Environment and comprising members from initially
seven more agencies representing the key partners involved in the project implementation upon its
inception.
Due to institutional changes which took place in the governance framework for the Rift Valley, RSCN
proposed and adopted a restructuring of the steering committee to include all the new organizations who
had become key stakeholders for the project. This included PDTRA, DZC, MOMA and others.
The changes in the legal frameworks of the Rift Valley significantly reduced MOE's ability to effectively
lead the steering committee. By year three of the project, there was a real need to visit the institutional
arrangements for the project with the aim to reconfirm the commitment and active involvement in its
44


﻿implementation and support. This was an action also proposed by the project PMU to the World Bank
upon mid-term.
On the other hand, the mandate of the steering committee was never obligatory to all its members by
design, it was merely a technical communication group/platform with little decision making powers. The
majority of the members of the committee were of technical capacity and always avoided making
commitments on behalf of their respective agencies.
Upon inception, the project was managed by a director who reported to the Director of Conservation at
RSCN, thus allowing limited space for decision making and effective communication with stakeholders
and project partners. A change to this was made by RSCN starting from year four of the project, where
the Director was in direct line of reporting with RSCN DG. This paved the way for significant
improvement in project delivery pace and ability to be adaptive and responsive in management.
Nonetheless, this arrangement was still not effective enough when it came to the implementation of the
SSS contracts assigned to RSCN in the project design. The PMU was essentially contracting its employer
for such contracts. A rather superficial modality/solution was introduced to mitigate such issues by asking
the MOE to sign the SSS contracts on behalf of the project with RSCN. This malfunctioning remedy
caused serious problems for the PMU in the monitoring and control of the contracts, and in one case led
to the early termination of the large 250 K socio-economic contract with Wild Jordan, thus leading to
serious internal issues for the PMU relationship with key RSCN departments. The PMU ended up directly
managing the contract activities/budget which led to an overload of its administrative and technical
capacities.
3) Project global environment objective and development objective
Rating: Satisfactory
The project was designed to contribute to safeguarding the ecological integrity of the Rift Valley
primarily through the application of the principles of integrated ecosystem management into the master
plan of the Jordan Rift Valley along with the establishment of a new approach and network of protected
areas. The project was meant to achieve the above through four main components: influencing the JVA
(and later on other agencies) master plan(s), establishing a new approach and set of protected areas
including the innovative SCA concept, initiating a biodiversity oriented climate change research and
assessments, and adopting a creative approach to financial sustainability mainly through endowment
funds.
RSCN notes that the project was also misperceived or misunderstood to be a typical/conventional
protected areas project which allowed for a significant shortfall in assessing its achievement/progress and
providing sound advice by key partners of the project.
It is RSCN's view that the project went above and beyond its initial intended scope by:
1. Mainstreaming the ecosystem approach and biodiversity conservation into the land use
planning frameworks, processes and plans of five national and regional agencies (DZC,
PDTRA, MOMA, ASEZA, and JVA) rather than just one (JVA) upon inception.
2. Establishing thirteen new protected areas including three conventional ones and ten
SCAs which represent - in the author's view - the new effective approach to PA
establishment and sustainability for Jordan.
3. Developing the biodiversity oriented climate change program in RSCN and nationally.
Initially only intended to undertake baseline assessment for climate change and
biodiversity, the project was able to go all the way to institutionalizing the climate
change program nationally with the Department of Meteorology and within RSCN with
45


﻿the new climate change program imbedded in its new structure as part of the
transformation strategy.
4. Securing the intended additional capital needed for the financial sustainability of the
new programs introduced and enhanced and developing the business planning capacity
of RSCN.
The project was able to deliver fully on its intended scope within the time and cost identified in its design.
4) Project Outcomes
Project outcome 1: Land-use plannin2
Rating: Satisfactory
The key deliverables under this component were the baseline assessments, the development and adoption
of the land use guidelines, the development and adoption of the protected areas policies and the awareness
raising of all key stakeholders involved in the land use planning and management.
The project successfully achieved the baselines assessments (ecological and socio economic) for five
conventional protected areas (Yarmouk, Fifa, Masuda, Qatar and Shoubak) and eleven SCAs (Al Shuleh,
Tal Al Arbaeen, Birket Al-Arayes, Ma'awa, Swaimeh Park and Homret Maeen, Khayyouf, Wadi Bin
Hammad, Rahmah, Hima Layathneh, and ABO) originally intended for four protected areas and seven
SCAs.
The project developed and adopted three biodiversity oriented land use guidelines with MOMA, MOE,
DZC.
The project implemented a comprehensive awareness raising program for all project stakeholders twice -
upon inception and midterm- rather than once as per the project design, in response to the changing
institutional frameworks.
The project successfully supported the development and adoption of the protected areas bylaw and the
SCA regulations by the MOE.
Project outcome 2: Protected areas
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The main deliverables under this component were the establishment and operationalization of four
conventional protected areas and the designation and operationalization of the seven and four SCAs
respectively, the development of a set of socio economic initiatives for local communities including
ecotourism and the documentation of lessons learned.
The project successfully designed three conventional protected areas and was able to operationalize two.
As an adaptive alternative to the shortcomings in the protected areas, the SCA concept and application
was expanded to introduce a very innovative alternative to centrally managed protected areas toward a
more community based and private sector based protected areas management model. RSCN perceives this
to be one of the project's key innovative contributions advising the future of the national protected areas
program.
A set of socio economic activities and initiatives were developed for each protected area, often using
creative ideas never used before by RSCN or nationally (e.g. the first highway rest-house, the commercial
outlets in CBOs management stations), in addition to the expansion on the conventional models of
46


﻿ecotourism, sustainable agriculture and handicrafts.
A comprehensive knowledge management system was developed and over 50 knowledge products were
delivered (e.g. case studies, infographic presentations, short films, powerpoint presentations, brochures,
posters, fact sheets and a picture book).
Project outcome 3: Climate change
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The main deliverables under this component were to establish a knowledge base on climate change
impacts on key biodiversity elements, the development of expected future scenarios, the identification of
policy and management options incorporated into PAs and SCAs planning and management and the
dissemination of the assessment results.
The project was fully successful in achieving all intended outputs and even went a long way further in the
development of technical and institutional frameworks on climate change and biodiversity. This
comprises; the establishment of the stand-alone climate change and biodiversity unit at RSCN as part of
its core function identified and adopted in the new transformation strategy, the development of a national
platform for communication and coordination of climate change and biodiversity with the JMD and
MOE, the development of a set of adaptation strategies within and outside protected areas, the
implementation of a series of pilot adaption projects in select sites, and the development of a long term
program development strategy with a set of new project concepts and proposals.
Project outcome 4: Sustainable financin2
Rating: Satisfactory
The main deliverables under this component include the increase of the endowment fund capital by two
million USD, the development of site based business plans, the implementation of a set of socio economic
initiatives for local communities including ecotourism, and the assurance of adequate co-financing by
project partners.
The project successfully achieved the two million USD addition to the endowment fund, prepared two
pilot business plans for one PA and one SCA and developed four strategic business development plans for
four more areas (2 PAs and 2 SCAs).
The project was able to incorporate the new units and programs into the RSCN strategic business
planning process, and they became part of RSCN's annual financial planning exercise.
The project co-financing achieved its intended targets with some agencies co-financing reduced and other
increased. See the co-financing table.
This component -along with component two- was faced with the challenges related to the national and
global financial crisis from 2008 onwards, with government direct financial support nearly vanishing.
Further, from 2011 onwards, political instability led to a severe decline in tourism numbers to PAs and
SCAs.
Project outcome 5: Project mana2ement
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The PMU was fully established during the first quarter of the project. It included the project director, the
procurement specialist, the accounting officer and the M&E specialist.
The first year of the project represented a very good start with focus given to baseline surveys and initial
detailed assessment and launch of project interventions. At the end of year one, the project director
resigned and it took RSCN over a year to find a replacement. During this period very little progress was
47


﻿made on project outcomes as well as spending. This situation continued through year three despite the
recruitment of a new project director who only stayed in position for eight months, leading to listing the
project on the 'problem projects list' during the PPR which took place in 2011.
The project director position was filled once again in year four, this time till the end of the project
duration.
-   The performance of the PMU was highly affected by a set of internal and external challenges:
1. The high turnover rate of the project director position.
2. The decline in government political and financial support hindered by global and national
constraints, especially in regard to PA designation and program financing.
3. The inability of RSCN's board of directors to provide needed support on the PAs designation
files due to national political and economic constraints.
The high level of bureaucracy of the World Bank procedures and often limited level of responsiveness
especially in regard to procurement and financial management.
5) World Bank Performance
The project had two TTLs, two procurement specialists, two financial management specialists, and one
safeguard specialist (for the first three years only).
The first TTL reported that the project was of satisfactory and moderately satisfactory performance until
quarter four of 2010. The project was then moved into the moderately unsatisfactory category for one
year which led to listing the project on the problem projects list. It is important to note that the change
from satisfactory to unsatisfactory coincided with the change of the project TTL, even though the project
was mal performing for at least one full year before. An earlier detection/recognition of the project's
weak performance could have been very useful to avoid falling into the problem list.
With the new TTL assigned to the project (along with the filling of the project director position), the
project witnessed rapid improvement in performance which was concluded with a full on time delivery of
all project technical components and financial proceedings in July 2013.
Upon project midterm in early 2011, RSCN requested a project restructuring in response to the
cumulative effects of the external environment factors described earlier. The project TTL was supportive
of the proposition, however, the proposal was declined by the Bank's management with the justification
that the restructuring will only need to be triggered six months before the project termination. A more
constructive response from the Bank would have resulted in better achievement of project technical
components quality as well as financial and institutional sustainability.
One year before the project termination date, RSCN, with support from the TTL, put together a full
project restructuring proposal, a process which took three months of concerted efforts by the PMU. The
proposal included a one year zero additional cost extension to assure project activities quality, foster
institutional anchorage and improve potential for sustainability. RSCN was astonished to receive the
World Bank rejection of the restructuring proposal only four months before its termination date. The
project PMU was faced with the challenges of finalizing around 10% the project interventions and 30% of
project budget in four months.
It was mainly due to the support of the project TTL that the PMU was able to adopt a four months
emergency plan to deliver on all remaining project activities and unspent funds. This took place despite
the bureaucratic constraints put forth by the procurement specialist and significant delays from the
financial disbursement department.
48


﻿6) Government Support
The government of Jordan was supportive of the project during its inception phase. The steering
committee - although with limited decision making powers - provided all possible support and expressed
full understanding of project challenges.
The support of the government declined severely after the 2008 economic crisis, and reached its lowest
peak upon the start of the Arab spring which limited its ability to push forth some of the project
components (i.e. the PAs designation).
The government of Jordan was very supportive of the proposal for the project restructuring and extension
but was highly surprised and discontent at the Banks unresponsiveness to the request.
7) RSCN Performance
RSCN executed the project stemming from its long established experience in large GEF projects
implementation. The PMU was delegated to oversee the project delivery and all possible political,
technical and administrative support was made available.
RSCN suffered the most from the 2008 and 2011 external constraints which crippled its capacity to
achieve the new PAs designations. It was obvious to RSCN - in the view of the author - that the time for
smooth PA designation (particularly in the Rift Valley) had passed. It is well recognized by RSCN today
that all new protected areas and land tenure related activities will need a much more thorough preparation
phase which could or could not lead to successful PA designation. This notion is well accepted by RSCN
as it complies with its established approach to participative planning and management.
RSCN took several important decisions to ensure the financial and institutional sustainability of the
interventions. This was done through the successful enlargement of the endowment fund, the
institutionalization of the land use, climate change and community development units within its core
business and the incorporation of all the new activities within its annual business and financial planning.
8) Project Procurement
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The project procurement specialist was there for its full duration. The procurement plan of the project was
fully met with all its anticipated targets and was continuously rated by the project director and the World
Bank team as satisfactory. Please see ISRs and final procurement plan report.
The procurement process during the last three years of the project was a typical emergency process which
peaked during the last six months and achieved (with quality performance) the spending of around 80% of
project funds.
9) Project M&E
Rating: Satisfactory
Two M&E specialists were recruited for the project. The first covered year one through three while the
second was in position until the project termination.
The M&E system was well delivered by the project team with support from the TTLs. However, the
system suffered from the unclear mandate, limited supervision by the steering committee and the time and
efforts wasted in preparation for the project restructuring.
The project had a safeguard specialist who was underperforming and consequently dismissed/resigned.
49


﻿Two full-cycle attempts to recruit a new safeguard specialist failed due to lack of competent candidates.
10) Project spending
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The project ended year one with around 15% spending of its allocated funds. Year two and three
witnessed severe decline in project spending (see previous notes). By year four, the project was identified
as a problem project with only around 20% of funds disbursed and around 60% of project time elapsed.
Starting from year four, the project spending performance improved dramatically resulting in full
disbursement of all project funds by termination date.
