                         management plans of the protected areas, as prepared by the Research and Survey Section and the Nature Conservation Section respectively. Thirdly, the project is able to specify

                         amount of funding spent in the first three years of project implementation. This increase in expenditure is a reflection of the much improved ongoing execution of project activities
                         and operations, the recruitment of key individuals that are to deliver on the project components, as well as improvement in communications with key government agencies which have
                         led to several breakthrough discussions with the Ministry of Environment, Jordan Valley Authority, and Ministry of Agriculture, among other partners.
