had an overall moderately satisfactory\n            outcome, with the performances of the Bank and the borrower\n            being deemed moderately satisfactory as well. The global\n            environment objectives indicator was partially achieved,\n            while the project development objectives indicator was fully\n            achieved and exceeded the target. Of the fourteen\n            intermediate outcome indicators, three were partially\n            achieved, while the remaining indicators were fully\n            achieved. The following significant lessons were learned\n            during the implementation of the project: 1) readiness for\n            implementation is key to effective start up and\n            participatory planning needs to be started at the\n            preparatory stage; 2) a non-governmental organization with\n            strong technical capacity, a clear mandate, and proven\n            experience in nature conservation makes it a feasible\n            implementing agency for this project; 3) the development of\n            sustainable socio-economic and conservation projects as an\n            entry point to strengthening relationships with local\n            communities prior to protected area designation; 4)\n            identifying priority needs in the targeted areas as parallel\n            activities to finance in order to gain community support for\n            the designation of the sites; 5) the need to address land\n            tenure complexities at the time of project design; 6)\n            setting up a results-oriented monitoring and evaluation\n            system that serves as a dynamic management tool, with\n            precise objective and indicators that adequately reflect\n            results achieved on the ground; 7) the qualifications of the\n            project teams and their adequate staffing and presence on\n            the ground, as well as their close and regular contact with\n            beneficiaries promote confidence and credibility of the\n            project and its institutions; and 8) a conjunction of\n            mechanisms and initiatives tailored to the local conditions\n            and context specific demands is needed to engage communities\n            in conservation management."}, "docdt": "2014-01-13T00:00:00Z"}
