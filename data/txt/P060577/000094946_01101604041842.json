and Innovation Project objective, is to assist\n            Mexico, its participating states, and the private sector,\n            learn about the requirements for the development of\n            sustainable micro-finance processes, so as to promote access\n            to financial services by targeted groups, and, learn as well\n            on the use of information communications technology to\n            service micro-businesses cost-effectively. The components\n            will: 1) strengthen eligible micro-finance institutions\n            within the country's less developed rural-urban\n            markets, through innovative approaches for local businesses,\n            to gain reliable access to commercially priced working\n            capital, and investment credit, and secure as well savings\n            facilities; 2) promote increased access to information\n            communications technology-based business development\n            services, to enable participating micro-businesses to access\n            new markets, and increase income. Business application,\n            databases, and business management, and planning tools will\n            be developed to match local needs; in addition, training,\n            and programs will be provided for the use of ICT in business\n            development services; and, 3) design, and implement\n            monitoring, and evaluation systems, supported by consulting\n            services, and, will as well finance the incremental costs of\n            equipment, and software needed for this purpose. Project\n            management, administration, and coordination will be\n            financed, as will the necessary training to ensure\n            widespread participation in project activities by civil society."}, "docdt": "2001-09-26T00:00:00Z"}
