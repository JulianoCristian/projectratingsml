Some lessons learned included: strong\n            ownership of the central and state governments is essential\n            to successful project implementation, especially if the\n            project is designed to do the right things at the right time\n            which has been the case with TEQIP. The instrument chosen\n            for the project, a reforms-based Specific Investment Loan\n            (SIL) embedded, worked well in India where there were a\n            large number of states and institutions competing for\n            project funds. Competitive funding of institutions is a\n            flexible tool that can be used to support changing sector\n            priorities by selecting appropriate eligibility and\n            selection criteria. Voluntary participation by states to\n            implement reforms increases the likelihood of their success.\n            Innovations introduced under reform-oriented investment\n            projects can have spill-over effects on parts of the sector\n            not under the purview of the project. Similarly, strong\n            ownership coupled with demonstrable positive project\n            outcomes can create a receptive platform for further\n            innovations. Implementation performance depends on the\n            availability of adequate full-time staff and their timely\n            training in implementation procedures; ideally prior to\n            project effectiveness. Staff continuity should be maintained\n            as much as possible to reduce delays caused by unfilled\n            posts and time taken by new staff to learn the job.\n            Decentralizing project implementation to the institution\n            level can increase participation but execution can get\n            delayed because it takes time to train all the implementers\n            in the proper procedures. Additionally, good communication\n            mechanisms between the institutions and state level\n            implementing agencies and the state and central level\n            agencies, if absent, can delay or even derail\n            implementation. Any reform-based project in the technical\n            and engineering sector cannot omit private institutions who\n            dominate as providers. Private aided and unaided\n            institutions used the resources provided under the project\n            well. However, given their relative unfamiliarity with\n            public procurement methods, they may need greater\n            supervision and training."}, "docdt": "2009-09-24T00:00:00Z"}
