{"cdata!": "The Engineering Technical Education\n            Quality Improvement Program Project aims at a systematic\n            transformation of the technical education sub-sector, into a\n            dynamic, demand-driven system, responsive to rapid economic,\n            and technological developments. As such, the status of\n            enrollment in Indian engineering education is reviewed, as\n            well as the initiatives, and enabling mechanisms taken by\n            the Government through the existing national policy, in\n            providing education coverage for people with special needs,\n            for women, and minorities. The project fully endorses such\n            policy, and will support the cause of schedule castes (SCs)\n            and schedule tribes (STs) students, in protecting the\n            interests of indigenous persons, particularly that of the\n            SC/STs. It is not envisaged that new institutions will be\n            created, thus it is unlikely adverse impacts will affect\n            STs' land rights. The quality of education for SC/STs\n            will be enhanced, to meet international standards, focusing\n            in particular, on popularizing technical education among\n            SC/ST communities. The legal framework, and constitutional\n            provisions allow for the advancement of socially, and\n            educationally backward classes of citizens, and, promotes\n            special care for the educational, and economic interests of\n            the weaker sections of the population. Claims shall be taken\n            into consideration, through grievance mechanisms due to\n            discrimination against SC/STs candidates, through the\n            judicial system, and by the National Commission for SC/STs,\n            in addition, counseling and advisory services will also be provided."}, "docdt": "2002-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
