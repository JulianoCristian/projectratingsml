F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project's development objective was to improve the quality, efficiency, equity and
access of the Lithuania health care system. Key performance indicators measured: (i)
improved equity of resource allocation among health regions (apskritis), (ii) cost-
containment through effective contracting between the State Patient Funds and health
care providers; (iii) efficiency gains through hospital services consolidation and
restructuring in four pilot regions; and (iv) improved access to General Practitioner
services in four pilot regions.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The project development objective did not change during the project life.

In 1997, accelerated privatization supported the growth of Foreign Direct Investment to record
levels, while most other structural reforms proceeded apace. As a result, the GDP growth rate
increased from 3.3% in 1995 to a 7.3% in 1998. The main objectives of the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for Lithuania for 2000-2002 were to: (i) help improve macroeconomic and
financial stability; (ii) support the reform agenda and investments needed for EU accession; and
(iii) support reforms, institution building and investments in social assistance and the health and
education sectors.

Country and sector background
In the late 1990s, Lithuania faced problems in the health sector similar to other CEE/FSU
countries. Aggregate health indicators had deteriorated compared to the pre-transition period
(pre-1991), leaving Lithuania with a significant gap in health status in comparison with the EU.
The health system did not proactively address the root causes of ill health because of lack of
effective public health policies and programs. The health system was also not able to cope with
the increased burden of ill health because of an inefficient health care delivery and health
financing system.       Declining public funding for health services and poor maintenance of
investments in health care infrastructure exacerbated the situation. In 1995, Lithuania adopted a
Primary Health Care Reform Strategy to restructure its health sector and adjust to changing socio-
economic, epidemiologic, and demographic circumstances.

There was a lack of effective public health policies and programs to address an emerging
wave of non-communicable diseases. Historically oriented towards infectious diseases and
environmental health, the public health system had little capacity and leadership to
comprehensively address non-communicable diseases such as circulatory diseases, external
injuries and malignant tumors that were the most frequent mortality causes. This situation was
further aggravated by deteriorating socio-economic conditions during transition and life-style
related risk factors.

The health care delivery system was characterized by inefficient primary, secondary and
tertiary level institutions, and work force. The system had an excessive number of poorly
organized and low quality hospitals; absence of first level and family care services; and an
inadequate skill mix in the work force. As a result of the imbalance between primary, and
secondary and tertiary health institutions, there was an over-reliance on inpatient treatment. At
the same time, there was a need for less acute care beds and more nursing and support beds where
frail elderly and chronically ill individuals could be better taken care of at lower cost within the
framework of community-based health services. Human resources, especially physicians, were in
excess compared to the EU and Lithuania's Baltic neighbors. There were also significant regional
imbalances ranging from 1.3 physicians per 1,000 population in some predominantly rural
counties to 6.2 in big cities.



                                                  1

Although Lithuania had taken considerable steps in reforming its health financing system
towards separation of purchasing (through the State Patient Fund, SPF) and provision of
services, it still faced challenges posed by a supply driven resource allocation formula,
inefficient management of investment resources, inefficient purchasing practices, and
payment systems that encouraged over-referral and hospital admission.                   Patient fund
allocations were determined by the level of services provided by secondary and tertiary facilities
within the territorial boundaries, which in turn resulted in large cross-territorial variations in per
capita allocation. Investment decisions were taken by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the
municipal authorities without SPF participation. Service prices did not incorporate the cost of
buildings and equipment. Consequently, investment decisions were encouraging ineffective
resource use as health care institutions were receiving investment funding on the basis of criteria
other than the number of services rendered. Territorial Patient Funds (TPF) distributed their
budget on the basis of historical patterns and not actual needs, while the combination of capitation
for primary care and activity-based payments for secondary care created incentives for under-
utilization of primary health care (PHC) services and high level of referrals to specialists and the
hospital sector.

The health care benefit package was unaffordable. Officially all services were covered by the
SPF unless there was a specific exclusion. The remaining benefit package was still too extensive
to be sustained by country resources and rationing occurred in a number of different implicit
ways.

There was a need to strengthen institutional capacity and better define the institutional
framework for public accountability.            The MOH and SPF were the key institutions
implementing health reforms. During project preparation, many stakeholders viewed the lack of
capacity in the areas of reform planning, implementation and monitoring as one of the main
reform obstacles. The MOH had important strengths that it could build upon, but also needed to
strengthen institutional capacity for program management, monitoring and evaluation (M&E),
communication, and needs and technology assessment. The change of health care facilities from
budget organizations to public institutions in 1997 led to substantial autonomy and flexibility for
these institutions, but it did not provide clear rules for public accountability. In reality, hospital
owners (central government, health regions, and municipalities) played a passive role in oversight,
leaving the task of financial monitoring largely to the SPF/TPFs, although the latter did not have
the necessary power to address poor business hospital performance.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

The Lithuania Health Project supported the FY00-02 CAS objectives to "design cost-effective,
financially viable social safety net and human development programs" and to help reorient public
services and infrastructure in order to provide adequate and cost-effective social services. In the
health sector, this translated into reorientation of medical services towards a general practice-
based primary health care system, optimization and improvement in quality of hospital services,
and introduction of appropriate incentives and efficient management into the health financing
system.

Support to the Government's reform health program. The project supported the Government's
health reform policy agenda at a time that Lithuania was in need of external donor support. The
project was financed by a World Bank Loan, a Grant from the Swedish International
Development Agency (SIDA) and a Grant from the Government of Japan. Competitive selection
of pilot counties based on the quality of proposals and consistency with the national health care


                                                  2

reforms was perceived to contribute to successful project implementation. Tangible positive
results from the first successful activities were believed to facilitate nation-wide implementation
of health sector reforms.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The project development objective was to improve the quality, efficiency, equity and access of
the Lithuania health care system. Key performance indicators measured: (i) improved equity of
resource allocation among health regions (apskritis), (ii) cost-containment through effective
contracting between the SPFs and health care providers; (iii) efficiency gains through hospital
services consolidation and restructuring in four pilot regions; and (iv) improved access to General
Practitioner services in four pilot regions.1

Key Indicators
The Lithuania Health Project (LHP) had the following sector related indicators from the CAS:
         Improved efficiency of the health care system;
         Improved population satisfaction with national health services;

and the following indicators for PDO:
         Standard health services efficiency indicators improve yearly over the life of the project;
         90% of health care providers stay within year-end predefined fixed price-volume
         budgets;
         50% of population in project areas is covered by certified General Practitioners (GPs)
         providing comprehensive services by end of project;
         Referrals and self-referrals to ambulatory care specialists and hospitals beds are reduced
         by 20% in pilot areas by end of project;
         Patient satisfaction with the services they get from their primary care physicians is
         improved in pilot areas by end of project;
         Policy framework for health service planning and restructuring in place, and used by
         health administrators by end of project.

In addition, the LHP had 25 indicators related to component outputs/outcomes. For a detailed list
of the component-related indicators see the Results Framework Analysis.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The project development objective and key indicators did not change during the project life.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)

The PAD identified seven groups of project beneficiaries:

will be used when referring to the five regions of the TPFs.




                                                       3

    (i)     Society at large benefited from improved efficiency of public expenditure on health,
            better standards of care; and improved equity as a result of a needs-based resource
            allocation;
    (ii)    Population in pilot counties benefited from better access to care; better quality of
            care; reduction in urban-rural inequities; increased community participation in health
            and health care issues; and community nursing services (the latter mainly benefited
            the elderly and the chronically ill);
    (iii)   The Government benefited from improved decision making capacity through
            institutional and process improvements, and greater data availability from an
            improved information management; and better communication with the population
            and system stakeholders;
    (iv)    SPF and TPFs benefited from strengthened institutional capacity; improved job
            satisfaction through skill development activities and clear job descriptions;
            automation of data gathering, aggregation, and analysis function supporting statistics,
            policy development, and resource allocation; and reduction of fraud in the health
            insurance system;
    (v)     Health policy decision makers and opinion leaders, the Government, the Patient
            Funds, the Parliament and influential stakeholders benefited from improved
            information about reform processes; improved transparency of health care funding
            that would allow for better planning and accountability; strategic planning for the
            improvement of the health of the population through policy and other broad-based
            approaches; and improved detailed and aggregated data on health from the Health
            Management Information System (HMIS);
    (vi)    Health administration managers benefited from better management skills;
    (vii)   GPs benefited from improved skills and incentives for good performance; improved
            professional prestige; better control and flexibility over professional lives; and
            improved working conditions.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The LHP had three components:

Component A. Support to Health Reform (estimated total cost US$8.46 million). This
component consisted of three sub-components, namely: A.1. Policy Development, A.2.
Strengthening Capacity of National Health Institutions, and A.3. Information Management. Each
sub-component was further divided into sub-components.

Sub-component A1. Policy Development (estimated total cost US$1.16 million). This sub-
component aimed at supporting the development of a regional resource allocation formula, a
mechanism for the allocation of investment funding, provider reimbursement and contracting
mechanisms, needs assessment and service planning, a basic package of services and clinical
protocols, and health care service restructuring. Sub-component A1 included six sub-components.

Sub-component A2. Strengthening Capacity of National Health Institutions (estimated total cost
US$1.47 million). The objective of this sub-component was to strengthen institutional capacity
to implement policy reforms. Institutional strengthening included staff skill development,
provision of information, tools, and methodologies, and building capacity to effectively
communicate with the consumers of the health care system and the main stakeholders. The
beneficiaries of the component activities were the Medical Library, the Lithuanian Health
Information Centre, the MOH, Patient Funds, and the National Health Board. Sub-component A2
included five sub-components.


                                                 4

Sub-component A3. Information Management (estimated total cost US$5.83 million). This sub-
component aimed at strengthening the Lithuanian Health Information Center (LHIC) and
developing a hospital and PHC information system. The Health Information System envisaged
the development of an open-ended information system in a modular fashion that would be a
flexible and cost-effective tool for patient management, administration and documentation. The
sub-component also supported MIS development in four pilot counties and was linked to the
facilities supported through Component B. Sub-component A3 included two sub-components.

Component B: Health Services Restructuring (estimated total cost US$24.13 million). This
component was designed to support health service restructuring in four pilot counties: Alytus,
Kaunas, Utena and Vilnius. Lithuania has 10 counties in total. The pilot counties were selected on
a competitive basis out of nine applications. Following selection, the four selected counties
developed detailed regional health sector restructuring and development programs supported by
international technical assistance.

Sub-component B1. Alytus Pilot Project (estimated total cost US$5.26 million) included a
Regional PHC Development Program and a Hospital Restructuring Program.

Sub-component B2. Kaunas Pilot Project (estimated total cost US$7.01 million) included a Health
Promotion and Primary Prevention Program, a Regional PHC Development Program, a Hospital
Restructuring Program, a Community Mental Health Service Program, and an Ambulance and
Emergency Services Development Program.

Sub-component B3. Utena Pilot Project (estimated total cost US$4.38 million) included a
Regional PHC Development Program, a Hospital Restructuring Program, and an Ambulance
Service Development Program.

Sub-component B4. Vilnius Pilot Project (estimated total cost US$7.48 million) included a
Vilnius Apskrtitis PHC Service Restructuring Program and a Hospital Restructuring Program.

Component C: Project Management (estimated total cost US$1.35 million). This component
supported the operation of a Project Coordination Unit (PCU), staffed by project management and
technical staff in the MOH. To oversee the restructuring of health services in the four pilot
counties and facilitate implementation at the local level, a core team of at least two staff was
placed at each of the four apskritis participating in the project.

1.6 Revised Components

Component A. Sub-component A2. There was no substantial restructuring of this component
during project implementation. However, the activities of sub-components A2.2. Management
and Development Adviser to the MOH and A2.3. Management Training to be financed under the
EU/PHARE project were implemented earlier and separate from the LHP activities because of
delays in the negotiation of the World Bank (WB) loan. The implementation of these sub-
components was primarily the responsibility of the Division of Foreign Affairs of the MOH. The
LHP PCU did not participate in their implementation and therefore did not have any information
on these activities. Efforts were made to obtain relevant information from the Division of
Foreign Affairs of the MOH but because of changes in the Ministry's personnel, the individual(s)
responsible for the EU/PHARE project could not be located and interviewed and information
could not be retrieved.



                                                  5

Due to changes in the activities financed under Sub-component A2 and a change in the exchange
rate between the Lithunian Lita (LTL) and the US dollar (US$) which left activities under Sub-
component A1 under-funded, Sub-component A2 funds were re-allocated to Sub-component A1
activities. During the re-allocation process, the Government decided to use funds under sub-
component A2.5 for study tours for the National Health Board to finance activities under sub-
component A1. Consequently, activities under sub-component A2.5 were cancelled.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

Extensions of project closing date. The original closing date of the LHP was September 30, 2004.
The closing date was extended twice and the project closed on September 30, 2006.

The Government requested the first extension of the project's closing date (from October 1, 2004
to March 30, 2006) in order to: (i) complete activities under sub-component A3.2. Development
of Hospital and Primary Health Care Information System or HMIS; and (ii) finalize payments for
the day-surgery centers' equipment, ambulances for the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and
civil works in the Vilnius Railway Hospital.

Following the first extension, the second extension from April 1, 2006 to September 30, 2006 was
granted to finalize activities under the HMIS. The six-month extension request was based on the
understanding between the Bank and the Borrower that a minimum of nine months was needed to
ensure effective procurement and implementation of the HMIS.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory by this ICR.

The project was based on a sound and detailed background analysis. The project preparation
period lasted for more than two years, from April 1996 (Concept Review) to November 1999
(Board Approval). This was due to a number of reasons including, the complexity of the
proposed reform activities, both at the level of policy development and health service
restructuring (HSR); the involvement of pilot areas with varying health sector characteristics and
thus different needs; and structural changes in the MOH (during preparation, the Ministry
leadership changed three times). To address the complexity of health services restructuring, pilot
counties were selected on a competitive basis.         Subsequently, the four selected counties
developed detailed regional health sector restructuring and development programs supported by
international technical assistance. The demand driven approach for competitive selection of pilot
regions strengthened the project's local ownership and assisted the process of addressing the
complex political context of health sector restructuring.

The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) highlighted a number of lessons learned from other
projects in the region: for example, health sector reforms in the ECA region were a lengthy
and politicized process; expectations from the reform process had been too optimistic for
both the World Bank and the client countries; and projects per se were complex.


                                                 6

Unfortunately, the Bank team did not apply all these lessons when designing the LHP. The
LHP was a complex project with three components and a total of 17 sub-components; 13 sub-
components under Component A and 4 county sub-components under Component B; county sub-
components were further divided in programs/other sub-components. In the case of Component
A, the area of Policy Development aimed to address issues of resource allocation, investment
funding, provider reimbursement and contracting, needs assessment and service planning, the
basic package of services, and health sector restructuring. These issues are all inter-related and it
could be argued that they have to be addressed simultaneously in order for a reform process to be
comprehensive and effective.        However, their inclusion under one project umbrella in an
environment of weak institutional capacity, frequent political changes and a relatively low level
of political commitment posed serious risks for project implementation. As is argued in Section 3.
Assessment of Outcomes, while the majority of these issues were put on the table and discussed
by the sector's stakeholders, few political decisions were eventually taken in these areas. The
latter was probably due to (i) the high political cost that these decisions involved, and (ii) the need
for stronger institutional capacity in the MOH.

A smaller number of sub-components could have benefited project implementation, and
M&E. This is particularly true in the case of Component A that consisted of three sub-
components and where each sub-component was further divided to multiple sub-components. In
retrospect, the project could have followed a more modest approach and focused on a smaller
number of policy issues. This would have allowed for a faster and easier implementation process
­as discussed in section 2.2, the project faced various problems during the first years of
implementation. At the same time, it would have allowed for the M&E arrangements to focus on
a smaller number of key performance indicators, which under the present design reached
approximately 30 indicators (see also discussion in section 2.3).

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

Up to Mid-Term Review (MTR), which took place in June 2002, the implementation process
of both Components A and B was slow. As far as Component A was concerned, few political
decisions were taken, although working groups had been formed and the issues had been
discussed in multiple fora and with the participation of main stakeholders. Project activities on
the HMIS started only two years after project effectiveness. There were various reasons for this
delay: i) there was lack of clarity in the Government and the health sector in general regarding the
content of the HMIS, ii) non-technical issues such as issues of confidentiality and legal needed to
be addressed in advance of any project activities, iii) there were various institutions that
demanded the control of primary data and iv) there was lack of institutional capacity to fully
develop the HMIS. Regarding Component B, during the first year of implementation there were
considerable delays in signing the implementation agreements between the MOH, and the pilot
counties and municipalities due to local elections which took place during that year. Eventually,
three out of four agreements were signed by the end of 2000 (Alytus, Utena, and Vilnius), while it
took until March 2001 for the Kaunas implementation agreement to be signed. The length of
time and difficulty in the signing of the agreements was also due to the fact that the restructuring
programs in some pilot counties were challenging, involving the merging of hospital facilities and
the closing of hospital departments.

Project implementation was affected by frequent changes in the MOH leadership and in the
composition of the Bank team.           During the project life (from May 2000 when it became
effective until September 2006 when it closed) there were six Ministers of Health. On average, a


                                                   7

minister's tenure was less than 18 months. The frequent changes of the MOH leadership caused
delays in project implementation, especially in Component A, as each incoming Minister needed
time to get acquainted with the project and provide support and leadership to the program. The
existence of a Project Steering Committee, which was created during preparation and tasked to
offer policy guidance and donor coordination, might have assisted in faster project
implementation despite ministerial changes. However, the Chair of the Steering Committee
appeared reluctant to cooperate with World Bank (WB) colleagues during the first three years of
the Project period, thus posing additional difficulties for project implementation. At the same
time, the Bank team also experienced frequent changes of task team leaders (TTL) and program
team leaders (PTL). In total, there were three TTLs and four PTLs during the project life.
Continuity in the relationships between the MOH and the Bank was affected by frequent changes
of team members from both sides.

A well-performing Project Coordination Unit (PCU) had a highly positive impact in project
implementation and outcomes. The LPH benefited from a strong PCU, both in the MOH and
the pilot counties. The PCU worked in a professional and dedicated manner in order to guarantee
smooth implementation of a complex project in an unstable political environment. This had a
highly positive impact on project implementation and it was acknowledged, unanimously, by
Bank staff and project beneficiaries (e.g., health care providers involved in the project, employees
of national health institutions, etc.) in project documents and interviews carried out during the
preparation of this ICR.

Activities under sub-components A2.2 Management and Development Adviser to the MOH
and A2.3. Management Training were financed by the EU/PHARE project and supervised
by the Division of Foreign Affairs of the MOH before the LHP became effective (see
Section 1.6). Activities under sub-component A2.5 were cancelled as the Government
decided to re-allocate funds from this sub-component to the financing of activities under
subcomponent A1.

A Quality Assessment Group (QAG) assessment carried out in October 2002 rated the
quality of supervision as marginal (overall rating 3).2 The assessment stated that the project
had an overly ambitious policy and institutional reform agenda in a local context characterized by
continuous changes of sectoral authorities and insufficient buy-in of reforms by the national
government. As a result, the project got off to a very slow start with serious implementation
problems in the area of support to health reform (Component A). The QAG panel recognized the
commitment and steady efforts of the Bank team to supervise a project with design problems
from the outset causing slow and difficult implementation and commented that the management
could have made stronger efforts to find solutions and provide strategic guidance to the team.
The QAG panel observed that while the diagnosis of the problems was satisfactory, it was not
translated into agreement with the Government on revising and possibly restructuring the scope
and content of the project. The assessment concluded that the task team should revisit the MTR
findings and move from problem diagnosis to discussion and agreement with national authorities
on concrete remedial measures, including project restructuring. The panel also advocated the



2The assessment rating for QAG is: 1=Highly Satisfactory, 2=Satisfactory, 3=Marginal, 4=Unsatisfactory,
NA=Not Applicable. The ratings available in the ICR Portal (Section C in the Datasheet) are not
compatible with QAG's ratings. In particular, they do not have an option for a marginal rating. Therefore,
the rating for quality of supervision in Section C.3 of the Datasheet is different from QAG's rating shown in
the main text.

active involvement of the country unit that could help raise project related issues to the
appropriate senior levels of Government as part of a broader country portfolio review.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The M&E design identified an ambitious set of indicators to monitor progress towards the
PDO and component outcomes. As discussed in section 1.2, the project had approximately 30
indicators for measuring progress against CAS related goals, the PDO and project components.
In the case of Component B, the Results Framework Analysis stated that individual targets for
each project apskritis were to be defined in Project Implementation Agreements (PIAs) and it
made reference to examples of indicators that could be included in these agreements (e.g.,
reductions in hospital beds, increases in population coverage by certified GPs, etc.). The PAD
also identified the collection methods for these indicators which included routine project
monitoring by the PCU and the Bank team, reports of sectoral authorities such as the MOH, the
SPF and regional authorities, and population surveys. The latter were expected to provide data on
population satisfaction with PHC health services before and after implementation of project
activities in the pilot counties using two types of population groups; individuals who visited PHC
facilities that participated in the project (project group) and individuals who visited PHC facilities
that did not participate in the project (control group).

The implementation of M&E arrangements was not done in a systematic way during
project life. During project implementation, data on key performance indicators were collected
in a sporadic way and not for all indicators. Furthermore, there was an absence of documentation
of the M&E process in Project Status Reports (PSR) and Implementation Status and Results
(ISR) reports. In interviews carried out during the preparation of this ICR, Bank team members
and PCU staff mentioned that efforts were made to gather an additional/alternative set of national
and regional data with the assistance of a Bank consultant (including data on number of hospital
admissions, number of inpatient days, number of hospital beds, utilization of ambulatory services
and utilization of ambulance and emergency services). Unfortunately, these efforts were not
completed and the above mentioned data were not collected. As a result, when the project closed
there were no baseline data or other type of data against which the project could be evaluated.
The only exception was the baseline and evaluation surveys on patient satisfaction that were
carried out in 2001 and 2005, respectively.

During ICR preparation, data on key performance indicators were collected. In November
2006, the ICR author requested the collection of relevant project data ex post. An agreement was
reached between the MOH (PCU) and the SPF that data in their disposal would be provided to the
ICR author for the years 2000 (baseline), 2002 (MTR) and 2006 (actual). At the same time, the
LHIC completed the data put together by the M&E Bank consultant for the period 2000-2005. A
complete set of data was provided to the ICR author by March 2007. The fact that the Lithuanian
authorities were able to provide detailed data ex post is evidence of their M&E institutional
capacity. However, it is not clear why this effort was not made earlier in the project and if it was
made, why it was not documented accordingly. One possible reason could be that the large
number of key performance indicators had an adverse effect on the M&E process. The PCU
members who were primarily responsible for M&E stated that they did provide data to the Bank
mission sporadically. From the Bank side, the need for data collection for M&E purposes was
raised by the Bank team in aide-memoires as well as in management's comments on the PSRs
and ISRs, and the QAG assessment.

Overall financial management is rated satisfactory. The PCU's financial management systems
during project implementation, including project accounting and financial reporting, internal
controls, staffing, disbursements, and auditing arrangements were considered adequate. Starting
2001, the PCU used the automated accounting system "HANSA Financial," while a revised,
improved version of this system was used from 2003 onwards. Procurement throughout the
project period proceeded with appropriate speed for goods and renovations/works for hospitals,
day surgery centers and GP offices. However, considerable delays were observed in procurement
of services that needed political decisions by the MOH. Audits were carried out annually and
were unqualified.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

Following project closure, the Government has been using EU structural funds to finance
the implementation of the remaining phases of the HMIS. Under the project, the Concept
(Core system) of the HMIS or E-Health project was prepared and four functions ­the basic
electronic patient record, patient registration with PHC providers, referrals to secondary and
tertiary level services and laboratories, and records of results- were developed. Development of
the remaining 11 functions and roll-out of the system in three regions is currently financed
through EU Structural Funds. The MOH has maintained the PCU in order to coordinate activities
under the new EU "Pilot E-Health System Development Project" which became effective in
February 2007 and is expected to close in September 2008. The use of EU structural funds for
the completion of the HMIS provides clear evidence of the importance that the Government
assigns to the development of E-Health in Lithuania and its commitment to complete project
activities. At the same time, the MOH takes full advantage of in-house capacity developed under
the LHP in order to co-ordinate the implementation of the EU-financed activities.

The Government continues HSR through the approval of the second stage of the `Strategy
for Restructuring of Health Care Institutions' in June 2006. The Government approved the
first stage of the `Strategy for Restructuring of Health Care Institutions' in March 2003 (see also
section 3.2). Implementation of this Strategy resulted in a 19% reduction in the number of
hospital beds between 2000 and 2005. 43% of this reduction took place in non-pilot counties
showing the commitment of the Government to HSR. The second stage of this Strategy was
approved in June 2006 and contemplates continuation of the restructuring efforts.

The Lithuanian Government and the World Bank have explored the possibility of future
collaboration in various health-related topics. Three areas for future collaboration have been
identified: developing a Health Human Resources strategy, supporting the MOH in implementing
its Mental Health Policy 2005-2010 and exploring options for Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in
delivery of health care services. Forms of collaboration discussed with the MOH included: (i) ad-
hoc short-term TA, and cross-country TA; and (ii) longer-term TA on a cost-sharing basis with
the Government for priority areas subject to the limits of Bank support to graduated countries,
should the Government be interested.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)



                                                 11

The objectives and implementation of the LHP remained relevant and consistent with
Lithuania's current development priorities in the health sector and with current Bank
country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals. The 2006 `Implementation
Strategy of Health Care Reform's Aims and Objectives' prepared by the MOH recognized `equity
in health as the main principle of the national health policy' and emphasized the importance of
the primary health care sector and HSR for the Health Care Reform program. HSR was also
supported through the Government's `Strategy for Restructuring of Health Care Institutions.'

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details
on outputs in Annex 2)

The project has achieved its development objectives satisfactorily as demonstrated through
the achievement of most targets set out in the outcome and output indicators in the Results
Framework Analysis. The project has contributed to policy development, strengthening
capacity of national health institutions, developing a national HMIS and carrying out HSR in four
pilot counties. By providing support to health reform, the project achieved a more equitable
allocation of health resources among regions based on population size and other characteristics of
the pool of beneficiaries and led to the development and adoption of health specific investment
guidelines. One of the main accomplishments of the project was the development of a Master
Plan for health facilities which covered the whole country and was used for HSR not only in the
four pilot apskritis but in the rest of the counties as well. During the project period, issues such
as provider reimbursement and contracting, needs assessment and service planning, ambulance
and emergency services and the content of the basic benefits package (BBP) were widely
discussed in the framework of national workshops and conferences and strategies on these issues
were developed by health authorities. The project supported training of MOH officials from the
Communication Unit and the Medical Library and provided equipment and furniture for the
LHIC, thus increasing institutional capacity. The project also assisted with the development of
the Core System and four functions of the HMIS and set the basis for the development of E-
Health in the country. Finally, by investing in civil works, training, equipment and vehicles in
PHC facilities, hospitals, and ambulance and emergency services, the project laid the foundation
for the provision of more and better quality health care services to the population of pilot counties,
improved efficiency of the health care system and increased patient satisfaction. As mentioned
earlier, in the area of policy development, a stronger and more committed leadership could have
led to some additional policy decisions and reform actions.

The Results Framework of the LHP identified the following sets of indicators: (i) sector related-
CAS goal related indicators; (ii) PDO indicators; and (iii) Component indicators. Achievement of
the project development objectives is measured by progress made against each project indicator,
as follows:

Sector related-CAS goal indicators

Improved efficiency of health care system. This indicator was fulfilled in a satisfactory way.
Efficiency of the health care system was evaluated using two standard health service efficiency
indicators: average length of stay (ALOS) in hospitals and bed occupancy rate (BOR). Both
indicators have improved during the period of project implementation (Figure 1). In particular,
ALOS decreased from 7.8 days in 2001 to 6.7 days in 2005 (14% decrease), while BOR increased

from 25.1% in 2000 to 29% in 2005 (15.5% increase). The increase in BOR is considered a step
towards the right direction, although its value is still low by international standards.

Improved population satisfaction with national health services. Results related to this indicator
are mixed. Patient satisfaction with service provision in PHC ambulatories increased by 9.5%
between the baseline and evaluation periods (Table 1). However, no change in the level of patient
satisfaction was observed for services provided in polyclinics between the two periods. When
taking into account both ambulatories and polyclinics, patient satisfaction increased by 1% for the
project group (individuals who visited facilities participating in the project). An increase in
patient satisfaction for services provided in PHC ambulatories was also registered for the control
group but it was lower compared to the one of the main group (8.7%). In the case of polyclinics,
the control group registered a decrease of 5% in patient satisfaction. The main reasons for patient
dissatisfaction in both project and control groups were long queues, doctors with low level of
qualifications and inability to carry all tests in the facility.

PDO indicators

Standard health service efficiency indicators improve yearly over the life of the project. This
indicator was fulfilled in a satisfactory way. Improvements during the project life were
observed both in ALOS and BOR. There was an approximately 14% decrease in ALOS for
hospitals and a 15% increase in BOR, albeit from a very low baseline value of 25% (See also
Figures 1 and 2).

90% of health care providers stay within year-end predefined fixed price-volume budgets. This
indicator was fulfilled in a satisfactory way. According to data provided by the SPF, more than


                                                               13

90% of health care providers (92.5%) stayed within year-end predefined fixed price-volume
budgets by the end of the project period. Unfortunately, no data is available for the baseline and
MTR periods.

50% of population in project areas is covered by certified GPs providing comprehensive services
by end of project. This indicator was fulfilled in a highly satisfactory way. One of the main
objectives of Component B was the development of a PHC reform strategy promoting the
provision of services by GPs) in order to improve access to quality PHC services. For this reason,
regional PHC development programs were implemented in all pilot counties providing training
and retraining of GPs and nurses, refurbishing of family practice offices and health centers,
provision of medical and office equipment and limited number of vehicles for GPs in isolated
rural areas. As a result of project activities, population coverage in pilot areas increased from
24.7% in 2000 to 61.8% in 2006. In terms of actual number of physicians, GPs increased from
692 in 2000 to 1,730 in 2006 (61% of all GPs in the country) in pilot counties.

Referrals and self-referrals to ambulatory care specialists and hospitals are reduced by 20% in
pilot areas by end of project. This indicator was fulfilled in a moderately satisfactory way.
There is no data on referral and self-referrals to ambulatory care specialists and hospitals. For the
evaluation of this indicator, ambulatory specialist visits per capita and admissions to hospital
inpatient care per 1,000 population are used. Between 2000 and 2005, ambulatory specialist
visits per capita increased in Alytus and Kaunas counties by around 12%, while they decreased in
Utena and Vilnius counties by 9% and 7%, respectively (Table 2). In the case of hospital
admissions, all counties showed an increase of services with the exception of Utena where
hospital admissions remained approximately the same. Likewise, the number of ambulatory
visits per capita, excluding specialist visits, increased in all four counties between 10% (Kaunas)
and 21% (Alytus and Vilnius).           The fact that there was a greater percentage increase in
ambulatory visits to non-specialists as compared to specialists and hospitals provides evidence of
the strengthening and higher utilization of the former services. In addition, a higher level of visits
to ambulatory care specialists and hospital admissions might have been caused by a higher burden
of disease between different periods in time and does not necessarily reflect an under-utilization
of ambulatory non-specialist services.

Patient satisfaction with the services they get from their primary care physicians is improved in
pilot areas by end of project. Results related to this indicator are mixed. Patient satisfaction
with service provision in PHC ambulatories increased by 9.5% between the baseline and
evaluation periods, however there was no change in patient satisfaction for services provided in
polyclinics. Please see also discussion under indicator Improved population satisfaction with
national health services and Table 1.

Policy framework for health service planning and restructuring in place, and used by health
administrators by end of project. This indicator was fulfilled in a highly satisfactory way. By
May 2002, a "National Hospital Restructuring Strategy," a "Strategy Implementation Plan" and
"Proposals for Needs-Based Health Care Service Plans in at least Five Counties" were prepared
by an international consultant under the project. These deliverables served as the basis for the
preparation of the "Strategy for the Restructuring of Health Care Institutions" approved in March
2003 by the GOL. The government's Strategy resulted in a 19% reduction in the number of
hospital beds between 2000 and 2005 (Figure 3). Fifty-seven percent of this reduction took place
in project pilot counties. More importantly, 43% took place in the rest of the country showing the
government's commitment to HSR. The Government approved the second stage of the Strategy in
June 2006.

Component A

80% of health funds allocated to regions according to population and needs-based formula by
mid-term evaluation (2002) and 100% of health funds by end of project. This indicator was
fulfilled in a satisfactory way. In 2000, 28% of funds were allocated to regions based on a
population and needs-based formula; PHC and ambulance services, nursing, and rehabilitation
were financed through formula funds based on a capitation payment system. In the period
between 2000 and 2002 (MTR) international TA assisted the SPF to assess the existing system of
resource allocation and provided recommendations on further development of the formula. The
adoption of a revised formula that included outpatient specialist services and hospital services
took place in June 2003 and increased the level of funds allocated through the formula to 54% of
total funds. The delay in the adoption of the revised formula was mainly the result of the
reorganization of the TPFs (which were reduced from 10 in 2002 to 5 in 2003). In July 2006, a
further revision took place which led to the inclusion of pharmaceuticals in the resource
allocation formula and an increase of the funds to be allocated through the formula to 75.5%.
Currently, the only interventions that are not included in the formula are high-cost procedures.
Although Lithuanian health authorities and the SPF, in particular, have made a great effort in



                                                              15

revising and employing the resource allocation formula in the last five years, differences in public
expenditure on health among regions remain relatively high. Under the assumption that the final
goal of the adoption of the population and needs-based formula should be a more equitable
distribution of public expenditure on health, Lithuania authorities should continue working
toward this goal through refinement of the formula mechanism.

A revised hospital reimbursement schedule based on standard costing study is in place by 2003.
This indicator was fulfilled in a moderately satisfactory way. A revised reimbursement
schedule was introduced in February 2003 but it was not based on a national costing exercise and
is expected to be revised again in the near future. In 2003, the MOH revised the hospital
reimbursement schedule by reducing the number of DRG-type (Diagnostically Related Group) of
profiles it was using up to that date. Nevertheless, prices were not based on a Lithuanian costing
exercise and in recent discussions (during the preparation of this ICR), government officials
signaled the national authorities' intention to carry out a new revision of the system where they
will define upper limits for specific services and stop using group profiles. Government officials
stated that the provision of project TA in this area was a valuable input to the sector dialogue, but
at the same time they acknowledged that hospital reimbursement is still a topic under discussion.

Government guidelines for appraisal, allocation, monitoring and financing of health sector
investments are developed and in use by Year 3 of project. This indicator was fulfilled in a
satisfactory way. In the period between 2000 and 2002 (MTR) international TA assisted the
MOH to assess the existing system of investment allocation and provided recommendations on its
future development. The MOH adopted health-specific investment guidelines in 2002 which are
still in use.

National and regional need-based health services plans are developed in at least 7 counties (out
of 10). This indicator was fulfilled in a moderately satisfactory way. Although no separate
needs-based health service plans were developed at the county level, the "Strategy for the
Restructuring of Health Care Institutions" was implicitly based on a needs assessment and service
planning. One of the reasons for which no separate plans were prepared was due to resource
constraints. As a result, the MOH decided to concentrate more on sub-component A1.6 as
compared to sub-component A1.4.

Numbers of health institution managers are trained in management. This indicator was not
fulfilled. There were no project activities related to this indicator.

Ambulance services review report is developed and disseminated by 2001. This indicator was
fulfilled in a moderately satisfactory way.          Ambulance service development plans were
prepared and adopted in 2003 in Kaunas and Utena counties in accordance with their PIAs. At
the national level, TA was provided under the project on the "Development of an Ambulance
Service Strategy" and "Implementation Plan," but no final political decisions were made given
resistance from the municipalities to transfer responsibilities of ambulance services to the county
level.

National Health Report is published regularly. This indicator was fulfilled in a satisfactory
way. A National Health Report is prepared and published yearly by the LHIC (www.lsic.lt).

Component B

The implementation of Component B. HSR is rated as highly satisfactory. HSR in all four
pilot counties was implemented in a smooth and highly effective way once PIAs were signed.


                                                 16

One of the most impressive outputs of this Component was related to the superior quality of civil
works. This was an impression shared by the WB team, Lithuanian counterparts at the central
level and the author of this ICR. On monitoring indicators, Component B performed equally well
with reductions in the number of beds (up to 33% in Alytus Country) (Table 3) and ALOS
(Figure 4); increases in population coverage by certified GPs (Figure 5); increases in utilization of
PHC non-specialist services higher than increases in utilization of PHC specialist services and
hospitalizations (Table 2); increases in outpatient surgery; and introduction of hospital finance
management and personnel/patient administration systems. In addition, in accordance with the
PIAs, Compulsory Health Insurance Fund (CHIF) resources were not used for the maintenance of
premises becoming vacant upon completion of hospital restructuring activities.

Component B had a great spill-over effect, as restructuring took place not only in the four
pilot counties but in the rest of the country, as well. This resulted in a reduction in the number
of beds by 19.5% in non-project counties (Figure 3). Furthermore, the GOL approved the second
stage of the "Strategy for the Restructuring of Health Care Institutions" in June 2006, providing
clear evidence of its intentions to continue the restructuring efforts.

A detailed list of country-specific performance indicators/targets included in PIAs is provided
below.3

Performance Indicators of the PIA in Alytus County.

55% of the Alytus County population is covered by qualified GPs by end of project. This
indicator was fulfilled in a highly satisfactory way. 62% of Alytus County population was
covered by qualified GPs by the end of the project (Figure 5).

The total number of hospital beds in the Alytus County Hospital is reduced by 20%. This
indicator was fulfilled in a highly satisfactory way. There was a 26% reduction in the number
of hospital beds by the end of the project (from 583 beds in 2000 to 431 in 2006).

Not less than 40% of all operations are performed in the day surgery center of the Alytus County
Hospital. This indicator was fulfilled in a moderately satisfactory way. 31% of all operations
in the Alytus County Hospital were performed in the day surgery center. The lower level of day
surgery operations was to due to the fact that the center started functioning in 2005.




3There are no indicators for Vilnius County. The Vilnius PIA included activities to be carried out under the
Vilnius Apskritis PHC Service Restructuring Program and the Hospital Restructuring Program, but no
performance indicators similar to the ones of the rest of the counties.


                                                     17

Average Length of Stay in the Alytus County Hospital is reduced to 9 days. This indicator was
fulfilled in a highly satisfactory way. ALOS in Alytus County Hospital reached a level of 6.9
days in 2006.

Performance Indicators of the PIA in Kaunas County.

55% of the Kaunas County population is covered by qualified GPs by end of project. This
indicator was fulfilled in a highly satisfactory way. 76.6% of Kaunas County population was
covered by qualified GPs by the end of the project (Figure 5).

The number of surgery beds in Kaunas Clinical Hospitals No.2 and No. 3 is reduced by 30%.
This indicator was fulfilled in a highly satisfactory way. By the end of project, there was a
38% reduction in the number of surgery beds in Kaunas Clinical Hospital No. 2 (from 150 beds in
2000 to 97 in 2006) and a 35% reduction in Kaunas Clinical Hospital No. 3 (from 140 beds in
2000 to 87 in 2006).

Not less than 4,000 operations (each) are performed in the day surgery centers of Kaunas
Clinical Hospitals No. 2 and 3. This indicator was fulfilled in a moderately satisfactory way.
Day surgery centers started operating in Kaunas Clinical Hospitals No. 2 and No. 3 in March
2005. During 2006, 1,391 operations took place in the day surgery centers.

Performance Indicators of the PIA in Utena County.

20% reduction in the number of referrals to specialists. This indicator was not fulfilled. There
was an 11% increase in the number of visits to specialists by the end of the project (from 5 visits
per capita in 2000 to 5.6 visits per capita in 2006). Increases in the number of visits to specialists
are probably closely related to decreases in the number of hospitalizations, with visits to
specialists operating as a substitute for hospitalizations. Although it was envisaged for visits to
specialists to be reduced because of a higher demand for ambulatory non-specialist visits, the
restructuring of the county hospital system reduced the number of hospitalizations and patients
sought specialist care. It is also worth noting that the highest increase in terms of health care
services was recorded for ambulatory non-specialist visits (with a per capita increase of 15.5%).

20% reduction in the number of direct arrangements to see specialists. This indicator cannot
be assessed due to lack of data.




                                                 18

30% reduction in the number of emergency calls. This indicator was not fulfilled. There was a
51% increase in the number of emergency calls by the end of the project (from 31,008 in 2000 to
47,126 in 2006). Nevertheless, this increase mainly involved calls for transportation of pregnant
women after the closing of the obstetric departments in Ignalina, Moletai and Zarasai hospitals;
based on the organizational system of the county, pregnant women are expected to call
emergency services when in need of transportation to the hospital. Unfortunately, there is no
available data on the number of emergency calls excluding the calls made by pregnant women
that would allow a more accurate assessment of this indicator.

5% reduction in the number of hospitalization cases. This indicator was fulfilled in a highly
satisfactory way. There was a 6.25% reduction in the number of hospitalizations by the end of
the project (from 32,000 in 2000 to 30,000 in 2006).

Provision of general surgical, gynecological and pediatric services is introduced without
increasing total number of beds in Visaginas Town Hospital. This indicator was fulfilled in a
highly satisfactory way. Number of births in Visaginas Town Hospital increased from 180 per
year in 2000 to 338 in 2005 (88% increase).

Component C

Performance indicators related to project management were fulfilled in a highly
satisfactory way with the exception of regular monitoring of progress towards achievement
of key performance indicators and agreed development objectives which is rated as
moderately satisfactory. Performance indicators of project management related to timely
contracting of goods, works, and services with quality outputs; efficiently managed PCU with
adequate staff and resources; satisfactory accounting systems, and annual audits; promotion of an
efficient dialogue among key project actors, and annual staff performance evaluations, and
training programs were rated as highly satisfactory. As mentioned before, the professionalism
and dedication of the PCU to project implementation constituted one of the main factors for the
project's success. The only exception was the documentation of progress towards achievement of
key performance indicators and agreed development objectives, which was rated as moderately
satisfactory as there was lack of complete data on M&E at the end of the project. Nevertheless, it
needs to be acknowledged that without the PCU involvement, the probability of collecting this
data ex post would have been very limited.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

The LHP was subject to an economic and financial analysis at preparation.

Economic Analysis. The costs of the project and the expected benefits were estimated in three
main areas: (i) policy development and support to national health institutions; (ii) HSR in the four
apskritis that support the PHC reform and hospital capacity optimization; and (iii) total costs and
benefits of the project including synergistic effects and indirect financial benefits.

The costs and benefits of the restructuring component were related to: (i) changes in referral rates
to hospitals and specialists; (ii) estimated benefits from expected changes in skills mix and
structure of medical staff, costs and benefits of pilot PHC practices with a special focus on the
shift of treatments from hospitals to PHC (including indirect benefits like reduced time-costs and
travel costs); (iii) savings due to expanding day care surgery and concentration of some care and


                                                 19

avoided duplications, benefits in terms of shorter ALOS and cuts in hospital beds; (iv) estimated
changes in direct costs and benefits for restructuring mental health by the expansion of out-patient
treatment; and (v) estimated costs and productivity gains due to investment in the ambulance
sector (including analyzing the volume of different services provided and organizational changes).
The summary project costs included also the cost for project management as well as an additional
benefit from the demonstration effect and synergistic effect of coordination and implementation
process (equal to 1% of public expenditure on health starting from midterm of the project). Data
for the analysis was derived from domestic reports, and from ad hoc data collection and research
(questionnaires, telephone interviews, etc.).

The economic analysis concluded that the project as a whole would yield an estimated internal
rate of return (IRR) of 41% if the indirect financial benefits were included. The indirect benefits
represented 14% of total project benefits, driven primarily by shorter length-of stay in hospitals
due to expansion of day-care surgery and ambulatory care. The total benefits over ten years were
nearly US$94 million and the net present value (NPV) over US$49 million.

Financial Analysis. The financial project analysis estimated recurrent costs linked to investments,
and analyzed how this would affect total public expenditure on health. The fiscal effects were to
a large extent equal to the economic costs and benefits, excluding indirect financial benefits. The
financial analysis concluded that the project would yield a financial rate of return (FRR) equal to
32% and a NPV of US$34.7 million.

A re-estimation of the IRR, FRR and NPV for the economic and financial analysis was not
possible due to the unavailability of the original project files. As stated in the PAD, details of
the economic and financial evaluations were available in project files. However, during ICR
preparation, it was not possible to locate these files either in the IRIS system or in the personal
files of the TTL at preparation time and the local consultants responsible for the collection of data
for the analysis. Some assumptions and data were included in the PAD, but they were not
sufficient for the re-estimation of the IRR and FRR and NPV.

Despite the fact that re-estimation of the project's IRR, FRR and NPV was not possible, the
achievement of performance indicators indicates that project benefits identified during
preparation were realized First, there was an increase in the utilization of PHC services as
compared to ambulatory specialist services and hospitalizations; this implied a reduction in the
cost of treatment for patients who were treated by GPs and otherwise would have been treated by
a specialist or at the hospital. Second, the creation of day surgery centers led to an increase in the
number of day surgeries; saving resources that otherwise would have been used to cover full
hospitalizations. Third, project activities resulted in a decrease in ALOS and an increase in BOR,
both clear measures of efficiency. Fourth, the project reduced the cost of utilities of health care
facilities by reducing excess building capacity. Finally, as demonstrated through the baseline and
evaluation surveys, there were improvements in patient satisfaction in project health care
facilities which were greater than the ones observed in control facilities.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating of the project is satisfactory. The objectives and implementation
of the LHP remain relevant and consistent with Lithuania's current development priorities in the
health sector as presented in the 2006 `Implementation Strategy of Health Care Reform's Aims
and Objectives' and the `Strategy for the Restructuring of Health Care Institutions.' The project


                                                  20

has achieved its development objectives in a satisfactory way as demonstrated through the
accomplishment of intended outcomes and outputs for most project indicators (Table 4). The
project contributed to the restructuring of PHC and the hospital sector in four pilot counties; the
strengthening of the capacity of national health institutions; and the development of a HMIS. The
project also assisted the process of policy development, albeit to a lesser extent, as political
decisions were not taken for all project reform issues. One of the most important contributions of
the project to the development of the health sector in Lithuania was paving the way for the
continuation and deepening of HSR in the whole country. Furthermore, the project served as a
catalyst for the development of the HMIS, as it addressed politically sensitive issues of data
confidentiality and end-users. Efficiency wise, the project resulted in reductions in ALOS and
number of hospital beds, increases in BOR and day surgeries and a re-focus towards PHC
services, amongst other things. Population baseline and evaluation surveys also demonstrated an
increase in patient satisfaction with PHC services in pilot counties.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The project had a substantial impact on institutional development in Lithuania's health
sector. Outcome indicators showing increased utilization of GP services and improvements in
patients' satisfaction indicate increased knowledge and capacity of physicians and nurses trained
under the project. Similarly, project activities assisted in increasing the understanding and raising
the awareness on reform issues of staff of national health institutions such as the LHIC, SPF,
TPFs and MOH. The continuation of the reform efforts through the second stage of the `Strategy
for the Restructuring of Health Care Institutions' provided further evidence of the impact of
project activities on the institutional capacity of national health authorities. At the county level,
implementation of project activities in pilot apskritis gave the opportunity to the local authorities
to interact with the central level and members of the international health community, and
participate in reform efforts. Finally, on project monitoring, Lithuania is one of the few countries
where the PCU has continued in the MOH after project completion and has become the
coordination unit for a different project.

Beneficiary Surveys
Two satisfaction surveys were carried out during project implementation: a baseline survey in
2001 and an evaluation survey in 2005.           The surveys provided information on patients'
satisfaction with PHC institutions in the pilot counties. Two types of population groups were
used; individuals who visited PHC facilities that participated in the project (project group) and
individuals who visited PHC facilities that did not participate in the project (control group).
Evaluation of patient satisfaction took into account issues such as time spent before seeing the
physician, features of the physician visited, duration of physician's visit, contact with medical
nurse, and suitability of premises. For details on survey results see Annex 5.

Stakeholder Workshops
Various stakeholder workshops were organized under Component A. These workshops formed
part of the deliverables of the two main TA contracts for consultant services. The first contract
included TA on the areas of Ambulance Service Development, Hospital Care Planning (Master-
planning) and Capacity Building. Results on these three areas were presented in a national
conference and three workshops. The second contract included TA on Resource Allocation
Formula Development, Provider Reimbursement and Contracting, Investment Allocation and
Public Information. Results on these areas were presented in one workshop, two training courses
and one seminar. Furthermore, two study tours were organized by consultants. The first study
tour aimed at familiarizing Lithuanian specialists with the Swedish ambulance system, while the
second study tour aimed at getting Lithuania experts acquainted with the Irish health information
system. Participants in these tours contributed to the preparation of the Ambulance Service
Strategy and HMIS. For more details see Annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The risk to development outcome is estimated to be moderate. The Government appears
committed to build on the achievements of the completed project especially in the areas of HSR
and HMIS. On HSR, the Government approved in 2006 the second stage of the "Strategy for the
Restructuring of Health Care Institutions" and it plans to intensify its efforts in this area in all
counties. Reductions in ALOS and BOR at a national level provided some early evidence of
improvements in the way public resource on health are used, but the Government needs to deepen
its efforts in HSR, Provider Reimbursement and a narrower definition of the BBP in order to
address the issue of indebtedness of the CHIF towards personal health care providers, pharmacies
and other health care institutions (actual expenditure on services and medicine exceed planned
expenditure). On HMIS, as already discussed, the Government is currently using EU structural
funds to finance the implementation of the remaining phases of the system. The EU funds will
finance the development of the remaining eight functions of the HMIS and roll-out of the system
in three regions.     The Government has also maintained the LHP PCU to administer the
implementation process under the new EU project.

In terms of public spending, Lithuania spent approximately 5% of its GDP on health in 2005, a
share which remained relatively stable during the period 2000-2005 (Table 5).                Public
expenditure on health represents the majority (75%) of total expenditure on health and increased
on average and in real terms at a similar pace as the GDP during the period 2000-2005. This, as
well as the fact that the level of increase of public expenditure on health (PEH) is higher than the
level of increase of total government expenditure provides more evidence of the importance that
the GOL places on the health sector. A sustained and increasing stream of public funds needs to
be directed to the health sector to maintain investments carried out in project and non-project sites



                                                 22

and to expand the reforms to the rest of the country. Nevertheless, as already discussed adequate
funding still needs to be combined with structural reforms in order to achieve a more efficient use
of resources and address the issue of debts.        The Government needs to pay attention to
stakeholder groups such as health professionals or county populations with vested interests in the
health sector that might attempt to postpone or stop reform efforts. In order to mitigate the social
risk related to these groups, the MOH could make use of its communications unit to support,
guide and train health care system stakeholders and the general public.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's performance during project preparation was moderately satisfactory. The
project was based on a sound and detailed background analysis that profited from a long
preparation period and a demand driven approach for competitive selection of pilot counties.
Nevertheless, although the PAD acknowledged that health sector reforms in the ECA Region
were a lengthy and politicized process and projects per se were complex, the Bank team did not
apply these lessons when designing the LHP. The LHP was a complex project with three
components and a total of 17 sub-components; 13 sub-components under Component A and four
sub-components under Component B. The inclusion of multiple reform issues under the Policy
Development sub-component in an environment of weak institutional capacity, frequent political
changes and a relatively low level of political commitment resulted in extensive institutional
discussions, but few political decisions. A simpler project structure could have benefited project
implementation, as well as monitoring and evaluation. The high number of sub-components
created the need for a high number of key performance indicators. A QAG assessement carried
out in October 2002 also identified problems in project design (e.g., "overly ambitious policy and
institutional reform agenda", "Yet, the design of this project did not adequately incorporate these
(the PAD) lessons.") and the quality of performance indicators (e.g., "The quality of performance
indicators could have been improved ­ to reduce the number of key indicators...").




                                                  23

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's performance during project implementation was moderately satisfactory. The
project was monitored through frequent implementation visits. Aide-memoires and follow-up
letters were prepared in a timely manner and served as the institutional memory for the project
and for highlighting pending or important issues to be followed up. Implementation teams
frequently visited sites in pilot counties to become better acquainted with project interventions.
The Bank team worked closely and effectively with the PCU and SIDA representatives who in a
number of cases joined Bank implementation reviews. Implementation could have benefited
from a more systematic M&E of key performance indicators. As mentioned in section 2.3, efforts
to collect data for M&E purposes were carried out during the project period. However, the
documenting of data was not completed. This was partly due to the large number of key
performance indicators and the difficult political environment with frequent changes of ministers
and a constant need for securing the commitment of the MOH's leadership on project activities.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance during project preparation, appraisal and supervision is
rated moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The government's performance is rated satisfactory. Both the central and local governments
in pilot counties ensured quality of project preparation and implementation and complied with
covenants and agreements, towards the achievement of development outcomes. A high level of
commitment was demonstrated in the area of HSR which took place not only in pilot counties but
in the rest of the country as well. In the area of Policy Development, although there is still ample
room for further policy reforms, the Government introduced a revised Resource Allocation
Formula and health-specific investment guidelines, and opened the dialogue on issues such as
Provider Reimbursement and Contracting, Ambulance Service Development and the content of
the BBP. The Government also provided timely counterpart financing for the project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of the MOH is rated moderately satisfactory.                   The MOH actively
participated in project preparation and provided its support to project activities during
implementation. However, fewer changes in the ministry's leadership and more active
collaboration by the Chair of the Steering Committee might have contributed to a smoother and
faster project implementation, especially during the first three years of the project. Furthermore,
a stronger level of commitment to project activities related to policy development might have a
led to additional policy decisions with respect to key reform areas such as provider
reimbursement and contracting, the content of the BBP, ambulance service development, etc.




                                                 24

The performance of the PCU is rated satisfactory. The PCU did a good job in implementing
the project in a volatile political environment. The PCU repeatedly secured ministerial support
following changes in the leadership of the MOH. The PCU was well organized and effective in
dealing with procurement, disbursement, progress reports, and in maintaining proper records of
the project. The PCU was responsive and attentive to Bank requests and suggestions. The PCU
should have paid even greater attention in systematically monitoring the project and documenting
this process.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The borrower's overall performance is rated satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

The following lessons can be drawn from the implementation of the Lithuania Health Project:

1. Systematic and documented monitoring of project performance indicators allows for better
    project evaluation and increases considerably the demonstration impact that a project can
    have both in a national and international context.

2. Government ownership not only leads to better implemented projects, but also increases the
    probability of continuing with the reform efforts after the completion of the project. In the
    area of HSR, strong government commitment led to the expansion of the restructuring
    process to non-pilot counties and the adoption of a second stage of the "Strategy for the
    Restructuring of Health Care Institutions."

3. The complexity of projects should be adjusted to the country's context and circumstances.

4. Frequent changes of key persons in the government and the sectoral ministries have an
    adverse impact on the speed and the level of project implementation.

5. Bank management should assure continuity of staff during project implementation.

6. In projects that involve HSR, the existence of some type of conditionality between the project
    activities and the availability of funds (i.e., in the Lithuania case, funds became available at
    the county level only after PIAs were signed) increases the probability that HSR is
    successfully implemented. WB experience in other ECA countries and in similar projects
    demonstrate few changes in the number of hospital facilities, departments and beds when
    there is no conditionality between the restructuring efforts and the availability of funds.

7. Availability of medication and equipment in PHC facilities and better premises increase
    patient satisfaction with the provision of services. As the satisfaction surveys carried out
    under the LHP showed, individuals visiting project facilities referred to better premises and
    the possibility of having all necessary exams at the facility among the main factors of
    increased satisfaction.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(b) Cofinanciers

SIDA informed the Bank that it would not be able to provide comments or a contribution to this
ICR due to the fact that SIDA employees who participated in the supervision of the LHP were not
available or had left the organization.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

This section aims at providing brief evaluations and ratings of achievements by components.
Information on project outputs that are closely related to key project indicators and commented in
the main body of the ICR is not repeated. The section rather presents a summary of what has
been achieved and how it is related to project objectives.

Component A. Support to Health Reform (actual total cost US$7.04 million): Moderately
Satisfactory.

Sub-component A1. Policy Development (actual total cost US$0.92 million): Moderately
Satisfactory. Under the sub-component of Policy Development, TA was provided for six reform
areas: geographic resource allocation system, investment funding, provider reimbursement and
contracting, needs assessment and service planning, development of the BBP, and health care
delivery system restructuring. TA was organized under two main contracts for consultant services.
The first contract included TA on the areas of Ambulance Service Development and Hospital
Care Planning (alias health care delivery system restructuring) and Capacity Building in these
two areas. The second contract included TA on Resource Allocation Formula Development,
Provider Reimbursement and Contracting, Investment Allocation and provision of Public
Information in these areas. Despite the fact that contract deliverables were produced as stipulated
in the TORs, policy decisions were taken regarding three areas: the resource allocation formula,
investment funding, and the health care service restructuring (both in pilot and non-pilot counties).
Project outputs related to needs assessment and service planning were considered integrated in
the health service restructuring strategy developed by the Government. On provider
reimbursement and contracting, despite various changes during the project period on contract
mechanisms applied by the SPF, no final decisions have been taken yet. On BBP, efforts
concentrated on the development of guidelines and treatment protocols and although
approximately 20 set of standard protocols were prepared, the content of the BBP has not
changed considerably.

Sub-component A2. Strengthening Capacity of National Health institutions (actual total cost
US$0.32 million): Satisfactory. Outputs related to the strengthening of the Communications Unit
of the MOH, the Medical Library and the LHIC were generated according to LHP requirements.
These activities greatly contributed to the strengthening of the institutional capacity of these
institutions to implement policy reform.         Institutional strengthening included staff skill
development, provision of information, tools, and methodologies, and building capacity to
effectively communicate with the consumers and main stakeholders of the health care system.
Funds destined for study tours for the National Health Board were reallocated by the government
to the financing of TA under sub-component A1, the financing requirements of which were
under-estimated at project preparation.

Sub-component A3. Information Management (actual total cost US$5.74 million): Satisfactory.
Implementation of activities under the Health Management Information (HMIS) component
started approximately two years after project effectiveness. There were various reasons for this
delay: i) there was lack of clarity in the Government and the health sector in general regarding the
content of the HMIS, ii) non-technical issues such as issues of confidentiality and legal issues
needed to be addressed in advance of any project activities, iii) there were various institutions that
demanded the control of primary data and iv) there was lack of institutional capacity to fully



                                                 29

develop the HMIS (or E-Health). Following intense discussions between the MOH, SPF, LHIC,
University hospitals and health care providers, a formal working group was created in 2002
including representatives of all the above-mentioned institutions. The working group, with
assistance from Swedish consultants, elaborated a strategy which was complemented by a
feasibility study. In a following stage, the Concept (Core system) of the E-Health project was
prepared and four functions ­the basic electronic patient record, patient registration with PHC
providers, referrals to secondary and tertiary level services and laboratories, and records of
results- were developed. Relatively recently, in 2006, the Government also took the decision that
the owner of the new system will be the MOH and the initial administrator will be SPF where the
system will be physically located. The SPF will be responsible for distributing data to the users,
e.g., MOH, LHIC, etc. The revolutionary element of E-Health was changing the focus from
information collected having as a starting point the episode of care (e.g., no. of PHC visits,
hospitalization records, etc.) to a personalized health care record which included clinical
information related to the person.

Further development of the HMIS (the remaining 11 functions and roll-out of the system in three
regions) is currently financed through EU Structural Funds.

Component B: Strengthening Capacity of National Health Institutions (actual total cost
US$21.64 million): Highly Satisfactory. Activities under this component were implemented in
a highly satisfactory way in all four counties (Alytus, Kaunas, Utena and Vilnius) once the PIAs
were signed. This has been supported both by the excellent quality of civil works in health care
facilities and the achievement of most performance targets in the PIAs. The varying level of time
and difficulty for the signing of the PIAS was due to local elections in 2000 and the fact that the
restructuring programs in some pilot counties were more challenging involving the merging of
hospital facilities and the closing of hospital departments. Furthermore, this component had a
significant demonstration effect as HSR took place in the rest of the country as well.

Component C: Project Management (actual total cost US$1.13 million): Highly Satisfactory.
The LPH benefited by the presence of a strong PCU, both in the MOH and the pilot regions. The
PCU worked in a professional and dedicated manner in order to guarantee smooth
implementation of a complex project in a volatile political environment. This had a highly
positive impact on project implementation and it was acknowledged, unanimously, by Bank staff
and project beneficiaries (e.g. health care providers involved in the project, employees of national
health institutions, etc.) in project documents and interviews carried out during the preparation of
this ICR. Project management could benefit by a more systematic and better documented
monitoring of project performance indicators. Nevertheless, it needs to be acknowledged that
without the valuable help of the PCU, the collection of data for the monitoring indicators ex post
might not have been possible.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The LHP was subject to an economic and financial analysis at preparation.

Economic Analysis. The costs of the project and the expected benefits were estimated in three
main areas: (i) policy development and support to national health institutions; (ii) HSR in the four
apskritis that support the PHC reform and hospital capacity optimization; and (iii) total costs and
benefits of the project including synergistic effects and indirect financial benefits.

The costs and benefits of the restructuring component were related to: (i) changes in referral rates
to hospitals and specialists; (ii) estimated benefits from expected changes in skills mix and
structure of medical staff, costs and benefits of pilot PHC practices with a special focus on the
shift of treatments from hospitals to PHC (including indirect benefits like reduced time-costs and
travel costs); (iii) savings due to expanding day care surgery and concentration of some care and
avoided duplications, benefits in terms of shorter ALOS and cuts in hospital beds; (iv) estimated
changes in direct costs and benefits for restructuring mental health by the expansion of out-patient
treatment; and (v) estimated costs and productivity gains due to investment in the ambulance
sector (including analyzing the volume of different services provided and organizational changes).
The summary project costs included also the cost for project management as well as an additional
benefit from the demonstration effect and synergistic effect of coordination and implementation
process (equal to 1% of public expenditure on health starting from midterm of the project). Data
for the analysis was derived from domestic reports, and from ad hoc data collection and research
(questionnaires, telephone interviews, etc.).

The economic analysis concluded that the project as a whole would yield an estimated internal
rate of return (IRR) of 41% if the indirect financial benefits were included. The indirect benefits
represented 14% of total project benefits, driven primarily by shorter length-of stay in hospitals
due to expansion of day-care surgery and ambulatory care. The total benefits over ten years were
nearly US$94 million and the net present value (NPV) over US$49 million.

Financial Analysis. The financial project analysis estimated recurrent costs linked to investments,
and analyzed how this would affect total public expenditure on health. The fiscal effects were to
a large extent equal to the economic costs and benefits, excluding indirect financial benefits. The
financial analysis concluded that the project would yield a financial rate of return (FRR) equal to
32% and a NPV of US$34.7 million.

A re-estimation of the IRR, FRR and NPV for the economic and financial analysis was not
possible due to the unavailability of the original project files. As stated in the PAD, details of
the economic and financial evaluations were available in project files. However, during ICR
preparation, it was not possible to locate these files either in the IRIS system or in the personal
files of the TTL at preparation time and the local consultants responsible for the collection of data
for the analysis. Some assumptions and data were included in the PAD, but they were not
sufficient for the re-estimation of the IRR and FRR and NPV.

Despite the fact that re-estimation of the project's IRR, FRR and NPV was not possible, the
achievement of performance indicators indicates that project benefits identified during
preparation were realized First, there was an increase in the utilization of PHC services as

compared to ambulatory specialist services and hospitalizations; this implied a reduction in the
cost of treatment for patients who were treated by GPs and otherwise would have been treated by
a specialist or at the hospital. Second, the creation of day surgery centers led to an increase in the
number of day surgeries; saving resources that otherwise would have been used to cover full
hospitalizations. Third, project activities resulted in a decrease in ALOS and an increase in BOR,
both clear measures of efficiency. Fourth, the project reduced the cost of utilities of health care
facilities by reducing excess building capacity. Finally, as demonstrated through the baseline and
evaluation surveys, there were improvements in patient satisfaction in project health care
facilities which were greater than the ones observed in control facilities.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
(if any)

Two satisfaction surveys were carried out during project implementation: a baseline survey in
2001 and an evaluation survey in 2005.                       The surveys provided information on patients'
satisfaction with PHC institutions in the pilot counties. Two types of population groups were
used; individuals who visited PHC facilities that participated in the project (project group) and
individuals who visited PHC facilities that did not participate in the project (control group).
Evaluation of patient satisfaction took into account issues such as time spent before seeing the
physician, features of the physician visited, duration of physician's visit, contact with medical
nurse and suitability of premises.

Based on the survey results, patient satisfaction with service provision in PHC ambulatories
increased by 9.5% between the baseline and evaluation periods (Table 5.1). However, no
changes in the level of patient satisfaction were observed for services provided in polyclinics
between the two periods. When taking into account both ambulatories and polyclinics, patient
satisfaction increased by 1% for the project group (individuals who visited facilities participating
in the project). An increase in patient satisfaction for services provided in PHC ambulatories was
also registered for the control group but it was lower compared to the one of the main group
(8.7%). In the case of polyclinics, the control group registered a decrease of 5% in patient
satisfaction. The main reasons for patient dissatisfaction in both project and control groups were
long queues, doctors with low level of qualifications and inability to carry all tests in the facility.

Below, we provide a brief overview of various survey outcomes. This list is not exhaustive.

    Increase in the number of GPs working in ambulatories, as compared to the number of
    Therapists and Pediatricians between the two surveys.

    Increase in the frequency that patients visited PHC survey institutions (ambulatories and
    polyclinics) between the two surveys.

    Easy access to the telephone center of PHC institutions. The situation did not changed
    between the baseline and evaluation surveys for both project and control groups.

    Improved satisfaction with the behavior and characteristics of the personnel working in the
    registration counter of PHC institutions for the project group between the baseline and
    evaluation surveys. There was no change in the control group.




                                                             35

On average, patients waited 33 minutes to see a physician in 2005. The corresponding time in
2001 was slightly lower at 30 minutes.

Improved satisfaction with the behavior and characteristics of the physician for the project
group between the two surveys; physicians in ambulatories achieved higher scores than
physicians in polyclinics. There was no change in patient satisfaction with the behavior and
characteristics of the physician for the control group.

Among different specialists, there was an increase in the level of satisfaction experienced
when consulting a GP as compared to a Therapist or a Pediatrician between the two survey
periods.

Urgent cases in the control group were referred more often to secondary specialists as
compared to urgent cases in the project group.

Increase in the share of patients communicating with nurses working together with the
physician, especially in PHC institutions of the project group, between the two surveys.

Increase in the level of satisfaction with the environment (interior of premises, adaptation of
premises for the specific nature of the institution, clarity of directions and signs) both for the
project and control groups between the two surveys.

Stakeholder Workshops
Various stakeholder workshops were organized under Component A. These workshops formed
part of the deliverables of the two main TA contracts for consultant services. The first contract
included TA on the areas of Ambulance Service Development, Hospital Care Planning (Master-
planning) and Capacity Building. Results on these three areas were presented in a national
conference and three workshops. The second contract included TA on Resource Allocation
Formula Development, Provider Reimbursement and Contracting, Investment Allocation and
Public Information. The TA also included the organization the following workshops, training
courses, and seminars:

        Workshop for SPF/TPFs on capacity building in modeling and statistical techniques to
        evaluate TPFs theoretical budgets after the application of the new formula;
        Training course for SPF/TPFs and managers/economists in major providers on
        modernization of contracting between purchasers and providers;
        Training course on how to conduct rational planning for investment and disinvestment in
        facilities and equipment at national and regional level, linked with service plans and
        norms;
        Seminar for SPF/TPFs staff on organization of public information campaigns.

Furthermore, two study tours were organized by consultants. The first study tour aimed at
familiarizing Lithuanian specialists with the Swedish ambulance system, while the second study
tour aimed at getting Lithuania experts acquainted with the Irish health information system.
Participants in these tours contributed to the preparation of the Ambulance Service Strategy and
HMIS.

     · Actual financing of the project by 31 August 2006 (see table attached).

5. PROJECT-RELATED ACHIEVEMENTS

     · Expanded network of primary health care services resulting from the establishment of
        new GP offices in rural areas (by replacing former medical points or building the
        offices anew) or by renovating the old ones in towns; suitable working conditions
        ensured (premises renovated, medical and other equipment purchased).
     · Access to the services provided by qualified GPs ensured to 55% of county inhabitants.
     · Establishment of GP offices in Alytus policlinic and concentration of outpatient
        services at Alytus hospital allowed for the consolidation of the concept of general
        practice in line with which GPs provide services to families without separating children
        from adults.
     · Renovation of GP offices allowed saving about 20-30% of resources allocated for the
        heating of premises.
     · Day surgery centres established and equipped at Kaunas 2nd clinical hospital and Alytus
        and Kaunas county hospitals by adjusting the existing premises or operating theatres.
        After the day surgery centres started functioning, the number of in-patients decreased
        by 20-30%, the average length of stay has significantly decreased.
     · In Utena county specialized health care services falling under the main health care
        profiles were concentrated in three county hospitals: Utena, Anyksciai and Visaginas
        hospitals. Utena and Visaginas hospitals received investments for renovation, Moletai
        hospital ­ for renovation and equipment, Anyksciai hospital ­ only for equipment.
        Medical equipment in these hospitals has been concentrated in resuscitation
        departments and intensive care units.
     · In Kaunas and Utena counties plans for the development of ambulance services were
        prepared and approved by regional development councils. These plans conform to the
        new concept of the Ministry of Health to replace 40 ambulance cars (30 in Kaunas and
        10 in Utena), while fuel costs per one kilometre were cut by 10 %.
     · In Kaunas county a programme for the prevention of cardio-vascular diseases was
        implemented. According to this programme, risk factors of the above diseases are
        controlled by the newly established prevention rooms equipped with the necessary
        medical equipment and computers.
     · In all municipalities of Kaunas county mental health services were established, 11
        community mental health teams were formed and provided with renovated and
        accommodated premises and supplied with necessary equipment.
     · Vilkpede hospital (former Railway) located in Vilnius city was reconstructed and
        transformed from a general profile hospital into a nursing and palliative care hospital.
     · Having restructured health care institutions and started using the existing premises
        more rationally, several buildings were abandoned and transferred from health care
        sector for other needs.

6.   USEFUL OBSERVATIONS IN RELATION TO PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION



                                              40

      · One of the aims of the project was to provide consultations of foreign experts to the
Government of Lithuania on the reorganization of the ineffectively functioning part of health care
system. The acquisition of technical assistance was to be financed from the grants issued by the
governments of Sweden and Japan, however, the Government of Lithuania was supposed to
choose only Swedish consultants. Therefore, the suggested models for the reorganization of
health care system came from Scandinavian countries where the financing of health care system
as well as traditions significantly differ from those in Lithuania. The Government of Lithuania
was not provided with an opportunity to gain experience from a broader scope of countries.
      · The frequent change of the World Bank's staff (TTLs, PTLs, procurement specialists),
which has been working with Lithuanian Health Project team, as well as change of Ministers of
Health and executives of the Ministry impeded the implementation of the Project.
      · Continuity of aspiration to project aims was safeguarded by:
           1)    Concluding project implementation agreements between the founders of health
care institutions (municipal councils and county manager's administrations) and the Ministry of
Health setting the conditions for programme funding based on the fulfilment of obligations
undertaken by the founders with regard to the reorganization of health care institutions. For
example, in case of failure to fulfil obligations, i.e. not having restructured health care institutions
as provided for in the agreement or not having prepared and approved concept strategies for the
implementation of the programme that would be acceptable to the World Bank, financing for the
relevant programme would not be allocated, and vice versa.
           Project implementation agreements also ensured continuity of implementation of
Lithuania-Health Project despite the frequent change of Ministers of Health and executives of the
Ministry.
           2)    Ensuring active involvement of final beneficiaries into project implementation
and delegating responsibility by closely cooperating in preparing specifications, assessing tender
proposals, accepting goods or works, carrying technical maintenance of construction ­ renovation
works, appointing authorized representatives to workgroups with decision right, etc.
           3)    Managing and administrating project implementation. A separate institution
authorized to act on behalf of the Ministry of Health and staffed with properly trained specialists
in project implementation was able to organize project implementation and ensure monitoring of
results much more effectively.
