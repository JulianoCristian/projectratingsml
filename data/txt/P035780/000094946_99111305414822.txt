A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The project development objective is to improve the efficiency, equity and access of the Lithuania
health care system. Key performance indicators measure: (i) improved equity of resource allocation
among health regions (apskritis), (ii) cost-containment through effective contracting between the State
Patient Funds and health care providers; (iii) efficiency gains through hospital services consolidation and
restructuring in four pilot regions; and (iv) improved access to General Practitioner services in four pilot
regions.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 13677-LT               Date of latest CAS discussion: May 11, 1999
The project supports the Bank's objectives to design cost-effective, financially viable social
safety net and human development program and to help reorient public services and infrastructure in order
to provide adequate and cost-effective social services. In the health sector it translates into orientation of
medical services towards a general practice-based primary health care system, optimization and
improvement in quality of hospital services, and introduction of appropriate financial incentives and
efficient management into the health financing system.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Lithuania is a small, urbanized (68 percent) Baltic state with a population of 3.7 million (1997)
bordered by Latvia, Belarus, Poland, Russia and the Baltic Sea. Ethnic Lithuanians make up about 82
percent of the population, Russians 8 percent and others 10 percent. Major towns include the capital,
Vilnius (580,000), Kaunas (419,000), Klaipeda (203,000), Siauliai (147,000) and Panevezys (133,000).
After high inflation and sharp declines in income and social indicators during the initial years of
independence (1991), the economy has stabilized and growth has resumed. GDP per capita in 1997 was
US$2,128 (based on exchange rate) or US$4,245 (based on purchasing power parity). Lithuania is
implementing reforms for transition to a market economy and membership in the European Union (EU)
(see Annex 10).
The main health sector issues are similar to other CEE/FSU countries. Aggregate health
indicators have deteriorated compared to the pre-transition period (pre- 1991), leaving Lithuania with a
significant gap in health status in comparison with the EU countries Lithuania wants to join. The health
system does not proactively address the root causes of ill health because of the lack of effective public
health policies and programs. The health system is also not able to reactively cope with the increased
burden of ill health because of an inefficient health care delivery and health financing system. Declining
public funding for health services and poor maintenance of investments in health care infrastructure
exacerbates the situation. Lithuania is implementing a health reform and facing the challenges of
restructuring its health sector to adjust to changing socio-economic, epidemiologic, and demographic
realities.
Lack of effective public health policies and programs to address large preventable burden of
disease. The natural growth of the population has been negative since 1991, because of declining birth
rates and increased mortality.' Life expectancy for men fell from 66.9 years in 1988-1990 to 63.8 in 1994-
1996 and for women from 76.3 to 75.4 years. Life expectancy at 15 years of age has declined over the past
15 years and the gap with developed countries increased. In 1994, it was 55.2 years overall (declined 4
I     Birth rate per 1,000 population declined from 14.3 in 1992 to 10.4 1997; mortality increased from 1 1.1 in 1992 to peak
12.5 in 1994 and subsiding to 11.1 in 1997.

percent from 1981), but only 49.2 years for men (6 percent decline from 1981).2 There is a significant
health status gap between the men and women as well as between urban and rural men. However, in
terms of aggregate health status indicators, Lithuania has performed better than its Baltic neighbors (Table
1).3
As one of the main contributors to avoidable mortality status, mortality from coronary heart
disease before age 64 has increased 1.5
times since 1981, and is 3 times higher                 LV      LT    EM        .       FS      D

quality of the perinatal case
management.
Contributing factors to this negative trend in health status are: (i) deteriorating socio-economic
conditions during transition; (ii) behavioral risk factors of medium and long term impact (tobacco, alcohol,
diet, physical activity); (iii) behavioral health determinants of immediate impact (alcohol related injuries,
poisonings, suicides); and, to some extent (iv) increased mortality from health conditions amenable to
health care interventions (perinatal mortality, CVD mortality, TB).
Socio-economic conditions. GDP fell by 30 percent between 1990 and 1994. Average annual
decline of real wages was between 11.7 percent and 45.3 percent between 1991 and 1993. Inflation has
come down from a staggering 1100 percent in 1992 to single digit numbers by 1998. Socioeconomic
changes are likely to be the main factor behind extraordinarily high suicide rates reaching 46.4 per
100,000 population in 1996.
Poverty is among the factors which affect health status of population. It should be noted that the
poverty level during the period from 1990 - 1997 has remained roughly at the same level. According to
the poverty line of 50 percent of average expenditure per household member in 1997, the poor made up
16.6 percent of the total population, the GINI co-efficient is 31%. To contrast the official poverty line, 27
percent of the population perceives themselves as poor. Variation of poverty among different groups of
the population reveals that poverty is the highest among: (i) families with small children (37.2 percent of
families with 3 or more children); (ii) pensioners (22 percent); (iii) rural populations (prevalence of
poverty 25.9 percent compared to 9.7 percent in the five largest cities). A study in the Kaunas region
revealed statistically significant differences in health status between urban and rural populations in favor
of the former.4 As children and the elderly are conventionally the biggest consumers of health services,
health system is an important part of safety net to protect the poor. Improved access, equity and quality of
national health service, in particular in rural areas, would disproportionately benefit the poor in Lithuania.

Life-style related risk factors. Various isolated surveys5 on risk factors have been conducted but
little information is available for cross-country or longitudinal comparisons. The prevalence of smoking
(50% among men and 10% among women) and alcohol consumption is similar to the average in Western
European countries and notably less than in other former Soviet Union countries. It is estimated that 7,000
people a year die (20% of overall mortality) from tobacco-related illnesses. Increased alcohol psychosis,
suicide and crime rates are being associated with increased alcohol abuse.6 Nutritional habits differ
considerably from what WHO considers healthy: fat intake accounts for 47 percent and carbohydrates for
38 percent of total energy intake compared to WHO recommended 30 percent and 55 percent respectively.
Mortality and disability from non-communicable disease and injury is amenable by improvements in
socio-economic conditions and cost-effective primary and secondary care interventions.
The public health system. Historically oriented towards infectious diseases and environmental
health, the public health system has currently little capacity and leadership to comprehensively address the
above root causes of non-communicable disease mortality. The National Health Concept (1991) and the
Law of the Health System of the Republic of Lithuania (1994) call for strengthened emphasis on health
promotion and disease prevention but until recently the country lacked a national focal point to provide
leadership for public health reform. A National Health Board, established in 1998 to advise the Parliament
on public health issues and put together and publish an annual national health report, as well as recently
established State Commission of Health Affairs to advise the Minister of Health, may well become a
catalyst for comprehensive public health reform. As a first step, a comprehensive national health program
was developed and approved by the Parliament.7
The Program outlines a comprehensive strategy to tackle nation's public health issues and it relies
on implementation of various primary prevention (health promotion), secondary prevention (screening and
early treatment), public health research and several inter-sectoral measures. The Program also proposes to
develop by 2005 a national public health surveillance instrument to monitor the key risk factors and
proxies of public health status and progress towards the targets provided in the Program. However, some
of the most effective health protection measures such as substantial increase of tobacco price or removing
subsidies from high fat content food products are yet to be included into national public health strategy. In
1998, specific excise duty on cigarettes translated to LTL 0.5 (US$0.125 equivalent) per pack of 20
cigarettes. The overall tax content of the retail price for the most popular cigarette brands of LTL 3
(US$0.75 equivalent) was about 30% percent which is the lowest among the Baltic states and far below
EU recommended 50 percent and does not create significant price barriers for tobacco consumption.
Introducing anti-tobacco legislation in Lithuania is complicated because of a strong tobacco lobby backed
by Philip Morris, one of the largest foreign investors in Lithuania.
An inefficient health care delivery system could be characterized by excessive, poorly organized,
low quality hospital infrastructure; absence of first level and family care and related over-reliance on
inpatient treatment (one survey suggests that 25 percent of patients in Lithuania are inappropriately placed
in acute care beds); and a poorly distributed mix of human resource skills (too many specialist physicians,
too few skilled nurses and managers). This structural inheritance from the Soviet health system plus
shortcomings of policy framework and low institutional capacity are contributing factors to inefficiency.
There is scope for considerable improvement in allocative efficiency towards primary health care and
improved technical efficiency in the hospital sector through appropriate incentives and restructuring. Until
to date, the Govermment has tried to use various normative instruments to correct for inefficiencies in the
health care delivery but so far, these interventions have not produced tangible changes.
In late 1996, Lithuania had 197 inpatient institutions with 39,182 beds. Although the number of
hospital beds has declined compared to 1990 levels by 7,000 (15 percent) and hospital production shows

alcohol consumption patterns (e.g. alcohol abuse, binge drinking, alcohol dependency). Moderate consumption can

efficiency gains, the main efficiency indicators remain below international benchmarks (Table 2).
Progress in optimizing the bed capacity has been the least among the Baltic countries, partly due to a lack
of clear restructuring policy and adverse financial incentives, but also because of a politically complex
health system environment with several major competing health care establishments (including the largest
hospital in Europe in Kaunas) and several layers of administration. Estimates about remaining excess
capacity in hospitals vary from 10,000 to 20,000 beds (25-50 percent). The analysis of distribution of
admissions and hospital utilization indicators reveals that district level hospitals have the most excess
capacity (6 percent of bed complement handling 4 percent of admissions with the lowest bed occupancy
rates - 70 percent).8

Consolidation of acute care services is needed to improve quality of care and efficiency of
dissemination of medical technologies. This should be achieved through a mix of regulatory measures
(planning, norms, management of investment expenditures), strengthening Primary Health Care services,
incentive structures (health financing systems), improving management capacity of all levels in the health
care system and consensus building activities. The Government's current focus is on development of
national guidelines and norms for service provision. But it is likely that administrative measures alone
will not yield to significant changes given its vulnerability to political manipulations.

care. The outcome of an ineffective PHC
system is best reflected in over-utilization of ambulance services (see Figure 1) and over-referrals by
district therapists (up to 50 percent of office visits).

Recognizing the underlying structural issues, Lithuania adopted in 1995 a Primary Health Care
Reform Implementation Strategy.10 The main components of the strategy were a gradual introduction of
the general practitioner/family physician (GP) institution, retraining a significant number of district
pediatricians and obstetricians in family medicine, conversion of large policlinics into specialized
diagnostic and treatment centers; conversion of smaller policlinics into health centers and GP group
practices; focus on community, patient choice of GP, capitation financing of GPs and gatekeeping
function. The strategy proposed a 10 year implementation period but the process has been delayed mainly
because of a lack of funds and delays in the introduction of key regulatory acts (A General Practice Law).
Limited number of nursing and support beds has been raised as an issue in Lithuania. The
Ministry of Health is discussing a conversion of excess acute care capacity into nursing and support beds.
Recent experience from other countries shows that the needs of the frail elderly and chronically ill are
better and more efficiently met through multi-disciplinary community based services, where the nursing
and medical professions across the line of social and health services join to give the appropriate services
and support. Wide con-version of hospital capacity for this purpose might become counter-productive to
this necessary development. There will be need for hospital-type chronic care - both as long-term care and
convalescent and rehabilitation care (for example after stroke or major trauma), but the right size of this
capacity can only be appropriately determined in settings where the alternative community-based services
- home care, home nursing, various forms of assisted living and dementia care - are in place. This all calls
for flexible financing and administrative arrangements. In this area of services the principle of "money
follows the patient/client" across the sector lines between health and social would be most useful to
reorient the services. The currently established national norm of one nursing care bed per 1,000
population needs to be reviewed. Successful community based programs require good integration and co-
ordination of social and health care which in Lithuania is hindered by different administration levels and
financing flows.
The Government has taken steps to introduce community-based health services to improve quality
of service and in the longer, term provide viable alternatives for institutional care. In particular, the MOH
has developed a community nurse concept1I and is planning to strengthen community mental health
services. There is need to develop further the concepts (e.g. integration of community medical and social
care) and integration of mental health services with PHC. Mental health services have been given high
political priority by the President of the country because of extraordinarily high suicide rates in Lithuania.
Restructuring of mental health services should be based on effective organization of ambulatory services.
Ambulatory services should be developed at least on two fronts: (1) to offer alternative living
arrangements and services to chronic patients with usually lengthy hospital care careers and (2) to offer
modern non-stigmatizing outpatient services to persons with the types of mental health and psycho-social
problems that are becoming more and more apparent: depression, anxiety, problems with substance abuse,
etc. In both cases the direction of development should be to integrate the necessary services with the
general health services, especially Primary Health Care, and to due extent with also social services.
Human resources supply is in excess compared to the European states and Lithuania's Baltic
neighbours. There has been a non-significant reduction of 1 percent in a number of physicians since the
level of 1990. Although in view of harmonization with European Union practices, the Government has
consolidated previously 1 16 medical (sub)specialties into 40 specialty categories, the supply of physicians
is unbalanced. In 1996, 77 percent of physicians were in specialties normally related to general hospitals,
only 0.6 percent were classified as General Practitioners (GP).12 There are also significant regional

imbalances in physician supply ranging from 1.3 per 1,000 population in some predominantly rural
counties to 6.2 in big cities. A study on physician supply planning in Lithuania predicted a 2,000
physician oversupply by 2005 and recommended a major restructuring of workforce, including retraining
district therapists and pediatricians as general practitioners, introducing an automated health care human
resource information system, and using a "physician supply" model as a planning instrument.13 The human
resources supply needs to be optimized, skills need to be improved, retrenchment considered through
retraining schemes and severance packages and enrollment into medical schools and residency programs
regulated, based on future need projections.
Increased cost of pharmaceuticals and utilities have put pressure on escalation of health care costs.
Upward pressure on health personnel salaries will also have an impact on health services cost over
medium term. Expected economic growth will not fill the gap and steps toward health services
optimization and decisions about health care priorities need to be taken.
Management of health expenditures. Since 1990, Government expenditures on health have
fluctuated, reflecting difficulties in the entire economy. In 1994, health care expenditure amounted to 751
million LTL which accounted for 4.4 percent of GDP. This was 70 percent of the 1992 expenditure level
in constant prices. In 1997 health care expenditures amounted to 1,609 million LTL or 4.2 percent of
GDP. Public health spending in 1997 was 7.6 percent of the state expenditure, down from 14.3 percent in
1996. The sources of public funding are: (i) payroll tax (3 percent); (ii) 30 percent of income tax; (iii) a
contribution from the national budget which is defined by Seimas every year as part of national budget
(see Table 3). Most of the public health funds (84 percent in 1997) are consolidated and administered
through the State Patient Fund (SPF) system that carry on health insurance contracting health service
providers through ten territorial Patient Funds (TPF). Ministry of Health (MOH) and Municipalities
administer funds assigned for health promotion and prevention programs, investment progran and budgets
for selected health system institutions.
Lithuania has taken considerable steps in reforming the health financing system towards
separation of purchasing and provision of health services. Delayed introduction of a relatively
straightforward system has ensured that many of the pitfalls encountered by other countries of CEE and
the FSU have been avoided or reduced. Some important strengths of the current system are: (i)
consolidation of health financing administration in the SPF and 10 regional branch offices that allows for
efficient risk pooling, need based planning and participation in regional health services planning through
long term funding arrangements (all these opportunities are currently not used, however); (ii) a service-

long term funding arrangements (all these opportunities are currently not used, however); (ii) a service-
based remuneration system that is reasonably simple to administer although there are anomalies (discussed
further below); (iii) a SPF that does not collect contributions and can, therefore, concentrate on the
payment and purchasing function; (iv) funding for personal health care allocated through the SPF, hence
no problem of multiple funding pipelines; (v) providers having considerable autonomy over budgeting and
resource use; and, (vi) providers responding to financial incentives and evidence of entrepreneurial
activity.
However, there are several ways in which the system must continue to develop to better meet the
needs of the population. The overarching issue is that the system is currently supply rather than health
needs driven. There are a number of areas that should be examined in order to address this weakness: (a)

supply-driven resource allocation; (b) inefficient management of investment expenditure; (c) inefficient
purchasing practices; and (d) payment systems that encourage over-referral and hospital admission.
Supply-driven resource allocation. Patient Fund allocations are determined by the level of
services provided by secondary and tertiary facilities within the territorial boundaries. This results in large
cross-territorial variations in per capita allocation. TPFs do not have incentives to search for the most cost-
effective provider of care for the territory's population, regardless of geographic location of the provider.
Providers are not encouraged to offer cost-effective services since their funding is guaranteed.
The supply-driven resource allocation formulation results also in inequitable resource allocation.
Variation in per capita allocations for primary care are relatively small, a product of the population-based
formula for allocating these resources. For secondary care, which consumes around 72 percent of money
allocated through the SPF, the variation is much larger - varying from 34 LTL per capita (first quarter
1998) in Taurage to more than 80 LTV in Kaunas. In addition, the coefficient of variation of total per
capita expenditures was greater in the first quarter of 1998 than it was in 1996 (coefficient of variation
0.12). This suggests that the variation may be increasing despite the population-based system for primary
care allocations.
Partly this variation is a product of cross-boundary use of services. Citizens of counties lacking
tertiary level facilities will cross county boundaries to use hospitals in Kaunas and Vilnius. But it is also
likely to be a product of relative access to service - those living closer to good quality facilities will make
relatively greater use of services than patients with similar health care needs that live further away. In
addition, the current payment system may exacerbate the inequalities if hospitals in certain areas are able
to increase activity to a greater extent than others. The relative importance of each of these factors is not
known since data on the place of residence of patients are not aggregated above the facility level.

The Government has drafted an initial population-based regional resource allocation formula'4
and plans to implement it in phases: (i) in 2000 theoretical budgets and interfund settlements will be
modeled for TPFs; (ii) in 2001 partial population based territorial resource allocation will be introduced
that would reach to about 80% of all resources by year 2002; (iii) by 2001 full population-based funding.
Inefficient management of investment expenditure. Investment for state facilities is approved and
allocated through the Ministry of Health and municipal authorities with no role of SPF. Prices for services
charged to the patient funds do not, therefore, incorporate the cost of buildings and large equipment. While
the separation of investment and revenue expenditures allows the Ministry to preserve some financial lever
over facility planning through the investment budget, it does lead to two interconnected problems: (i)
private providers may find it difficult to secure contracts since the price of their services, incorporating an
investment element, will tend to be higher than equivalent state facilities; (ii) the allocation of investment
money to the state sector may not encourage effective resource use because for the end user, the
investment is essentially a free good. Local hospitals bid for part of the investment money knowing that
they will bear none of the cost of servicing the investment.
Although Government has introduced commercial accounting practices in public hospitals that
account for depreciation, assets and capital investment funds are still viewed as "free goods." A
comprehensive policy, including development of rational capital investment plans linked to health service
plans, as well as a capital charging regime or a suitable practical alternative for giving financial incentives
to public hospitals and clinics to promote efficient use of assets and investment, is needed.
Inefficient purchasing
practices. Currently, TPFs'
purchasing decisions are                       Taurage

patterns of care and react to the           Marijampole

monitor contracts. Likewise,
managers of provider institutions lack the skills to participate in contract negotiation and adapt to the
demands of needs-based purchasing.
Payment systems encourage over-referral and hospital admission. The current combination of
capitation payments for primary care and activity-based secondary care payment means that there are in-
built incentives to minimise primary care services and refer to the specialist sector. Utilization data reveal
that hospital admissions in 1996 were 110 percent of 1990 levels and number of operations were 115
percent of 1990 levels. This trend, however, is not adjusted to the possible increase of re-admission rates
because of the case-based hospital payment system. This system is not moderated by primary care audits
and gatekeeping nor by inpatient contracts that control volume and quality of services. In addition,
because prices for inpatient services are based in part on expenditures per bed day for specialties in

different types of hospitals, a simple case that could be treated at a secondary level facility would be
remunerated at a higher rate if the service is provided at a tertiary level facility. There is a need to further
refine the new reimbursement systems - already improved by a shift from input-based to service-based
payment - to reduce remaining disincentives for more efficient care.
An unaffordable benefit package. Officially all services are covered by the SPF unless there is
specific exclusion." The remaining benefits package is still too extensive to be sustained by Lithuanian
resources and rationing occurs in a number of different implicit ways. There is considerable interest in
developing a more explicit basic benefits package. The debate is focusing on the further development of a
negative list of services, in particular for excluding some pharmaceuticals from benefits package
altogether or limit the number of beneficiaries. Applying this approach rarely yields significant savings as
there is invariably considerable argument over each service that is considered for exclusion. Other
approaches to limiting the package of benefits that are both effective and politically acceptable need to be
considered.
Low Levels of Collection by SPF. The only contributions the SPF is currently responsible for
collecting are those from farmers and other self-insured people such as housewives (estimated 13.3 percent
of population). These collections are currently running at very low levels, constituting only 0.2 percent of
public finance of health care. There has been some discussion about how to increase the level of
contribution of farmers, e.g. by the Agriculture Fund subsidising the farmers' contributions - effectively a
transfer of resources from one part of the government budget to another without obtaining any further user
contribution. Maintaining administrative responsibility of such limited contribution collection is not
efficient and there has also been discussion about whether the SPF should give up this role and the
Government designate SODRA or Tax Agency to assume this responsibility.
Private/Public Mix. Fully private health care provision has been rather limited although private
practice was legalized in the late 1 980s. An estimated 70 percent of physicians, 25 percent of dentists and
20 percent of nursing staff are involved in part-time private activities. More significant privatizations has
occurred in rehabilitation services where Lithuania has a significant supply of sanatoriums. By 1997, an
estimated 14 sanatoriums had been privatised. Private acute inpatient care has been limited. In 1996,
there were only 3 private hospitals in Lithuania comprising only 9 beds. In 1998, a significant investment
was made into a private cardio-vascular surgical clinic with a support of US$16 million loan guaranteed
by the Government. The investment is not economically sustainable and it highlights problems with
definition of Government role vis-a-vis private sector, lack of regulation of high technology dissemination
as well as political complexity of the health sector.

public reimbursement received from the state. The IFC 6 estimates that the potential demand for fully
private health care provision and insurance would be one to three percent of the total population (37,000 -
110,000 people) but they would be younger and healthier than the population on average.
The Government also plans to alter the public/private mix in the provision and financing of health
services.17 Sanatoriums and resorts that already are privately financed are the prime candidates for
privatization. This is in addition to pharmacies and dentistry practices that already are to a large degree
privatized. The strategy also proposes PHC practices as suitable for privatization but as they would be
providers of essential and publicly funded services, regulations and TPF contracts need to be carefully
designed. The key aspects that need to be considered are: level playing field for private and public
providers (likely to require changes in regulations governing public institutions), universal co-payments
for basic benefits package services, universal referral protocols and treatment guidelines, incentives to
treat low income patients. Nursing hospital and social care services that could also be considered for
private provision have not been discussed in the Government strategy.
Institutional capacity. MOH and State Patient Fund are the key institutions implementing health
reforms. Many stakeholders view that the lack of capacity in the areas of reform planning, implementation
and monitoring as one of the main obstacles facing the reform.'8 The MOH has important strengths that it
can build upon but also needs to address a number of weaknesses. The 1996 National Strategy of Health
Reform is continuing to provide overall direction of the health reform and defines priorities (PHC reform,
restructuring, licensing and accreditation, health insurance). The MOH has strong leadership and
improved structure and improved cooperation with the Parliament and Ministry of Economy. To
successfully implement health reform, the Government needs to build institutional capacity for program
management, monitoring and evaluation. Also, the MOH needs to improve capacities in communication
and build new capabilities in needs assessment and technology assessment.
Weak institutional capacity and a vaguely defined institutional franework hinders
implementation of the new health financing principles. Lack of capacity to track hospital re-admissions
and monitor cross-boundary patient flows make cost-containment and introduction of equitable regional
allocation formula difficult. The proposed purchaser/provider split has created needs for new institutions,
new roles and responsibilities, clear by-laws and transparent administrative procedures, new accountability
mechanisms, new skills for health insurance and business-like hospital management, and appropriate
management information systems that need to be developed.
In October, 1997, the Government changed the status of health care facilities from budget
organizations to public institutions. These new regulations provide for substantial autonomy and
flexibility, but they do not provide assurances for clear public accountability. Hospital owners (central
government, municipalities and apskritis) play a passive role in oversight, leaving the task of financial
monitoring largely to the TPFs, though TPFs' do not have the necessary powers to address poor business
performance in hospitals. Many hospitals have accumulated significant debts, and owners sometimes pay
off these debts to keep hospitals open, undermining incentives for efficiency. It is difficult to achieve a
co-ordinated rational approach to reconfiguration when hospital ownership is fragmented across three
levels of Government, and parochial pressures inhibit rationalization. There is a prospect of further
fragmentation as the number of municipalities is increased. Success and credibility of the reform depends
on the appropriate response to such institutional weaknesses and the appropriate legal status, governance
and monitoring arrangements for the organizations involved.
Civil service reform will unlikely affect health reforms because health service providing
institutions are registered as public institutions while civil service reform will affect only budgetary
institutions. However administrative reform may have negative impact to restructuring of service

provision. According to reform by year 2000 the number of municipalities should be increased from 56
present to 96, i.e. municipalities will become smaller. The majority have hospitals and policlinics in their
territories and it is likely that municipalities as founders of health institutions will try to maintain them to
meet minimal requirements established by the Ministry of Health. This may create additional disincentives
to take radical steps towards restructuring of the hospital sector.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Lack of effective    The National Health Board (NHB) was established in 1998 as a national focal point for
public health      leadership in public health policies. It is expected that in the short and medium term,
programs to        national public health priorities will be defined, surveillance mechanisms established
address priority   and programs initiated. The project provides limited support to the NHB in publishing
health problems    a national public health report and knowledge brokering activities to help the NHB
fulfill its functions.
Inefficient health    The project supports implementation of PHC reform that is the Government top reform
care delivery      priority. PHC is expected to provide better quality care to the population and provide
system             economically more efficient alternatives to institutional care. Developing community-
based mental health services and community nursing are strategic focuses within the
PHC reform. Mental health is driven by political priority of mental health (high suicide
rates) and internationally recognized best practices in mental health services.
Community nursing is being developed as a strategic vehicle for introducing health
promotion and disease prevention activities in communities and for creating an enabling
professional environment for integration of social and health care services.
Health services    Health services restructuring is inherently a very politically complex process. The
restructuring      project uses three strategic approaches to address this issue: (i) development of an
enabling policy and institutional environment, including appropriate financial
incentives, management of investment expenditures, need based health services
planning and health services governance reform; (ii) national development of service
norms and guidelines, including alternatives to hospital care and review of ambulance
services; (iii) a demand driven competitive pilot approach to ensure quality of
proposals, local ownership and successful implementation and replicability.
Supply-driven      The project supports a change from a supply-driven health financing system to a needs-
resource allocation  driven system. By 2003, all SPF resources will be allocated to the ten TPFs on the basis
resulting in       of population and other indicators of need, rather than on the basis of services provided
regional inequities  by facilities in the given territory. TPFs will then be responsible for purchasing services
for their resident population from facilities providing the most cost-effective care,
regardless of location of the provider. Strategic considerations include the scope of
need-based allocation (inclusion of secondary and tertiary care) and phasing the
changes because of the expected significant impact on budgets for some territories
(increases or decreases, depending on the initial relative share).
Inefficient        The project supports development of an effective and transparent system of investment
management of      appraisal, especially for capital funding (construction and equipment) above a certain
investment         level. The process builds on structures that already exist but puts them into a more
expenditure        formal and wider social, economic and health perspective. Feasible options for
Lithuania to encourage economy of resource use will be developed during the project,
including population-based allocation of investment budgets, a system of investment
credits that can be used to obtain capital funding, and inclusion of capital costs into the
price of services.
Inefficient        The project will support implementing a strategy to introduce needs-based purchasing
purchasing         by TPFs through skills development within purchaser organizations (SPF, TPFs) in
practices          needs assessment, quality monitoring, and contracting. Managers of provider



Page 13
institutions will also be trained to participate in and respond to the contracting process.
To underpin assessment of needs (by type and volume) and quality of care, and to guide
priority-setting in the purchase of services, evidence-based best practice service
protocols will be developed for priority areas of care. Given continuing changes in
medical science, population needs, and resource availability, protocol development will
need to be an ongoing process. In-country capacity to apply the basic methodologies
for evidence-based research and review will be developed under the project.
Payment systems   The project will support adjustments to the capitation-based remuneration of PHC to
encourage over-    encourage them to expand the range of services. Volume limits will be introduced to
referral and       the system of hospital care reimbursement to discourage excess admissions. The
hospital admission  project will support solving implementation issues such as application of sliding scale
reimbursement of services exceeding contracted limits, finding a rational and
transparent basis for determining contract volumes, and adjusting prices with actual
costs. It is expected that needs-based purchasing practices would gradually determine
the service volume to be purchased from health services providers. A policy of
applying the same prices for similar care whether performed in tertiary or secondary
facilities will be established.
An unaffordable    The project will support attempts to establish a more explicit public health insurance
benefit package    benefits package which is a methodologically and politically difficult task. Technical
assistance under the project will help the Government to understand the various
approaches that have been attempted in other countries. A number of other project
inputs will indirectly support the development of the core list of services that are to be
funded through the compulsory state health insurance system: (i) development of
treatmentprotocols to increase the quality of care and reduce the cost of treatment for
some types of interventions; (ii) processing a needs assessment will help to show which
treatable diseases should be included in the package and given the overall limit on
available resources prioritise interventions towards those that offer the best value for the
money; (iii) the development of a better cost basisfor activities will help to establish
the prices for services to be charged to patients; (iv) primary care incentives will help to
reinforce primary care led protocols.
Low Levels of      The project will facilitate assessment and decision on how to improve SPF's
Collection by SPF   contribution assessment and collection system while maintaining administrative costs at
a low level. The options include (i) improvement of SPF collection capacity from the
self-insured population (farmers, housewives, etc); (ii) transfer all collection
responsibilities to SODRA and thus free the SPF to concentrate on its purchasing
responsibilities; (iii) improving the contribution tracking system to refuse services to
those who have not paid. These issues are linked to current discussions on proposals to
introduce a system of supplementary health insurance which would cover services
outside a universally guaranteed basic package of services. This nexus of policy
decisions needs careful consideration of not only its impact on revenue generation,
administrative costs of collection and priority-setting for efficiency, but also on the
fundamental principle of universality of access to health care that can ultimately be
resolved only through the processes of political choice. Technical Assistance on
defining the basic package (above), on developing an efficient collection system, and on
approaches to and arguments for and against supplementary health insurance will be
provided under the project.
Health             Support establishment of a well coordinated and comprehensive Health Information
Information        System consisting of databases and application systems independently developed by the
System             project participants, to effectively and enduringly improve the amount and accuracy of
health data available for policy making, and to support the efficient operation of
national health care budgeting and administration.

Insufficient      Various project inputs would contribute to development of institutional capacity. A
Institutional     management adviser will be provided tot he MOH to offer guidance on implementation
Capacity          of reforms and to strengthen managerial capacity within the Ministry. A provider
support unit will be established in the MOH to offer support, guidance and training for
managers of provider institutions. Short courses on contracting, business planning,
protocol development and health needs assessment will be offered for provider
institution managers as well as for staff of the SPF and TPFs. Finally, a long term
national health management training program will be commissioned from a relevant
academic institution. An improved management information system (below) will also
be an essential element of the health management infrastructure. Special effort is paid
to strategic information systems management.

A. Health financing reform
*  By 2003, gradually move from supply driven health financing resources allocation among regions
to a population needs based formula.
*  In 2000, introduce volume limits to all contracts between TPFs and secondary and tertiary
facilities. Marginal pricing methodology will be developed for extra-contractual services.
*  Strengthen the Communications Support Unit within the MOH to inform general public about
implications of the health reform and offer continuing support to providers during the reforms.
*  Assign and strengthen the function of health needs assessment in the MOH and SPF and appoint
the necessary staff.
*  Development of guidelines for appraisal, allocation, monitoring and financing health sector
investments. TPFs as long terms funders and purchasers of services for their respective
populations participate in the development of service development plans for the period of 3-5
years.
B. Health System Restructuring.
*  License health care facilities to provide a limited scope of services based on national norms,
efficiency and quality criteria.
*  Develop need-based health services masterplans on national and apskritis level.
*  Gradually introduce a gatekeeping function for GPs to contain unnecessary self-referrals to
specialist and ambulance services. This will be done through phased definition of the core PHC
services.
*  Develop and strengthen provision of ambulatory mental health services in integration with general
Primary Health Care services.
*  Review the system of ambulance services provision with the objective to separate true emergency
ambulance services from other necessary transportation needs of health care personnel and
patients and implement recommendations in pilot regions.
*  Development of clinical practice guidelines.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The executing agencies will include: (I) the Ministry of Health, which will provide overall
technical and managerial direction; (2) apskritis administrations; (3) municipalities, which will be
responsible for delivering health services; and (4) the State Patient's Fund, with responsibility for
financing and reimbursing health services through Territorial Patient Funds.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
No-project alternative. The perceived value added of the project is to support the Government to
leverage policy reform. Given that political will exists, resources are needed to secure some critical
inputs, produce successful pilots to secure positive feedback on reform, and ensure stakeholder



Page 18
engagement and approval. Post-socialist transition economies do not have a tradition of adequately
financing reform efforts. High opportunity cost of recurrent expenditure dollars makes it difficult to
allocate public funds for development purposes and the country needs to rely on external donor support.
A well designed and targeted project would mitigate the risk of losing commitment and credibility of the
reform compared with no-project alternative.
Project focus. Health financing reform and restructuring were selected as focus areas because
perceived Bank's comparative advantage in these areas. Public Health is not the focus of the project
because of choices made earlier in the project preparation phase. Part of the rationale behind the decision
was a lack of respective Government counterpart and general reluctance of the Government to use loan
funds for technical assistance intensive activities.
Size of the loan. The size of the operation was influenced by what is acceptable to the
Government and yet still sufficient to leverage policy changes. Annual project disbursements amounting
to about 1-2 percent of the overall annual health spending were perceived to be affordable to the
Government and sufficient to support the policy program.
Specific design issues. Competitive selection of pilot regions based on the quality of proposals
and consistency with national health care reform, is perceived to contribute to a successful project
implementation. Tangible positive results from the first successful activities are believed to facilitate
nation-wide implementation of restructuring of the health sector.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design.
Lessons learned from other health projects in the ECA region are as follows: (a) health sector
reform is a lengthy, politicized process and expectations for the reform process have been too optimistic
for both the World Bank and the client countries; (b) institutional aspects of reform are as important as
technically proficient strategies; (c) greater attention needs to be paid to the political economy of the



Page 1 9
reform through marketing reforms to lawmakers, the medical community and the public; (d) projects have
been too complex; and (e) adequate resources need to be committed for supervision of projects. 21
The project team recognizes that sector development and achievement of the Project's
development objectives will require a strong partnership between the MOH and international experts and
and financiers to support the implementation process. Through consultant trust funds and a Sida
partnership, the Bank has brought additional technical assistance to the MOH during the project
preparation phase. Technical assistance has facilitated the production of detailed regional health care
restructuring proposals which increased the technical knowledge of local health care providers and will
also facilitate implementation. In addition, the Vilnius Resident Mission has been providing constant
support to the MOH and PMU in project preparation and implementation through a dedicated Human
Development sector staff. The ongoing support from the Bank's local office will strengthen and sustain the
supervision effort. Finally, to strengthen the management capacity of the MOH and PMU, significant
technical assistance and training will be financed under the Project.
Most Bank projects in Lithuania that are under implementation are performing satisfactorily or
highly satisfactorily( 9 out of 11 projects under implementation). The main problems are related to a lack
of experience and insufficient capacity of implementing agencies to follow implementation arrangements
including application of procurement requirements and commitment to meet policy conditionalities if
agreed. Timely and efficient capacity building and TA, and training provided to implementing agencies
reduce these problems. In rare cases unsatisfactory implementation is due to inadequate project design
which ultimately requires review of the project.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The MOH is the institution charged with the design, implementation and monitoring and
evaluation of Lithuania health reform and it is also the primary counterpart for the World Bank supported
Health Project. The main priorities of the MOH reform efforts have been guided by 1996 National
Strategy for Health Reform and have largely remained the same although the commitment to the project
has been influenced by changes in the MOH management. Over the past two years, the Ministry had been
managed by three Ministers and the MOH has undergone significant structural changes. However, after
general and presidential elections, Lithuania has a stable Government and development concept and
commitment to the reforms has been reaffirmed. During the 1998 World Bank and IMF annual meetings,
the Government expressed explicit interest in World Bank support to the Lithuania Health reform.
The demand driven approach for competitive selection of pilot regions in the restructuring
component of the project has strengthened local ownership of the project and helps to overcome the
complex political context of health services restructuring activities. The project also has enjoyed
Parliamentary support throughout the preparatory process that has been facilitated by regular briefing
sessions and project support to the National Health Board.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
Continuous policy dialogue during project preparation and implementation would enable the
Govermnent to tap into the Bank's extensive international experience and knowledge base about best
practices in designing and implementing health sector reform.
The Bank's credibility as an institution and its financial assistance increases the Government
leverage to negotiate with the stakeholders and implement needed reforms in a politically complex health
sector.

Bank financing would complement funding from other donors that is primarily restricted to
technical assistance. The Bank's funds are important in the complementary effort with other donors to
accomplish established goals in PHC reform implementation.
E: Summary Project Analysis
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4):
Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$ 34.7 million; ERR= 41 %
The economic analysis is a cost-benefit analysis where both the costs and benefits are measured
over a ten year presented in 1999 prices. Current and investment costs are considered irrespective of the
source of finance. The benefits are limited to direct financial benefits that are measurable and some
indirect economic benefits that are likely to occur as a result of the project. Intangible benefits such as
improved quality and health status, more equitable allocation of resources according to needs, better
access, etc., are not quantified in the analysis.
Information was derived from domestic reports, and from ad hoc data collection and research
(questionnaires, telephone interviews). Some assumptions are based on regional, national and
international experience about potential savings to the health care system. A discount rate of six percent
was used to calculate the net economic benefits of the project expressed through an internal rate of return
(IRR) and net present value of the project (NPV). The details of the economic evaluation are available in
the project files.22
The costs of the project and the expected benefits are estimated in three main areas: (i) policy
development and support to national health institutions, including cross-regional equity and resource re-
allocation implications of introducing a need-based (capitation) resource allocation principle,
strengthening the role of the purchasers through development and implementation of new payments
models and contracting system, strengthening the information management; (ii) health services
restructuring in the four apskritis that support the PHC reform and hospital capacity optimization; and (iii)
total costs and benefits of the project including synergistic effects and indirect financial benefits.
The costs and benefits of the restructuring component are related to: (i) changes in referral rates
to hospitals and specialists; (ii) estimated benefits from expected changes in skills mix and structure of
medical profession, costs and benefits of pilot PHC practices with focus on the shift of treatments from
hospitals to PHC (incl. indirect benefits like reduced time-costs and travel costs); (iii) costs and benefits
of the pilot hospital-restructuring projects (savings due to expanding day-care surgery and concentration of
some care and avoided duplications, benefits in terms of shorter ALOS ands cuts in beds); (iv) estimated
changes in direct costs and benefits for restructuring mental health by the expansion of out-patient
treatment; and (v) estimated costs and productivity gains due to investment in the ambulance sector
(including analyzing the volume of different services provided and organizational changes).
The summary project costs include also the cost for project management as well as an additional
benefit from the demonstration effect and synergistic effect of coordination and implementation process
(equal to 1% of public HCE starting from midterm of the project). The project as a whole would yield an
estimated internal rate of return of 41% if the indirect financial benefits were included. The indirect
benefits represents 14% of total project benefits, driven primarily by shorter length-of stay in hospitals due
to expansion of day-care surgery and ambulatory care. The total benefit over ten years is nearly US$94
million and the net present value over US$49 million.

Sensitivity analysis
The following are some factors that determine success of policy reforms: (i) strengthening the
institutional capacity of Patient Funds will be a determinant for how effectively the Funds can use
contractual agreements and participate in the regional health services planning and resource allocation
decisions; (ii) expansion of PHC would not automatically lead to a reallocation of resources from
hospitals, and incentives (pecuniary and non-pecuniary) given to doctors as well as patients will be
important for changes in utilization of services; (iii) commitment to the national and regional plans for
restructuring the hospital sector will be crucial for releasing resources.
The macro-economic development is one of the most important determinants of health care
spending. The project economic analysis is based on the key assumption of a favorable macro-economic
environment. The projected growth of GDP is estimated to 5 percent over the next 4 years. International
comparisons shows that the income elasticity across countries are greater than 1.0 (from 1.15 to 1.31),
meaning that health spending will grow at a faster rate than the growth of the overall economy.23 But the
health care sector is very sensitive and suffers during economic recessions. Available resources for the
project and expected benefits will depend on the overall economic growth.
Introduction of a decentralized model of General Practitioner based Primary Health Care system
may lead to an extra layer of health care system. Financial savings would only occur if physical resources
released in polyclinics and hospitals will be put for alternative economic use (cut costs, generate income)
or closed (cut costs). If no savings are generated from both closed polyclinics and decrease in the number
of facilities or space utilization, then the IRR for the PHC subcomponent of all four pilot apskritis would
be negative, with the NPV equaling US$-6.0 million. With 50% additional costs off-set by savings, the
IRR would become positive; with 100% additional costs off-set by efficient use or closing of vacated
space, both IRR and NPV will become positive (see table below). To monitor this critical factor, the use
of vacated space will be monitored by the PMU at mid-term and end of project.

3. Technical:
The project supports introduction of a population-based resource allocation formula for TPFs.
This is consistent with the best international practice and an important pre-condition for development of
the capacity of TPFs as purchasers of needs-based health care services. In addition, TPFs would be able
to develop their planning capacity to meet long-term financing needs for health services under tight
budgetary constraints. This transparent and equitable resource allocation mechanism to be utilized by
TPFs, as well as a sophisticated purchasing capacity are factors recognized internationally as one of the
best methods for controlling costs and ensuring cost-effective use of resources in a decentralized system.
The investment policy development activities supported by the project propose to establish a
transparent framework for investment decisions, review, financing, and monitoring. Technical evaluation
of final policies is not possible at this stage but the Government will be able to choose an option from a list
of international best practices that fits best the Lithuanian context. The project will also support
development of evidence-based medicine guidelines that is becoming international best practice to
improve efficacy and cost-effectiveness of health care interventions. The use of the methodologies of
population health needs assessment, health service planning, and hospital facilities functional planning to
develop national and regional master plans for reconfiguring secondary care services is a robust and
appropriate tool to help an oversized, formerly centrally-directed health system adjust capacity and move
into a more decentralized environment.
To assure technical credibility of development of Day Surgery Units for hospital restructuring
plans, professional guidelines were used, including the Royal College of Surgeons of England,
recommendations of the U.K. National Health Service Management Executive, Day Surgery, Making it
Happen, NHS Management Executive, and Value for Money Unit, 1991 London HMSO.
For the improvements in the country's Health Information System (HIS), the project's approach is
highly de-centralized and pilot focused. Progress will be possible at several fronts at the same time, and
individual activities have a high likelihood to remain manageable. For all of the application development
work, there will be full involvement, on a competitive basis, of the private sector which from experience in
other projects is known as having the elasticity to best respond to such needs. The tendencies for
disintegration which are natural in a decentralized implementation, will be counteracted by improved
strategic coordination on the country level supported by EU/PHARE project.
4. Institutional:
Executing Agencies: The Health Reform Component will be implemented through the MOH's
State and Territorial Patient Funds, while the Health Services Restructuring Component will be
implemented through the existing institutional capacity of municipalities and health regions (Apskritis).
International and national technical assistance services would be provided to these entities to facilitate
implementation of their respective Project Implementation Plans (PIP). These entities have participated in
the project preparation phase and worked jointly with consultants in the preparation of their PIP.
Project Implementation Management: To strengthen the capacity and knowledge of the MOH to
prepare the health reform and health services restructuring policies and activities, a Project Management



Page 23
Unit (PMU), a Project Steering Committee, and Component Working Groups were established in 1997.
These units will continue to operate throughout the Project Implementation Period. The PMU would be
responsible for facilitating project implementation, in particular, to: (i) promote the objectives and sector
efficiency reforms being supported under the Project; (ii) monitor progress in the achievement of the
agreed development objectives, benchmarks, and outputs as defined in the agreed Key Performance
Indicators; (iii) operate a sound Financial Management System and produce the required financial
statements to monitor eligible expenditures and meet auditing requirements; and (iv) conduct all
procurement under the Project in accordance with Bank Guidelines.
5. Social:
Health reform and health services restructuring will have both political and social impacts on
specific segments of the population. The project includes activities to support the Government's
communication capacity with the stakeholders and general public as well as a pilot fund to mitigate social
consequences of health workforce retrenchment through voluntary severance packages.
6. Environmental assessment:   Environmental Category  [ ] A  [ ] B   [X] C
The project is expected to have a marginally beneficial impact on the environment by improving
energy efficiency of primary health care facilities, and closing hospitals and clinics. Otherwise, no
appreciable environmental impacts are anticipated.
7. Participatory approach [key stakeholders, how involved, and what they have influenced; if
participatory approach not used, describe why not applicable]:
An integrated participatory approach has been applied to the identification, preparation and design
phases of the Lithuania Health Care Reform project. A "Participation Strategy for Project Preparation"
was collaboratively designed in May, 1997 by the Ministry of Health, World Bank and the project
Participation Consultant. The strategy defined the various components of the participatory approach for
the project and was designed as a means to create broad based commitment to the Bank supported project
while increasing the number of actors potentially involved in the implementation of the project, especially
at the local Apskritis level. The participatory strategy involved a diversity of central and regional
stakeholders representing a diversity of health care system interests (160 stakeholders have participated in
one or more of the participatory events which included a stakeholder analysis, stakeholder infonnation and
education seminars, a participatory project design process and several capacity building initiatives).
(a) Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups: Ministry of Health; State Patient Fund;
Territorial Patient Funds; municipal authorities; apskritis authorities; primary, secondary and
tertiary facilities and providers; and allied health personnel.
(b) Other key stakeholders: Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy, Department of Statistics,
medical providers, allied health personnel, medical professional associations, medical universities,
national media, medical care consumers, and intemational development agencies involved in the
health sector.

F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Policy measures supported in the project are expected to improve stability and certainty of health
services funding on a regional level. This should establish conditions for developing plans to restructure
health services on a sustainable level. Implementation of need-based allocation formnulas will put financial
strain on some regions but the impact is expected to be mitigated through phased implementation of
reform. Economic analysis is expected to demonstrate positive return on the project but these need to be
confirmed during the appraisal mission. The project will not generate significant incremental recurrent
costs. Any incremental recurrent costs are expected to be offset by savings from efficiency improvements.
Political risk and sustainability issues are addressed in the table below.
An estimate of the financial sustainability of the project has been carried out by relating total
project costs to the public health care expenditures, total public expenditures and the GDP, to determine
the overall burden of the proposed project on public finances and the overall economy. Real GDP growth
is assumed to be 5 percent annually, and the share of the total government spending to stay around 25.0
percent of GDP. The financial burden of the project will be highest during the second year of the project
and then decline (see table below).

For the implementation of the HIS sub-components, chances for sustainability of the investrnents
are high due to the decentralized nature of the development activities, an approach that will increase the
individual robustness of the component systems, and thereby of the overall HIS. Indeed, the application
systems developed for PHC facilities and hospitals are expected to be extremely attractive to be
implemented in further health care institutions far beyond the pilots supported by the project.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
A possible controversial activity supported under the Project is the proposed investment into an
inpatient nursing and long term care facility. The institutional setting for the proposed facility is not the
most efficient and high quality way to provide for long termn and nursing care needs as many countries are
moving towards community-based nursing and home-based care. In addition, the private sector could be
a more efficient provider of long-term and residential care. The primary objective of the proposed
conversion of the Vilnius Railway acute care hospital into a nursing and long-term care hospital is the
reduction of excess acute care capacity as well as to accommodate the large unmet demand for long-term
nursing care. This project component does not serve as a model for meeting nursing and long-term care
needs. After completion of the conversion, Vilnius will have 0.13 nursing beds per 1,000 population
which will still be very low in comparison to international standards. The proposed hospital project will
also be based on a sound business plan and will demonstrate efficient use of space and utilities.

Project Description
Project Component A. Support to Health Reform - US$8.5 Million
Sub-component Al: Policy Development
A1.1 Geographic Resource Allocation System
Justification: The system of resource allocation is supply driven rather than needs led. The
allocation of resources to TPFs is largely dependent upon the level of services delivered through
specialist facilities.
Principle of reform: To establish a system of allocation that more closely matches population
need based on available data with gradual introduction and refinement as more information becomes
available.
Activities and recommended policy.- Allocation of recurrent budgets to TPFs based on size of
population and some other factors, with defined transition path for implementation, and integration of
funding for tertiary as well as secondary for health care.

Goods and services: International and local health economist to assist in development and
refinement of formula and dissemination workshop for SPF, TPF staff and managers of large institutions.
Responsible for implementation: Board of the SPF.
A1.2 Establishing and implementing procedures for allocation of investment funding.
Justification: Institutions do not bear the cost of capital funding and do not, therefore, have an
incentive to maximise the use of investments. The system for allocating investment funding is ad hoc and
lacks a consistent framework for assessing the value of proposed projects.
Principle of reform: To establish clear principles for assessing investment proposals and the
opportunity cost of existing assets, and develop skills, methods and incentives for allocating expenditure
that encourages economy of resource use; to conduct rational planning for investment and disinvestment
in facilities and equipment, at national and regional level, linked with service plans and norms, to be
developed under subcomponents A 1.4 and A 1.6.
Activities and recommended policy: The Ministry of Health will establish a system of option
appraisal for evaluating proposed investment in civil works and equipment in terms of medical need,
economic benefit and social consequences. Capacity will be developed in the MOH and at apskritis level
to carry project appraisal and set priorities for the State Investment Program, as a basis for giving

Page 36
systematic advice to the National Health Programs Coordination Commission. The MOH will prepare for
the introduction of a system of capital investment allocation that can be used once the general
restructuring of health facilities has been completed, including investment planning linked to needs-based
service planning, and capital charging (or some practical alternative method of giving providers
incentives to invest, divest and maintain assets efficiently).
Goods and services: International and local health economist to assist in development and
refinement of investment allocation system and develop system of investment option appraisal; short
training course in investment appraisal for MOH and apskritis staff, and managers/economists in major
providers. It is envisaged that the MOH will maintain adequately staffed strategic planning and programs
department to sustain the capacity in investment appraisal.
Responsiblefor implementation: MOH
A1.3 Provider reimbursement and contracting
Justification: Substantial changes have already been introduced to the system of provider
reimbursement. Payments now reflect activity rather than inputs used. Volume quotas have been
introduced into contracts with hospitals. The payment system is simple to understand. Primary care units
are paid according to the number of patients enrolled. Further refinements are being planned which
should improve the functioning of the system. These include:
*  Refinements of the case-classification system in contracts with hospitals;
*  some additional payments to primary care practitioners for illness prevention;
*  adjustments to TPF allocation and hospital payment procedures for cross-boundary patient flows.
Specific project assistance should concentrate on the following:
*  Standardisedfinancial management (costing) system. The project activities will support
undertaking a comprehensive and realistic costing exercise. This is expected to provide a
reconciliation of top down expenditure allocation and bottom up actual costs. It will provide
valuable information for pricing. The methodology used should be flexible enough to show how
changes in facility structure and protocols effect unit costs. It therefore becomes a vital tool for
internal management. The system, once developed and fully tested, would become the standard
analytical and reporting system to be used by all health care institutions (public and private) in
Lithuania contracted to the TPFs. The system should be readily linked to activity data to provide
management information that can be used at each level of the system. A cost-accounting based
financial management model will be piloted in some of the Vilnius apskritis hospitals and
policlinics (B4.1), in conjunction with the Vilnius TPF.
* Refining the system of secondary care reimbursement. These activities will use the new costing
framework to help refine the current system of inpatient and outpatient specialist payment system.
Pricing will be revised so that they reflect actual costs. Recommendations for incorporating these
prices into contracts in a way that avoids the cost escalation of recent years and encourages more
cost-effective patterns of care.
*  Primary health care reimbursement. Project activities will explore additional incentives for PHC
providers to develop their own services and reduce referrals. An example could be additional
income provided to practices based on the development of new services and reductions in
specialist referrals based. Projects could be funded on a competitive basis. These changes would
be tested out on a trial basis on the pilot apskritis. Funding for these allowances should, in the
medium term, be provided through TPFs as a direct result from the reduction in spending at the



Page 37
secondary level. As an interim measure it is suggested that some project funding be provided to
fund these incentives on a declining basis.
* National workshops or conferences on contracting will be organized each year of the Project for
representatives of the purchasing and provider institutions on approaches to contracting looking
especially at the framework and content of contracts.
Goods and services: International financing specialist and local financing experts to develop
standardized costing framework and advise on outpatient and hospital care reimbursement strategies.
International contracting specialist for preparation and participation in the workshops or conferences.
Short training course in contracting for SPF, TPF staff and managers/economists in major providers. An
international study tour for 1-2 lead personnel in SPF and MOH.
A1.4 Needs assessment and service planning
Justification: The Territorial Patient Funds do not currently purchase care on the basis of need.
Rather funding is determined by the amount of care institutions are able to provide to patients. Health
financing reform foresees need based regional resource allocation. TPFs as purchasers of care need to be
equipped with the necessary information and skills for identifying population need, determining the best
pattern of services and obtaining services in a cost-effective way through provider contracting. Purchasers
require both strong evidence based information and the financing mechanisms and planning methods to
use this information in an optimal way. Ministry of Health needs to ensure that rational planning of
services occurs at national and regional level.
Activities and recommended policy:
* A national conference drawing on international experience and with a broad range of
Lithuanian representation to launch the concept and develop a consensus about needs
assessment and service planning at the beginning of the project; with a short training course
program for MOH, SPF and TPF staff to reflect these conclusions.
*  Health needs assessment will be a function of the health economics unit in the MOH and
respective unit in the SPF. Needs assessment should inform service planning and priority-
setting by the MOH, SPF and TPFs.
*  Mechanisms need to be developed to link the needs assessment functions to the planning
functions of the MOH and SPF and should lead to implementation of a rational planning
exercise on national and regional level by the end of the Project.
Goods and services: International experts on needs assessment and service planning as
conference speakers and trainers in the short course program. The organisation selected to run the
conference and training course will be required to obtain speakers from a variety of country backgrounds
from outside the main contracted organisation. International and local experts in epidemiology, health
services organisation and service planning will provide technical assistance to the public health
department to undertake the first needs assessment and service planning exercise. It is envisaged that the
MOH will recruit an adequate staff specialised in needs assessment to sustain this area of activity.
Responsible for implementation: MOH, SPF.
A1.5 Development of the basic package of services
Most of the countries have found the process of establishing a basic package of priority services
politically very difficult. At a general level, Lithuania has defined the package of services covered by the
patient funds. A number of project inputs will support refinement of the core list of services that are to



Page 38
be funded through the compulsory state health insurance system, which will help to establish a clearer
basis for service prioritization.
*  The process of needs assessment will help to show which treatable diseases should be included in
the package. Of course, it is also possible that recommended treatment for some types of disease
will increase. The task will then be to prioritize interventions towards those that offer the best
value for money.
* The development of a better cost basis for activities will help to establish the prices for services
to be charged to patients.
*  Primary care incentives will help to reinforce primary care led protocols.
This project component focuses on development of improved guidelines or protocols for
treatment based newly emerging evidence based medicine concept and methodologies. The protocols can
be expected to increase the quality of care but also, through changes in the way patients are treated,
reduce the cost of treatment for some types of intervention. It will also illuminate those current
interventions that are ineffective or inappropriate and should therefore be dropped from the package.
Activities: A national conference will be organized by the MOH to draw on international and
national experience and perspectives on protocol development, its objective being to determine a national
approach. International experts also to advise MOH on priorities for diseases/treatment areas for which
protocols should be developed and provide training for panels. Four panels per year to be established for
appropriate disease or clinical specialty groups, with some methodological training for panel members;
the panels then to identify appropriate clinical conditions to develop pilot protocols. The project also
supports fellowships for overseas study in health economics and technology appraisal for two persons to
work with the panels (to be employed by MOH and/or the Health Law and Economics Center).
Goods and services: International experts as conference speakers and trainers, and local experts
for protocol development panels. Short term training and overseas fellowships in health economics and
technology assessment.
Responsible agency: MOH and Health Law and Economics Centre.
A1.6 Health care delivery system restructuring
The Government of Lithuania is developing a strategy for restructuring health care system in
medium and long term. The underpinnings of the strategy are implementation of general practice based
primary health care reform, developing national and regional plans for public hospitals and related health
services based on evidence of international best practices and in the context what is affordable for
Lithuania and consistent with emerging strategic plans for health services based on preliminary needs
assessment. Restructuring is closely related to development of health financing policies, including
incentives imbedded in the provider payment methodologies and capital investment allocation, as well as
to permitting forms of ownership and management that improve accountability to the public and clients of
the health system and ensuring that health system administrators have necessary skills and tools to run
services in effective way. Different activities of the project support all these aspects of policy
development.
This project component will focus on two health sector areas that are closely linked to the
Government PHC reform: (i) introducing a community mental health concept; and, (ii) review of
ambulance services system.
Goods and services: International and local experts in PHC, community mental health and
emergency services management.

Sub-component A2: Strengthening Capacity of National Health Institutions
The objective of the sub-component is to strengthen institutional capacity to implement policy
reforms. Institutional strengthening includes staff skills development, provision of information, tools and
methodologies, building capacity to effectively communicate with the consumers of the health care
system as well as the main stakeholders. The beneficiaries of the component activities are Ministry of
Health, State Patient Funds, National Health Board, National Health Information Centre.
A2.1 Communications Unit in the Ministry of Health
Justification: The general public and health system stakeholders need be informed and consulted
to ensure that they understand the reforms, can adapt to the change and can participate in the process of
policy development and implementation.
Principle of reforms: To establish a mechanism for support, guidance and training for main health
care system stakeholders and general public.
Activities: The Minister of Health has established a unit to give advice, guidance, and support to
provider institutions. This unit will facilitate communication and consultation for providers with the
MOH and will be a conduit for stakeholder feedback to the Government on health care reform. The Unit
to be guided by the outcomes of the national conferences on contracting, business planning, protocol
development and health needs assessment, and by the forthcoming projects on financial management and
budgeting.
Goods and services: Local TA for training and communication facilitation; foreign TA from long
term management adviser and training/development advisers.
Responsiblefor implementation: MOH
A2.2 Management and development advisor to the MOH
Justification: Management advice is needed on the implementation of reforms and to strengthen
managerial capacity within the Ministry of Health. The health care sector needs to enhance its
training/development capacity to enable it to respond to the changes.
Activities: To give advice: (i) on management and organization development issues arising out of
reform process, including implementation issues, change management, the development and support of
the provider support unit, and management development across the health care sector; (ii) on training and
development issues arising out of the reform process, and on the training and development needs of the
sector; to work collaboratively with the management adviser, relevant departments within the Ministry of
Health, academic and other training suppliers in the assessment of training needs; organize appropriate
national conferences and other training activities; work with academic and other training suppliers on
long term management training programs; nurture and support for training and development activities
across the sector.
Goods and services: Foreign TA from pre-project stage for one year, with six months of further
support spread over the remainder of the project, including development of Lithuanian counterpart to be
in post from beginning of the project (a continuing permanent appointment) with matching
responsibilities. Support to this activity will be provided by the EU/PHARE project.
Responsible for implementation: MOH



Page 40
A2.3 Management training
Justification: Mainstream management training needs to reflect the different management skills
required for the reformed health care sector.
Principle for reform: To commission a national health management training programme from a
relevant academic institution.
Activities: (i) Commissioning of long term management training (possible national management
training scheme) for the sector in conjunction with academic institutions (using contract mechanism if
appropriate); the training program to include project work within health institutions as well as academic
courses with a range of options to cover both purchaser and provider management. The
training/development group to draw up a specification for this program as basis for tenders from
academic institutions if contract mechanism is used.; (ii) A program of short courses on: information
management, financial management and budgeting, business planning, etc. Commissioned and
organized by the MOH reflecting special needs of health care services providers and patient funds. A
proposed model is courses of three modules of one week each to be undertaken within one year for groups
of 20 staff. The courses to be a mix of formal teaching with case studies, simulations, and group
exercises with project work undertaken by course members on live problems in their own organizations.
Continuous evaluation of courses and updates will be applied to keep the training abreast of policy
developments and better meet the needs of the beneficiaries.
Goods and services: International and local TA to develop and deliver a course. Short term
study visits, fellowships. The project inputs will have considerable training of trainers focus in order to
develop sustainable in-country capacity. Support to this activity will be provided by the EU/PHARE
project.
Responsible for implementation: MOH
A2.4 Information unit on cost-effective medical care
A unit to provide information should be established in the Medical Library. This unit should
provide access to current medical best practice and have the capacity to assemble information in a way
that can be used by purchasers and providers.
The inforrmation unit should be equipped with a good library. This will include some relevant
primary medical journals but should concentrate on assembling secondary reviews of the medical
literature prepared by other units world-wide. This will require quick and reliable access to the internet
and regular subscriptions to medical effectiveness databases (mostly on CD or through the internet). The
unit should be capable of performing quick searches on best practice for, for example, the protocol group
or SPF. It should also begin to produce digests of evidence on treatment of certain conditions.
Goods and services: International health librarian/reviews specialist, local IT specialist to develop
Ministry of Health information unit. Computer hard and software, shelving, tables, subscriptions.
Responsible for implementation: Medical Library.
A2.5 Policy Monitoring and Evaluation

issues and maintain and build contacts with the non-governmental organisations. The Seimas requested
the Bank project to provide support to the Board in the form of study tours and professional exchanges.
The project will also support strengthening of capacity for the MOH and the Health Law and Economics
Centre to monitor and evaluate policy, giving advice to the National Health Programs Coordination
Commission.
Goods and services: Study tours for members of the NHB and MOH personnel involved in
monitoring and evaluation; a workshop to define policy evaluation roles and processes in MOH, short-
course training in health economics for personnel to be employed by MOH and/or the Health Law and
Economics Centre.
Sub-component A3: Information management
A3.1 Strengthening Health Information Centre
Justifi cation: The reforms within the health sector have a big impact on the information provision
function of the Health Information Centre. New inforrnation flows are created, current information flows
change or even become redundant. The function of the centre needs to be reviewed to meet the current
information demands of the entire health sector.
Principle of reform: The Health Information Centre will need to play a key role in the emerging
HMIS of the country. It needs to be provided with resources to meet the information demands of the
entire health sector. medical statistics.
Activities and recommended policy: The Government needs to commit to provide more adequate
space to H1C (at least a doubling of the current space is needed), and adequate future recurrent funds to
operate the IT including the web site and its communications costs. Health MIS Steering Committee
needs to coordinate required investments from different funding sources.
Works, goods and services: Adequate furniture, office technology and IT outfit, including
required software packages such as for statistics, software development costs to create a database and web
site - with appropriate access safeguards - for the electronic submission of HIC questionnaire data by
providers and for access to the derived, distilled, and aggregated statistical data produced by the Center,
and highly specialized statistics and software training as needed by HIC staff.
Responsible for implementation: MoH.
A3.2 Development Hospital Information System/Primary Health Care Information System
Justification: The grade of automation in the health establishments is poor and they are thereof
the weakest chain in the applications infrastructure for the collection and interchange of data. They lack
MIS to support and to measure their own performances.
Principle of reform: The aim of the development of a rudimentary information system for health
establishments is to offer them a flexible and cost effective tool for patient management, administration
and documentation. An open-ended system, allowing implementation in a modular fashion. The system
will be based on an appropriate data base management system and will be open ended, both in hardware
and software. The minimum requirements are the support of inpatient & outpatient departments,
ambulance & emergency activities and PHC practices (including prescriptions) as well as basic financial
management systems. These core modules should support most aspects of hospitals and PHC practices
activities, both in clinical and financial terms.



Page 42
Activities and recommendedpolicy: The system development comprises several phases: (i)
system analysis (feasibility study and information requirements/functional design); (ii) system design;
(iii) programming (or selection of off-the-shelf product); (iv) end user test; (v) documentation; (vi) tender
procedure for hardware; (vii) training and implementation; (viii) maintenance and upgrading.
Goods and services: The project will support MIS development in the four pilot regions and is
linked to the facilities supported through the component B of this project. The project will provide for
MIS project manager, MIS system analysts, MIS system designer, programmers. Computer hard and
software based on the following assumptions: number of PCs for PHC practices and policlinics is about
350; number pilot hospital MIS is 4 (servers, LANs), additional workstation needed for pilot hospitals is
about 130; MIS for day surgery centres is three.
Responsible for implementation: Strategic Information Management Group that will include
representatives from four pilot regions, MOH, SPF and HIF.
Project Component B. Health Services Restructuring - US$24.1 Million
The project will support parts of restructuring programs in four pilot regions: Alytus, Kaunas,
Utena and Vilnius. Lithuania has 10 regions in total. The pilot regions were selected on competitive
basis out of nine applications. The four selected regions developed detailed regional health sector
restructuring and development programs supported by international technical assistance.30
The regional restructuring plans had to meet the following criteria:
*  Proposal be based on adequate analysis of regional health needs, priorities as well as main
issues facing regional health care system of (i.e. demographic, prevalence of diseases,
availability of resources considered).
*  Proposal is consistent with national primary health care reform strategy (GP based PHC
system development, consisting of training and retraining of doctors and nurses, procurement
of standard equipment, reconditioning of facilities, work organization improvement) and
emphasizes its implementation in rural areas of the apskritis (to improve access to quality
first level health care).
*  Concentration of services rendered (where any of the following actions is required to reduce
duplication of services or increase efficiency, investments into policlinics are linked to such
actions as consolidating children, adult policlinics and women consultancies; merging
facilities in a policlinic complex consisting of several free-standing buildings; consolidating
laboratory or diagnostic radiology services; integrating outpatient specialist services with
hospital specialist services) as well as decentralization of GP offices.
*  Investments into hospitals are restricted to secondary care and linked to one or more of the
following: consolidating services in one hospital complex and closing down free-standing
buildings or wings, merging certain duplicated acute care services in the region into fewer
hospital sites, converting acute care hospital into long-term care or nursing facility.
*  Hospital investment proposals as well as for services have adequate financial and economic
analysis of expected impact that should demonstrate savings in terms of recurrent costs of
facility or cost of treatment. Adequate assessment of expected funded demand of particular
service is an important part of economic and financial analysis.
30    Alytus and Kaunas regions were supported by International Health Development Group (Denmark); Utena
and Vilnius regions were supported by SOLVE (Austria).



Page 43
* Proposal has adequate monitoring indicators and targets to measure improvements in
efficiency, access and quality (incl. patient perspective) and respective monitoring
arrangements.
* Proposal has adequate implementation arrangements(human, skills, structural resources),
including measures to improve project management capacity.
* Local authorities co-finance the project out of their funds.
Pilot regions will enter into implementation agreements with the MOH that will record the project
objectives, funding commitments, implementation, supervision, monitoring, evaluation and reporting
responsibilities and implementation conditions where applicable. All pilot regions have local
implementation arrangements through local steering committees and project management units. All HIS
investments for component B will be closely coordinated with, and implemented via, sub-component A.3.
Sub-component BI: Alytus Pilot Projecte1
Alytus apskritis is a region in the southern part of Lithuania. It covers 5,340 sq. kms and has a
population of 202,354. About 50% of population lives in rural settings (compared to national average of
31%). Epidemiological and demographical situation follow the general pattern in Lithuania. In 1996,
the apskritis had 10 hospitals (10.9 beds 1,000 population), 6 policlinics, 15 ambulatoriums and 81
medical posts. The apskritis had 26.7 physicians and 97.9 middle level health personnel per 10,000
population which is less than in the nation on average 32 The health services utilization indicators indicate
marked urban/rural differences in the use of services and low efficiency of obstetrics, neonatal and
paediatric specialties.
Bl.1 Regional PHCdevelopment program. The objective of the program is to accelerate the
development of PHC services throughout the apskritis and to achieve a critical mass of newly qualified
GPs as PHC providers in rural and urban settings (target: 55% of population coverage). Geographical
organisation of GPs within the main Alytus policlinic and assimilation of outpatient specialist care into
the Alytus apskritis hospital will allow integrate all children's medical services with adult services as part
of the 'family' based general practice concept. Re-training and training of GPs is expected to raise the
share of GPs over 50 % in all ambulatory primary care medical encounters. The project will develop a
pilot model of dispersed GP group practice that will link small practices in Miroslavos, Simnas and
Krokialaukis communities to provide a network of professional support and cooperation of isolated GPs.
The project will finance refurbishment of family practice offices and health centres, provision of
medical and office equipment and limited number of vehicles for the GPs in isolated rural areas. Training
and retraining of PHC providers will be provided by national institutions.
B11.2 Hospital restructuring program. The objective of the program is to improve the efficiency,
cost-effectiveness and quality of care by establishment of a day-surgery unit and structural reorganisation
of the Alytus apskritis hospital. The reduction in the need for beds and integration of adult and children
care in Alytus policlinic will enable the hospital to close and dispose of some of the worst quality and
most inefficient patient and service accommodation, including the laundry building, ambulance
headquarters, garages and peripheral offices, and the children's infectious diseases department. The
targets for hospital restructuring program are 20% reduction of hospital beds, 40% of all routine surgery
undertaken on a day basis, reduction of ALOS to 9 days, and 10% improvement of financial performance
of the hospital complex (input/output).

The project will finance architectural design, functional planning and superivison of civil works,
civil works, medical and office equipment.
Sub-component B2: Kaunas Pilot Project33
Kaunas apskritis is located in central lowlands. It covers 8,170 sq. kms (12.5% of Lithuania's
total area). The population of 755,046 people consists of 74% urban population that is higher than
Lithuania average. The epidemiological and demographic profile is in line with Lithuania average.
Kaunas apskritis had in 1996 31 hospitals (117.5 beds per 1,000 population), 21 policlinics, 46
ambulatoriums and 142 medical posts. In 1996, the apskritis had 44.4 physicians and 109.1 middle level
health personnel per 10,000 population. Kaunas, the second largest city in Lithuania, has a very high
concentration of health care services, including the largest hospital in Europe (2,228 beds in 1996). The
apskritis faces huge restructuring challenge given the economically unsustainable excess service capacity.
B2. 1 Health promotion and primary prevention program. The objective of the program is to
design and implement an organisational structure capable of delivering coherent and cohesive health
promotion programs in the apskritis level. The project activities support training of health information
specialists to be stationed in the policlinics and health centres, production and dissemination of mass
media materials and minor civil works to create appropriate physical environment. The approach is
consistent with the national health program and strategy to reduce mortality rates from ichaemic heart
disease and stroke through effectively controlling risk factors suc as elevated blood pressure, hyper-
cholesterolemia, diet, overweight and diabetes. The beneficiaries of the program are the primary health
care providers and their catchment population.
B2.2 Regional PHC development program. The objective of the program is to significantly
accelerate the development of PHC services to achieve a critical mass of GPs in both rural and urban
areas of the region. Specifically, the project aims to achieve at least 55% of population covered by
qualified GPs practicing within developed PHC models by the end of the project. The project will
support change programs in Dainava, Central and Silainiai Polyclinics and pilot models of dispersed
group practices in Jonava and Prienai districts as well as GP rural outposts. The project activities include
training and retraining of general practitioners and nurses, refurbishment of general practice offices,
provision of medical and office equipment and limited number vehicles for the GPs in isolated rural areas.
B2.3 Hospital restructuring program. The objective is to improve quality of care for patients by
introducing new technologies and techniques and evidence-based approaches, to reduce lengths of stay
and unnecessary hospital admissions as well as to leverage optimisation of selected acute care services in
the region. The project will support development of a day surgery units (DSU) in the Kaunas Clinical
Hospital No. II and/or No. III and consolidation of selected hospital services to improve efficiency of
acute hospital service delivery. The DSU will have a maximum capacity of 5000-6000 cases per year and
will enable a 30-45 surgical bed capacity reduction of the respective hospitals. Investments into the two
hospitals are linked to restructuring commitments that will be set forth in the implementation agreements.
The project activities will include refurbishment of facilities, provision of medical and office equipment
and training.
B2.4 Community mental health services program. The objective of the program is to establish in
each municipality a multi-disciplinary team operating from community mental health centres in
policlinics. The teams will provide a range of ambulatory, day care and community based preventive,
diagnostic, therapeutic, rehabilitation and after care services and cooperate closely with PHC services,
social and welfare services and inpatient mental health facilities. Once these centers have been established

they are expected to provide practically the usual mental health services for their catchment populations
and leave only special tasks for ambulatory secondary care. The centers are expected to become key
elements in the attempts to reduce high suicide rates by offering good access to crisis intervention. A 10
% reduction in referrals to psychiatric hospital care is expected to take place. The project activities will
support refurbishment of facilities, working material and training.
B2.5 Ambulance and emergency services development program. As the number of GPs increases
the role of ambulance and emergency services must be reviewed in order to make efficient use of the
GPs' potential in acute care. Ambulances and their crew will be in the future used for serious medical and
traumatological emergencies and the GPs and other Primary Health Care after-the-office-hours services
will take up the responsibility of a bulk of present tasks of ambulance services. The project will support
the development and implementation of a new regional emergency ambulance system, which is
compatible with the development described above. The investments are expected to result in at least 10 %
reduction of recurrent costs per ambulance kilometer and in a reduction of the number of vehicles needed
to serve the apskritis population.
The project activities include technical assistance for system development, limited number of
emergency care vehicles, communications' equipment, training and retraining of emergency medical
staff. Disbursement for ambulances is contingent on conducting a review of the ambulance services
system in Lithuania and incorporating the recommendations into Kaunas regional ambulance network
reorganization plan.
Sub-component B3. Utena Pilot Project34
Utena apskritis is located in the eastern part of Lithuania (see map), has an area of 7,021 sq. km
and a population of 201,601. Compared to the rest of country, the apskritis has lower than average
economic situation, higher than average elderly population, higher than average mortality and lower than
average birth rate. The apskritis is a location for the Lithuania only nuclear power plant, closure of which
in medium term is currently discussed in relation to Lithuania's EU membership application. In 1997, the
apskritis had 6 acute care hospitals with a total of 1197 beds and 381 nursing/long term care beds (162 in
small nursing hospitals). The apskritis has well developed network of PHC facilities. The health
services produced 4.1 outpatient visits and 1.4 hospital admissions per capita in 1997.
B3. I Regional PHC services development program will support training and retraining of PHC
providers, refurbishment and equipment for policlinics and general practices and limited number of
vehicles for GPs in rural areas. Over the life of the project 41 general practices will be established in the
apskritis policlinics, ambulatoriums and health posts.
Improvement of efficacy and efficiency of the PHC system is expected to have the following
impact by 2004: Reduction of referrals to specialists by 20-30 %, reduction of direct non-referral based
encounters with ambulatory specialists by 20-30 %, handling of about 30 % of the present calls to the
ambulance by GPs, nurses and GPs' on-call services instead of the ambulance services; reduction of
hospital admission rate by 5 %; about 20-30 % savings in utility costs in the renovated facilities;
reduction of the number of specialist FTEs35 by 20 %.
B3.2 Hospital restructuring program supports steps towards optimisation of hospital services
capacity based on apskritis working group analysis recommending that to ensure quality and efficiency
acute care services in the future be provided in 2-4 hospitals. The project will support renovation and

restructuring of the Utena Regional Hospital, consolidation of maternity services of Visaginas, Zarasai
and Ignalina hospitals and reconfiguration and re-profiling of Moletai Hospital based on their prospective
roles in the regional health services provision plan. Restructuring commitments that will be set forth in
the implementation agreements. The analysis of future demand for hospital services foresees 18% decline
of beds and 12% reduction of medical staff by 2004.
The project will finance rehabilitation of selected hospital facilities, medical and office equipment
and consultant services in functional planning, architectural design and works supervision.
B3.3 Ambulance services development program will support the reorganisation and modemisation
of the apskritis emergency ambulance system. General Practitioners are expected to become a first point
of contact also in acute and urgent cases. Therefore a locally adapted system of how GPs will be on call
outside the normal working hours on weekdays and on weekends must be planned. For accidents and
other emergencies, a call centre and appropriately designed territorial placement system for paramedic
and medical ambulance teams will be set up. The project supports system development, limited number
of emergency care vehicles, communications' equipment, training and retraining of emergency medical
staff. Disbursement for ambulances is contingent on conducting a review of the ambulance services
system in Lithuania and incorporating the recommendations into Utena regional ambulance network
reorganization plan.
Subcomponent B4. Vilnius Pilot Projec#'6
Vilnius apskritis is the largest in Lithuania. The area covers 9,650 sq. kms. Out of the total
population of 895,000, 575,000 live in the city of Vilnius, capital of the Republic. Overall, 80% of the
population live in urban settings. Ethnic composition of the population is multinational, including
Lithuanians, Poles, Russians, Byelorussians. The Vilnius apskritis has excess supply of health services:
44 physicians, 103 middle level health personnel and 108 hospital beds per 10,000 population. The
apskritis has higher than Lithuania's average morbidity rates that at least partially can be supply driven.
The apskritis is very complex politically and faces enormous challenges to adjust the health services
provision with changing socio-economic and demographic realities.
B4. I Vilnius aspkritis PHC services restructuring program will support consolidation of Vilnius
City policlinic services from 12 to no more than 1 1 sites and development of GP practices in the areas
where geographic access to policlinics is limited. The consolidation of policlinics will take place through
consolidating freestanding children-only and women-only with formerly adult population policlinics
consistent with family oriented general practice. It was agreed that by EOP there will be no single
specialty or special population group linked policlinics in Vilnius. The project will support refurbishment
of the facilities and provide medical and office equipment to eight consolidated policlinics37 in Vilnius
and I 5 GP practices in areas with remote access to policlinics, training and retraining of PHC providers,
technical assistance for development and piloting financial management models for policlinics. The
Vilnius PHC development activities will also support strengthening of community nursing for an
estimated 575 patients.
The project will also support improvement of General Practices in the Ukmerge and Svencionys
municipalities of the Vilnius apskritis. The Ukmerge (Svencionys) municipality will require services of
27(17) GPs and 30 (25) nurses who will be trained during the project time. Fourteen (six) staff would
also receive management training under the first component of the project. The project will also support
investments into facility refurbishment, medical and office equipment and limited vehicles.

B4.2 A hospital restructuring program will support a conversion of the Railway Hospital from
acute care facility into long term and nursing care facility. The primary objectives of the project activity
is to reduce excess acute care capacity, to respond to unmet need for nursing beds in the Vilnius
(currently 0.1 beds per 1,000 population), improve the efficiency of management of hospital plant and
improve quality of service. The current hospital structure bed complement of 190 beds consists of the
following wards: (i) septic traumatology (60 beds); (ii) internal medicine (40 beds); (iii) gastroenterology
(20 beds); (iv) neurology (25 beds); (v) intensive care (5 beds); (vi) nursing care (50 beds). The
restructured hospital will have 150 beds in 2 buildings. A sound business plan will be produced assuring
that the hospital is a viable entity under the GOL regulations of funding long term care and social care
services.
Project Component C. Project Management - US$1.3 Million
Sub-component C.1. Project Management
To prepare and implement the activities of the Project, a Project Management Unit (PMU) was
established by the Ministry of Health in 1997. A PHRD Grant (TF-029690) has financed technical
assistance and training to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Health to manage effectively project
implementation. The PMU is currently staffed by a team of six persons: PMU Director; Project
Implementation Officer; Health Financing and Health Services Reform Component Coordinators;
Procurement Officer; Chief Financial Officer; Accountant; and Administrative Secretary. In addition,
two component coordinators for Health Financing and Primary Health Care work full-time within the
PMU to oversee implementation of these activities under the Project. To facilitate Project
implementation and the achievement of the Project's development objectives in a timely fashion, the
Project will continue to support the current PMU structure throughout the implementation period. To
oversee the restructuring of health services in the four pilot regions and facilitate implementation at the
local level, a core team of at least two staff would be placed at each of the four Apskritis participating in
the Project.
To provide managerial policy guidance, oversee the Project preparation phase, and facilitate
endorsement of the Project's health sector financing reforns and health services restructuring, a Project
Steering Committee (SC) has been operating since Project inception. The SC will continue to provide
policy guidance and oversee Project implementation. The SC will remain operational throughout the
Project, and will work closely with the PMU Director. The Steering Committee is chaired by the Minister
of Health, and includes the Vice-Minister, the PMU Director, MOH officials for PHC and health
financing, and selective local health care officials. The Steering Committee would encourage
participation in meetings of stakeholders or experts that could be consulted on specific subjects discussed.
The PMU would be responsible for managing the project implementation and maintaining
informed MOH management of progress achieved and issues requiring action and solutions. Under the
management of the PMU Director, the PMU would be specifically responsible, among others, of the
following tasks: (i) facilitate project implementation, promote the objectives and sector efficiency
reforms being supported under the Project; (ii) monitor progress in the achievement of the agreed
Development Objectives, benchmarks, and outputs of the Project as defined in the Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs); (iii) coordinate Project Activities with responsible MOH Departments and local health
care providers; (iv) establish and maintain a Financial Management System (FMS) to accurate reflect all
project expenditures, meeting international accounting and auditing standards; (v) conduct procurement,
in accordance with Bank Guidelines, for purchasing goods, works, and services, with due diligence to
economy and efficiency; (vi) produce quarterly Project Management Reports (PMR), including physical,
financial, and procurement implementation progress; and (vii) liaise with financiers, donors, and the
appropriate media or public relations entities.



Page 48
Financial Management Systems. Under the management of the PMU Director, the PMU has
been implementing a PHRD grant since December 1997, and has gained experience in disbursements, the
operations of the Special Account, and in processing contracts for goods and services. The PMU will
continue under the Project to be responsible for financial management and reporting procedures that are
acceptable to the Bank. Due to capacity constraints, financial management systems have been inadequate
to support deployment of resources with the purpose of ensuring economy, efficiency and effectiveness in
the delivery of outputs required to achieve desired outcomes; however, to strengthen the FMS capacity of
the PMU, financial management consultants were contracted to assist the PMl develop a viable financial
management system including a comprehensive manual of financial procedures, Chart of Accounts, and a
fully integrated project accounting structure, using appropriate accounting software. In addition, a
suitably qualified and experienced Financial Officer was recruited to participate in the development of the
financial management system, and to guide and direct the financial management operations.
The proposed Financial Management System would be able to produce a Project Financial
Statement, including Summary of Sources and Uses of Funds, Special Account Reconciliation Statement,
Cash Withdrawal Statement, and Cash Forecast. The Chart of Accounts would facilitate presentation of
summary expenditures by Component, Activity, and Loan Disbursement Category. Although the PMU
will maintain Project accounts of eligible expenditures, the MOF is expected to continue to operate the
Special Account through a commercial Bank.
Project Implementation Plan (PIP). A detailed draft PIP was submitted by the PMU during
Negotiations, and was acceptable to the Bank. The PIP has been completed by the PMU jointly with the
Working Groups and Apskritis. The four Project Apskritis received technical assistance to develop
integrated health services restructuring plans. The development objectives and key performance
indicators for health services restructuring are outlined in each Apskritis proposal and will be incorporated
in the Pilot Implementation Agreements to be entered into between the MOH and the administration of
each pilot region.

Summary of Benefits and Costs:
Both current and investment costs are considered irrespective of source of finance. The benefits are
limited to direct financial benefits that are measurable and to indirect economic benefits that are likely to
occur as a result of the project. Intangible benefits such as improved quality, better information and
health status, better access, etc., are not quantified in the analysis. The analysis is based on costs and
benefits over a ten-year period.
The costs and the expected benefits of the project are estimated in three main areas each including
components that work against similar targets: (i) Support to Health Reform; (ii) Primary Health Care
Development and Health Service Restructuring in the four pilot regions; and, (iii) Project Management.
A. Support to Health Reform
Different investments aiming at supporting health care reforms are analyzed simultaneously. This
includes programs to support development of regional resource allocation fortnula, allocation of
investment funds, improved effectiveness of provider reimbursement and contracting and efforts to
strengthening the capacity of national health institutions. It also covers the substantial part of the sub-
component addressed to investment in information management at hospitals and primary health care
providers as well as at planning and coordination agencies.
Effects of the investments to support health reform are allocation and efficiency related. Better
allocation of resources linked to needs is expected. The efficiency gains (or savings) of this change are
difficult to estimate but an assumption was made that the change implies transfer of resources from less to
more cost-effective treatments. On the provider side, the improved information systems will probably
result in reduced duplications and reduction of some services. F or example, a doctor will have better
access about the patient's prior results from X-rays, laboratory test etc. and decides not to perform another
one.
38   Economic analysis will be completed during the appraisal. Summary of the design of the analysis is in the
main text of the PAD.

The improvement and development of
the investment policy will consolidate health
investment and capital financing policy. The                Knowledge
analysis assumes an improved rate of return on
investments from better investment program
which equals 10% of present investment from                                  f

difficult to quantify and there are other factors that could influence this dependence. Still, the analysis
assumes that the combined effect of changing provider reimbursement and contracting and support of
strategic information planning and coordination is likely to result in improved overall efficiency of health
services.
The project support to health reform is expected to have a NPV of US$ 21 million and IRR of 66
percent (Table 1).

B. Health Service Restructuring
The project support to major restructuring in the four apskritis is expected to have a significant
impact on maintenance costs, hospital admissions, ALOS, number of beds, etc. In order to estimate the
effects of these changes a questionnaire was sent to all involved pilot projects and followed up telephone
interviews. Prices for different services and the proportion of fixed and variable costs were based on
average figure from representative provider units.
There are also indirect benefits in terms of productivity gains from less days lost due to increased
primary health care service, investment in day-care surgery and overall shorter length-of-stay. For day-
care surgery the analysis considers the loss of productivity since part of the curative treatment is
transferred from the hospital to the family. For many discharges one other family member has to stay
home for some days.



Page 55
The productivity gains are derived from shorter length of stay and fewer admissions to hospitals.
Since most patients are either elderly, children and other people not at work, the assumption was made
that about 20% per cent of all bed day savings result in productivity gains. The average number of days
worked per employed was estimated to 220 days a year.
Apart from the costs for the investment and incremental recurrent costs, consideration was taken to
other running costs that will occur as a result of the project. Also the capital costs for replacing
equipment, vehicles etc. during the evaluation period was considered using depreciation principles.
The project support to restructuring of the health services in the four pilot regions is estimated to
have a negative financial NPV of US$ 9.2 million and a negative FRR of 6% 39 When indirect financial
benefits are included, this subcomponent will have a positive NPV as well as generate positive IRR. The
analysis does not include intangible benefits such as improved quality of services (Table 2).

C. Summary of the total project - incl. Project Management
Total costs and benefits of the project is arrived at by including the cost for project management
and an additional benefit from the demonstration effect of pilots and synergies from the coordination and
implementation process that is assumed to be equal to 1% of public HCE starting from 01/02.

39    The project uses a very conservative assumption about the savings from economic use of vacated policlinic
space. If 50% of extra costs of the decentralised PHC model will be offset by savings from vacated space, FRR and
NPV tuam positive. See sensitivity analysis.

Sensitivity analysis / Switching values of critical items:
Introduction of a decentralized model of General Practitioner based Primary Health Care system
may lead to extra layer of health care system. Financial savings would only occur if physical resources
released in policlinics and hospitals will be put for alternative economic use (cut costs, generate income)
or closed (cut costs). If no expected savings from closed polyclinics or less space would occur, the IRR
for PHC subcomponent of all four pilot apskritis would be negative and the NPV=US$ -6 million. With
50% of extra costs be set off by savings, IRR would become positive and with 100% extra costs set off by
efficient use or closing of vacated space, both IRR and NPV will become positive (Table 4). To monitor
this critical factor, the use of vacated space will be monitored by the PMU at mid-term and end of project.

Lithuania Health Project
Development of Project Financial Management System
Introduction. As part of project appraisal of the Lithuania Health Project, a Financial Management
Capacity Assessment was carried out during the period of March 22-April 8, 1999. The objective of the
assessment was to determine the Borrower's and implementing agencies' capacity to maintain financial
management systems, including accounting, financial reporting, and auditing systems - adequate to ensure
that they can provide to the Bank accurate and timely information regarding project resources and
expenditures, in accordance with OP/BP 10.02. The review focussed on the assessment of Project
Management Unit (PMU), and financial reporting in the health care institutions, as well as arrangements
for financial reporting and accountability for public funds by the Territorial and State Patients Funds.
Overall the project will satisfy the Banks' minimum financial management requirements, but with risks
limited to general capacity shortcomings in the implementing agencies that may result in unintentional
errors, omissions, miscalculations, late submission of financial statements, and financial statements that
may not reach acceptable standards. Subject to the Development Action Plan being successfully
addressed prior to effectiveness, the Bank's minimum financial management requirements will be
satisfied. Weaknesses and inadequacies found during the assessment are summarized below.
Internal Control Systems. Due to capacity limitations in the country as a whole, the PMU has been
unable to attract well-trained and qualified accountants. All the three accountants who have worked in the
PMU lacked experience in systems development and, as a result, the PMU had not developed standards
and guidelines for internal control and financial accounting, with clear delegation and segregation of
duties. However, with technical assistance from an international accounting firm, comprehensive manuals
of procedures and adequate internal control mechanisms were developed to guide staff and minimize risks
of errors and omissions, as well as delays in transactions, recording, and reporting. The written standards
and procedures clarify responsibilities, including levels of authority, clear control over assets, cash and
bank accounts, easily available access to supporting documentation, and timely and accurate financial
reporting.
Project Accounting System. The MOH-PMU has maintained separate accounts for project preparation
activities financed under a PHRD Grant. With technical assistance, the PHRD grant accounts are now up
to date, and an independent international accounting firm has been contracted to complete the audit. The
PMU accountant and chief financial officer will continue to receive training throughout project
implementation, as well as receiving support from international technical assistance.
Project Planning and Budgeting. With support from technical assistance, a manual has been developed
outlining the PMU's budgetary policies and procedures. Further technical assistance during project
implementation will include the preparation of further detail defining responsibilities for budget
preparation, adoption, execution, monitoring and reporting, as well as budgetary control procedures by
staff of the PMIJ and health care institutions.
Staffing. The PMU is currently staffed by the PMU Director, Procurement Specialist, Project
Implementation Officer, Project Accountant, two coordinators for Primary Health Care and Health
Services Reform activities under the Project, and an Administrative Secretary. The Project Accountant
has clear understanding of government accounting systems, regulations and requirements, but lacks
exposure to international accounting practices and standards. Although the accountant is undergoing some
accounting training by distance learning, the attendant pressure means that she is most unlikely to attain
the desired level of confidence by project effectiveness. The accounting personnel employed in the health



Page 71
care institutions are hard-working, but there are obvious capacity limitations due to lack of recognized
professional accounting qualifications, and exposure to commercial accounting practices.
Disbursements, Replenishments and Documentation. The Accounts Section of the PMU does not
currently have in place a financial management system that can provide the information required by the
World Bank for the LACI-based Project Management Reporting (PMR) disbursement mechanism.
However, as capacity is developed to comply with PMR-based disbursements, it is expected that during
the second project year a review of such capacity would be conducted with the view to adopt PMR
disbursements. Thus, in the short-term, existing disbursement procedures would be followed as outlined
in the World Bank's Disbursement Handbook. Disbursement of funds would be made against Withdrawal
Applications with full documentation or against Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) submitted by the
Borrower.
Audit Arrangements. The Lithuanian Law does not make it obligatory for organizations such as the
PMU to submit audited financial statements. The law, however, provides for inspection of public
institutions by state and municipal institutions and entities offinancial activity control. In order to
comply with Bank reporting requirements, an independent and qualified audit firm, with experienced
staff, will carry out an audit of the project accounts.
Financial Management Capacity Assessment. A detailed financial management capacity assessment
report and proposed development action plan to strengthen accounting weaknesses was discussed with
and presented to the PMU. Successful implementation of the Action Plan will ensure that the project
operates in a healthy environment, under existing disbursement arrangements. Financial management
consultants are now engaged to help the PMU develop adequate systems of accounting and internal
control.. In addition, it was agreed that a suitably qualified and experienced Financial Officer would be
recruited to participate in the development of the financial management system, and to guide and direct
the financial management operations throughout the Project implementation period.
Pilot Hospital Financial Management Systems. Technical assistance will also be required to help
upgrade and transforn the accounting systems in health care facilities in the pilot regions. This will
facilitate introduction, on a pilot basis, of Hospital Financial Management System, with emphasis on cost
accounting and activity-based budgeting procedures.
