provide most of the house\n            connections to serve 215,000 additional persons (over half\n            of which are urban poor, defined as those persons earning\n            less than one-third of the national average per capita\n            income); strengthen EAM operational and administrative\n            capacity; determine future water supply sources; and\n            determine the most suitable institutional arrangements for\n            the sector. It comprises construction and equipment of six\n            deep wells, construction of three water tanks, installation\n            of distribution mains and 20,000 house connections,\n            acquisition of pumping equipment and a new computer, and\n            consulting services. Since Managua is in an earthquake zone,\n            the project works have been designed to withstand seismic effects."}, "docdt": "1977-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
