The road improvement component was implemented\n            at approximately the estimated cost, yielding the estimated\n            rate of returns, in line with appraisal estimates. The Fund\n            for National and Regional Roads (FNRR), achieved\n            considerable institutional improvements, and the Customs\n            Administration in Macedonia, stands at the forefront within\n            the region, in recognition for its customs reform process.\n            Regardless of success, the following lessons learned are\n            suggested: 1) Although project design and its complexities,\n            should remain within the project's stated objectives, a\n            realistic overall implementation assessment, defines a\n            highly satisfactory achievement, vs. a troubled one, with\n            various difficulties stemming from inappropriate project\n            design. 2) Implementing government agencies are the primary\n            determinants for timely completion of individual project\n            components. Thus, FNRR's experience, contributed to the\n            timely civil works completion. 3) The government strong\n            commitment should convey that sense of ownership, paramount\n            for prioritizing specific activities. Conversely,\n            flexibility on the part of the Bank, would convey a sense of\n            willingness to consider particular circumstances, such as,\n            the high percentage approval of retroactive financing, a key\n            factor in easing implementation, and ensuring a timely completion."}, "docdt": "1999-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
