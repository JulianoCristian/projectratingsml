MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLICAN ROAD ORGANIZATION
OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
FOR A TRANSIT FACILITATION PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendations on a
proposed loan to the Republican Road Organization of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
for the equivalent of US$24.0 million to help finance a Transit Facilitation Project. The loan would
be guaranteed by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and it would be at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate with a maturity of twenty years, including five years of grace.
2.           Country/Sector Background.  The main transport infrastructure in the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia consists of 8,216 km of roads (of which about 4,900 km are
paved), a railway network of 700 km, and two international airports in Skopje and Ohrid. The
primary road network, under the jurisdiction of the Republican Road Organization (RO), is 3,526 km
long and carries about 75% of the country's freight traffic.
3.           The configuration of the transport system was iafluenced by geopolitical
considerations of the former Yugoslavia, which emphasized the development of the North-South
Corridor (namely the Trans-Yugoslav Highway). This situation has now changed: the North-South
corridor is closed due to the United Nations imposed blockade of Serbia and unresolved issues with
Greece. As a result, the Port of Salonika in Greece, which provides the shortest and most economic
trade route, no longer serves the landlocked former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The East-
West road corridor is now the only connection of the country with the rest of the world. However,
road deterioration, congestion, excessive waiting time for border crossings and poor interface with
ports in Albania and Bulgaria make the East-West corridor ill-suited as the main life-line for the
country's economy, and transport costs have increased several fold. Upgrading the link between
Skopje and the Adriatic and Black Seas, and facilitating the movement of crucial goods such as oil,
has become one of the most urgent Government priorities.
4.           The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is making concerted efforts together
with Albania and Bulgaria, to deal with the sudden increase in traffic due to the emergency role of the
corridor. Regular tri-lateral meetings are being held to coordinate road investments, to develop a
regional framework for customs procedures and to ensure adequate port services for the landlocked
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (paras. 5 and 6).
5.           The development of the East-West corridor, although growing in importance for
domestic traffic and as a feeder to the North-South artery, was hampered by the economic and
political isolation of Albania, which until 1992 prohibited transit through its territory, and to some
extent, by the administrative difficulties of crossing Bulgaria and the commercial relations and
practices inherent to the centrally planned economies. The importance of the East-West corridor,
however, goes beyond the short-run objective of overcoming the difficulties imposed by the
interruption of North-South traffic and of providing access to the ports of Durres in Albania and
Burgas in Bulgaria. The corridor (the ancient Roman Via Ignatia) offers the opportunity of opening
new markets and the provision of transit services between countries East and West. The need to
upgrade the Macedonian portion of the corridor to acconunodate the growing domestic traffic was



- 2 -
being addressed under the Bank's Third Highway Sector Project for Yugoslavia. The loan was
approved by the Board on June 20, 1990 but was cancelled prior to its effectiveness when the former
Yugoslavia was dissolved. Nevertheless, because of the urgency of the investments, the RO went
ahead with contracting works in three of the four appraised road sections following procedures
acceptable to the Bank and it is financing the works with its own budget.' The Albanian link of the
corridor is partially being upgraded under the ongoing Credit 2499-AL, and further works would be
included under a proposed Second Transport Prcject for Albania. Also, the Bank is supporting the
development of a master plan for the port of Durres, including the provision of facilities for handling
exports and imports for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania.
6.            In addition to road deterioration and traffic congestion, outmoded custom procedures
also cause high transport costs. Corrective measures should result in reducing the time required at
border crossings. Improvement of physical facilities (expansion of parking, waiting and inspection
areas) are being implemented with bilateral assistance. Also, the US Government, through the US
Customs Agency, carried out an assessment of the needs to modernize customs procedures. The
proposed project, in a concerted effort with the IMF, will support the Govemnment in its trade
facilitation efforts through the implementation of an Action Plan comprising measures that are in line
with those being implemented at the regional level with the support of the European Union.2
7.            Road management in the former Republics of Yugoslavia is unique. The Republican
Road Organization was an autonomous entity responsible only to Parliament and with weak links to
the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC). Financing for expansion and maintenance of
the primary network was provided by an efficient pricing system which directly transferred funds
from user charges to the RO's accounts. The system is now being reviewed to give MTC a larger
role in road management, particularly at the planning stage. Also, the transfer of funds from fuel
taxes to RO (about 60% of RO's revenues) will take place through the central budget, a change that
might result in reduced road budgets. The know-how for the preparation of investment plans based
on economic criteria was centralized in Belgrade. The project will address the problem of ensuring
sound allocation of resources among different road activities in a situation of severe budgetary
constraints, through the systematic review of RO's investment and maintenance plans. The project
will also enhance RO, MTC and MUDCEE's planning, project evaluation and pavement management
capabilities, including the integration of environmental concerns in project design.
S.            Rationale for Bank Involvement. In addition to helping the Government overcome the
critical situation caused by the interruption of North-South traffic, the Bank's presence in the sector,
together with the ongoing Bank work in Albania and Bulgaria, could play a significant catalytic role
in modernizing procedures for intra and inter-regional trade. The proposed project is in line with the
Bank's strategy for the country, as outlined in the limited Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
presented to the Board on February 8, 1994. The strategy emphasizes short term macroeconomic
objectives; in particular, meeting the balance of payments shortfalls, deepening the economic
restructuring, and strengthening the social safety net. These objectives will be supported by the
retroactive financing proposed herein (para 12) and by a proposed Financial and Enterprise Sector
1/     Since appraisal of the Third Highway Sector Project, works in the Tetovo-Gostivar road have been mdesigned to account for
increased traffic. The incrased standards were found to be justified both on economic and technical grounds.
2'     The DAF is expected to provide advice to the Customs Agency on those aspects of the modenization program reated to
intermational trade data and revenues.



Adjustment Credit (FESAC) which is expected to be submitted to the Board in May/June 1995,
together with a revised CAS. The CAS also calls for the improvement of basic transport
infrastructure to reduce transport costs and support the resumption of economic growth, which would
be the main outcome of the proposed project.
9.           Lessons of Past Experience. The RO is the direct successor to the former Republic
Roads Organization with which the Bank worked successfully in four of the thirteen highway loans to
the former Yugoslavia. The Completion Reports and Performance Audit Reports for the Bank's
highway loans to the former Yugoslavia evaluated the projects as economicaliy justified and positively
contributing to operational improvements. Further, the projects were instrumental in developing in
the former Yugoslav Republics an efficient scheme for road pricing and financing.
10.          Project Objectives. The main objectives of the project are to: (i) address the crisis
created for transport in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia caused by the closing of the
Serbian and Greek borders to the transport of goods, through the facilitation of East-West transit;
thereby reducing transport costs; and (ii) strengthen the road management capabilities of MTC,
MUDCEE and RO, particularly in the areas of planning and pavement management.
11.          Project Description. The project would have three components: (i) the civil works
component would improve the country's access to the ports of Bulgaria and Albania through the
rehabilitation and upgrading of about 60 km of the East-West Corridor; Cii) the transit facilitation
component would fund technical assistance and equipment for the development and implementation of
a modern custom system; and (iii) the institutional strengthening component would fund technical
assistance and training for strengthening MTC, MUDCEE and RO in the area of economic evaluation
of different road interventions, the integration of environmental concerns in project design, and life-
cost planning for pavement management.
12.          Proiect Cost and Financing. As already mentioned, civil works for the road
rehabilitation and upgrading component of the project were tendered in the framework of the Third
Highway Sector Project for the former Republic of Yugoslavia. The procurement process was
subsequently reviewed and found satisfactory to the Bank. The total cost of the project, including
sunk costs, is estimated at US$38.87 million. About 50% of the work was completed by the end of
1994. The loan would include retroactive financing of up to US$10 million for expenditures incurred
since the former Yugoslav RX2public of Macedonia became independent (September 9, 1991). This
amount of retroactive financing, representing 42% of the loan amount would exceed the standard 10%
limit. In view of the unique circumstances surrounding the cancellation of the Third Highway Sector
Project and the fact that procurement was done following Bank guidelines in the expectation that the
works would be financed by the Bank, an exception to the standard limit is justified. Government
local counterpart financing totals US$14.70 million, of which US$6.8 million has already been spent.
13.          Project Implementation. Except for those project components related to border
crossings, which will be under the responsibility of the Customs Agency, the project will be
implemented by the RO through a Project Implementation Unit. MTC and MUDCEE will oversee
the technical assistance for planning. RO is an experienced Bank borrower with a successful record
for project execution. A Steering Committee with representatives from RO, MTC, MUDCEE and the
Customs Agency will be appointed to coordinate project implementation. A Project Implementation
Plan was agreed upon during negotiations.

14.          Sustainability. Because of the importance of the East-West corridor (both for
domestic and international transit) and the high level of traffic even prior to the interruption of North-
South transit, project sustainability is heavily dependent on the ability of RO to properly maintain the
road corridor at an adequate level of serviceability. RO's good past performance in this regard and
its level of financial independence provides sufficient assurance that project benefits will be sustained
throughout the life of the project.
15.          Environmental Aspcts. The project bas an environmental rating of B. Internal
procedures for addressing environmental issues in project design and implementation were reviewed
by the Bank and found acceptable. They aim at ensuring that potential for any negative
environmental impact, such as erosion, scouring of the landscape, improper waste disposal or
destruction of vegetation will be minimized through proper site management and drainage design.
Under ongoing contracts, the contractors are legally responsible for maintaining work sites pollution
free, restoring ground conditions to their original state and equipping asphalt plants with dust
collectors. Also, RO will implement minor remedial actions, in the form of sound barriers, to
protect the inhabitants of five houses illegally built on the road side. Environmental benefits are
expected through improved road drainage and, at border crossings, reduced congestion and improved
sanitary conditions.
16.          Issues and Actions.   During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
matters: (i) that only such investments will be authorized for the expansion, upgrading and
maintenance of the road network as are determined to be economically viable and environmentally
sound, on the basis of criteria and guidelines satisfactory to the Bank; (ii) the Project Implementntion
Plan; and (iii) a plan of action covering 1996 to 1999 for customs modernization. Prior to Loan
Effectiveness RO should: (i) establish a Project Implementation Unit; Cii) the Guarantor to establish
the Steering Committee with representatives of RO, MTC, MUDCEE, and the Customs Agency to
coordinate project implementation; and (iii) the Guarantor and the Borrower to sign a Fund Sharing
Agreement satisfactory to the Bank for the implementation of the transit facilitation component.
17.          Project Benefits. The proposed project would facilitate the international movement of
goods and passengers through the reduction of transport costs in one of the main export-import
corridors in the country. This would be accomplished by reducing congestion in the Tetovo-Gostivar
road section, decreasing the present value of road expenditures in the Kichevo-Botun road section by
rehabilitating the road now and avoiding more expensive reconstruction at a later date, and reducing
border crossing waiting time by incorporating modern customs procedures. The technical assistance
component is also expected to increase the allocative efficiency of the scarce national resources.
18.          Risks. The project does not present any technical and/or environmental risks. The
main risk is related to the fragile political and economic situation, which may impact the availability
of counterpart funds. That risk, however, is within acceptable levels because of the high priority of
the road works, the historic financial independence and solvency of RO, the small share that the
proposed investments represent in RO's budget, and the amount of retroactive financing proposed for
the project. There are also risks arising from coordination inadequacies among the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, Albania and Bulgaria to improve border crossings, thus reducing the
expected benefits from the project. The current presence of the Bank in the transport sector of the
three countries, provides an opportunity for encouraging systematic tri-lateral performance
monitoring at the borders, which would reduce that risk to manageable levels.

19.          Recommendations. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
