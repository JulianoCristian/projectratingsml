The project will have\n            three components: 1) the civil works component will improve\n            the country's access to the ports of Bulgaria and\n            Albania through the rehabilitation and upgrading of about 60\n            km of the East-West Corridor; 2) the transit facilitation\n            component will fund technical assistance and equipment for\n            the development and implementation of a modern customs\n            system and the improvement of transit times; and 3) the\n            institutional strengthening component will fund technical\n            assistance and training to strengthen MTC, MUDCEE and RO in\n            the area of economic evaluation of different road\n            interventions and life-cost planning for pavement management."}, "docdt": "1995-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
