Transit\n            Facilitation Project are to assist the Government to: 1)\n            address the crisis created for transport in the former\n            Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia caused by the closure of the\n            Serbian and Greek borders, through the facilitation of\n            East-West transport so as to reduce transport costs; and 2)\n            strengthen the road management capabilities of the Ministry\n            of Transport and Communications, the Ministry of Urban\n            Development (MTC), Civil Engineering, and Environment\n            (MUDCEE), and the Republican Road Organization (RO) of the\n            former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The project will have\n            three components: 1) the civil works component will improve\n            the country's access to the ports of Bulgaria and\n            Albania through the rehabilitation and upgrading of about 60\n            km of the East-West Corridor; 2) the transit facilitation\n            component will fund technical assistance and equipment for\n            the development and implementation of a modern customs\n            system and the improvement of transit times; and 3) the\n            institutional strengthening component will fund technical\n            assistance and training to strengthen MTC, MUDCEE and RO in\n            the area of economic evaluation of different road\n            interventions and life-cost planning for pavement management."}, "docdt": "1995-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
