THIRD POPULATIOI4 AND FAMILY HEALTH PROJECT
CREDIT AN1b pROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                Bangladesh, acting by its President.
Amount:                  US$78.0 oillion.
Project Description:    The project would assist the Government of
Bangladesh to reduce fertility and infant and
maternal mortality during its Third Five Year
Plan (1985-90). It would have the following
componenttS   (a) Family Planning Service Delivery
Consolidatton and Expansion; (b) Maternal-Child
Health (4CII) programs; (c) Communications, (d)
women's Programs; (e) Support to Non-Governmental
Organizations and Innovative Programs; (f) Research
and Eva, ation, and (g) Project Management
Support. The proposed project would operate
nationwide.
The main risk under the proposed project is that
the Governl3ent will fail to meet its fertility
reduction and MCH goals because of technical and
managerial deficiencies or flagging commitment to
the prograul. The project is designed to reduce the
technical, inanagerial and administrative risks to
an acceptable level and to monitor commitment
through fOrI,al reviews of both annual performance
and propOsed yearly budgets.

I. INTRODUCTION: DEMOGRAPHY AND MATERNAL-CHILD HEALTH CONDITIONS
A. Demography
1.01      The population of Bangladesh has more than doubled in the past 35
years. It is now around 100 million, with an estimated growth rate of 2.6%
per annum. Population density is one of the highest in the world estimated
at 699 persons per km2 and results in a land-man ratio that has fallen fxom
0.34 acres in 1974 to 0.29 in 1981. All districts are heavily settled
except the Chittagong Hill Tracts wnere the density is 57 per km2. The age
structure of the population gives a high dependency ratio (93%) with 45% of
the population below 15 years. The urban population is now more than 15%
of the total and has an annual growth rate of 10.6%, however, about a third
of the increase is due to a change in the definition of urban populations.
Much of this growth arises from in-migration of young single males seeking
work opportunities and results in an urban sex ratio of 126.
1.02      The total fertility rate (TFR) remains high, at an estimated 5.8
in 1985. However, the TFR has declined from 7 in 1971 as a result of a
rapid increase in the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) from 10% in 1975
to 24-26% today. There has been a remarkable consistency in fertility
across spatial, urban, religious and educational distributions.
Socio-economic differentials in fertility exist, with lower rates in women
married to non-agricultural and white collar workers, though non-working
wives and those with greater assets representing affluent rural families,
have higher rates.
1.03      ExtenGomd breast feeding leads to relatively long birth intervals
of approximately three years, though probably declining with urbanization.
Early marriage is still the norm. More than 50% of women marry by the age
of 16 (1981), although age at marriage has been rising steadily and recent
legislation setting the minimum zge at 18 for women and 21 for men should
reinforce this trend.
1.04      However, the demographic data base in Bangladesh remains weak;
different estimates are available for most key indicators. The second
Bangladesh Fertility Survey which will take place later this year (the
first was conducted in 1975) will improve that base.
1.C5      Using the best available demographic data, several projections
have been developed to predict future population growth. The most
appropriate is based on an ambitious, yet still attainable rise in
contraceptive prevalence to around 40% over the next five years, mainly
from increased satisfaction of unmet need for family planning. This is
expected to produce a TFR of 4.8 by 1990. Thereafter, CPR increases are
likely to slow as general socio-economic conditions will improve only
gradually. Under this scenario, by the year 2000 the CPR is expected to
have risen to 52Z resulting in a TFR of 3.7, and Bangladesh would achieve
replacement fertility in 2025-30 with a total population of over 220
million in 2030. The above scenario differs from those of ;he Government,
which projects a TFR of 4.1 by 1990 followed by a rapid fertility decline
to replacement fertility in the year 2005, with a 62% CPR.



1.06      The current high population growth rate is absorbing resources
required for increased productivity and sustained economic development.
Conversely, economic development, improved educational and living standards
and alleviation of poverty are prerequisites for reductions in child
mortality and associated fertility levels. Arable land, capital and skills
are necessary inputs to achieve increased productivity and job creation.
However, pressure on arable land is already bizIi at 1062 people per km2 and
will rise to 1560 per km2 in the next 15 years; the landless population,
currently between 50-54%, will increase further. Food production is
increasing, but progress toward the Government-s objective of a minimally
adequate 15.5 oz of foodgrains per capita-day, representing 1500 calories,
is slow. Investment per potential new worker is one of the lowest in the
world at $1000 per capita.  Education resources are already fully extended
to meet a primary school enrollment ratio of 54%. Around 2.75 million
children will be added to the primary school population by 2000 depending
on rates of fertility decline. This increased demand on resources will
greatly diminish any capacity to extend coverage or improve standards.
1.07      It is evident that without a substantial decrease in
fertility, improvement in social and economic conditions will be difficult
if not impossible to achieve. However, initial declines in fertility may
be difficult to sustain or accelerate without decreases in presently high
rates of infant and child mortality and rising educational levels and
incomes. Evidence of linkages between fertility and infant and child
mortality in Bangladesh is mixed but indirectly supported by studies
indicating the perceived value of surviving children, particularly sons. A
Bank-funded survey of population and family planning research in Bangladesh
(Staff Working Paper No. 557, 1983) suggests that lower infant mortality
would reduce fertility. A background paper for the 1984 World Development
Report suggests that -most policies and programs for ... reducing mortality
will in most settings over the long run produce greater fertility than
mortality declines."
B. Maternal-Child Health Conditions
1.08      Over the forthcoming decades, maternal and child health services
will require substantial support to improve child survival rates and alter
common perceptions of family size required to meet domestic production and
social security needs. The maternal and child sector of the population
will grow rapidly; children under five years and women aged 15-49 years
will increase from 38.8 million today to almost 54.8 million by 2000 and
69.9 million by 2015, assuming a moderate decline in fertility as projected
by Bank calculations. Substantial increases in both human and financial
resources will be needed to keep pace with or improve currently low levels
of MCH coverage.
1.09      The health status of the population is unacceptably low by all
conventional measurements. Infant mortality is estimated at 132 per 1000
live births, compared with 94 in India and 96 in Burma; child mortality
(1-4 years) remains at an estimated 19/1000 population. Infant mortality
varies substantially by region although variation by social class and
income is small, due in part to uniformly low standards of hygiene and
sanitation and universal and prolonged breast feeding. Deaths in infancy
are concentrated in the first month of life with an estimated neo-natal
mortality rate of 80/1000 live births; this represents 61% of infant



-3-
mortality against an international norm of 30-50%. Surveys indicate that
the principal causes of neonatal death are tetanus (59%), birth trauma and
prematurity (32%) and pneumonias (9%). The remaining infant deaths occur
in the succeeding eleven months due principally to late emerging tetanus
(24%), respiratory infections (27%) and diarrheas (27%). In the second
year of life, covering the weaning period, diarrheal disease is the
predominant cause of death (43%) with contributions from respiratory
infections (14%) and measles (7%). In the 2-5 year age group, diarrheal
disease accounts for 63% of deaths. Maternal mortality is estimated at
6/1000 live births which is about 100 times higher than rates for developed
countries. The principal causes of maternal mortality are complications of
labor, eclampsia and infections arising from septic abortion and unhygienic
delivery.
1.10      The major proportion of infant mortality arises from a limited
number of conditions which reflect the absence of maternal care, low
standards of nutrition and hygiene, overcrowding and poor sanitation. Some
of these conditions such as prematurity, birth trauma, tetanus and severe
dehydration from diarrheal disease can be prevented or controlled
by relatively simple and direct interventions. Others such as
malnutrition, respiratory infections and the prevention of diarrheal
disease require more elaborate and costly measures developed over the
long-term. The major causes of maternal death could be substantially
reduced by relatively simple measures including prenatal care with risk
assessment and referral facilities, the institution of safe birth practices
and the availability of family planning services.
1.11      Determinants of neonatal, infant and child mortality vary with
age. Neonatal mortality is strongly associated with previous child deaths
in the family, suggesting the persistence of hazardous practices, such as
unhygienic delivery giving rise to tetanus. Post-neonatal mortality is
inversely associated with the age of the mother which suggests that
biological and social immaturity are important factors. These could be
influenced by delaying first births through contraception and the
recently increased legal age for marriage. In the early months of life,
when universal and prolonged breast feeding assures a safe and nutritious
food supply, socio-economic differentials in mortality are not
significant. During weaning and thereafter, socio-economic factors have a
significant effect on mortality largely due to maternal education and
differential allocation of familial resources, particularly food.
1.12      According to the Bangladesh Food and Nutrition Sector Review
(Report No. 4974-BD) of January 31, 1985, malnutrition makes a major
contribution to mortality in infancy and childhood. Maternal malr.utrition
is universal in rural areas and results in fetal growth retardation and a
high frequency of low weight births. A recent survey of rural children
from birth to five years identified over 60% of subjects with second or
third degree malnutrition based on weight-for-age measurements. Acute
malnutrition, principally marasmus, is common in the second year of life,
while chronic malnutrition represented by growth retardation is most
frequently found in the fourth year of life.
1.13      Per capita energy consumption has decreased progressively from
2,300 calories in 1962/66 to 2095 in 1975/76 to 1,935 in 1981/82. Less
than 40% of the population now have an adequate energy supply. The most



- 4 -
severely affected groups are landless farm workers and rural informal
non-farmers, whose per capita intake averages 1,500 calories per day, a
critical level for basic function without considering work energy
requirements.

II. NATIONAL POPULATION/MCH PROGRAM
A. Demographic and Health Goals - Historic Perspective
2.01      1965-1973.  Bangladesh's program to control population growth got
underway with voluntary efforts three decades ago. East Pakistan adopted
a national family planning program in 1965, with a target of reducing the
rate of population growth from 3% to 2.7% by 1970. The Government
set up a network of family planning (FP) clinics run by an autonomous
Family Planning Board, independent of the health system. The program
succeeded in creating public awareness about population issues and the use
of contraception but probably made little, if any, impact on fertility
rates. Interrupted by the War of Liberation in 1971, the program had come
to a virtual halt by 1972-73.
2.02      First Five Year Plan.  The First Five Year Plan of 1973 marked
the start of a more meaningful and comprehensive national effort to
moderate fertility. The plan set a five-year demographic target of
reducing the population growth rate from 3% to 2.8% by 1978 and a
longer-term objective of achieving replacement-level fertility by the year
2000. In 1976 the Government adopted a more comprehensive and ambitious
set of policies and objectives which aimed at changing demographic
behavior through information, education and motivation (IEM), as well as
the supply of family planning services. Links between fertility decline
and socio-economic factors such as employment, education, improved health,
reduction in infant and childhood mortality and female participation in the
labor force received explicit recognition. A National Population Council,
chaired by the President, was set up to guide policy formulation and
program review (para. 2.18). The demographic objective was revised to call
for replacement fertility by 1985 to contain population at about 120
million by the end of the century. While there was little serious prospect
that such an ambitious goal cotld be attained, the decision explicitly
reflected Government's concern with and political commitment to curb
population growth. During this period, nascent maternal-child health (MCH)
services made very little headway.
2.03      Second Five Year Plan.  The Second Five Year Plan (1980-85), now
drawing to a close, set a long-term demographic goal of replacement
fertility by 1990. Consistent with that objective, the Plan sought to
reduce the crude birth rate from about 43 per 1000 in FY80 to 32 by FY85,
implying an increase in contraceptive prevalence among eligible couples
from 12.7% in 1979 to about 38% by 1985. The Government placed major
reliance on sterilization, slated to increase from 19% of total acceptors
in FY80 to 43% by FY85; correspondingly the proportion of acceptors using
oral pills and condoms, together accounting for 74% of the total in FY80,
was expected to decline to about 43% by FY85.
2.04      By mid-1982 it became evident that the Government's demographic
objectives for the Second Plan were still over-ambitious. Actual
performance revealed shortfalls of 40.5% in sterilizations, 57.4% in pills,
28.5% in condoms and 44% in IUD insertions against plan targets. The GOB
then undertook a review to identify the major bottlenecks to improved
performance, and revised targets to a CPR of 38-40% by 1990 and replacement



- 6 -
fertility by around the year 2,000. The Bank and the donor community urged
both the adoption of managerial measures to improve program performance and
reconsideration of unattainable demographic targets. Response from the
Government resulted in administrative actions during 1983 and 1984 which
brought about considerable program improvement resulting in a CPR of 24-26%
today, double the rate in 1979. Moreover, according to World Development
Report analysis, over the past 14 years Bangladesh has moved from a
position of very weak support of family planning to a moderate stance
(comparable to Thailand) in terms of official political commitment,
availability of services and other essential criteria, an important shift
unmatched by any other developing country.
2.05      Like contraceptive goals, MCH targets under the Second Plan were
unrealistic. They called for a 20% reduction in the infant mortality rate
(IMR) from an estimated 125/1000 live births in 1980 to around 100 in 1985,
and 75 in 1990, and for a reduction in child mortality from 23/1000 in 1980
to 15 in 1985 and 11 in 1990. They assumed that 30% of children under two
years of age would be immunized against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus
(DPT) by 1985, and 55% by 1990. In reality, between 1979 and 1983 less
than 20% of children were immunized with two doses of DPT and no more than
3% of women in the reproductive age group were immunized against tetanus.
The plan also called for identification and treatment of 25% of second and
third degree malnutrition cases, as against only 3% achieved by 1980.
B. Progress Under the First (1973-78) and Second Five Year (1980-85) Plans
2.06      The Government's efforts to control population growth over the
past 10 years (from 1975-85) have included a wide range cf organizational
and motivational initiatives. The strategy has included six main
components: (i) top-level policy coordination; (ii) government-wide
promotion; (iii) encouragement of NGO efforts; (iv) improvement of
government service delivery; (v) introduction of legal measures to promote
reduced fertility; and (vi) introduction of a system of compensation for FP
users and payments for providers.
2.07      The administrative arrangements which have evolved as a result of
initiatives (i), (ii) and (iv) are described in paras. 2.21-2.24. The
existence of the NCPC (para. 2.18) has provided evidence of visible
high-level support for the program. The education and motivational efforts
by seven involved ministries (para. 2.19) have helped activate demand for
FP services. The service delivery system currently in place (paras.
2.25-2.33) is well-conceived and is expanding towards national coverage in
a methodical and rational way. During the Second Plan, the involvement and
coordination of NGO activities (paras. 2.38-2.39) though still limited to
urban areas, broadened the base for FP motivation and service delivery.
2.08      The Government has introduced a number of measures to help reduce
fertility by raising the social and economic status of women. It has
raised the age of marriage (para 1.03) and prohibited dowries. All nursing
and 50% of primary school teachers' posts have been reserved for women,
along with 10% of posts in Government and its parastatals. Compulsory
female representation is provided for in Parliament and local government
bodies. Additionally a number of projects to increase income-generating
opportunities for women are being implemented, but there is still a long
way to go.



-7-
09 og   The GOvernment has created a system of payments to compensate
QIiients, those vAlo refer clients, and service providers for sterilization
and TUD insertions.  Clent compensation rates are Tk. 175 for male or
termale sterilizations and Tk.15 for an IUD.  Both absolutely and as a
p,oportion of per capita income, clie.it compensation rates in Bangladesh
ate lower than in India and Sri Lanka.
Z.lO      Dais, Government workers and members of the general public
tpceive referral fees ranging from Tk. 15 to Tk. 45 per case; the same
tates apPly to both sterilizations and IUDs. Government doctors who
Ierform sterilizations and attending clinic staff receive Tk. 20 and Tk.
Z, respectively, for each case.  USAID finances around 85% of the cost of
'lient compensation and service provider payments and referral fees.  The
%B meet5 the remaining 15%, around US$500,000 yearly, from its own
1tsources The Government also has announced but not yet set up a system
4f uniOs and worker awards for outstanding performance which is to include
11CH in addition to family planning activities. The Government adopted but
IAcentlY withdrew worker disincentives promulgated on October 20, 1983, for
tailing to meer assigned contraceptive targets and has stated its intention
`entuallY to abolish all referral fees.
Z-11      A recent survey of 922 women tubectomized at clinics managed by
the Bangladesh Association for Voluntary Sterilization indicated that in
S6% of rhe surveYed cases cash or in-kind compensation was not reported as
v reasol for cho0sifng sterilization. Over 95% of the respondents also
I-ported that rheY had been seriously thinking about becoming sterilized
tnt a month or 0ore. These findings indicate that client compensation
-vels are likelY to be low enough not to serve as an inducement for
`terilization.  However, referral fees are subject to special problems and
;veral aspects of the Government's approach to them are potentially
"0taiter-productive.  These are the exclusive use of sterilizations and IUDs
4% the basis for referral fees; the negative effects of referral fees on
\rlcer follow-up of clients, and the danger that clients will get only
11inited information regarding contraceptive methods and side effects.
Qbese problems were revealed in a recent Government-funded study by the
klldepe ndent Program for the Introduction and Adoption of Appropriate
te,CnologY (PIACT).  In response to that study the Government has begun to
KtrY out measures to improve worker follow-up of sterilization clients and
kz ensure that workers adequately inform clients about all forms of
ctitraception and their side effects.
.12        Even with immediate problems corrected, the present system may
Zove to have higher long-term costs and fewer benefits than the GOB now
kt1ticipates.  over the next five years, the program will put increased
b1JPhasiS on MCH and expanded use of child-spacing methods, accompanied
toting the last three years of the project by an expected decline in
'LU4bers of annual sterilizations.  Payments based only on referral for
r1tnical methods may have negative effects on worker performance,
Qkpecta:ions and attitludes in respect of client follow-up, MCH care and
Ptomotioo of child-spacing methods such as pills for which no special
Ituneration is available.  It also is reasonable to assume thaL by 1990 an
Ittreasigg proportion of sterilization clients will be child-spacing
'tteptors switching to a permanent method. Workers could find it more
Rdvant.geous to focus on such clients rather than to recruit new acceptors,
'-'I4ch woold cut back the Possible future rate of CPR growth.



-8-
2.13      Designing a neutral and abuse-free system of client compensatiou
and referral payments is difficult. Current arrangements, which are
closely monitored by USAID, appear to have been relatively free of such
abuse. During previous years, when program focus was exclusively on
contraception, the system arguably provided a useful, if not vital,
management tool. However, as the program balance shifts toward MCH and
spacing methods, so the balance between benefits and costs of the present
compensation and referral fee system also is likely to change. Therefore,
it is essential to consider prospects for altering that system earlier
rather than later.
2.14      The Government views such arrangements as a temporary and dynamic
process, changing as program needs are redefined, and is prepared to
modify that system. Some of the donor community would like to see the
system abolished but appreciates the need for gradual rather than sudden
change. We have accepted the continuation of the system of client
compensation, service provider and temporary referral fees in Bangladesh
under three conditions: a) that the Government takes corrective action
against specific problems revealed by the PIACT study; b) that the
Government will keep the system under continual review, and c) that the
state of such arrangements will be a formal part of annual reviews of
project progress (para 5.09).
2.15      Among the most critical aspects which the GOB needs to study are:
(a) the technical and managerial feasibility of using imnunization and ORT
performance as a basis for worker awards; (b) ways of ensuring appropriate
follow-up of clients, particularly those who have chosen sterilizations or
clinical spacing methods, including possibly compensating acceptors of
clinical methods for a follow-up visit to a UHFWC or UHC; and c) the
continuing need for referral fees. The MOHPC will carry out the scudies
concerning MCH criteria for worker awards and ways to ensure client
follow-up. Because of its policy responsibilities, (see para. 2.20), the
Population Planning Section of tile Planning Commission will carry out the
referral fee study.
2.16       Assurances were received at negotiations that not later than
December 31, 1986, the Government will (i) carry out a study, under terms
of reference satisfactory to IDA, of the present system of client
compensation, worker referral and service provider fees, and community and
other incentives, including the current and future need for such payments
and options for their modification or phase-out; (ii) provide the findings
of the study for IDA comment, and (iii) take all measures agreed with IDA
to improve, modify or phase out the above system (para. 7.01a).
2.17      In 1980, even before it got underway, the Second Plan was cut due
to lack of funds. All MCH/FP initiatives to be funded by the Government
were affected.  Despite these reversals, progress has occurred on a number
of fronts. These include strengthening of supervision of field staff,
improvement in quality of sterilization services (para 2.32), reduction in
delays in building, staffing and equipping UlHFWCs and gradually increasing
utilization of these completed facilities. The efforts to integrate family
planning and MCH services (paras 2.23,2.24) have been only partially
successful and concentration on family planning has resulted in the
continuing relative neglect of MCR care.



C. Program Organization, Management and Financing
Policy Formulation and Coordination
2.18      National policy for population control is formulated by the
National Council for Population Control (NCPC), chaired by the President
and cons.sting of all 12 cabinet ministers. Formerly the National
Population Council (para 2.02), the NCPC provides policy guidelines and
directives, and approves programs, strategies and other measures. The NCPC
is assisted by an Executive Committee headed by the Minister for Health and
Population Control (MOHPC). Other members are the Secretary to the
Ministry of Finance and the Member of the Planning Committee in charge of
social and economic infrastructure. The Secretary, MOHPC, acts as
member-secretary to the Executive Committee.
2.19      In addition to the MOHPC, seven other ministries serve as
channels to disseminate family planning information and, in some cases, to
provide contraceptive services. For example, programs to motivate family
planning acceptance operate through the ministries of labor, agriculture
and education. Moreover, population education is a part of the formal
school curriculum. Each ministry has separate staff at headquarters
responsible for planning, budgeting and monitoring population-related
activities. Each also has strengthened its field staff to carry out such
activities. Coordination of the multisectoral aspects of the program is
achieved through a national cocrdination committee as well as through
regular meetings of population program officers chaired by the Population
Control Wing (PCW) of MOHPC.
2.20      The Population Planning Section of the Planning Commission
assists in the development of policy options for NCPC consideration and the
formulation of Five Year Plan proposals for the population program. It is
also responsible for evaluation of key program activities through its
External Evaluation Unit (EEU). A Population and Development Planning Unit
under the Population Planning Section works on progressive incorporation of
population factors in the formulation of national policies.
Ministry of Health and Population Control (MOHPC)
2.21      Structure.  The MOHPC is responsible for development,
coordination and implementation of the national population control and MCH
program.  It consists of two wings-Health, and Population Control-headed
by the Secretary to the Ministry. The Secretary, MOHPC is assisted by an
Additional Secretary for Population Control in the Population Control
Wing. The PCS is responsible for MCH and population programs; the Health
Wing is responsible for all other health services. Each wing has its own
Director-General (DG); a secretariat responsible for planning, budgeting
and monitoring; and functional directorates responsible for operational
aspects of the program. Offices at district and upazila levels support the
directorates. (Bangladesh is divided into 64 districts, 464 upazilas
within the districts and 4,365 rural unions within the upazilas. Each
union contains three wards, with an average population of 6-7,000). Each
of the 64 district offices is headed by a Civil Surgeon on the health side
and a Deputy Director/Family Planning (DD/FP) on the population side. The
DD/FP is assisted by a Medical Officer, Mobile Sterilization Team (MO/MST),
whose primary job is to provide sterilization at the union level. Health



- 10 -
and family planning services are functionally integrated in upazilas under
the Health and Family Planning Officer (UHFPO) who belongs administratively
to the Health Wing. He is assisted in the performance of FP and MCH
functions by an upazila Family Planning Officer (FPO) and a Medical Officer
(MO/MCHI/FP) who provides technical supervision and heads MCH/FP efforts.
In addition, the upazila staffing pattern includes 7 MOs, providing
primarily curative health care; a Health Inspector (HI) who supervises
field operations of health workers, and an Expanded Program of Immunization
(EPI) technician. The organizational chart of the MOHPC at the national,
district and upazila level is shown in Annexes 1 and 2.
2.22      At the lowest administrative level are the 4,365 unions.  Field
staff include an Assistant Health Inspector (AHI), and a Family Planning
Assistant (FPA), both males, who are supervised by the HI and the FPO from
Lh1e unazila level. They supervise the teams described below, who work at
the ward level. A Medical Assistant (MA), a Family Welfare Visitor (FWV)
and occasionally a pharmacist, staff Health and Family Welrare Centers
(UWHFWCs) at the union level. UHFWCs provides the lowest tier of health
referral; sterilizations and most IUD insertions also take place there.
The MAs and FWVs provide technical assistance to the ward teams. At the
ward level a team of two workers delivers home outreach services: a male
Health Assistant (HA) from the Health Wing and a female Family Welfare
Assistant (FWA) paid from the PCW budget. The HA is responsible for
cholera and malaria control, environmental sanitation and general health
matters; he also provides condoms.  The FWA is principally an FP worker;
she delivers mainly pills and condoms while motivating for other forms of
contraception as well, but also provides nutrition education. The FWA is
assisted by a female ihelper (dai) who receives fees for referring
sterilization and IUD cases. To complement domiciliary services delivered
by field workers, the kWA and HA conduct satellite clinics in selected
villages on fixed days of the week. The Government has also decided that
the residences of both the HA and FWA will be delivery points for
distribution of contraceptives like pills and condoms. Each team is
theoretically responsible for a ward population of 6000, although
population growth has increased the population:worker ratio. Around 90% of
Bangladesh's 13,500 wards currently have FWA-HA teams.
2.23      Functional Integration.  The present structure, with health and
FP services separated from central to district levels and integrated2 at the
upazila, union and ward levels, results from the fifth reorganizati.n to
have taken place over the course of the First and Second Five Year Plans.
The original concept was total integration, but during implementation of
the First Plan, separate administrative divisions for Population Control
and Family Planning were created, with coordinating links to general health
services at various levels. The Second Plan modified this strategy and
sought to integrate the health and family planning organization fully at
the upazila level and below, combined with unity of top-level command
through a single Secretary for Health and Population Control. This change
met much opposition; actual and threatened work stoppages became frequent.
In 1981, the system was again changed, with a Secretary in charge of health
and an Additional Secretary in charge of population and family planning.
In April 1983, the present structure was initiated; health and family
planning services were functionally integrated at upazila level and below.
The two administrative divisions were redesignated as wings, one for Health
and. the other for Population Control, under a single secretary.



- 11 -
2.24      The principle governing functional integration is to identify
priority FP/MCH services to be delivered at the community level, distribute
these between HAs and FWAs and facilitate implementation both through the
supervisory systems and institutional and outreach services from the union
and upazila level. To reduce friction between line and technical
supervisors and facilitate coordinated functioning and team work, the
Government has set up regular fortnightly meetings of all union level staff
at UHFWCs under the leadership of the MA. These meetings are to be
utilized for program review, problem solving, planning for the next
fortnight and for continuing training. The frequent changes, however, have
left a legacy of program disruption and staff demoralization. Although the
present structure leaves much to be desired, further changes would result
in similar interruptions. Therefore, the most appropriate strategy at
present is to strengthen and improve current arrangements and, within those
arrangements, to provide increased emphasis on tCH activities and better
quality of family planning delivery.
2.25      However, even these Government efforts to develop a more
effective set of administrative relationships cannot prevent temporary
swings in family planning performance. After two years of record
contraceptive increases, couple-years of protection (CYP) January-August,
1985, declined by around 20% from CYP levels for the same period in 1984.
The decrease, stemmed mainly from Family Planning Officer (FPO) resistance
to Government orders placing FPOs under the administrative control of the
UHC medical head. Recent Government moves to accommodate FPO concerns are
expected to speed the recovery of the program, which registered a modest
September, 1985, upswing.
2.26      Service Delivery Structure.  Union Health and Family Welfare
Centers (para. 2.22) serve both as the first referral point for the FWA/HA
teams and as the institutional cornerstone of the Government's FP/MCH
outreach program. The First and Second Five Year Plans set in motion
effcrts to achieve eventual national coverage by UHFWCs. Some 1,020 UHFWCs
were operational, as of May 1, 1985 or about one-fourth of those needed.
Each serves an average population of around 22,000 (15,000 - 25,000).
UH,'WCs are the first point of referral for such MCH interventions as
screening of high-rate pregnancies, ante-natal care, post-natal care and
treatment of common maternal and child disorders.
2.27      The FWV is responsible for administering MCH and clinical
contraception while the MA is responsible for curative medical care.
Operational research by the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease
Research, Bangladesh (ICDDRB) indicates that the existence of UHFWCs with
curative care, contraceptive back-up services provided by trained resident
paramedics, a carefully organized system of referral, and basic
pharmaceuticals, confer credibility on field workers and contribute to the
success of family planning delivery in Bangladesh.
2.28      Low utilization has posed a problem for many UHFWCs.  While the
situation is gradually improving, and a number of UHFWCs now record more
than 1,000 client visits per month, few have achieved the average
case-loads of 1,500 recorded monthly by several pilot projects. The main
reasons for low utilization have bectn lack of drugs, initially slow
progress in getting residential staff into position, and poor staff



- 12 -
supervision. Public association of the UHFWC as primarily a family
planning service facility, rather than one where MCI care also is
available, also may have hindered community acceptance. Posting of
residential MAs and FWVs has begun to improve Ui{FWC utilization.
2.29      UHFWC staffing is no longer a serious problem.  The Government
has committed itself to deploy one FWV and one MA per union. FWVs are
assigned to all UHFWCs; more than 600 others work out of a union council
headquarters or the nearest UHC in the absence of a UHFWC. Around 300 more
FWVs are graduating yearly from the 12 training institutions financed under
the First project. Around 1,50( tAs already have entered government
service and one will be availpie for each union by 1990. Only pharmacists
will remain in short supply. Since their UHFWC role is not essential, the
Government has given priority to assigning trained pharmacists to unions
with the heaviest caseloads.
2.30      Around 1,300 Rural Dispensaries (RDs) under the Health Wing are a
second type of health facility at the union level. They have been staffed
in various ways, but mainly by MAs. In 1983, the Government decided to
unify the function and staffing patterns of UHFWCs and rural dispensaries
and, in those unions without UHFWCs, over time to upgrade dispensaries to
be UHFWCs. However, contrary to that decision, the Health Wing in 1984
assigned around 600 doctors to RDs. The MOHPC Secretary recently decided
that all such physicians would be reassigned whenever RDs were redesignated
as a UHFWC.
2.31      Upazila Health Complexes are 31-bed facilities built to cover a
population of around 200,000. They are the second tier of referral under
the overall Health/FP/MCH delivery system developed in the First and Second
Five Year Plans. Currently, a UHC exists in 337 upazilas, or over
three-quarters of those needed. The staffing goal of nine MOs per UHC is
over 80% achieved and around 2,500 MOs are posted to UHCs. Two FWVs also
are posted to UHCs for MCH and family planning work.
2.32      District and subdivisional facilities represent the two final
steps in the referral system. In addition to subdivisional and district
hospitals, there are about 93 maternity and child welfare centers (MCWCs)
at district and subdistrict levels. Most of the MCWCs have ten beds, a
staff of two FWVs and supporting staff. MCWCs at the district
administrative headquarters also have an MO. The MCWCs provide maternal
and child care, sterilizations, IUD insertions and injectables.
2.33      Clinical Contraceptive Surveillance Teams were created in 1982
(as Sterilization Surveillance Teams) to assist the Government in
monitoring and improving the quality of its national sterilization effort
and thus increase its appeal to potential contracepting couples. Through
regular visits to health facilities where sterilization takes place, the
four teams provide both medical surveillance and in-service training to the
MOs at UHCs and the MO/fISTs who carry o.t these procedures at UHFWCs, as
well as to other personnel who assist. The quality of sterilization has
improved considerably in Bangladesh over the past three years. According
to an international team which reviewed the program in November, 1984,
mortality from tubectomy is less than 4 per 100,000 cases (against a rate
of 9.1 in 1981) and the vasectomy mortality rate is only 1.79 per 100,000
cases. A sample survey of acceptors is underway through the program to



- 13 -
measure client perceptions of the sterilization process, including
motivation, counseling, pre- and post-operative care, follow-up and
satisfaction. Each team now consists of one expatriate and one Bangladeshi
physician and support staff, financed by the Swedish International
Development Authority (SIDA) with WHO as the executing agency. The
expatriate coordinator of the group heads the Dhaka team; the other three
teams are headquartered in Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi divisio.3. They
all report directly to the DG (PCW).
2.34      Logistics.  A directorate under the DG (PCW), is responsible for
procurement and delivery of most drugs, kits, medical and surgical
requisites, and supplies needed for the population and MCH program. Some
commodities such as donated contraceptives are procured directly by donors
and distributed either through PCW or directly to intermediary
institutions. Distribution takes place mainly through a central warehouse
in Dhaka and two regional warehouses in Chittagong and Khulna. The
regional warehouses stock contraceptives and drug and dietary supplement
(DDS) kits, which they supply to district stores for transmittal to
upazilas. Large national NGOs collect contraceptives from the Dhaka
warehouse for distribution to their branches. Smaller NGOs and the women's
programs collect their supplies of pills and condoms from district stores.
Other kits and supplies go direct from Dhaka to upazilas and then to union
facilities as needed.
Training
2.35      Training to meet estimated requirements already worked out for
the national populstion control program under the Third Plan (see Annex 3)
is mainly organized and managed by the National Institute of Population
Research and Training (NIPORT), although there are programs under other
auspices for MAs, doctors and Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs). NIPORT
is headed by a Director-General who reports directly to the Addi-':onal
Secretary, PCW.
2.36      NIPORT was established in 1977 by the MOHPC to: (i) work with the
ministry to determine training needs; (ii) to carry out management, worker
and trainer training; and (iii) to plan, supervise, contract out and
evaluate training activities undertaken by a network of subsidiary and
independent training institutions located throughout Bangladesh.
2.37      NIPORT administratively controls 12 Family Welfare Visitor
Training Institutes (FWVTIs) and 20 Family Welfare Assistant Training
Institutes (FWATIs). The latter, now knowzL as Regional Training Centers
(RTCs), are responsible for the training of all field workers of both the
health and population control wings and their supervisors. NIPORT also
provides technical supervision and support to the training of medical
pert.onnel in sterilization techniques by the Bangladesh Association of
Voluntary Sterilization (BAVS).
2.38      Training for HAs is provided separately at Medical Assistant
Training School (MATS). Doctors receive in-service training through the
National Institute of Preventive and Social Medicine (NIPSOM) and doctors
and medical students receive practical training in clinical contraceecion
at eight Model Family Planning Clinics attached to medical colleges, with
technical supervision and support from NIPORT. Training of TBAs in



- 14 -
improved delivery practices began in 1978 and was extended with UNICEF
assistance through 1985. Over 19,000 TBAs have been trained and provided
with delivery kits.  A second phase of the program is now underway to train
5,000 more TBAs, bringing the total to 24,000 by the end of 1985.
Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)
2.39      NGOs account for around 37% of contraception from modern methods
in Bangladesh. The bulk of that contribution is by two agencies: The
Social Marketing Project (SMP) and BAVS, both assisted by USAID. SMP
provides around 45% of the NGO contraception. It supplies around
two-thirds of all condoms and 18% of all oral contraceptives in Bangladesh
through a network of 89,000 outlets for commercial distribution.  BAYS
performs around 30% of all monthly sterilizations, thereby accounting for
around 38% of the NGO contribution.
2.40      Many smaller NGOs have been directly  involved in population
control a.tivities for at least a decade, with an officially recognized
role since 1976.  Around 170 currently are registered to carry out
population work; more than 100 are actively involved in the population
control program, many with foreign funding, through around Z25 projects.
NGUs work mostly in urban areas, although the important Swanirvar family
planning project, which focuses on community development through
self-reliance, works primarily in rural areas.  The Mohammedpur Family
Planning Clinic in Dhaka, a local NGO, is also part of the service delivery
structure and functions in addition as a training center for medical and
paramedical personnel for clinical contraceptive services. The Government
has set up a Subvention Committee, headed by the Secretary, MOHPC, with NGO
representation, to consider NGO project proposals and review performance.
Financing
2.41      Government expenditures on population and health (capital plus
recurrent) in Bangladesh have risen from 5.3% to 5.9% of total budgetary
expenditures over the past five years. This compares with 3.9% in Pakistan
in 1980 and 4.5% in Nepal in 1982. Yearly public expenditures on
population programs in Bangladesh are estimated at around US$0.51 per
capita or US$26 per current contraceptive user, compared with US$0.30 and
US$33 for Pakistan; US$0.34 and US$10 for India and US$0.42 and US$7 for
Sri Lanka. The total budget of the MOHPC grew from Tk.476 million
(US$18.3m) in 1974/75 to Tt.1,919 million (US$73.8m) in 1979/80 and
Tk.3,090 (US$118.8m) in 1983/84. The average increase in real terms over
the five years to 1983/84 was about 4 75¶.  During this period, spending on
population as defined in GOB's budgetaLy categories grew faster than
spending on health, making up 36% of the budget in 1983/84 as against 33%
in i978/79. By the end of the plan period, population outlays from the
revenue budget had doubled to 12%. Since the Bangladesh revenue budget is
funded exclusively from domestic resources, while the developuent budget is
largely donor-financed, this shift indicates Government's increasing
commitment to shoulder a larger share of the population cost burden.
Foreign aid for population and MCH from the major donors over the Second
Plan period totalled about US$285m (US$135m was from USAID), US$100m came
from the cofinanciers of the Second Project, US$10m each from the Federal
Republic of Germany and UNICEF and US$30m from UNFFA. Foreign aid averaged
about 43X of the MOHPC total budget, capital plus recurrent, during this
period.

D. Experience with Past Lending
Financing and Design
2.42       IDA and cofinanciers have assisted the Government's 1.)pulation
efforts for ten years through the First Population and Second Population
and Family Health projects. The First Project became effective on
September 25, 1975, and closed, after three one-year extensions, in
December, 1982. Total costs were US$45.7 million with an IDA credit of
US$15 million. The First Project was cofinanced by Australia, Canada, the
Federal Kepublic of Germaniy, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom which
provided combinied total financing of US$25.4 million. A completion report
issued in September, 1984, concluded that the project assisted in
broadening and expanding the population program at a time when service
availability was limited, field structure was non-existent, field staff was
demotivated and organizational capability for program implementation was
weak. The report indicated considerable progress in im.wrnving ! rvice
quality, worker productivity and program management, while recosnizing that
fully satisfactory solutions to those problems still lie ahead.
2.43      The Second Project (No. 921-BD) became effective on April 1,
1980, and has been extended to December 31, 1985. Total project costs were
estimated at US$110 million of which 85% was disbursed by September 30,
1985, including around US$23 million in IDA funds. External funding also
came from six cofinanciers, of whom five (Australia, Canada, Federal
Republic of Germany, Norway and Sweden) were cofinanciers of the first
project. The new additionI was the Government of the Netherlands. The
individual contributions of various donors (calculated in US$ millions),
were Australia (US$4.04), Canada (US$5.07), Federal Republic of Germany
(US$18.2), Netherlands (US$7.9), Norway (US$20.0), and Sweden (US$11.8).
The GOB provided US$11.0 million.
2.44      Objective.  The Second Project's main objective was to continue
and expand activities begun under the first project. It sought to reduce
fertility and mortality primarily by (i) expanding and strengthening the
family planning services and health care delivery system; (ii) increasing
availability and improving the quality of both health and family planning
manpower; (iii) extending the information, education and motivation (IEM)
activities of the First project; (iv) strengthening evaluation and research
capabilities; and (v) improving program and project implementation. It was
also designed to respond to the Government's objectives under the First and
Second Plans (para. 2.02, 2.03), with particular emphasis on assisting the
Government to improve its ability to provide both FP and health services in
an integrated fashion through the rural team approach. It also supported
the Government's goals of increasing demand for family planning through
IEM.
2.45      Design and Content.  The project had six major components: (i)
Health and MCH/FP Service Delivery; (ii) Training; (iii) IEM; (iv) Research
and Evaluation; (v) Private Sector and Innovative Activities; and (vi)
Project Implementation. The health and family planning services component
provided for (a) salary support to 6,500 Family Welfare Assistants in
1980/81, declining to 4,500 in 1982/83, plus purchase of 253 ambulances,
four vehicle maintenance vans, 19 vehicles for supervision, and 4,000
bicycles for field workers; (b) construction of furniture and equipment for



- 16 -
19 UHCs; (c) construction of furniture and equipment for 700 UFHWCs
expanded in agreement with IDA to 950; and (d) incremental drug and dietary
supplement (DDS) kits. The training component included: (a) construction
furniture and equipment for four Medical Assistants Training Schools
(MATS); (b) additional classrooms/staff quarters for the FWATI at Barisal;
(c) co-struction, furniture and equipment for 19 FWATIs and their operating
expenses; (d) operating expenses for four Model Family Planning Clinics;
and (e) training for population program managers/supervisors including a
building, vehicles and operating expenses.
2.46      Support under IEM consisted of vehicles, equipment, technical
assistance and incremental operating expenses for: (a) mass media activity
of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting; (b) training of community
leaders by the IEM unit; (c) formation of Mothers Clubs and establishment
of women's cooperatives in 21 additional upazilas; (d) establishment of
women's vocational training centers in 12 additional upazilas; (e)
establishment of a marketing/design unit to promote and handle sales of
handicrafts and other products produced by women's activities; and (f)
strengthening of the Health Education Bureau (HEB). The Research and
Evaluation Component provided for equipment, technical assistance and
incremental operating expenses for; (i) strengthening the Population/MCH
Service Statistics Cell in MOHPC; (ii) strengthening the EEU of the
Planning Commission; (iii) strengthening the Health Information Unit of
MOHPC; and (iv) establishment of a committee to coordinate the research
and evaluation system in its entirety. Support to NGOs and innovative
activit.es was for specific activities to be identified and agreed upon by
the Government and IDA. The project implementation component provided
equipment, vehicles and incremental operating expenses for: (a) the
Building, Planning and Design Unit (BPDU) and UHFWC Engineering Cell, and
Project Finance Cell of MOHPC: (b) the Supplies Directorate; (c) the
Population Cell of Public Works Department; and (d) some of the costs of
the population specialist and assistant in the Resident Bank Mission Dhaka.
2.47      Implementation Mechanism.  Primary responsibility for
implementing the Second Project rests with the Population Control Wing of
the MOHPC. While utilizing and strengthening management units set up under
the first project for civil works, project finances, communications and
women's programs, the Second Project also established a Construction and
Management Cell (CMC) in place of the UHFWC Engineering Cell to implement
the UHFWC program and a population cell in the Public Works Department to
coordinate and monitor the implementation of major civil works. A unit in
the Directorate of Supplies and Inspection to coordinate and monitor
procurement also was set up but abolished when the Government's Second Five
Year Plan was cut back. Coordination of major civil works improved
considerably but coordination between the MOHPC Health and Population
Wings, even after the reorganization of 1983, still needs to be
strengthened from the upazila down (paras. 2.23-2.26, 2.50-2.53). MOHPC
coordination with the population control efforts of other participating
ministries also was slow to develop but now has reached acceptable levels.
Project Performance
2.48      Impact.  Isolating the impact of the project within that of the
Government's family planning program is difficult. Moreover, the scarcity
of reliable demographic data impedes efforts to determine changes in



- 17 -
fertility and mortality rates. Nonetheless, the CPR appears virtually to
have doubled since 1979 to over 24%, and around 95% of eligible couples now
know at least two modern contraceptive methods. Couple-years of
contraceptive protection have increased steadily, the average increase
1980-84 is almost double that of 1976-80. Around 40% of women in the
mothers' cluba and women's cooperatives subcomponents have accepted family
planning, while 36% of eligible couples in the Swanirvar program villages
regularly practice contraception. These proportions are well above
national averages.
2.49      Mortality outcomes are even more difficult to substantiate.  The
limited MCH coverage to date, however, would argue strongly against
attributing any mortality change since 1979 to the project, although
reduced fertility and longer birth intervals are likely in themselves to
improve survival of mothers and children.
2.50      Civil Works.  The construction of 39 major civil works (19 UHCs,
19 FWATIs, extension of facilities at an FWVTI) is about 85% complete. All
but three of the facilities are expected to be completed by December 31,
1985. Delays arose because work orders for most sites were issued only in
1982 and 1983, two years behind the appraisal schedule due primarily to
late government approval of the subcomponent and a policy dialogue within
the government as to whether construction at and below the upazila should
be permanent or semi-permanent. Around 550 of the 700 UHFWCs initially
provided under the project were completed by September 30, 1985. Work on
the remaining sites is expected to be completed by the closing date. Work
on 250 additional UHFWCs begun last year is expected to be completed by the
end of 1985. Delays in site acquisition, initial inability of the CMC to
provide funding control for numerous scattered rural sites, and earlier
negligence by contractors have all delayed work. All of the four Medical
Assistant Training Schools have been completed and are operating. The 48
union level Women's Vocational Training Centers were deleted as the result
of budget cuts but the 12 upazila level centers are almost completed.
Procurement of equipment, vehicles, technical assistance and appointment of
additional staff for all project subcomponents have also been nearly
completed, though at reduced levels, due to cuts in the Second Five Year
Plan.
2.51      Service Delivery Organization.  The project enhanced the
Goverament's ability to provide integrated health services throughout the
country particularly by establishing MCH services at all functioning UHCs
and increasing the capability of a number of UHFWCs and rural dispensaries
to deliver MCE/FP services through deployment of FWVs (paras 2.27-2.31).
Two major problems, however, continue to impede the smooth functioning of
the service delivery system: (i) continuing friction between the FP and
health sides of the MOHPC, and (ii) lack of competence among supervisory
staff, exacerbated by a government reorganization which cut some key
supervisory posts (para 2.53).
2.52      Differences persist, both within the Government and among donor
agencies, as to whether the family planning program should be organized
vertically or fully integrated with health services. During negotiations
on the Second Project the Bank and the GOB had agreed that family planning
services should be integrated in a phased manner over a number of years.
Under this arrangement, FP/HCH services at all levels above the upazila



- 18 -
were to be transferred to the health division in the first phase, and the
integration of FP services at the upazila level and below would commence
from July, 1983, in accordance with a timetable linked to the progressive
establishment of UHCs and UHFWCs. The Planning Commission, however,
reopened the integration question during formulation of the Second Plan.
The 1980 decision to vest all authority in a single secretary, and the
subsequent division of responsibility between a Secretary and an Additional
Secretary, is described in para 2.23. The arrangement has not worked out
as well as might have been hoped. The current need is to provide and
strengthen opportunities for personnel of the two wings to work together
and develop, over a period of time, relationships promoting teamwork rather
than to reopen the integration issue or attempt further organizational
changes. Better training, job descriptions, supportive supervision and
management at and below the upazila are key to making the system work
better.
2.53      The problem of limited supervisory skills among upper level staff
is pervasive. Training in supervision is generally weak or absent.
Supervision is both irregular - constrained by lack of mobility and
inadequate funds - and concentrates too heavily on achievement of FP
targets. Supervisors tend to check targets rather than provide either
support or guidance. The Government has partially responded to those
issues by revising the job descriptions of supervisory staff and by working
out detailed guidelines for supervision at various levels, now being
pretested for feasibility. While orders have been issued to hold
fortnightly meetings of all union level staff and monthly meetings of all
upazila staff, specific guidelines on how to organize and conduct the
meetings and use them for continuing training are being worked out.
2.54      The 1982 Government decision to increase the number of districts
from 21 to 64 and to decentralize administration to the upazila level was
accompanied by cuts in staff positions which put additional burdens on top
level supervisory staff. In the wake of the reorganization, the Martial
Law Committee recommended abolition of che four MOHPC posts of divisional
Directors who had provided supervision at the national level, and of the
two posts of Assistant Directors in each of the districts. The abolition
of the divisional Director posts, particularly in conjunction with an
increase on the number of districts, made it virtually impossible for the
Director-General (PCW) effectively to supervise field operations.
Abolition of the district posts of Assistant Director (MCH/FP) also
weakened technical supervision, as most district Deputy Directors of family
planning are non-medical personnel. With the current and proposed increase
in the role of clinical contraception and the decision to strengthen MCH
care and improve its balance with family planning services, the need for
strengthened technical supervision from the district and central levels is
evident.
2.55      Logistics.  The Second Project, together with UNICEF, provided
DDS kits for MCH use at UHCs, MCWCs, and UHFWCs, distributed through the
PCW logistics directorate (para 2.33). The early years of project
implementation were marked by weak arrangements for inventory control at
central and operational levels, delays in reordering, inadequate storage
arrangements at district and UHC levels and shortages of transport from the
district to the periphery. However, the situation has improved over the
past three years. With assistance from a UNFPA-funded logistics advisor,



- 19 -
the directorate has set up inventory and stock control mechanisms and
buffer stock arrangements. More storage space is being made available at
UHCs. After long delays, vehicles financed under the Second Project have
become available to transport supplies from the district headquarters to
the periphery.
2.56      Manpower Development.  A major contribution of the project has
been to increase significantly the availability of both FWVs and MAs (about
2,300 and 2,500 respectively over a five year period). The FWATIs
constructed under the project have helped in imparting refresher training
to all the 13,500 FWAs in three courses of 12, 7 and 2 days' duration;
about an equal number of HAs participated in team training with FWAs for
the second and third courses. Students at all eight medical colleges now
receive orientation in family planning while interns receive pract!cal
training in sterilization techniques and IUD insertion.
2.57      A continuing and growing problem has been the low density of
female field workers. FWAs have been responsible for delivering family
planning services to an entire ward since 1976, when the average ward
population was 6,000. A 1:6,000 ratio was the goal of the Second Plan.
Over the last eight years, the average ward population has increased but no
additional FWA posts have been approved. The current ratio is 1:7,400 and
FWA visits to each household are at least three months apart. Pilot
projects in Bangladesh and NGO experiences have shown that the frequency of
visits to each household should be monthly for maximum family planning
impact, and that an FWA cannot effectively cater to more than 400-600
households. A recent government decision to replace retiring male EAs with
FWAs would alleviate the problem to some degree, since the job of HAs does
not include home visits, but that changeover would be too gradual to have
significant short-term impact.
2.58      Training.  Both the First and Second P-ojects have helped to set
up training facilities and to increase considerably the availability of
trained manpower, but the quality of most training is still uneven.
Inadequate practical experience in deliveries has hampered FWV training and
sujvrvision of TBAs.  Poor training in management has hampered effective
UHFWC operation and MA-FWV technical supervision of ward-level staff.
Because of organizational and staff problems, NIPORT has not sufficiently
exercised its role in identification of training needs, curriculum
development, trainer training, preparation of training materials,
evaluation of training and conduct of management training courses. Aware
of the problem, last year the Government appointed a committee chaired by
the Secretary, MOHPC, to examine the entire area of manpower development
for both wings of the Ministry including training. The committee's
recommendations include specific suggestions for improving the quality of
training of all workers in population control and health through attention
to such needs as linking curriculum to job functions; improving training
methodology, practical and field training, training of trainers, and
training evaluation, and the institutional development of NIPORT. The
committee has streamlined training courses, changed the duration of
different kinds of training and developed a general training plan for the
next five years.
2.59      Communications.  Activities implemented under the first two
projects have substantially helped to improve popular knowledge about



- 20 -
family planning and contraception.  Through assistance to the Ministry of
Information and Broadcasting (MIB), the Second Project has strengthened the
capacity of Bangladesh Radio, the Department of Films, the Department of
Mass Communication, Bangladesh TV and the Feature Writing Bureau to produce
and disseminate population-related messages. Under the project, 70 minutes
of daily radio programs are being broadcast from Dhaka and 30-minute
programs are being aired five days a week by the regional broadcasting
station. Two fortnightly 25-minute programs are shown on television. A
total of 18 population films have been produced during the first four years
and six more are expected to be completed before the closing date. Five
programs undertaken by the IEM unit of the MORPC (orientation workshops for
religious leaders, use of folk song, publicity through billboards and
cinema slides, motivational meetings and film shows) together are estimated
to have reached about five million eligible couples during the project
period. Support to the Health Education Bureau (HEB) of the MOHPC has
contributed to the training of Health Education Officers at the district
and sub-divisional levels and also of medical officers at the upazila
level.
2.60      A substantial gap still exists, however, between knowledge and
contraceptive use. A change in the communications strategy is essential to
make messages more method-specific and to tailor them to specific target
groups. Prevailing misconceptions about various contraceptive methods need
to be corrected and more support from religious and other community leaders
needs to be generated. Lack of coordination among the major participating
agencies on message creation and dissemination, as well as lack of
reinforcement of mass media with face-to-face communication, need to be
corrected. There also has been no effort so far to include promotion of
MCH in the communications strategy.
2.61      Women's Programs.  To support the Government's long term strategy
to improve the status of women, the Second Project provided support to
three women's programs created under the First Project. These groups
involve around 110,000 women in income-generating activities and have
recruited a cumulative total of around 230,000 FP acceptors. All three
programs provide women the opportunity to earn money through sales of items
they have produced. Each has an FP component, either promotion among their
own members, or external recruitment. Contraceptive acceptance by members
is around twice the national average. Common long-term objectives of the
programs are to improve women's incomes, status and leadership skills while
motivating them to want smaller families and to adopt FP. A total of 1,600
Mothers Centers (MCs) now operate in 40 upazilas with a membership of
around 40,000.  They have a strong institutional base and have operated
reasonably well, recruiting a total of around 98,000 FP acceptors. Around
1,500 women's cooperatives are functioning in 100 upazilas with a
membership of around 60,000, over one-third contracepting. In addition to
their other activities, cooperatives have reestablished a number of
literacy, numeracy and health programs. Over 11,000 women have received
vocational training through the Women's Welfare Foundation, and around
112,000 FP acceptors have been recruited by trainees, who produce items for
sale in the 1OU production centers which currently exist in the 20 upazilas
where the program now operates.  The MCs and the women's vocational
programs are under the Ministry of Social Welfare and Women's Affairs; the
Women's Cooperatives are run by The Bangladesh Rural Development Board
(BRDB) of the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development. Although



- 21 -
the cooperatives have enjoyed the greatest degree of economic success, each
of the three programs has made at least modest income impact. Annual
incomes among the 30% of MC members who managed to obtain credit on an
individual basis are approximately US$40, according to a recent evaluation
study. Members of the Women's Cooperatives have an estimated per capita
annual income of US$46. Around 50% have access to credit. Moreover, loan
repayment rates among those women are close to 100% against much lower
rates (76%) for men's cooperatives. Estimated monthly incomes for women
trained by the Welfare Foundation range between US$3-4.
2.62      Evaluation of the women's projects has consistently shown that:
a) rural women are anxious to participate; b) that contraceptive use among
participating women is high compared with the national average; c)
participating women have earned increased, if modest, income; and d)
participating members are beginning to enjoy improved status within the
family. Nevertheless, several problems remain to be resolved. Inadequate
marketing arrangements for and quality control over produced goods persist
mainly because the setting up of a Marketing and Design Cell originally
approved by the Planning Commission was blocked by cutbacks in the Second
Plan (para 2.17), which also reduced the number of managerial staff for the
programs to inappropriate levels. Absence of credit in two of the three
programs limited beneficiaries to only those enterprises which could be
financed by personal savings or income. Poor training of trade instructors
and beneficiaries also hampered program effectiveness. Moreover, MOHPC has
not directed FP/MCH services directly at these relatively well-organized
groups.
2.63      NGOs and Innovative Activities.  The Second Project provided a
modest US$350,000 for support for NGO activities mostly in urban areas.
The Subvention Committee (para 2.39) approved and funded projects involving
clinical programs, workshops, publications and operational research, by 45
organizations. A major recipient was the Swanirvar program in family
planning which now covers 1440 unions in 130 upazilas. Constraints to more
effective involvement of NGOs included GOB reluctance to support rural work
by voluntary agencies, lack of mechanism to screen, strengthen and
prioritize proposals for Subvention Committee review, and weak arrangements
for monitoring NGO performance. Absence of a defined role to which NGOs
could respond also inhibited their participation in the program.
2.64      Research and Evaluation.  The Second Project focused primarily on
strengthening the Population Service Statiscics Cell of the Management
Information System (MIS) of MOUPC, strengthening and expanding the
capability of the EEU (para 2.20), strengthening the Health Information
Unit (HIU) of the Health Division of the MOHPC, and creating a coordination
committee to consolidate all research and evaluation efforts.
2.65      MIS prepares and distributes four monthly reports.  One is on
contraceptive acceptance by upazila and district, and public and
non-government provider, matching performance against MOHPC targets.
Second, MIS analyzes, annotates and distributes monthly inspection reports
of field visits by senior officers. It also prepares monthly summaries of
all PCW activities, expenditures and progress against projects managed by
PCW. Fourth, it prepares for the President's Secretariat a report on
sterilizations, UHFWC construction and service delivery activities,
including fund allocations, availability, staffing situation, progress and
achievements.



- 22 -
2.66      Over the past five years, MIS has begun to develop a service
statistics system in 40 unions of 37 randomly-selected upazilas, to provide
monthly information such as numbers of couples visited per worker, sources
and quality of contraceptive supply, number of continuous and current
users, births, deaths and marriages. HIowever, MCH reporting remains weak,
partly because of the minimal scale of those interventions to date and
partly through lack of decisions on what data to collect, their periodicity
and their potential clientele.
2.67      However, review of the MIS highlights several areas requiring
improvement for the system to serve as a management tool to promote better
field performance. First, the absence of local information on the age and
parity of eligible women makes it difficult to estimate potential demand
for family planning services at the upazila level and below and to monitor
performance against realistic expectations.   Another consequence of that
data gap is the persistence of unrealistic upazila targets for
contraception set by splitting up national Planning Commission targets and
adjusting them on the basis of past contraceptive performance. Second,
mechanisms to link data from performance reports to supervisory and work
routines have not yet developed. Third, links between performance
reporting and the availability of such essential inputs as personnel,
contraceptives and MCH supplies remain to be worked out. Finally, current
reporting mechanisms do not cover MCH activity and give greater attention
to data on new acceptors of clinical methods than to data on continuation
rates and changes in the contraceptive method mix.
2.68      The EEU carries out evaluations of the national population/TiCH
program.  Set up nine years ago under the First Project. by July, 1985, the
EEU will have completed more than 20 studies of such program aspects as
field worker training and performance; performance of upazila and district
FP officers; women's programs accomplishments; functioning of UHFWCs; and
effectiveness and efficiency of the contraceptive storage, distribution and
supply system.
2.69      The EEU's impact on program performance, however, has only
recently become noticeable. Earlier studies were of uneven quality because
of recruitment of inexperienced ctaff and absence of systematic advanced
training opportunities. The staffing situation has now improved and
stabilized. Another problem has been lack of effective response by program
managers to EEU findings. In some cases, deficiencies in EEU
communications were responsible; in others, managers focused on technical
points in the reports and tended to ignore major findings. Recently,
however, committees and workshops involving project managers have been
formed to discuss the content, processing and findings of EEU studies.
2.70      Expenditure and Disbursements.  Because of initial delays
relating to cutbacks of the Second Five Year Plan, late Government approval
of project proformas and late selection of civil works sites, the project
has been extended by two years to December 31, 1985. However, certain
factors resulting in lower disbursements of cofinanciers' contributions
have permitted increased financing of some project components during the
lengthened implementation period. These include progressive devaluation of
the taka since 1980, initial scaling down of some subcomponents during the
cutback in the Second Five Year Plan. lower than anticipated price



- 23 -
increases of some items such as drugs, and UNFPA supply of some UHFWC
equipment. These changes also permitted Australia and IDA to meet the cost
of components originally expected to be financed by the United Kingdom.
2.71       Slow disbursement against NORkD and IDA funds derives mainly from
the late start of the construction program and the lag between incurring
expenditure and preparation of withdrawal applications. However, all
cofinancier funds are expected to be substantially disbursed by the project
closing date, except for a possible savings of up to US$3 million
anticipated from the IDA credit.
E. Third Five Year Plan
2.72      GOl's draft Third Plan (1985-90) has grown out of the experiences
of the last 10 years.  Its demographic goals are more realistic than In the
enrlier two plans and constitute the first phase of a three-phase
approach. The subsequent phases are a) to reach replacement fertility
by the year 2000 or as soon thereafter as possible, and b) then to achieve
zero population growth. The FP/MCH strategy has also been modified and now
emphasizes MCH which was missing in the implementation plans for the First
and Second plans. Specifically, the Government has come to accept the
premises that (a) assured survival of children is a critical factor in
planning families; (b) improvement in the range and quality of servlces
offered will promote better relationships between health workers and
clients; and (c) the combined effect of these influences should lead to
increased contraceptive prevalence rates and reductions in fertility.
Goals
2.73      The demographic goal of the Third Plan is to increase the CPR
from the current level of 24-26Z to 38-40X in 1990. The demographic change
expected to be achieved through this increase would be a 17Z decline In the
TFR. from the present level of 5.8 to 4.8 in 1990, a reduction of the crude
birth rate from about 39 in 1984-85 to 32 in 1989-90 and in the crude death
rate from 15.2 in 1984-85 to 13.1 in 1989-90. TFR change would be close to
the performance of 11 developing countries, including Colombia and
Thailand, which experienced particularly rapid fertility decline after
World War 'I.  In those countries, fertility fell by a roughly constant
amount of 0.2 per year.
2.74       :he GOB's MCH goals are focused on the unacceptably high levels
of intaint and mateinal mortality (para. 1.09). The goals are to reduce IMR
by about 24Z. or from the current estimated level of 132/1000 live births
to less than 100/1000 by 1990. The goal for reduction of maternal
mortality (MIR) is from around 6 to 4 per 1000 live births by 1990.
Strategy
2.75      The strategy to achieve the goals would focus on at least seven
areais: (.) improved service delivery; (ii) contraceptive mix; (iii) MCH
interven:ions; (iv) redesign of the FP/MCH communications strategy; (v)
strergthening of women's programs; (vi) increased support to NGOs; and
(vii) innovative activities. While ambitious, these programs taken
together are achievable within the limits of resources available to GOB
th.rough its owr. and external resources. If implemented as anticipated,



- 24 -
these programs could realistically be expected to achieve all the Third
Five Year Plan goals except the rather ambit!ous MMR objective.
2.76       Service Delivery System.  The Government's basic strategy under
the draft Third Five Year Plan is to continue to improve FP and MCH
services by increasing the productivity of the substantial human and
physical infrastructure created under the first two plans. MOHPC would
focus on improvements in the supervision and management system, in-service
training, and provision of supplies, within the context of the current
organizational structure, and set up a special mechanism to improve field
implementation. In only two areas, major inc.rease, in the infrastructure
are planned. Another 1000 UHFWCs would be built toward national coverage
and an additional 10,000 FWA positions would be created to increase density
and quality of service in rural areas.
2.77      Possible conflicts lave threatened to emerge between the
Population and Health Wings of MOHPC in regard to staffing of union-level
facilities. A Planning Commission paper suggests posting physicians
financed by the Health Wing to all union-level facilities and building
housing for them under the Third Plan. Staffing such facilities with
physicians would be a costly and inappropriate response to oversupply of
physicians rather than a cost-effective way to meet health needs, since the
HA and FWV should be able to manage most of the union level caseload.
Because the health part of the Third Five-Year Plan had not been drafted by
May, 1985, it was not possible to ensure complementarity between the health
and population plans in regard to staffing and related issues. The
Government agreed not to staff UHFWCs with physicians and to harmonize
five-year plans for population control and for health.
2.78      Proposed Contraceptive Mix and Fertility Reduction.  The Third
Five Year Plan proposes a contraceptive mix and estimated rate of increase
in use for 1985-90 (see Annex 4), which is both achievable and consistent
with the objective of reaching a 38-40X CPR in 1989-90. The share of
sterilization which began to rise under the Second Plan (paras. 2.03 and
2.04), would increase to 41% of the CPR, and the use of IUDs would also
increase to 15% of the CPR. With the decrease in less-effective
traditional methods, the overall mix effectiveness would rise from .79 to
.85. The use of oral contraceptives also is expected to increase and
account for 16% of the 1990 CPR. The projected 15% rise in the CPR derives
both from the availability of additional workers to provide regular pill
distribution and experienco in Matlab indicating that oral contraceptives
can make up as much as 30% of contraceptive use where injectables are not
widely available. However, the use-effectiveness of pills is known to be
low because of high discontinuation rates and frequently irregular use.
Therefore, the contraceptive mix will be kept under continual review and
more effective spacing methods such as IUDs and injectables will be
promoted insofar as possible.

2.79      The Government will have to seek ways of developing less
centralized approaches to both contraceptive supply and demand during the
Third Project. Some districts, and some areas within districts, are likely
to reach the national 40% CPR target earlier than others accompanied by
significant shifts in consumer preference as, for example, demand for
sterilization declines. The Government will need to monitor such changes
through its information system and accordingly work out localized
strategies for communications, target-setting and ensuring that an
appropriate mix of contraceptives remains available to those areas.
2.80      MCH.  The strategy over the next five years is designed to
promote a better balance between MCH and FP services through the national
application of interventions directed at major causes of morbidity and
mortality in pregnancy, infancy and childhood. This aspect of the program
will require a major outreach effort. The improved child survival rate
obtained through selected interventions of proven efficacy is an accepted
and leading factor contributing to long-term reduction in fertility rates.
The main interventions will be:
-    developing capability to provide oral rehydration therapy at the
household level.
-    immunization of children less than two years of age against six
diseases and immunization of women of child-bearing age against
tetanus.
-    training of Traditional Birth Attendants in safe delivery
practices.
These priority interventions were selected on the basis of managerial and
technical feasibility, acceptability and low cost. They have been tested
on a limited scale and have been demonstrated to be effective in conditions
prevailing in the country as a whole.
2.81      The goals of the interventions will be:
(i) Immunization against DPT, measles and BCG of 30% of all rural
children and 55% of urban children aged 0-2 years or a total of
4.2 million children over a five-year period and coverage of at
least half that group with polio vaccine;



- 26 -
(ii) Immunization against DT of around half of all children aged 2-10
years, or a total of around 4.7 million children over a five-year
period;
(iii) Immunization with two doses of tetanus toxoid of 30% of all women
of reproductive age r a total of 6.6 million women over a
five-year period;;
(iv) Education in oral rehydration therapy of 75% of rural families
and the distribution of 15 million packets of oral rehydration
salts (ORS) annually, or coverage of approximately 7.7 million
families over a five-year period; and
(v)  Safe delivery by trained TBAs for a total of 27% of all
uncomplicated rural births or around 950,000 assisted births
yearly over 5 years, plus institutional delivery of 10% of all
rural births identified through high-risk screening, or around
350,000 births yearly over a five year period.
2.82      UNICEF, as part of its MCH assistance, has supported the
development of these interventions in a combined fashion. However,
implementation to date has been limited; as a result, little information
regarding the impact of the approach on an operational scale is available.
However, an ICDDRB study in Bangladesh suggests that immunization and safer
childbirth support family planning objectives. The study found that the
introduction of ORT in Matlab initially diluted worker FP effort, leading
to a temporary drop in contraceptive prevalence. The decline took place
because ORT at first was not properly integrated into field staff workloads
and thereby absorbed too much worker time. As ORT routines stabilized,
contraceptive prevalence rates recovered. In a longer time p_rspective,
the introduction of selected MCH services is not considered an impediment
to the growth of contraception in Matlab. Other research, both in
Bangladesh and internationally, show the effectiveness of the interventions
taken separately:
(i)  Completed immunization with DPT, oral polio and measles vaccine
has been showa internationally to be effective in reducing
mortality a-ad morbidity from these causes. BCG vaccination in
infancy protects against certain severe forms of tuberculosis
affecting young children.
(ii) The effectiveness of maternal TT immunization has been clearly
demonstrated in a controlled field study in Bangladesh in which
the neonatal tetanus mortality rate was reduced to 1.3/1,000 live
births compared to 24/1,000 live births in the control area.
This contributed to a reduction in total neonatal mortality to 39
per 1,000 live births compared with a level of 85 per 1,000 live
births in the control area.
(iii) ORT based on education and the distribution of packaged salts by
health workers and village volunteers has been shown to reduce
case fatality rates by 80% from 3.67 to 0.72/1,000.



- 27 -
(iv) Controlled field trials in other countries indicate that the
training of TBAs can reduce neonatal mortality principally from
tetanus and birth injuries by 75%. Although evidence for
reduction in maternal mortality under conditions prevailing in
Bangladesh is not yet available, in other areas TBA training has
greatly reduced maternal mortality, in particular from postpartum
hemorrhage and infection. Success will depend suLstantially on
the effectiveness of risk assessment and rcferral V-' edures, but
the Government's proposed TBA training and deploym'nt goals are
feasible. However, it will take time to reach national coverage
levels proposed in the draft Third Plan, which depend as much on
demand for services as their supply. Hence, it is likely that
maternal mDrtality will begin to fall appreciably onl-y in the
project's later years and that an MMR reduction to 5 could be
achieved only in the last year of the project.
2.83      Communications.  The communications strategy will aim to reach
all eligible couples to (a) encourage adoption of a small faaily norm; (b)
adopt and continue contraception; and (c) participate in the MCH program.
This strategy shifts to one of promoting specific behavioral change against
earlier efforts to promote awareness.
2.84      Women's Programs.  The strategy will emphasize strengthening
management of the three women's programs, improving their cost
effectiveness and increasing their coverage (para 2.60). Specifically, the
goals will be (i) to triple both the coverage and double individual incomes
for women's cooperatives; (ii) triple membership in Mothers' Centers and
raise members' lacomes by 50%; (iii) recruit a total of oier 440,000 new
contraceptive acceptors; (iv) provide vocational training and retraining
for beneficiaries, and (v) raise the average per capita income of
participants with access to credit between 67% and 100%.
2.85      NGOs and Innovative Programs.  The Government proposes to greatly
expand the role of NGOs, particularly in rural areas. The GOB intends to
rely on NGOs to supply injectables (which ideally should be dirtribi'ted
through home visits) at least for the duration of the Third Plan. Although
in the longer run MOHPC field workers would be expected to assume this
function, resistance from the medical profession makes such a strategy
impractical for the present. The innovative programs will be based on
Government recognition that while the present FP/MCH program may increase
contraceptive prevalence to about 40% by 1990, additional measures to reach
a 62% CPR by the turn of the century will have to be identified and tested
during the Third Plan.
Outlook After 1990
2.86      GOB planners are aware that the program strategies in place for
the Third Plan will require modification after 1990. Regarding demographic
goals, it is unlikely that actions ade'essed solely to improving the
service delivery system would maintain the pace of TFR decrease expected
during the Third Plan period. No more than an estimated 50% of all
currently-married Bangladeshi women aged 15-49 years desire no more
children. Intensive, well-managed pilot projects in Bangladesh promoting
modern contraceptive methods and selective maternal-child health (MCH) care



- 28 -
have peaked at around a 42% CPR over time. Those figures suggest both that
the constraints inherent in Bangladesh's stage of socio-economic
development will need to be addressed in future years, and that
strategieswill be needed to generate additional demand by influencing
proximate determinants of fertility such as women's status and the
perceived economic value of children.
2.87      Program interventions after 1990 also will need to include a
wider range of activities. When fully developed, they would include
pregnancy monitoring and advice, obstetrical risk assessment and referral,
safe delivery assistance, post-natal evaluation of mothers and infants,
breastfeeding support, immunization, growth monitoring, nutrition
supplementation, treatment of common infections and parasitic disease and
health education. Because of the increased operational and managerial
workload involved, the Government would introduce the various interventions
by phases. While these interventions should permit fairly rapid initial
reductions in mortality from identified leading causes, principally of
infectious origin, subsequent reductions would depend to a greater extent
on broader environmental and behavioral measures involving non-health
sectors.
F. Bank Strategy and Role
2.88      Under the circumstances described above. Bank strategy in
Bangladesh over the next five years should be to assist the GOB to: a)
meet the 1990 CPR target of 38-40%;  b) evolve measures to stimulate
additional demand for family planning services both to maintain program
momentum beyond 1990 and to ensure that the service delivery system will
continue to be appropriately utilized; and c) find ways over the next few
years to extend essential and affordable health care to Bangladesh's
largely unserved population.
2.89      To move towards the achievement of a 38-40% CPR, Bank and other
donor support should center on at least five key areas of service delivery:
-    First, consolidation and qualitative improvement of the service
delivery system, particularly from the UHFWC to the villages.
This will involve particular attention to training, supervision
and motivation;
-    Second, expansion of the URFWC infrastructure at a rate
commensurate with GOB ability to manage and operate it;
-    Third, ensuring an effective and efficient flow of medical and
surgical requisites, contraceptive supplies, related MCH drugs
and medicines and othier logistics requirements of the service
delivery system;
-    Fourth, full involvement of the private sector in service
delivery through an increased role for NGOs in rural areas,
building on their considerable urban success; and



- 29 -
-    Fifth, strengthened monitoring and surveillance to promote better
quality control over services IDA also should be prepared to continue to
accept the government's client and worker reward measures, as long as they
are carried out with satisfactory attention to the quality of care and
include verifiable maintenance of a clearly voluntary environment.
2.90      Creation of new demand involves a spectrum of activities whose
outcome may be unpredictable at this stage. IDA should assist Government
efforts to reorient the national communications strategy to promote a small
family norm and adoption of family planning behavior by specific target
groups. IDA also should continue selective project support to women's
programs. However, it should be recognised that increasing women's
productive participation requires broader efforts by the country and
donors; progress toward this objective should be pursued more vigorously
through current IDA lending for education and proposed lending for creation
of rural employment opportunities.
2.91      Finally, IDA should support the Government's proposals to
experiment during the next five years with ways to alter existing public
perceptions that the economic value of children outweighs their cost.
Pilot projects may range from old-age insurance and savings bonds to
possible legal and administrative measures to raise the cost of children.
2.92      Another aspect of the Bank strategy should be to maintain the
consortium approach adopted in the first two projects and proposed for the
Third project. To assure donor coherence and support, the Bank should
continue as in the past, to promote donor participation in project design
and appraisal, cofinancing and project review. In this way, the Bank
should also promote closer partnership among all donor agencies concerned
with population and health in Bangladesh, including cofinanciers of the
proposed Third Project, and between them and the Government on all matters
pertaining to development of the sector.
G. Role of Other Donors
2.93      The Government anticipates substantial funding for its Third Plan
for population control from major donors such as USAID and UNFPA, apart
from the Bank and possible cofinanciers of the Third Project. Proposed
UNFPA funding for the Third Plan is estimated at US$15-20 million; final
project documents are being prepared. The major areas of funding wiil be
family planning/MCH services delivery and communications. USAID is the
major financier for the GOB voluntary sterilization an. IUD program and is
expected to continue funding client compensation and referral fees. In
addition, USAID will continue to provide substantial support for NGOs; the
major beneficiaries are the Social Marketing Project, BAVS, the Family
Planning Services and Training Center (FPSTC), Matlab family planning
project and its extension upazilas, and a number of national NGOs/voluntary
organizations. USAID support will be in the range of US$25.0 million per
year over the next five years. The Federal Republic of Germany (FRG),
since 1979 has assisted an important pilot project to develop a model
delivery system combining family planning and maternal child health
services with community-oriented activities. The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) is providing a US$27.5 million loan to build 150 UHFWCs, upgrade 150
RDs, strengthen 70 UHCs and ten district and subdivisional hospitals,



- 30 -
improve the central stores of both the Health and Population Control wings,
build 19 district warehouses for supplies and set up and strengthen
facilities to repair medical equipment. The loan also will improve
management of medical supplies. Activities funded by USAID, UNFPA, ADB and
FRG have been taken into consideration while designing the Third Project to
avoid duplication and ensure complementarity and mutual reinforcement. To
promote full coordination, both UNFPA and USAID representatives
participated in the appraisal of the proposed Third project, which was
prepared by the Government, along with representatives of the FRG and other
prospective cofinanciers.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives and Design
3.01      The major objective of the proposed project is to assist the
Government of Bangladesh in achieving the fertility and infant and maternal
mortality reduction goals set out in paras. 2.72 and 2.73. Corollary
objectives are to maintain program momentum thereafter by stimulating
additional demand for family planning, and to help strengthen the
infrastructure for basic rural health services. The project proposes to
achieve these aims by:
a)   Strengthening management and supervision of the service delivery
system;
b)   Strengthening and broadening maternal and child health (MCH)
activities through programs for immunization, diarrhea management
and safer childbirth;
c)   Increasing the effective coverage of rural family planning and
health services through provision of additional field workers and
Union Health and Family Welfare Centers (UHFWCs);
d)   Improving technical skills of field workers, through programs of
training and retraining;
e)   Supplying drugs, supplies and medicines for both MCH
and family planning;
f)   Developing information, education and motivation (IEN) programs
designed to increase the demand for family planning and MCH
services;
g)   Supporting women's vocational training and cooperative programs
which promote family planning acceptance, and non-government
organizations (NGOs) which promote and provide family planning
services;
h)   Strengthening the MOHPC's management information system, and
supporting research on the performance of the family planning and
health program and ways to improve it; and



- 31 -
i)   Supporting experimentation with other programs outside tne
service delivery system to encourage couples to delay having or
to have fewer children.
3.02      The project is designed to incorporate the assistance of most of
the major foreign donors to the Government's family planning and health
program for the Third Plan. This strategy will ensure that support is in
line with GOB priorities and will minimize the Government's aid management
burden. The project will thus finance most of the major family planning
and MCH activities in Bangladesh for the Third Plan. It will also build on
the accomplishments of the Second Project. Recognizing the long time
horizon for program and institutional development in the population and
health sectors, and the GOB's continuing dependence on external financial
assistance, the project will continue selective support to major activities
*upported under the Second Project. These are field staff salaries,
transport, drugs, UHFWC construction, training, IEM, women's programs, and
evaluation and research. The project will respond to problems which arose
during implementation of the Second Plan through the following actions:
a)   A special emphasis on strengthening management and
supervision of the field service delivery system qpara.
2.25-2.29);
b)   A major institutional development program for NIPORT;
c)   Introduction of a limited package of priority MCH services on an
outreach basis (para 2.79), made possible by the substantial
network of outreach workers built up under the First and Second
plans;
d)   A substantial increase in the number of female Family Welfare
Assistants (FWAs), (para. 2.56); and
e)   A maintenance program for the facilities constructed under the
First and Second Projects.

C. Detailed Project Description
Family Planning/KCH Service Delivery Consolidation and Expansion
(a) Management and Supervision
3.04      To support the Third Five Year Plan's emphasis on the
strengthening of management and supervision, the project will provide: (i)
improvements in the field supervision system, (ii) support to independent
quality control over clinical contraception, and (iii) support to a
management services development program.
3.05      Supervision Structure.  The project will finance two new cadres
of supervisory staff. First, it will create four Directors (Supervision),
plus ancilliary staff, as a supervisory tier between the Director-General,
Population Control (DG) and the 64 district Deputy Directors, Family
Planning (DD/FPs). This national supervision directorate will ease the
burdea on the DG, which has become extremely onerous with the increase in
the number of districts (para 2.53). The new Directors (Supervision) will
spend a minimum of 16 days a month in the field, and will have particular
responsibility for improving the quality of supervision (para 3.11), for
liaison with the Management Development Unit (para 3.16-3.17), and for
ensuring that the lessons of field experience are fed back into in-service
management training courses.
3.06      Second, the project will finance 464 newly-created Senior Family
Welfare Visitor (SFWV) posts, one per upazila.  The SFWV will be a female,
reporting to the MO (MCH/FP). She will carry out field supervision for 16
days per month, primarily at UHFWCs and during the remaining days, do staff



- 34 -
work at the UHCs. She will have particular responsibility for quality
control and in-service training on clinical forms of contraception, for TBA
training and for MCH services provided by the FWV at each UHFWC. The
additional technical supervision she will provide will be needed as the MCH
program develops and as IUDs and injectables become an increasingly
important part of the contraceptive mix. Doctors, the only technical
supervisors now available at the upazila level, are not suited for this
work because they are mostly male, and because their experience is with
clinical, curative medicine rather than MCH. The SFWV post will be a
promotion post for FWVs, and will for the first time provide career
development opportunities for this cadre.
3.07      In recognition of the need to provide supervision for an
expanding contraceptive mix, the GOB proposes to create a new technical
supervisory cadre at the district level. It will redesignate the MO/MST
post (para 2.21) as a MO/Clinical Contraception/MCH (MO/CC/MCH), and assign
MO/CC/MCHs to all 64 districts. These posts are financed through the GOB
revenue budget. The MO/CC/KCH will have primary responsibility for
technical supervision of the work of the SFWV and will monitor and improve
the quality of clinical contraceptive services and institutional MCH care.
He will report to the DD/FP and be provided technical supervision by the
Clinical Contraception Surveillance Team (para 3.12).
3.08      Supervisor Mobility.  The project will provide sufficient
mobility for regular, frequent field supervision at all levels, through
financing of transport and travel costs and allowances. The project
includes a four-wheel drive vehicle for each of the Supervision Directors
and two for each of the 64 districts. One will be for the health staff, to
be shared by the Civil Surgeon and his assistants. The other will be for
the DD/FP. EAch of the 64 district Medical Officers (MO/CC/MCH) will be
provided with a motorcycle on a hire-purchase basis to promote adequate
maintenance, which has worked well in an IDA-aided agriculture extension
project. Of the 192 vehicles to be provided at the district level, 51 will
replace existing vehicles coming to the end of their useful lives and 141
will be for staff otherwise without transport. The project also will
finance spare parts, operation and maintenance costs.
3.09      At the upazila level, the project will finance 2,308 motorcycles
for staff in 5 key field supervisor positions. These are the UHFPO, the
FPO, the MO/MCH/FP, the HI and the EPI technician (para 2.21). Around
1,292 of these motorcycles will replace existing vehicles to be written off
during the project period and 1,016 will be for supervisors previously
without transport. The motorcycles will be provided on a hire purchase
basis, to the UHFPO, FPO and MO (MCH), wlho will be responsible for their
maintenance; the project will provide only an operating allowance. HIs and
EPI technicians, whose low salaries will make hire purchase unaffordab'e,
will receive both operating and maintenance allowances, and their
motorcycles will remain government property. At the union level the
project will provide 19,620 bicycles for MAs, FPAs, AHIs, and HAs to
provide the mobility for regular supervisory and home visits. Around 8,120
bicycles will replace those due to be written off during the project
period, and 11,500 will be for staff currently without transport; all will
be provided on a hire purchase basis.



- 35 -
3.10      The project will finance a Tk.500 monthly allocation for the SFWV
to travel by bus, cycle-rickshaw and boat as required, since she will not
receive transport under the project. Existing travel allowances are
adequate for other district and upazila level staff. At the union level,
the project will finance monthly travel allowances of Tk.30 for FWAs and
HAs, Tk.40 for FPAs and AHIs, and Tk.50 for FWVs and HAs, to provide
adequate incentives for regular field supervision visits.In addition, the
project will provide a Tk.90 monthly boat allowance for FWAs & HAs for the
four months of the year when flooding usually makes it impossible to visit
all areas of the ward on foot.
3.11      Supervision Quality.  The project is designed to upgrade the
ability of management staff to provide support and guidance through
development of new forms of on-the-job training and new supervision
guidelines. Government orders regarding regular fortnightly meetings of
all staff to be held at each union, and monthly meetings at cach upazila
for all upazila staff will be enforced. Although the Government has yet to
work out guidelines for these meetings, it has agreed that certain training
activities would be included on a routine basis; specifically district and
upazila supervisors will present in-service training modules on management
and supervision, on technical subjects and on IEM. These steps have taken
place during project preparation and do not involve project costs.
Guidelines, already drafted by the Government and specifying the frequency
of supervision and the key activities for which supervisors at each level
are responsible, will be tested and refined in the pilot districts assisted
by the Management Development Unit (para. 3.16) before nationwide
dissemination. This improved supervision quality would promote
coordination between the Population Control and Health Wings and functional
integration (paras. 2.23, 2.24, 2.50, 2.51).
3.12      Independent Quality Control.  The project will broaden the scope
of the four Sterilization Surveillance units, each consisting of one
expatriate and one Bangladeshi physician, reporting to the
Director-General, PCW, which began work in Bangladesh in late 1982 (para.
2.32). The group will be renamed the Clinical Contraception Surveillance
Team (CCST) and will continue its supervisory role to MOs at the UHCs, and
to the newly created MO/CC/MCHs. However, it now will oversee the quality
of IUD insertions and injectables as well as sterilization. Its work will
provide an important element of independent quality control. All
expatriates will remain for three project years, except for the team
leader. He will stay on for an additional year to facilitate transfer of
responsibilities to Bangladeshi technical staff, who will then continue the
program through the Third Five Year Plan. Assurances were received at
negotiations that the four CCST teams will continue to operate through the
project period and report directly to the Director-General, PCWC
(para.7.01b).
3.13      This change in the team's scope of work is based on annual
reviews by WHO, SIDA, IDA and the Government, which have reported that
despite steady improvement in the quality of sterilization services, pre-
and post-operative care and subsequent follow-up of clients still needs to
be strengthened. It also reflects Govern=cdit plans to monitor and improve
the quality of other forms of clinical contraception, principally IUD
insertions.



- 36 -
3.14      To bring about these changes, the terms of reference of the group
wiil be expanded and an experienced Bangladeshi nurse will be added to each
divisional team along with one expatriate consultant-nurse to the Dhaka
team. The nurses will work with YWVs and other female IHC staff
responsible for pre- and post-operative care of clients in connection with
operating theatre procedures and avoidance of infection. They also will
train FWVs through visits to UHFWCs to strengthen quality control over IUD
insertions. As the use of injectables expands, the teams will monitor the
quality of service and follow-up. The project will also continue and
expand client satisfaction surveys to help monitor the clinical
contraception program and identify problems requiring corrective action.
One such survey will take place In each of the first four project years,
with an IUD survey in 1985-86 and 1987-88 and a sterilization survey In
alternate years. Assurances were received at negotiations that the terms
of reference of the annual clinical contraception surveys and their timing
will be satisfactory to IDA (para. 7.O0c).
3.15      The project will finance one four-wheel drive vehicle for each
team; 16 person-years of full-time expatriate technical assistance for
doctors and nurses; salarios and allowanceB for Bangladeshi counterpart and
support staff; costs of two surveys each of sterilizatlon and IUD client
satisfaction; development and production costs of trainlng manuals and
related teaching materials; and equipment, suppliles and related office and
operating costs.
3.16      Management Development Unit   The management system for
implementation of the varlous elements of the service delivery component of
the Third Plan will be tested In 4-8 districts where lmplewentation of the
project will first be concentrated. The project will finance a Management
Development Unit, consisting of four expatriate and four local
consultants who will be In place by June 30, 1986, and work In the pilot
districts. The unit will have three ais: (i) to provide on-the-spot
advice to assist district and upazila personnel to 'olve iaplementation
problems at the field level; (ii) to identify systemic problems which
cannot be solved in the field and to seek appropriate solutions in
consultation with senior management; and (ill) to feed back the lessons
from experience in the pilot districts Into the manageomnt strategy for
MDHPC scrvice delivery.
3.17      The unit will be based in Dhaka and report to the Secretary,
MOHPC; however, it will spend nine months of each year in the pilot
districts, working closely with district and upazils managers in health and
family planning, and with the supervision Directorate of MOHPC (par&.
3.05). The unit will review the coordination and management of all
elements of the project including MCH expansion; effectiveness of training;
deployment of additional staff; local IEI activities; the MIS; the
supervision system; and the construction and maintenance program. It will
also monitor the Government's client compensation, service provider and
worker referral fees ( paras. 2.09-2.10) In the pilot districts. The unit
will function primarily as the focus for an operational learning process,
resulting in continuing adjustment of plans and implementation strategies;
however, the team will also provide GOB with an annual report of progress
and problemo three months before publicatlon of the annual operational plan
for the project, as an input Into the plan. The role of the unit would be



- 37 -
reviewed jointly by the Governmeitt and IDA after cwo years of operation and
a decision would then be reached regarding its couposition and continued
work.
(b) In-Service TraininR for District and Upazila Staff
3.18      NIPORT.  The Third Plan calls for pre-seivice and in-service
training for district, upazila aiid union level staff and field workers co
ensure the quality of service delivery. The project will finance a major
institutional development program for NIPORT, the Family Welfare Vlsitor
Training Institutes (FWVTI), and the kegional Training Centers (RICs). The
NIPORT program will Iave four main eleents: (1) restructuring of NIPORT
training activities into two divisions, one responsible for training
program developmer; and the other for supervision of field; (il) staff
strengthening by addin' 13 trainers to the 14 professionals now in NIPORT,
the setting of more rigorous recruitment criteria, and staff developmont;
(iii) improving the quality of training through additional facilities and
equipment, strengthened curriculum and training materials development, and
technical assistance; and (iv) increasing the quantity of training through
contracting with other institutions. NIPOKT's new table of organizatLon
appears in Annex 5. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the
Government will maintaln and operate a Management Advisory Committee to
guide NIPORT's overall institutional development, composed of Inter alia
the Secretary, MOHPC, a Planning Commission representative and the Director
General of NIPORT. The Advisory Committee will met quarterly and will
inform IDA of its findings. (para. 7.Old).
3.19      The two new NIPUKT operating units will each be headed by a
Deputy Director reporting to the Director of Training who in turn reports
to the DG, NIPORT. The unlt for Supervision of Field Operations (SFO) will
be responsible for the FWVTIs and RTCs (see para 3.23). The TraLning
Program Development unit (TPD) will consist of five sub-units covering
management training, field worker training, technical tralning, trainer
training, and NGO/multisectoral/comuunity leader training. They will
operate through working groups with representatives from service providing
and training Institutions and experienced outside organizations. Each unit
will be responsible for planning of training, developing curricula and
evaluating results. The trainer training unit also will be responsible for
training and retraining of the 275 FWVTI and RTC training staff. The
management training unit will provide approximately 500 person-months of
training annually for district and upazila level managers,
Including team Lralning for staff at these levels. The project will fund
160 man-months of experienced local consultants annually to a*sist with
curriculum and training materials development and to help carry out NIPORT
training programs.
3.20      The project will provide US$207.000 annually for training
contracts with collaborating institutions for around 700 man- onthe of
speclalized management and related traLning, thus sharing the training load
with NIPORT and making maximum use of skills and experience in the
country. Institutions which have already been identifled and which have
had limited inceraction with NIPORT in the past, include the Bangladesh
Management Development Centre, Centre for Population Management and
Research, and National Institute of Preventive and Social Medicine
(NIPSOM!).



- 38 -
3.21      The project will fund 120 man-months each of local and foreign
training for NIPORT staff, particularly for manpower development and
management, training methodologies, curriculum development and in the
managerial skills needed to organize and mtnage NIPORT's own training
activities. Recruitment rules will be revised to ensure that only
qualified candidates would be eligible for NIPORT employment. The NIPORT
DC's active participation in the MOHPC committee which makes decisions on
NIPORT staff appointments and transfers will further help to ensure that
NIPJRT is staffed with qualified individuals. The project will finance the
salaries of 27 NIPORT professional training staff (para. 3.18).
3.22      The project will improve NIPORT facilities and equipment by
linancinit an extension to the NIPORT headquarters building, permitting a
physicail con.olidation of the training division, headquarters training
center anid hostel, now in rental premises in different parts of the city;
five ndcrobuses for the transport of students, four four-wheel drive
vehicles for field supervision of training, and one sedan. Furniture,
office aind training equipment and materials also will be provided. The
project also will finance 15 man-years of long-term expatriate technical
assistancc in organizational and curriculum development and 20 man-months
of short-term expatriate consultancies in planning and implementation of
specific training activities. One of the expatriate advisors will assist
NIPORT in drawing up and refining its annual schedule of training
activities, which will be furnished to IDA and cofinanciers during annual
project reviews (para. 5.09).
3.23      FWVTIs & KTCs.  The 12 FWVTIs, each with classrooms and hostel
accommodatLon tor about 60 students, will be responsible for in-service
training of an estimated 2,000 FWVs who in turn will run the TBA training
program (para. 3.53). This training will focus on safe birth practices,
neonatal care and FP. FWVs will be trained at the rate of 400 per year
over the project period. Twenty RTCs, with accommodation for 40 trainees
each, have the capacity to retrain all existing FWAs and FPAs, and to
provide pre-service training of all but 2,000 of the new cadre of 10,000
FWAs over the project period, who will be trained in four FWVTIs (para.
3.25). Priority will be given to retraining of FWVTI and RTC trainers by
the NIPOKT headquarters training centre during the first year of the
project. Pre-service practical training In deliveries for FWVs also will
be strengthened by increasing the number of births in which each trainee
participates. In addition to support for planning and supervision of
training, which will come from NIPORT, the project will finance for the
FWVT1s and RTCs: (i) 17 microbuses (1 for each FWVTI and 5 for RTCs) to
transport trainees; (ii) training and office equipment; (iii) the salaries
of traincrs and support staff; (iv) rental costs for training centres and
hostels, operation and maintenance costs for facilities, equipment and
vehicles; and (v) stipends for trainees.
(c)    Family Welfare Assistants
3.24      The project will finance the salaries and training of around
10,UOO new FWAs to be recruited by MOHPC during the course of the project.
These would bring the FWA:client ratio to 1:4,000 by 1990.  The reduced
ratio, coupled with a recent Government decision to replace
retiring male HA with females (para. 2.56), will permit health/family
planning workers to make monthly instead of quarterly visits to each rural



- 39 -
family. The 1:4,000 ratio represents a compromise between the need to
minimize incremental recurrent costs and research results suggesting that a
1:3,000 ratio is optimum for family planning acceptance. Four thousand
clients per worker also represents the maximum number which can in future
be adequately served by a single FWA, given the additional MCH tasks which
FWAs would take on during the l'fe of tla project.  With 10,000 new FWAs,
the staff/supervisor ratio would become 5.2 FWAs per FPA, as against the
current 3 per FPA. Since the current ratio is quite low, the increase
would be manageable. The FWAs would be phased in on a regional basis, with
priority to those areas where the new MCH services are first being
introduced. To encourage better rapport with clients, they will be
recruited insofar as possible from the specific catchment areas in which
they will work. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the
Government will gradually employ additional FWAs in order to achieve a
1:4,000 ratio of FWAs to population not later than June 30, 1990 (para.
7.01e).
3.25      The project will continue to provide the salaries of 4,500 FWAs
financed under the Second Project, or one-third of the existing cadre.
While it has not absorbed these staff salaries as originally envisaged
under the Second Project, the GOB in agreement with IDA, has assumed the
larger recurrent costs of other union-level staff whose salaries total
somewhat more than those of the 4,500 FWAs, thereby complying with the
spirit of the covenant under the Second Project.
(d)   Drugs and Kits
3.26      The  project will finance US$28.5 million in base costs of
FWA supplies, MCH-related drugs, and dietary supplements of which the
latter two will be dispensed at rural health facilities in addition to
those which will be provided by UNICEF and UNFPA. To minimize losses, the
drug and dietary supplement (DDS) kits would be supplied in sealed,
standardized units. They would be provided at the rate of seven kits in
the first year, followed by eight kits each year thereafter to each UdC;
four kits yearly to each UHFWC and converted rural dispensary, and one kit
yearly for each union without a UHFWC. The supply to UHFWCs is double that
provided in the Second Project. The experience of the Second Project
indicates that attendance at health clinics is directly and positively
correlated with drug availability; regular supplies of drugs are critical
to the productive utilization not only of clinic staff and facilities
.'nanced under the previous and proposed projects, but also to productive
use of the outreach workers, whose credibility and effectiveness will be
lost if they are not backed by an effective referral system. The average
quantities of drugs to be supplied per facility under the Third Project are
based on the experience of NGO-funded clinics, which have found, for
example, that 4-6 DDS kits per year are needed to operate a UF_!-X
effectively, as against the 1-2 kits that government-funded UHFWCs now
receive on average. The project review in 1987-88 (para.5.09) will include
an evaluation both of the appropriateness of the quantity of kits to be
supplied per facility, and of whether the mix of drugs provided in each kit
appropriately matches the disease patterns prevalent in rural areas.
(e) Medical and Surgical Requisites



- 40 -
3.27      The project will also supply medical and surgical requisites
(MSR) at a base cost of US$16.2 million. These will include medical
supplies for sterilization and surgical apparel (sarees and lungees) for
tubectomy and vasectomy patients to improve hygienic conditions during and
after sterilization operations. The number and phasing of these MSRs has
been calculated to correspond to the estimated number and phasing of
sterilizations during the five year period and takes into account projected
UNFPA support.
(f) Logistics
3.28      Several donors are involved in strengthening the logistics system
for procurement and delivery of contraceptives, DDS kits and MSR. At the
district level, an Asian Development Bank-assisted project will construct
warehouses in 21 districts; these, together with the existing regional
warehouses, and the central warehouse in Dhaka, which is to be expanded by
GOB outside the project, will provide sufficient storage capacity to keep
an 18-month supply of all kits and adequate quantities of contraceptives
and MSR at different levels of the system at any one time. A UNFPA project
will provide transport for distribution from the central to the district
level, and IDA has financed provision of transport at the district level
from Second Project funds; the Third Project will provide operating and
maintenance costs for those vehicles, and also a small sum to cover minor
transport costs from upazila stores to UHFWCs.
3.29      Monitoring of the distribution and control of major supplies such
as DDS kits, contraceptives, MCH kits and medical-surgical requisites would
take place through a combination of mechanisms. Line responsibility would
rest with the monitoring unit in the PCW Supplies Directorate. A
UNFPA-funded logistics adviser is part of the unit. CIDA has agreed to
finance an expatriate junior logistics adviser and four local consultants
to work with the monitoring unit and the UNFPA adviser. A joint logistics
advisory comittee headed by UNFPA is now working out details of the
monitoring system. UNFPA is prepared to fund additional local personnel
for monitoring as required. USAID has a separate logistics adviser and two
assistants for field monitoring of its commodity aid to the program. A
condition of disbursement against the costs of DDS kits will be the setting
up and implementation of a monitoring system satisfactory to IDA for the
distribution and control of DDS, MCH, and IUD kits; MCH supplies; medical
and surgical requisites; and contraceptives (para. 7.03a).
(g) Construction and Maintenance
3.30      Union Health and Family Welfare Centers (UHFWCs).  Phased
expansion of the network of UHFWCs begun under earlier projects would
continue with renovation of 73 and construction of 1000 new facilities.
Each will serve an average union population of 22,000. Adequate numbers of
staff are available to run them (para. 2.28).
3.31      Around 1,020 functional UHFWCs now cover around 23% of
Bangladesh's 4,365 unions. These UHFWCs Include 600 completed under the
Second Project (921-BD), 78 built under the First Project (533-BD), 266
completed under other schemes and 76 upgraded rural dispensaries. The 1000
UHFCWs to be created under the proposed project, together with the 350 to
be completed under the final phase of the Second Project, and 300 to be



- 41 -
inst±led through an ongoing Asian Development Bank loan, will mean that a
tot-a of around 2,670 UHFCWs will be in place by 1990, or around two-thirds
ef those needed for full national coverage. Assuming that most cf the
additional 900 Rural Dispensaries could be upgraded to UHFWC status over
time, the Government would then require only around 795 more UHFWCs to
achieve its objective of full national coverage.
3.32      Problems which hampered the UHFWC construction program under the
Second Project (para. 2.49) will be addressed in the Third Project. Delays
in acquiring sites will be avoided by ensuring ttiat a two-year supply will
be available at project start-up; 400 sites already have been acquired.
The two-year lead time would be continued through the civil works
implementation period.  To improve UHFWC utilization, the project will
increase the drug supply, add MCH services and further improve worker
supervision and competence. These measures are expected to result in
better use of the UHFWCs.  In addition, UHFWCs will become the
organizational center for immunization programs, in-service training of
field workers and training of TBAs.
3.33      To address quality control problems (para. 3.41-3.42), the MOHPC
has expanded the supervisory staff of its Construction and Management Cell
(CMC) which is now capable of carrying a workload of 300 UHFWCs per year.
To ensure that contractors perform satisfactorily, the Government recently
upgraded its criteria for prequalifying UHFWC contractors and has begun a
review to eliminate those who have failed to perform satisfactorily. To
ensure effective monitoring and repor.'-%, assurances also were obtained
at negotiations that the Government will continue to employ local
consultants to (i) provide overall supervision of the UHFWC construction
program, and (ii) report monthly on progress to the Chief Engineer of the
Construction Management Cell, MOHPC (para. 7.01f).
3.34      The greatest returns from UHFWC investments are likely to come
from the currently most under-served unions. The Government has adopted
criteria to identify such unions and to avoid the occasional duplication of
facilities which occurred earlier. It has also set and will follow better
criteria involving community participation for site selection within the
union to ensure that UHWWCs are lesated as conveniently as possible for the
beneficiary population.  Where iossible, the Government will seek to obtain
buildings donated by the csumunity or individuals, or will rent rather than
construct build.ngs, for use as UHFWCs.  Moreover, the Government will
continue to review UiiUWC design standards for appropriateness and
cost-effectiveness.  The scale of the annual UHFWC construction program
will be reviewed in terms of past construction and operational performance
as part of the annual Government-IDA-cofinancier review of project progress
(para. 5.09-5.12).
3.35      The project will finance renovation and construction costs, CMC
salary, training, and operating costs, professional fees for help with
superi'.sing and monitoring of construction, and the costs of furniture and
equipment for UHFWCs to be established under this subcomponent.
3.36      Maintenance. As in many other developing countries, upkeep of
publicly-financed buildings is poor and preventive maintenance is minimal.



- 42 -
The Government under-budgets for major maintenance and the Public Works
Department (PWD) tends to carry out only those repairs which it views as
most urgently required. Minor repairs generally are the responsibility of
those in charge of particular facilities. Since no funds are available,
repairs to broken plumbing, electrical fittings, masonry, woodwork and
furniture generally involve long delays. Minor problems are ignored until
they become ziajor.
3.37      The project wil'l ensure adequate repair for facilities built
under the two previous projects and the proposed UHFWCs. A maintenance
demonstration project will be set up for the 60 UHCs and training
facilities provided under the first two projects. PWD annually will
receive a non-fungible line item allocation for maintenance and repair
transferred from the MOHPC budget equivalent to 2% of the updated
construction cost for each building. The funds will not be able to be
carried over from year to year in the PWD budget. Every January, PWD will
review the state of each building, set up a work program and budget for the
next fiscal year and then carry out routine maintenance and periodic major
repairs as needed. PWD has adequate technical and supervisory personnel
for this purpose.
3.38      To ensure day-to-day maintenance and repair, a team of two
artisans -- a plumber/mechanic and an electrician -- will be added to the
staff of each of the 60 facilities. The teams will be trained initially by
WD instructors in groups of 15 for three months, mainly in practical
repair work with some book-keeping and maintenance planning. PWD also will
organize a two-week refresher course for the teams during the project
period. The artisan team at each UHC will be made available for minor
repair work at associated UHFWCs. If successful, this approach will most
likely be adopted more broadly, particularly for major FP/MCH service
facilities.
3.39      The office of the Joint Secretary, Development (JSD) in the
Health Wing of MOHPC will be responsible for general oversight of the
training and maintenance demonstration program. The JSD's office would
review the adequacy of training as perceived by facilities managers, PWD's
maintenance and repair workplans and budgets, and the quality and
timeliness of implementation.
3.40      The project will finance training and salary costs for the 60
maintenance teams, tool kits for each artisan, annual maintenance and
repair costs, and the salaries of an executive engineer and an accountant
in the JSD's office.
3.41      Maintenance of UHFWCs also presents serious problems.  Because
these are small facilities in remote rural areas, their upkeep generally
gets scant attention. Under decentralization (para. 2.53), responsibility
for maintenance of most facilities is handled by upazila councils under
modest lump-sum annual allocations from the GOB. Other maintenance
demands, however, are likely to result in low priority for the average of 6
UHFWCs expected in each upazila by 1990. To prevent this problem, each
upazila council will receive an earmarked and non-fungible line item
allocation yearly transferred from the MOHPC budget for UHFWC maintenance
which will not be carried over. The overall amount will be equal to 2% of
current costs of constructing the present stock of UHFWCs in the upazila.
CMC will carry out a study during the first year of the project to



- 43 -
determine whether the workload of upazila engineers will need to be
adjusted to handle UHFWC maintenance needs.    The overall design of the
UHFWC maintenance program and the adequacy of funds to maintain UHFWCs also
will be kept under review by the Government and IDA, and adjusted
accordingly.
3.42      CMC will set up a schedule for routinely visiting each UHFWC
every other year and when specific repair problems are brought to its
attention through the Director-General, PCW. CMC will determine what
repairs are needed, their estimated cost and how long they should take to
complete. The reports will be furnished to the upazila council for
contracting and execution of the repair work. Follow-up to ensure prompt
repair and maintenance will be provided through the UHFPO in charge of
service delivery facilities in the upazila. CHC will follow up on the
quality of the work performed and report in each case to the
Director-General, Implementation, MOHPC. The project will finance the
costs of the mainteaance allocations to upazila councils and to the MA at
each UHFWC.
Maternal and Child Health Care
3.43      The project will assist Government efforts to reach MCH targets
in the Third Plan (para 2.73) by helping to finance expansion of three key
activities which are the centerpiece of the national MCH program,
immunization, diarrheal management and improved childbirth practices. This
assistance will complement around US$9.7 million in continued UNICEF
financing of the MCH program to be provided outside the project. UNICEF is
recognized as the leading external agency in the MCH field in Bangladesh.
It was instrumental in developing three key interventions which have
operated until now on a limited scale. The costs of the national MCH
program appear in Annex 5. Project support to these activities will assure
their full incorporation into both the service delivery and monitoring
system. The MCH package builds on the results of operational research
undertaken by ICDDRB (para 2.81) and will be a central featuL.. of the
Government's integrated program. A UNFPA-funded MCH advisor will assist
the GOB to develop these activities in coordination with UNICEF and will
also review implementation progress of the MCH program jointly with the
GOB, IDA and the cofinanciers.
3.44      The MCH program under the Third Plan is only the first stage of a
broader effort to address other major MCH problems such as mortality and
morbidity from respiratory disease and malnutrition. The three current
interventions were chosen because they deal with leading causes of
mortality and are managerially and technically feasible under current
circumstances. Experience with them will provide the base for subsequent
measures under the Government's longer-term strategy (para 2.84) to deal
more comprehensively with MCH problems. As the strategy will require
increased and effective linkage between the health and population wings of
the Ministry, as indicated in the MCH organizational chart in Annex G,
specific steps have taken place to strengthen institutional cooperation and
service integration in maternal and child health. Staff from both wings of
the Ministry have prepared a comprehensive MCH strategy paper and plan of
action which identifies the nature and dimensions of MCH problems and the
range of interventions that are required to resolve them. A



- 44 -
recently-established MCH coordinating committee, chaired by the MOHPC
Secretary, will be responsible for management of the program (para 5.02).
Its membership includes both wings of the Ministry, the Planning Commission
and donor agencies.
3.45      Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI).  This component of the
MCH program which has been developed with WHO assistance is directed at the
prevention of six common infectious diseases of childhood (diphtheria,
pertussis, tetanus, tuberculosis, polio and measles) by increasing the
range and coverage of immunization on a national basis. It will also
provide Tetanus Toxoid (TT) immunizations for women of reproductive age.
Inclusion of mothers in an immunization campaign is an unusual feature of
this program and is designed to protect infants until they are old enough
to receive DPT shots. The expanded program is expected to reduce
significantly the incidence and severity of the six diseases and in curn tc
contribute to reduced mortality. Objectives will be achieved by (i)
strengthening the infrastructure of the EPI program by providing staff,
physical facilities, supplies and equipment; (ii) a training program for
health professionals on program content, implementation and monitoring; and
(iii) the retraining of specialized immunization personnel (EPI and cold
chain technicians) and the development of a curriculum and teaching aids
for immunization training ef union and field staff. WHO will continue to
provide the services of an EPI consultant to the program.
3.46      The EPI component represents the first attempt to provide
national coverage at pre-determined target rates, involving expansion of
the cold chain and the development of outreach services. It is also the
first effort to include the full range of six vaccines for specific age
groups through fixed schedules. Services will be delivered through UHCs,
URFWCs, MCWCs, divisional and district hospitals and extended to ward and
village levels through satellite clinics, household visits and village
campaigns. Women of reproductive age will receive TT immunizations, mostly
through periodic campaigns, althiugh women living close to MCWCs, UHFWCs
and UHCs will be immunized in the course of routine M%lH visits. Various
options for campaign-type delivery at the ward/local level will be tested
in 1985 to determine the most feasible and cost/effective approach. A
winter campaign approach to maternal TT immunization was tested
successfully earlier this year, since tetanus vaccine is sufficiently
stable to be used without refrigeration during cool weather. Education
activities also will be carried out through established services (HEB, IEM
unit) to create demand for these immunizations. A special reporting system
on immunization performance and target disease frequency is being set up by
the MOHPC Director, MCH, to facilitate evaluation of process and impact.
Assurances wcre obtained at negotiations that the Government will prepare
by March 31, 1986, and thereafter implement, a program satisfactory to IDA
for increasing the range and coverage of child immunization on a national
basis, as well as providing TT immunizations for women of reproductive age
(para 7.01g).
3.47      The project will finance eight four-wheel drive vehicles for
supervision and vaccine distribution as well as additional staff for the
program directorate in Dhaka including a director, an assistant director, a
medical officer, a cold chain aeglneer and an administrative officer.
Support staff would also be financed at the central level and immunization
technicians and vaccine carriers at the district level. The project also
will finance an EPI technician and a messenger to deliver vaccines for



- 45 -
outreach activities in each upazila. The staffing increases described
here, added to existing paramedical staff and an estimated 10,000 new FWAs
(para. 3.24), will result in a cadre of workers who can provide the
coverage envisioned in the Third Plan. Child immunization will require an
average paramedical caseload of 195 over five years and the mother's TT
program a caseload of 212 per field worker over the five year period.
3.48      Oral Rehydration Therapy.  The oral rehydration therapy component
(ORT) is part of the broader Diarrheal Disease Control Program
(DDCP)developed by the Directorate of Health Services/ICDDRB. The main
elements of the program are the production and distribution of ORS and
education at the household level on its preparation and administration.
The latter is an ongoing program of the Bangladesh Rural Advancement
Committee (BRAC), a voluntary agency financed outside the project, on the
use of ORS and the preparation of domestic rehydration solutions. The GOB
plan of operations provides for the annual production of a total of 12m 1/2
litre ORS packets yearly by four divisional cottage industry units to be
set up under the project to supplement the four which now exist. This will
bring total divisional production to a total of 24 million packets in
1990. This production will be supplemented by four million packets a year
from the Government Essential Drugs Company, from retail sales proposed
through the Social Marketing Project, and around 6 million packets per year
produced and marketed by Gonoshasthaya Pharmaceuticals, an NGO set up on a
trust basis. The World Bank Food and Nutrition Sector Report (4974-BD)
indicated that Government production was as economical as private sector
production, or UNICEF imports, the other two available supply options. The
number of ORS packets available by 1990 will meet around half of the total
need of the country in that year, conservatively estimated at 26 million
packets for children under five years of age and 44 million packets for
adults.
3.49      To reach the 7.7 million families envisioned in the Third Plan
(para 2.80), all district, upazila and union level staff will be oriented
and trained in the principles and practices of oral rehydration; the
existing field workers will be trained to reinforce a national program of
education at the household level. Field staff should be able to provide
coverage at the rate of 56 families per field worker over the project
period. Short-term training of around 32,000 MOHPC staff at upazila, union
and ward levels will take place over the project period, using educational
materials prepared under the direction of NIPSOM/ICDDRB with active support
of the HEB, and will include national seminars, and courses at the district
and local levels.
3.50      In addition to routine supervision of ORT activities by health
service staff, special supervision of ORT and epidemic control activities
will be carried out by program officers from national and divisional DDC
units. A baseline national sample survey to measure diarrheal dis. se
morbidity and mortality took place in 1983 under the DG, Health Services by
NIPSOM with technical and material assistance from ICDDRB and UNICEF and
will be repeated in 1986 and 1988. In addition to data on diarrheal
disease, the surveys provide reliable information on mortality patterns of
children under 5 years in rural areas and will be an important instrument
in program monitoring and adjustment. ORS production targets are realistic
on the basis of current trends. Manpower training requirements are within
NIPSOM's capacity, particularly since training will be coordinated with



- 46 -
other aspects of MCH training for paramedical and auxiliary staff. Planned
development and distribution of training and educational materials are
feasible.
3.51      The project will finance four trucks for ORS distribution;
salaries and allowances of five senior staff and support personnel in the
ORS program directorate and four officers and support staff for each ORS
production unit to top off UNICEF assistance; and operating costs.
3.52      Traditional Birth Attendants.  This component of the MCH program
will develop a national training and supervision program for 30,000 TBAs.
Combined with the 24,000 trained to date (para. 2.37), this phase of TBA
training will bring the national total to 54,000 by 1990 resulting in a
trained TBA for each of more than 80% of Bangladesh's 68,000 villages.
Fifteen active TBAs will be recruited from each of 2,000 unions; selection
criteria will include age, experience and marital status.
3.53      Training will take place at UHFWCs.  The training schedule,
programmed over two years, will alternate teaching and practice periods
during the first three months and continuing advisory/supervisory contacts
during the subsequent 21 months. Direct training and supervision
activities will be the responsibility of FWVs, who will be trained for this
responsibility under the training sub-component (para. 3.23). The overall
program will be organized at the upazila level by the SFWV, working under
the guidance of the MO/CC/MCH. The training content will include ante- and
post-natal care, family planning, safe delivery practices, risk assessment
and referral procedures, ORT and EPI. Involvement with ORT and EPI will
help prepare communities for acceptance of these interventions. As the
only resident village-level health worker, the trained TBA would be an
important factor in the success of these programs. Each would receive a
maternity kit and two samples of a simple safe-delivery kit that will be
made available to pregnant women commercially at a modest price.
3.54      Past experience indicates that capacity exists to undertake basic
TBA training on this scale. FWVs are expected to be able to handle such
training responsibilities after appropriate training and experience, with
support from SFWVs. However, initial FWV training needs to include
adequate delivery experience, which NIPORT is strengthening through greater
attention to field training.
3.55      The project will finance short-term training for 2,000 FWVs under
the training sub-component (para. 3.23), a four-wheel drive vehicle for
supervision, two bicycles, salaries of six senior staff and support staff,
and operating costs.
3.56      MCH Support Under Other Project Components.  Under the FP service
delivery component, the project will finance increased supplies, DDS kits
for LHFWCs (para. 3.26), and better diagnostic and referral capabilities of
field workers through training (para 3.23). Funds from the Innovative
Activities subcomponent (para. 3.79) will be used to test nutrition
interventions such as screening and selective, short-term supplementation.
These will augment the regular nutrition education activities which field
workers already are expected to carry out. Funds from Innovative
Programs will also cover costs of providing FWAs with a limited range of
minor drugs for common mother-child disorders: analgesics, skin



- 47 -
preparations and other safe medications. UNICEF will help the GOB test
whether enabling FWAs to provide such care would increase their credibility
and lead to increased acceptance of contraception, while improving MCH
care. Moreover, an estimated 35% of the time of field workers, FWVs,
senior FWVs and the Supervision Directorate also will be spent on MCH
delivery, thereby further contributing to a better balance between FP and
MCH services.
Communications
3.57      The objectives of the communications component under the proposed
Third Project will be to reach all eligible couples to promote: i)
acceptance of a small family norm; ii) contraceptive adoption and
continuation; and iii) participation in the priority MCH interventions to
included in the Third Plan. The four main implementing agencies will be
the Information, Education and Motivation (IEM) Unit and the Health
Education Bureau (EEB) of the MOHPC; the Ministry of Information and
Broadcasting's Radio and TV Units, and the Swanirvar movement (para.
2.58). The special feature of the communications strategy under the Third
project will be a focus on (a) targeting of specific messages to specific
audiences; (b) coordination and planning of the activities of the four
agencies involved; and (c) monitoring and evaluating effectiveness,
followed by continual readjustment of the strategy.
3.58      (a)  Messages will be targeted to key audiences as follows:  (i)
current contraceptive users will be encouraged to continue contraception or
switch from traditional to modern methods; (ii) new or occasional users
will be encouraged to accept FP on a continuing basis; (iii) young adults
will be encouraged to delay marriage and accept the small family norm; (iv)
young couples, will be encouraged to space births, and to have no more than
two or three children; (v) community leaders will be encouraged to
support family planning acceptance and the small family norm; (vi) service
providers -will be urged to participate in IEM; and (vii) pregnant and
lactating women will be urged to accept FP and preventive health
practices. Moreover, the Health Education Bureau (HEB) will support MCH
activities through semi-annual campaigns to promote oral rehydration,
coinciding with the onset of peak diarrhea periods, and programs
encouraging acceptance of immunization and promotion of safe childbirth
practices. The IEM Unit will ensure the dissemination of oral rehydration
and maternal tetanus immunization messages through MIB Radio/TV programs.
HEB child immunization messages will consist mainly of posters and other
visual materials concentrated in locales where DPT, TT, BCG and oral polio
vaccine will be made available.
(b) To strengthen planning and coordination at the central level
a project communications steering committee will be formed, chaired by the
Secretary, MOHPC, with representatives from the implementing communications
agencies, the project women's program managers, and major NGOs. The
committee will review an annual communications work plan to be furnished
by the IEM Director and will coordinate implementation with the
help of committees at district, upazila and union levels with similar
organizational representation.
(c) Routine monitoring of progress will take place through the
MOHPC's Management Information System (para. 3.82) and evaluation through
annual planning and review workshops and regular evaluation studies,
incln_  __                   u- I    -  .             -,,



- 48 -
undertaken by local consultants. Monitoring and evaluation results will be
fed back to the central communications committee and into the formulation
of the annual component work plan.
3.59      Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB).  For the MIB's
Radio Population Unit the project will finance six microbuses for field
work in Dhaka and each of the five regions; outdoor broadcasting equipment;
and salaries of 47 staff, staff training and fellowships. For the TV
Population Unit in MIB the project will finance three outdoor broadcasting
vans, one four-wheel drive vehicle and one microbus; audiovisual equipment
and furniture; salaries of 31 staff, staff training and fellowships. For
both units the project will fund operating costs including materials and
supplies, production expenses, field trips and per diems, and vehicle
operation and maintenance. The outputs are expected to be the production
and broadcasting of daily radio spots, jingles, documentaries and dramas,
totaling 75 minutes in three -:ime time slots; fortnightly 20 minute radio
fora and production and broadcasting of two daily and two fortnightly TV
programs in prime time, totaling 240 minutes viewing time per month.
3.60      IEM Unit of MOHPC.  The project will fund 12 audiovisual vans; 15
person-months of local consultancies in supervision and production of
communications materials; orientation workshops for community leaders;
communications materials production; exhibitions; research and evaluation;
salaries of 3 planning and evaluation officers, 16 district-level
communication officers, 32 audiovisual van personnel and 8 production
technicians; and the operating costs for field-based motivational
programs.   A total of 200 folk media teams will be deployed during the
project period, at a rate of 50 during each of the first four years of
implementation. Twcr years after initial implementation, the effectiveness
of using Health Education Officers and the folk media teams for IEM
activities will be evaluated by IDA and GOB and adjusted if necessary. The
output of the Unit is expected to be a total of 17,780 film shows by
audiovisual units; 306,000 folk song performances by upazila teams; 2,100
rural motivational meetings; orientation workshops for 15,775 religious
leaders, 13,925 upazila council chairmen and workers, and 45,000 union
youth leaders; 2,100 late marriage campaigns by community leaders and youth
leaders; and 13,500 fortnightly ward-level radio fora.
3.61      Health Education Bureau (HEB) of MOHPC.  The project will finance
the salaries of 8 staff; 9 person-months of expatriate technical assistance
in the design of health education campaigns; and operating costs for
communications workshops and materials development and production. The
expected outputs are health education workshops for health workers,
community leaders and volunteers.
3.62      Swanirvar Movement.  The project will finance one four-wheel
drive vehicle, one microbus and two motorcycles, audio visual and office
equipment and furniture; salaries of 50 staff; operating costs for training
and workshops for Swanirvar leaders and members; and development and
production of training and educational materials and community surveys and
awards. The expected outputs are orientation workshops for 200,000
Swanirvar leaders at national, district, upazila and union levels on
population awareness and family planning motivation; motivation training of
700,000 Swanirvar members; and motivational awards to selected communities.

Women 's Programs
3.63      The project would further strengthen the three women's programs
supported under the two earlier IDA and cofinancier-aided population and
health projects to help generate additional demand for smaller famllies by
raising women's status and incomes. All three have achieved comparable
rates of contraceptive acceptance but somewhat different income increases
from beneficiaries (see para. 2.60). The Third Project would seek to
maximize the economic potential of these programs. With anticipated
savings under the Second Project (para 2.69), CIDA is financing marketing
studies, for which terms of reference have been drafted, to identify what
products the mothers' centers and women's vocational training
sub-compunents should produce, the best mix of local and foreign markets
and the organizational framework for that marketing. Those studies are
expected to be completed by December 31, 1985. CIUA also is financing two
other initiatives for the programs. One is work on the development of a
management information system, with common formats and criteria to allow
comparison of the current status of the women's programs and their progress
over the course of the project. The other is development of a management
training course for headquarters staff of the three programs by the
Institute of International Management at the University of Dhaka. These
two initiatives are already under way. The Institute would continue to
develop management programs for various levels of staff over the course of
the project. By March 31, 1986, a special GOB-IDA-cofinancier team
consisting of a small industries specialist, a financial analyst and a
behavioral scientist will: (a) review baseline data on women's Incomes and
savings; (b) analyse the proposed strategy, design and detailed plan of
operations for each program to determine the feasibility of reaching Its
stated objectives; (c) justify the proposed size and mix of production and
training activities for each program in terms of (i) the comparative
cost-effectiveness of each approach to generating women's Incomes, and (tl)
links between each program and FP/MCH services to promote maximum family
planning benefits among participants; (d) set up appropriate criteria and
mechanisms for review of progress, identification and analysis of problems
and redesign of the scope and strategy of each subcomponent; and (e)
develop proposals to Institutionalize these programs by transferring them
to the revenue budget by July 1, 1990. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that the Government wlll prepare a detailed strategy, program
design, budget and plan of operation satisfactory to IDA for each of the
three women's programs not later than June 30, 1986 (para 7.01h). The
component will be supervised by CIDA, which will finance these three
programs under the project, through one full-time Canadian and two
full-time Bangladeshi specialists in Dhaka.
3.64      The project also would increase FP/HCH benefits to partlclpating
women through special efforts to target services direct to groups of
beneficiaries. These would involve development of a system of regularly
scheduled and maintained visits to cooperatives, MCs and production centers
by MOHPC field workers, particularly FWAs and FWVs, which would be included
in the strategy, program design and plan of operation for the three
programs.

existing trainee will be expected to recruit one new acceptor quarterly,
which a number of trainees already do.
3.73      Thw first two years of the project will be used to consolidate
and tmprove the axisting program rather than to expand coverage. Sales
centers will be uet up In each of the 20 upazilas where the program now
operates.  Retraining for mix weeks of around 224 trade instructors for the
oxisting I0U production centers will take place in accordance with survey
results.  Around 4,OUU women then will be retrained for 75 days, while
4,000 will recoive 150 days initial training in trades including weaving
and g4rmwnt-aaking which are known to be profitable in rural Bangladesh.
Trainees would receive a stipand of USS0.31 per day. Additionally, each
production unit would recevlv  need capital of US$770 (garment-making) or
USU2b9 (weaving) to buy trade equipment and Initial supplies of raw
materials. Arrangnmentm also will be pursued with the Sonall Bank for
trainees to have acceOs Lo credit. The program will expand during the last
three years to 10 additional upazilas. Each will receive a sales center,
four union-level production centers and a day-care center for children of
all women wlho receive vocational training. A final evaluation of the
program's Income and tamily planning impact will take place in the last
project year. In addition to the above costs, the project will finance
vehicles. furniture, And equipment; continued staff training; short-term
local consultancies in such areas as poultry-raising, weaving and garment
design; staff salaries and allowances; and program operating costs.
Non-Government Organizations and Innovative Programs
3.74      The project will provide US$4 million equivalent base costs for
population-related activities of voluntary agencies through both Government
grants and direct ODA support to NGOs. The bulk of these resources will be
made avallable to active and well-established Bangladeshi NGOs, recognized
by the Government, to expand and inten-ify FP/MCH activities either within
their existing structure or by setting up branch organizations in rural
areas. The project will also finance an NGO technical support unit
throughout the project period, which will include the salaries of two
program officers and support staff, one vehicle, furniture and equipment,
and the operating costs of the unit. The fourteen-fold increase over funds
disbursed in the Second Project is particularly to encourage NGO work in
rural areas. This emphasis is consistent with the recognized importance of
voluntary efforLs to the achievement of national population goals (para.
2.84).  The GOB anticipate.   major role for NGOs in providing injectable
contraceptives tan a homr visit basis (para. 2.88), since ICDDRB has
successfully Implemented a door-to-door approach. In additio!t to working
with vfluntAry agencies, the Government intends to experiment with SMP
marketing of injectables and ORS on a commercial basis. NGOs also would be
encouraged to promote other forms of contraception and to expand their MCH
work as well.
3.75      hlowever, a recent evaluation by the EEU suggests that
considerable improvement in the Subvention Committee mechanism is needed
for it to chanewl resources effectively to NGOs.  The main problems are
lack of clear objectives, operational procedures, grant selection criteria
and support staff, and the need to broaden NGO repreeentation on the
Coilttee. Therefore, under the project the GOB will set up a unit of at
least two professiDnals under the MOHPC Deputy Secretary to act as a



- 53 -
Secretariat to the Committee. The Secretariat will review NGO grant
requests and speed their processing through the Subvpntion Committee
(para. 2.39) and monitor NGO performance. The Govert;ment also will expand
the Subvention Committee to include representatives of at least two more
major NGOs and will modify Committee operating procedures to promote more
efficient processing of grant application. These changes will permit the
Government to disband its existing technical committee, consisting of
Government officials and NGO representatives, which now carries out initial
screening of voluntary agency grant requests for the Subvention Committee.
The combination of encouraging NGOs to work in rural areas and improved
ability to review and process their requests more efficiently will make it
possible to disburse the full amount proposed by 1990.
3.76      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that not later than June
30, 1986, the Government will prepare and furnish to IDA for review and
commpnt a strategy for the utilization of NGOs in the population/MCH
program during the project period. The strategy will include criteria for
determining NGO eligibility and the types of NGO projects suitable for
support by the Government, and procedures for processing, monitoring and
evaluating proposals and projects (para. 7.01i).
3.77      Innovative Programs.  The GOB will seek new approaches in three
key areas through this subcomponent. First, the project will finance
experimental measures to generate additional demand for family planning.
Interventions might include savings bond programs for families who limit
their numbers of children and bonuses for delayed marriages, longer birth
intervals and continuation rather than only initial adoption of
contraception.
3.78      Second, the project will finance two linked types of analyses
essential to MCH/health sector development. One will be a financial
analysis of the health sector described more fully in para. 4.11. The
other will be epidemiological studies, focusing initially on the burden of
infant and child diseases, to help prioritize health care needs and match
these requirements against current health funding and expenditure
patterns.
3.79      The third area also involves further development of the national
MCH strategy. The project will finance development and pilot-testing of a
district-based nutrition intervention program for pre-school children
and, if feasible pregnant women, to be developed in close collaboration
with the World Food Program (para. 3.57). Additionally, funds from the
will be used to design and test out the family planning/MCH impact of
providing field workers with a limited package of simple remedies for
common disorders such as scabies and eye inflammations. Funds also will be
included to prepare a fourth phase of donor assistance to the national
population/MCH program which would incorporate the lessons of these tests.
3.80      A condition of disbursement against innovative programs
estimated to cost more than US$25,000 equivalent will be the furnishing of
proposals satisfactory to IDA (see para. 7.03b).
Research and Evaluation



- 54 -
3.81      Management Information System (MIS).  As the main source of
performance data, the MIS will be strengthened to improve its contribution
to project management, particularly at the upazila level and below. MIS
reform will have two major objectives (i) to promote more realistic local
target-setting for contraception and MCH performance and (ii) to develop
more effective reporting instruments to monitor both worker performance and
availability and the use of inputs within the upazila. A major step to
achieve this objective is MIS completion of work now underway to develop,
test and inaugurate a household register in each ward. Maintained by field
staff, the register would provide age parity for target-setting, reliable
information on contraceptive adoption and continuation, and information on
supplies and worker coverage. Data from the registers would be aggregated
(i) at the union and upazila levels for use by supervisors in setting work
priorities for field staff and (ii) at district and national levels for
overall monitoring and the development of decentralized upazila family
planning and MCH targets and, eventually, strategies to achieve them based
on local age/parity characteristics and family planning acceptance and MCH
performance levels. During the project, the Government would move toward a
system of target-setting at the upazila level through consultation with
MIS officials, the district Civil Surgeon and Deputy Director of Family
Planning the UHFPO and the FPO, which in turn would base their
recommendations on consultation with field supervisors and staff. These
changes would be phased in after testing, and introduced with training
support from NIPORT and through fortnightly field staff meetings. In
regard to MCH performance input data, MIS will work closely with the MCH
coordinating committee (para 3.44) to determine what MCi{ data should be
collected, how often, by whom and for what purpose. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that a work plan satisfactory to IDA for the
incorporation of MCH service statistics into the MIS reporting system will
be prepared and put into operation not later than December 31, 1986
(para. 7.01j).
3.82      For MIS, the project will finance one four-wheel drive vehicle
and one microbus; office furniture, equipment and supplies; twelve months
of short-term foreign technical assistance; and staff salaries and
operating costs.
3.83      External Evaluation Unit (EEU).  EEU's work program for the next
five years involves 24 identified studies divided according to priority
into six groups. Top priority will go to studies of the training programs
for different categories of field staff and an evaluation of the Social
Marketing Project. Second priority will be a study of UHFWC functioning,
focusing on effectiveness, quality of care and utilization. Third priority
will be re-evaluations of the three women's programs, the national
sterilization program and qualitative review of the service delivery system
as a whole. All of the higher-priority evaluations are expected to be
carried out in-house; the EEU has access to sufficient survey workers and
investigators for that purpose. Lower-priority studies are expected to be
contracted out to local universities or other competent institutions or
organizations.
3.84      The Third Project will provide short-term overseas training for
two EEU staff members during each of the project's first three years.
Additionally, it is anticipated that the GOB will release one long-term
Colombo Plan fellowship annually for an EEU staff member to undertake an



- 55 -
academic year of post-graduate work abroad in such fields as research
methodology or population studies. The addition of a second deputy chief
and one more assistant chief for computer applications, accompanied by a
reduction in tine number of research investigator posts, also will improve
staff supervision and the quality of work output. To assist in the
technical design of the studies, thirty months of short-term foreign
technical assistance is included. In addition to the costs of expatriate
technical assistance, the project will finance the costs of
overseas and in-house training for EEU staff; two sedans and three
microbuses for field work; costs for those studies which EEU would contract
out; seminars and workshops; staff salaries; and operating costs.
3.85      The National Steering Committee for Population Research (NSCPR)
will be set up under the Third Plan as a national mechanism to set
priorities for and encourage and support population-related research.
The NSCPR also will promote both dissemination of research findings and
closer coordination among agencies involved in population research and
evaluation. The committee will be chaired by the MOHPC Secretary. Other
members will include at least three noted academicians in such fields as
demography, sociology and nutrition, and representatives from other
relevant agencies or institutions.
3.86      The Research Wing of NIPORT will act as Secretariat to the
NSCPR. The Research Wing will screen research proposals furnished for
NSCPR funding, and will monitor the progress of projects approved by NSCPR
from the initial US$140,000 research fund which the project will finance.
Additionally, the Research Wing will contract locally for national
contraceptive prevalence surveys to be carried out in the first, third and
final project years. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the
Government will operate and maintain the NSCPR during the project period
and that contracts for biennial national contraceptive prevalence surveys
will be based on terms of reference satisfactory to IDA (para. 7.01k).
3.87      For NIPORT's Research Wing, the project will finance a microbus;
office furniture and equipment; funds for research; preparation of research
proposals and special studies; staff salaries; local consultants; and
operating costs.
Project Management Support
3.88      Continued support will be provided to the Project Finance Cell
(PFC) in the MOHPC/PCW and to a small procurement unit to be set up under
the DG/PCJ to handle all MOHPC procurement under the project.  The
Population Program Office in the Resident Bank Mission, Dhaka, also will be
maintained during the project period.
3.89      Project Finance Cell (PFC).  The PFC has operated under the first
two projects to facilitate and help regulate the flow of foreign aid. The
PFC has eight professional staff who process reimbursement claims for
externally-aided population projects. It monitors disbursements,
reimbursements and utilization of project funds, maintains central records
of project accounts and conducts audits and inspections of expenditures
against donor-aided population and health projects. PFC performance of
these functions has improved substantially during the Second Project.



- 56 -
3.90      Procurement Unit.  MOHPC has received authority to procure
dirpctly instead of ordering through the Directorate of Supplies. This
will minimize delay, since the Directorate purchases for many ministries
and departments. The project will support the establishment and operation
of a procurement unit consisting of two pcofessionals and support staff
within the office of the DG/PCW.
3.91      Population Program Office.  This office has operated since 1976
in the Bank's Resident Mission, Dhaka, to monitor, report on and assist t-he
GOB to find prompt solutions to issues concerning population and health.
The office provides a mechanism to promote a cohesive, consistent donor
dialogue with the GOB on the national population and family health program
and has been staffed until now by one senior expatriate and one Bangladeshi
professional. Because of the increased prominence of MCH care in the
national program, the office will expand to include an expatriate MCH
specialist as well, who will be fully funded by the other cofinanciers to
maintain close contact with the GOB, UNICEF, UNFPA and other donors on MCH
policy and program development and implementation.
3.92      Funds under this component will fund vehicles; salaries;
equipment and supplies; and operating costs of the Population Program
Office, the PCW and the procurement unit.
IV. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING AND PROCUREMENT
A. Project Costs
4.01      Total project costs are estimated at US$213.8 million equivalent
including contingencies, local taxes and duties. Base costs, calculated in
May, 1985 prices are US$188.2 million (88% of total project costs). Duties
and taxes account for US$14.6 million, 7% of total project costs. Foreign
exchange costs of US$67.4 million amount to 32% of total project costs.
4.02      Project costs by expenditure category are summarized below in
Table 4.1 and detailed in Annex 7, Table a. Salary costs are based on the
GOB pay and allowance scale prevailing at appraisal. Base costs of drugs,
medicines, maternal and child health supplies and other medical and
surgical requisites account for an estimated US$44.8 million equivalent, or
24% of estimated base costs. Base costs of vehicles,
equipment, furniture and civil works account for an estimated US$46.5
million equivalent, or 25% of estimated base costs. Training accounts for
10% of estimated base costs. Foreign and local technical assistance
totaling 714 and 1103 man-months, respectively, (see Annex 8) represents 3%
of estimated base costs. Recurrent base costs are US$59.4 million
equivalent and account for 32% of base costs, with the largest proportion

B. Financing
4.06      Total project costs of US$213.8 million will be financed by an
IDA credit of SDR75.4 (US$78.0 million equivalent), six cofinancing
agencies (US$99.4 million equivalent) and the GOB. The cofinanciers are
Australia, Canada, The Federal Republic of Germany, The Netherlands, Norway
and IDA, all of whom participated in the second project, and one new donor,
the United Kingdom. However, donors have made it clear that their
continued participation in the project will be based on satisfactory
resronses from the GOB concerning family planning incentives and
disincentives, as well as its commitment to MCH and to absorb a
substantially increased share of recurrent costs of the population and MCH
program at the end of the project. UNICEF does not wish to be designated
as a formal cofinancing agency. However, its support is assured through
US$9.7 million equivalent to support a large share of the MCH component
under financing arrangements outside the project. IDA, as the donor of
last resort, wi'l finance those components or expenditure categories not
selected by other donors. However, formal cofinancing arrangements still
remain to be completed. A condition of credit effectiveness will be
signing of bilateral agreements satisfactory to the Association for the
Government to obtain external assistance amounting to not less than
US$109.1 million equivalent to carry out the project and the national MCH
program (para. 7.02).
4.07      The IDA credit would finance 39% of total project costs net of
duties and taxes. Repayment would be over 50 years with a ten-year grace
period. The IDA credit includes US$48.3 million in local cost financing,
justified on country grounds, for UHFWC construction and furniture (US$27.2
million equivalent), medical and surgical requisites (US$15.5 million
equivalent), innovative programs (US$5 million equivalent), contraceptive
prevalence surveys (US$0.4 million equivalent) and the supervision
directorate (US$0.2 million equivalent). If all prospective cofinanciers
take part at anticipated levels, the Federal Republic of Germany will
finance 13.4Z of total project costs; Canada, 11.0%; Norway 11.0%; the
United Kingdom, 4.8%; Australia, 3.3%; and the Netherlands 2.9%. A
proposed donor financing plan illustrating financing by functional
component and various expenditure categories appears in Table 4.4. The
Federal Republic of Germany is likely to establish separate financing
arrangements with the Government but project funds from all additional
donors besides IDA will be placed into trust funds to be administered by
IDA. As in the Second Project, donors will share the cost of a
professional population expert and a program officer located in the
Resident Bank Mission, Bangladesh, who will assume responsibility for
monitoring the project and assisting the Government in project
implementation. An MCH expert funded by the other cofinanciers also will
be added to that team. The Government of Bangladesh will finance the
remaining US$36.5 million equivalent, including duties and taxes.
4.08      The estimated annual recurrent base costs of the project
are shown in Table 4.5, as compared to the estimated recurrent budget of
the MOHPC in real terms. Included in project recurrent base costs are
drugs, MCH kits, medical and surgical requisites, NIPORT operating costs,
and the recurrent costs of the project. (Given the project's health



- 60 -
content, the appropria-e denominator is the total MOHPC recurrent budget,
not just that of the population wing.) The recurrent budget estimate in
Table 4.5 is not based on the Revenue budget figure, but a larger estimate
which attempts to take account of significant recurrent expenditure
normally included in the Development budget. The figures derive from the
best existing estimates of recurrent expenditure in 1984-85 and are
projected over the project period to rise by 5% yearly in real terms. This
rate of growth in real MOHPC recurrent expenditures appears to be realistic
for the third Plan period, given that real health expenditures, capital
plus recurrent, have grown at an average of 4.75% p.a. over the past 5
years, and given GOB's intention to give priority to key expenditures on
operation and maintenance in future budget allocations.

4.09      Recurrent expenditure under the proposed project will make up 19%
of the MOHPC recurrent budget in the first project year and 20% in the
last. These substantial percentages reflect the fact that the project is
in effect financing a time slice of the national population and MCH
program. However, only around half of the Tk. 636 million of project
recurrent costs in the final year of the project, will be incremental as a
result of the Third Project. The main elements of incremental
recurrentcosts are field staff salaries and allowances, drugs and medical
and surgical supplies and maintenance and running costs for buildings and
vehicles. About half of the annual recurrent base costs to be financed
under the project will be continuing essential expenditures financed by
foreign donors under the Second Plan. The main items are drugs and,
supplies (50%), FWA salaries (25%) and the recurrent costs of NIPORT and
its associated training institutions (7%). On the basis of current trends
in health finance availability, it is unlikely that GOB would be able to
absorb these costs fully in 1990 in addition to incremental recurrent costs
arising from the Third Project. Moreover, there is a danger that
dependency on foreign aid in the sector may increase after the Third Plan,
as better utilization of rural facilities for MCH further increases the
demand for drugs.
4.10      The project's strategy to avoid increased dependence on foreign
aid, and if possible to reduce it, is to provide for GOB's absorption of
selected costs at the end of the project, and to seek cost recovery so as
to further increase GOB's financing capacity during the fourth plan
period. The Government already has stated its intention to incorporate
essential local recurring costs of the population and MCH program into the
revenue budget from July, 1990, particularly the salaries and allowances of



- 61 -
all full-time family planning field staff and the operating costs of
UHFWCs, MCWCs and all training facilities. However, the project is
designed on the principle that GOB should absorb at the end of the project
period the local recurrent costs of those project activities that are
critical to institutionalize, whether these costs are incremental or
continuing. Those consist of salaries of FWAs, senior FWVs and the
supervision directorate; incremental FTA/TA; MOHPC building and vehicle
operation and maintenance, MCH, training and research and evaluation
costs. Their recurrent base costs would be approximately Tk360 million in
1989/90, a sum which is approximately equal to the incremental recurrent
base costs of the project. That sum also represents about 54% of the
incremental real recurrent budget likely to be available to MOHPC in 1990,
on the basis of a 5% per annum real growth rate. This level of cost
absorption is therefore likely to be affordable.
4.11      With regard to cost recovery, the project provides for six
man-months each of foreign and local technical assistance to be financed
from the innovative programs subcomponent to carry out a financial sector
analysis and study which would, inter alia, separate MOHPC budget
allocations and expenditures into investment and recurrent cost categories;
analyse the recurrent cost implications of the MOHPC investment plan,
including the health plan still to be finalized; review the distribution of
expenditures between different tiers and types of service and make
recommendations for reallocation of expenditure where this would increase
cost-effectiveness; and review the potential for cost recovery through user
charges for different services, taking into account issues of equity,
efficiency and willingness to pay. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations a) that a financial study of the health sector, with terms of
reference and by consultants whose qualifications and experience are
satisfactory to IDA will be completed by the Government by March 31, 1987;
b) that the Government will furnish IDA with the findings and
recommendations of the study, and c) that the Government will thereafter
implement recommendations of the study on which it and IDA agree (para.
7.011).
4.12      Program Costs FY1985-86 and FY1989-90.  Total recurrent costs of
the population and MCH program would amount to around Tk2,096 million in
1985-86 and around Tk 3,614 million in 1989-90, in current prices. As
detailed in Annex 9, these costs include major non-project inputs such as
salaries and allowances of other MOHPC field staff; contraceptives;
compensation/referral payments; other foreign-aided activities (e.g. BAVS
and SMP overheads and UNFPA activities); operating costs of MCH Units at
UHCs, RDs, UHFWCs outside the Third project, unions without UHFWCs and the
64 DD/FP offices; and half the salary and operating costs of the 64
district Civil Surgeon (CS) offices.
4.13      Total recurrent costs of the GOB's combined population/MCH/
primary health care program in 1985-86 are estimated at Tk 2,647 million
and at Tk 4,579 million in 1989-90 in current prices. They were
constructed by adding to the calculations in para. 4.12 the salary and
operating costs (including a projected doubling of DDS kits) of the 400
UHCs expected to be operational in 1989-90 and the remaining half of CS
Office costs. As shown in Table 4.6 below, recurrent costs of the
population/MCH Program are expected to absorb around 2.8% of the projected



- 62 -
1985-86 national budget (ADP and revenue combined) and a slightly reduced
share in 1989-90. The ratio is similar for the combined population/MCH/
primary health care program.
4.14      The table includes recurrent cost projections against projected
MOHPC budgets for 1989-90. Two assumptions were used: continued real
growth of the MOHPC budget at 5% yearly, and MOHPC retention of Its present
5.9% share of the national budget. Against a 5% real growth scenario, the
1989-90 MOHPC budget would rise to around Tk. 7369 million. If MOHPC
retained a constant 5.9% budget share, its 1989-90 budget would be around
Tk. 8076 million. Against either scenario, the projected rate of growth of
the MOHPC budget would keep recurrent costs close to their present share of
the Ministry's resources.

4.15      Direct foreign exchange mainly for drugs, medicines, related
supplies and contraceptives accounts for around one-sixth of the recurrent
costs of the population/MCH or the combined population/MCH/primary health
care program in 1985-86 and around one-fifth of the projected recurrent
costs of either program in 1989-90. If external aid were limited after
1989-90 to the direct foreign costs of drugs, medicines, supplies and
contraceptives against a 5% annual growth scenario the GOB share of funding
would be around 38% of the projected MOHPC budget in that year for the
population and MCH program and 49% for the combined population/MCH/primary
health care program in 1985-86 and around one-fifth of the projected
recurrent costs of either program in 1989-90. If external aid were limited
after 1989-90 to the direct foreign costs of drugs, medicines, supplies and
contraceptives against a 5% annual growth scenario the GOB share of funding
would be around 38% of the projected HOHPC budget in that year for the

- 65 -
4.17      Construction, renovation, and furnishing of 1,073 UHFWCs (US$45.1
million) will take place through local competitive bidding since the sites
are too numerous and dispersed for international competitive bidding. CMC
has met up satisfactory criteria for prequalifying contractors and will be
responsible for review and award of all bids. The Federal Republic of
Cermany will finance construction of the extension to NIPORT's building
(US$235,000) under parallel financing arrangements.
4.18      Equipmeatt and other furniLure (US$2.5 million), vehicles (US$8.3
million), and medical and eurgical equipment and supplies (US$17.9
million), will be procured through ICB in accordance with IDA guidelines,
unless Individual cofinanciers require other arrangements, involving
parallel financing, in respect of their disbursements. Under ICB, domestic
manufacturers will receive a margin of preference equal to 15% af the CIF
bid price of imported goods or the actual customs duties and import taxes,
whichever Is less. Contracts for furniture, equipment, vehicles and
supplies will be grouped insofar as possible in packages valued at a
minimum of US$100,000. Those which cannot reasonably be so grouped will be
awarded through LCH under approved GOB procurement procedures, which are
satisfactory to IDA.
4.19      Drug and dietary supplement kits (US$34.2 million) and other MCH
kits (US$279,000) will continue to be procured insofar as feasible through
UNICEF, as in the Second Project. Otherwise they will be procured through
ICB unless cofinanciers require other procedures under parallel financing
arrangements. Shoulder bags and umbrellas for FWAs (US$201,000) will be
procured over four years through local competitive bidding.
4.20      Equipment, furniture, vehicles and supplies valued at US$20,000
or less, except for UHFWC furniture, may be procured through prudent
shopping with at least three price quotitions, subject to a $200,000
ceiling on the sum of these contracts during the project period.
4.21      Consulting services, including surveys and studies (US$9.0
million) will be procured in accordance with procedures of cofinancing
agencies or IDA guidelines printed in June 1984 as applicable. The average
man-month cost of foreign consultants is around US$6,000 and for Bangladesh
consultants US$630.
4.22      Each IDA-financed contract over US$100,000 will be subject to
prior IDA review. This will cover around 30% of works and about 70% of the
total value of furniture and equipment, vehicles and medical and surgical
equipment and supplies, net of duties and taxes.
D. Disbursements
4.23      Funds from the IDA credit and any other funds which IDA may be
authorised to disburse on behalf of other donors will be disbursed on the
basis of satisfactory documentation submitted by the Project Finance
Office. Normal documents required by the Association will be submitted for
all items of expenditure except for innovative programs, the Supervision
Directorate and payments under small civil works contracts which will be
made against certified statements of expenditure, the documentation of
which will not be submitted for review, but will be retained by the GOB and



- 66 -
available for inspection by the Association during the course of project
supervision. The schedule of estimated disbursements appears in Annex 10.
It is based on the phasing and programming of project activities adjusted
by comparison with Bank-wide disbursement profiles for the sector, for
Bangladesh and for the First and Second Population Projects. However, the
disbursement period is shorter than the Bangladesh or sector profile.
Final disbursements of this credit would be made by March 31, 1992. The
main procurement items are construction and equipping of UHFWCs, which
should be completed within the first four project years, and ICB
procurement of medical and surgical equipment and supplies, which will take
place on a routine annual bqsis. UHFWC development is expected to proceed
largely as scheduled since problems which previously delayed implementation
under the Secc.ad 'roject will be addressed in the Third Project (paras.
3.32 and 3.33). Moreover, the construction program involves simpler
facilities than in the Second Project (para. 2.49), which should reduce
possible delays. All IDA-funded vehicles are to be procured within the
first two project years. Therefore, the disbursement period has been
estimated at seven years.
4.24      Disbursements against the IDA credit will be as follows:
(a) UHFWC construction upgrading and furniture costs (US$41.2
million)
(b) Medical and surgical equipment and supplies (US$15.5 million);
Ci)   directly imported-100% of foreign expenditures;
(ii)  locally manufactured-100X of local expenditures,
ex-factory; and
Ciii) locally procured (off-the-shelf)--65Z of local
expenditures;
(c) Drug and dietary supplement kits (US$11.6 million);
(i)   directly imported-100Z of foreign expenditures;
(ii)  locally maauufactured-100l   of local expenditures,
ex-factory;
(iii) locally procured (off-the-shelf)--65X of local
expenditures;
(d) Innovative programs (US$5.0 million);
(e) Vehicles and bicycles for: MOHPC service delivery including
Maternal and Child Health care and the Clinical Contraceptive
Surveillance and Management Services Development Teams;
Communications; Managenent Information Systems; the External
Evaluation Unit; Construction Management Cell, NIPORT Research
Wing, NGO Technical Support Unit and the Project Finance Cell
(US$4.1 million).



- 67 -
(i) directly imported--100Z of foreign expenditures;
(ii) locally manufactured--100l of local expenditures,
ex-factory;
(iii) locally procured-65X of local expenditures;
(f) Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys in the first, third and fifth
project years (US$0.42 million);
(g) Supervision Directorate costs (US$0.15 million).
E. Special Account
4.25      To facilitate project implementation and ensure that adequate
funds are available for project expenditures, the Government will establish
and open a project special account in a commercial bank under procedures
satisfactory to the Association. The special account will be in U.S.
dollars and will cover project components and cost categories associated
with IDA financing. The initial deposit to be made by the Association into
the account will be US$3.9 million, to cover four months' average
expenditures of IDA-financed items and will be replenished monthly. The
account will -e operated by the Secretary, Ministry of Health and
Population Control, or his authorized designee. The special account will
be audited in accordance with IDA standard requirements. Cofinanciers
establishing separate financing arrangements with the Government (para.
4.08) will be asked to adopt similar procedures in regard to their
assistance to the project.
V. ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT, ANNUAL REVIEWS, ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS.
A.   Organization and Management
5.01      The Project will be carried out over a five-year period beginning
in February, 1986 under most of the existing implementation arrangements
under the Second Project. Charts of key implementation activities are in
Annex 11. The MOHPC will be responsible for management of project-funded
service delivery activities, including training, and is adequately staffed
for this purpose. The Office of the DG, PCW, will be responsible for
assigning, and supervising project-funded FWAs, FWVs, PCW Medical Officers,
the Supervision Directorate, the Clinical Contraception Surveillance Team
and the Management Development Unit. The DG's logistics staff and
procurement unit will be responsible for procurement, distribution and
control of all project-financed vehicles, drugs, equipment and supplies for
the MCH and family planning program. Expatriate advisors from UNFPA, CIDA
and USAID (para. 3.29) would assist in logistics implementation.
Project-financed training for MOHPC staff would be organized and managed by
NIPORT, which also is headed by a DG. Three full-time expatriate advisors
(para. 3.22) would assist the DG with implementation.
5.02      The directors of the immunization, TBA training and diarrheal
mana-2ment programs will have direct responsibility for management of their
respective programs. Oversight will take place jointly by the MOHPC Health
and Population Control Wings through a coordinating committee (para. 3.44)
chaired by the Secretary, MOHPC. Committee membership includes the MOHPC



- - 68 -
DGs of both Health and Population Control; the Directors of each of the
three MCH Programs and Public Health Nutrition, the directors of primary
health care and MCH services and representatives of the health and
population sections of the Planning Commission and NGOs active in MCH. The
Committee will meet monthly. Its principal responsibilities are to: (a)
refine and monitor implementation of the national MCH strategy; (b) design
and monitor performance of an integrated MCH plan of operations (c) set up
and monitor technical and administrative norms for MCH care and (d) define
MCH data needs and assist in designing and implementing a reportipg system
for coordinated data collection analysis and feedback.
5.03      The UHFWC construction program will continue to be managed by the
CMC, which also will play an important part in the UHFWC maintenance
program. C1C's staff has been strengthened to carry out its increased
responsibilities (para. 3.33). CHC also has a long-term expatriate advisor
on the UHFWC program funded through bilateral Norwegian aid. The CMC
director reports direct to the MOHPC Secretary.
5.04      Family Planning Communications activities under the project will
be organized and managed by the IEM Unit of MOHPC, headed by a Director
reporting to the DG/PCW. The HEB will manage and implement campaigns
promoting immunization and home-based diarrheal management.
5.05      The Innovative Programs subcomponent will be managed within the
office of the Secretary, MOHPC. He will chair a committee to be set up to
review and approve funding proposals for these programs. Committee members
will include representatives of the Health and Population Control Wings,
the Health and Population Sections of the Planning Commission, and the
External Resources Division, Ministry of Finance. The committee will
organize a panel of Bangladeshi advisors to provide technical expertise as
required for review of funding proposals. A Deputy Secretary, MOHPC, will
act as Secretariat to the committee in addition to his other duties.
5.06      The MIS is organized and managed by a director and staff under
the Director-General, PCW to promote use of MIS data in management
decision-making. The MOHPC PFC will continue under the Third Project to
prepare withdrawal applications, keep project accounts and carry out
routine audits. The PFC is adequately staffed for this purpose and its
performance has improved substantially over the past two years.
5.07      Women's programs under the project will be organized and managed
as follows: (a) Women's Cooperatives - the Joint Director, BRDB of the
Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development will be responsible for
this subcomponent; (b) Mothers Centers - the Additional Director, Office of
the Director General, Social Welfare, Ministry of Social Welfare (DG/SW)
will be in charge; (c) Women's Vocational Training - the Additional
Director, Office of the Director, Women's Affairs, Ministry of Social
Welfare and Women's Affairs will manage the program. Coordination among
the women's programs and with MOHPC will take place initially through the
continued operation of an inter-ministerial committee headed by the
Secretary, MOHPC, and the Deputy Secretary (Coordination) in PCW, but
longer-term linkages among the programs and with HOHPC remain to be worked
out (para. 3.63).

5.08      Evaluation activities will be organized and managed by the
EEUwhich reports to the Population Program section of the Planning
Commission.
B. Annual Reviews
5.09      Because of the size and scope of the project and its central role
in the GOB's Third Five Year Plan for Population Control, annual GOB-
IDA-Cofinancier progress reviews will take place every December or
January.  The reviews will assess the qualitative and quantitative
performance of the program as a whole and of each major project activity,
including service delivery, training, supervision and logistics; coverage
under the MCH program; communications and women's programs; operation of
the GOB "incentive" system for workers and clients; and construction,
utilization and maintenance of facilities.
5.10      Each annual review also will include assessment of the following
factors which affect the project's demographic impact: maintenance of an
effective contraceptive method mix; promotion of higher continuation rates
and use-effectiveness for spacing methods; and increased use of spacing
methods among younger couples. Key management aspects to be reviewed
include: procedures for service delivery; synchronized provision of inputs
within and among components; rate at which newly-built UHFWCs become
operational; and the pace at which referral/service delivery points are set
up in unions without UHFWCs.
5.11       The purposes of the reviews will be to:
1.   Resolve issues impeding project performance;
2.   Review the proposed project budgets and work plans for the next
fiscal year against accomplishments to date and adjust them
accordingly;
3.   Identify areas for operations research or special GOB monitoring;
and
4.   Provide a forum for discussion and agreement on desirable course
corrections or changes in project design which could not be
otherwise anticipated.
5.12      Annual reports will be prepared in a mutually agreeable format by
the Supervision Directorate, the Clinical Contraception Surveillance Team,
the Management Development Unit, NIPORT, the CMC, the communications
component, the evaluation subcomponent, the Management Information System
and the three women's programs and furnished by the Secretary, HOHPC to IDA
and the cofinanciers at least four weeks before each annual review.
Specific terms of reference for each annual review will be worked out among
the cofinanciers, IDA and the Government not later than six months before
the review date. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
Government will, by March 31, 1986, establish an annual review system for
the project, under terms of reference satiszaX'tory to IDA, and jointly with
IDA will undertake progress reviews at the beginning of each calendar year
of project execution (para. 7.01m).



- 70 -
5.13      The Government also will provide IDA and the cofinanciers with an
interim progress report every June 30 on physical and financial
implementation of each project component for the six month period ending
April 30 in a format reflecting the approved budget and work plan for that
fiscal year.
C. Accounts and Audits
5.14      Each participating ministry or other implementing agency will
prepare and maintain project accounts in accordance with sound accounting
practices. The Project Finance Cell will continue to audit local currency
expenditures quarterly and furnish those reports to IDA within mix months
of the completion of the audited quarter. Reimbursement in each succeeding
quarter will be dependent on the availability of the PFC audit for the
quarter ending six months earlier. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that audits   of project accounts by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA will be made available to IDA within nine months of the
close of each fiscal year (see para. 7.01n).
VI. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Benefits
6.01      The project will finance most of the major activities of the
national family planning and MCH program, and thus its benefits cannot be
separated from those of the program as a whole. With regard to population,
the program is intended to raise the contraceptive prevalence rate from a
level of 24-26% in early 1985 to 38-40% by 1990. This appears feasible in
Bangladesh, given the strong GOB coimmitment to population control, the
development of a nationwide human and physical infrastructure for service
delivery, and the substantial unmet demand for family planning which is
known to exist among rural women. In light of the 100Z CPR Increase over
the past six years, a 50% increase in contraceptive prevalence over the
next five years appears reasonable. Achievement of the CPR target of 40%
by 1990 would imply a reduction in the total fertility rate from 5.8 to
4.8, and in the crude birth rate from 39 to 32 per 1,000. This rate of TFR
decrease would be comparable with that achieved by other Asian countries
with strong family planning programs, such as Thailand.
6.02      A strong family planning program, coupled with modest
improvements in socio-economic conditions after 1990, is projected to
result in a likely total of over seven million births averted over the next
15 years (para. 6.03). That scenario also would lead to a population of
183.8 m in 2015, 12% less than the 202.2 m which would result from the slow
decline to replacement fertility in 2025-30 assumed by the standard WDR
projection. While this faster fertility decline would lead to a relatively
small (6Z) decrease in the working age population by 2015, to 118 m as
against 125 m, the burden of dependents on these workers would be much
reduced; the dependency ratio would be 10% lower, at 56 rather than 62.
Public sector investment requirements would fall correspondingly. In the
health sector, assuming a UHFWC for each 20,000 of rural population, the
more rapid fertility decline by 2015 would save Tk 116 s per year In
1984/85 prices, equivalent to the operating coets of 1,075 UHFWCs.



- 71 -
6.03      For illustrative purposes, the number of births likely to be
averted by the project has been calculated to the year 2000 against two
reasonable parameters. One is that contraceptive prevalence without the
project would rise to 30% by 1990 on the basis of present momentum but
stagnate thereafter. The other is that the 40% CPR to be achieved with the
project would remain unchanged through the year 2000. On that basis, the
number of births likely to be averted over the next 15 years as a result of
the project would be around 7.4 million.
6.04      Costs per birth averted also were estimated for illustrative
purposes in the absence of reliable cost-benefit methodologies for the
sector. On the basis of US$213.8 million equivalent in project costs, the
cost per birth averted through the project would be around US$29.
6.05      The MCH program will contribute to an estimated 20% fall in the
IMR from 125 to 100 or less per 1,000 and in the MMR from around 6 to
around 44 per 1,000 by the end of the project. Specifically, the project
will provide tetanus toxoid immunization to 6.6 million women; diphtheria,
pertussis, tetanus, polio and measles immunization to 4.2 mil ion
children; diphtheria/tetanus immunization to an additional 4.7 million
children; and will extend knowledge of the use of ORT to 7.7 million rural
families, or 60% of the total in rural areas. The projected MMR decrease
assumes a total TBA workforce of 54,000 and expected FWV coverage of births
near fixed facilities, as well as rising demand for these services from
their increased availability. To this reduction can be added an
unquantifiable benefit arising from decreased deaths from septic abortion,
a leading cause of maternal mortality, due to increased levels of family
planning, particularly by women otherwise likely to resort to traditional
methods of pregnancy termination. In addition to the estimated 4.7 million
couples who now practice contraception, the project will benefit around 8
million women and 4 million men who would accept family planning during the
project period (see Annex 4). Longer birth intervals resulting from
contraception also will result in healthier mothers and infants. These
health benefits will lead to an increase in the quality of human capital
through improvements in reproductive health and childhood development. In
addition to the direct effects on health status, improvement of the quality
and coverage of basic services can be expected to increase contraceptive
prevalence over the long term, as parents see that more of their children
survive.
B. Risks
6.06      The basic risk is that the Government will fail to meet its
ambitious but achievable fertility reduction and MCH goals under the Third
Plan. Since the project is the cer.terpiece of the Plan, that possible
failure is a project risk. That cisk has two components. One is
feasibility and appropriateness from a technical and managerial
perspective. The other is committment from an administrative and political
point of view.
6.07      From a technical perspective, the relationship between proposed
project inputs and expected outputs is reasonable and should considerably
reduce observed constraints to increased worker productivity, such as



- 72 -
training defictencies, inadequate supervision and lack of drugs and
medicines. Increasing the density of female field workers also will
intensify client coverage to a prospectively satisfactory level. The
project is designed to strengthen field management of che program from the
district down. Job descriptions and work routines for this purpose already
have been developed on the basis of Bangladesh experience and will be
tested and refined in 4-8 districts with help from a special Management
Development Unit (para 3.16). By strengthening management at the
periphery, the project design is also consistent with broader Government
plans to decentralize services and will result in a management structure
which is less vulnerable to the disruptive impact of organizational changes
at the central level.
6.08      Four main foreseeable risks relate to the GOB-s capacity to (i)
improve the management and supervision of service delivery; (ii)
strengthen and expand the national MCH program; (iii) achieve specific
institutional developments in NIPORT and the women-s programs; and (iv)
maintain a stable organizational structure in the MNHPC. With regard to
the first risk, the project is designed to increase the frequency of field
supervision and to refocus supervision on the support and guidance of
workers. These efforts run counter to bureaucratic tradition. Therefore,
strong, continuing support from senior management in MDHPC for the
supervision component of the project in general, and for the Management
Development Unit-s efforts in particular, will be needed if these
initiatives are to succeed.
6.09      With regard to the second risk, development of a national MCH
program will require persistence in the Government-s declared commitment to
give basic health services more emphasis in a program wbich in the past has
concentrated almost exclusively on family planning. The success of the MCH
program will depend on the degree to which field supervisors accept and
reinforce the new balance between services, and the degree to which
Government develops its reward system for MCH as well as family planning
work. The new structure of MOHPC calls for an integrated approach to
service delivery, but this still has to take root in the field. Persistent
efforts to increase cooperation between population and health staff in the
field, for example, through joint training and review meetings, are key
features of the Third Project which need to be implemented if the benefits
of complementarity between health and family planning services are to be
realized.
6.10      With regard to NIPORT and the women-s programs, institutional
development lagged during the Second Plan period; key staff positions in
NIPORT were not filled and there was a high rate of turnover of key
managers in the women-s programs. Success of the institutional development
programs planned for these organizations during the Third Project will
depend on the recruitment and retention of key professional and managerial
staff. Finally, structural changes in the past have been a source of
uncertainty and conflict within the MOHPC, and have proved to be a serious
brake on performance in the field. The concentrated effort needed to
improve management and supervision in the field and to introduce a major
new MCH program will only be possible in the context of the stable
organizational frameworks to which the Government appears committed, and
will be monitored through annual program reviews (para. 5.09-5.12).

VII. ASSURANCES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Assurances were received at negotiations that:
(a)  not later than December 31, 1986, the Government will (i) carry out a
study under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, of the present
system of client compensation, worker referral and service provider
fees, and community and other incentives, including the current and
future need for such payments and options for their modification and
phase out; (ii) provide the findings of the study for IDA comment, and
(iii) take all measures agreed with IDA to improve, modify or

NGO projects suJtable for support by the Government and procedures for
processing, monitoring and evaluating proposals and projects
(para.3.76);
(j)  a work plan satisfactory to IDA for the incorporation of MCR service
statistics into the MIS reporting system will be prepared and put into
operation not later than December 31, 1986 (para. 3.81);



- 74 -
(k)  the Government will operate and maintain the NSCPR during the project
period and that contracts for biennial national contraceptive
prevalence surveys will be based on terms of reference satisfactory to
IDA (para. 3.86);
(1)  a financial study of the health sector, with terms of reference and
by consultants whose qualifications and experience are satisfactory to
IDA, will be completed by the Government by March 31, 1987; that the

the study, and that the Government will thereafter implement
recommendations of the study on which it and IDA agree (para. 4.11);
(m)  the Government will, by March 31, 1986, establish an annual review
system for the project, under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA,
and jointly with IDA shall undertake progress reviews at the beginning
of each calender year of project execution (para.5.12);
(n)  audits of project accounts by independent auditors acceptable to IDA
will be made available to IDA within nine months of the close of each

7.02      The signing of bilateral agreements satisfactory to the Association
for the Government to obtain external assistance amounting to not less than
US$109.1 million equivalent to carry out the project and the national MCH
program will be a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 4.06).
7.03      Conditions of disbursement will be:
(a)  against the costs of DDS Kits,setting up and implementation of a
monitoring system satisfactory to IDA for the distribution and control
of DDS, MCH and IUD kits; MCH supplies; medical and surgical
requisites; and contraceptives (para. 3.29); and
(b)  against Innovative Programs estimated to cost more than US$25,000
equivalent, the furnishing of proposals satisfactory to IDA (para.
3.80).
7.04      Based on the above assurances, the project is suitable for an IDA
credit of SDR75.4 million (US$78 million) equivalent, repayable over 50 years.
