Government's\n            family planning and maternal-child health (MCH) program\n            during the Third Five-Year Plan period (1985-90). In\n            addition, the project would assist efforts to stimulate\n            additional demand for family planning and to extend\n            essential and affordable health care to Bangladesh's\n            rural population. The project, which would continue support\n            to activities begun under the first and second population\n            projects, would consist of seven components: (i) expansion\n            and consolidation of family planning service delivery; (ii)\n            implementation of MCH programs; (iii) strenghtening of\n            communications and public education; (iv) assistance to\n            women's programs; (v) support to non-government\n            organizations and innovative activities; (vi) research and\n            evaluation; (vii) project management support."}, "docdt": "1985-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
