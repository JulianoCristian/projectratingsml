Czech Republic - Structural Adjustment Loan
In order to support the Czechoslovak Government's reform program, the World Bank provided a Structural Adjustment
Loan (SAL) in an amount of US$450 million. The SAL was the first World Bank loan to Czechoslovakia covering the
eighteen-month period starting mid- 1991 to end-1992 and it was part of the response from the international
community to support Czechoslovakia's reforms. This support also included an IMF (International Monetary Fund)
Stand-By Arrangement, as well as financial assistance from the G-24 countries by mid-1991. The World Bank loan was
cofinanced by the Export-Import Bank of Japan in the amount of US$200 million.

The reform program proposed a rapid transition to a market economy and restoration of economic growth. It was based
on policies to achieve rapid macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms. The program aimed at controlling
inflation and maintaining a sustainable balance of payments; reducing the role of Government in order to enhance
economic efficiency; and reforming the tax system. The SAL was designed to support policies in price and trade
liberalization, privatization of state owned enterprises, deregulation and competition.

Following the breakup of the Czech and Slovak Federation the loan was split between the newly established independent
states in order of US$300 million for the Czech Republic and US$150 million for the Slovak Republic.
