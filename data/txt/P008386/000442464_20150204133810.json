This support also\n            included an International Monetary Fund (IMF) stand-by\n            arrangement, as well as financial assistance from the G-24\n            countries by mid-1991. The World Bank loan was co-financed\n            by the Export-Import Bank of Japan in the amount of U.S. 200\n            million dollars. The program aimed at controlling inflation\n            and maintaining a sustainable balance of payments; reducing\n            the role of government in order to enhance economic\n            efficiency; and reforming the tax system.
