{"cdata!": "The Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL)\n            will support the first phase of Czechoslovakia's rapid\n            transition to a market economy. By adjusting to a radically\n            changed external environment and new prices and incentives,\n            the country seeks to restore competitiveness and growth, and\n            achieve higher standards of living. Within a sound\n            medium-term macroeconomic framework, the SAL's\n            principal focus is on fundamental systematic reforms in: (a)\n            ownership and management of enterprises; (b) price and trade\n            liberalization, including active enhancement of competition,\n            and (c) provision of an adequate social safety net for those\n            population segments most adversely affected during the\n            transition process. These reforms are expected to promote\n            private entrepreneurship and improve the allocation of\n            resources. At the same time, the loan will help initiate\n            restructuring of the financial sector, address urgent\n            pricing and regulatory issues in energy, and put in place a\n            basic institutional and policy framework for protecting the environment."}, "docdt": "1991-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
