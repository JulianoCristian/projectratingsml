"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "This is the Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Third Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC\n            III) in Burundi. Project objectives were largely unachieved.\n            Notwithstanding some initial progress, actions slated to be\n            accomplished by end-1993 -- which embodied the heart of the\n            reform -- remained mostly incomplete at the end of June 1995\n            when the outstanding balance of the second tranche of the\n            credit was canceled. Of the three areas targeted, only the\n            private sector development component realized some success.\n            The largely unfinished agenda of SAC IH attests to its\n            unsatisfactory outcome. The PE sector was barely reduced;\n            most large PEs continue to perform poorly. Public\n            expenditure (PE) programming instruments are yet to be\n            internalized, integrated into the budget process, and\n            adhered to in practice. Sectoral PEP units have practically\n            ceased to function, while the management of budget\n            allocations still lacks transparency. No steps were taken\n            towards allocating expenditures for core developmental needs\n            or a social safety net; fiscal reform, in particular the\n            reduction of import tariffs and the revision of the general\n            tax code, barely advanced; and investment decisions continue\n            to ignore sound economic criteria. However, public resource\n            management did benefit from some reform measures, notably\n            the application of a unified budget and the recent adoption\n            of a new accounting system for the government. This\n            experience teaches, fundamentally, that an unstable\n            political environment damages the chances for successful\n            structural adjustment and demands, therefore, a degree of\n            healthy skepticism in the Bank's lending decision. The\n            prolonged and violent unfolding of Burundi's history --\n            and indeed that of its neighbor Rwanda -- shows all too\n            clearly the need for a cautious, realistic evaluation of\n            risk. Particularly where past performance has been\n            unimpressive, the scope of reform should be modest,\n            selective and reasonable in relation not only to resource\n            and other constraints but also to the duration of the\n            implementation period. Other lessons emphasize the\n            importance of thorough internalization, prior to credit\n            effectiveness and involving up-front participation over a\n            broad spectrum of all those engaged in and affected by the program."}, "docdt": "1996-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
