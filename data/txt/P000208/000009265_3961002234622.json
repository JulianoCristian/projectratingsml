the adjustment process\n            by further reducing the role of the state in the economy\n            and, in conjunction with an IMF supported ESAF (Enhanced\n            Structural Adjustment Facility) arrangement, by continuing\n            to alleviate policy constraints to private sector\n            development. This operation will also shield vulnerable\n            groups from the transitional costs of adjustment. The\n            operation will support reforms in three key areas: i) a\n            reduced and more effective role for the state; ii)\n            elimination of policy and legal/regulatory constraints to\n            private sector development; and iii) improved access to\n            social services, especially for lower income groups. The\n            redefined state role will focus on reducing the fiscal\n            deficit by accelerating the restructuring of the public\n            enterprise sector and reducing non-developmental\n            expenditure. Private sector development and export\n            diversification will be promoted through liberalization of\n            external transactions, the agricultural sector and factor\n            markets, and reform of the regulatory, legal and fiscal\n            systems. Finally, a social sector component will promote a\n            more appropriate pattern of public expenditure through the\n            maintenance of a safety net of social expenditure and\n            measures to improve the quality of basic health and\n            education services."}, "docdt": "1992-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
