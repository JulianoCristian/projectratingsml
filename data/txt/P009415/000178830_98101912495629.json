of an\n            existing well; the provision of the necessary gas gathering\n            and conditioning facilities; the construction of a 24\"\n            gas transmission pipeline, 110 miles in length, from\n            Bakhrabad to the city gate station in Chittagong; the\n            construction of a 20\"/16\" gas distribution system\n            supplying the major consumers in Chittagong; the\n            construction of a 10\" gas spur line to the Karnafuli\n            Paper Mill and supplying industrial estates en route; the\n            provision of ancillary maintenance, administration and\n            communications facilities; the provision of advisory\n            services for project implementation and studies; the\n            provision of training; and, the provision of technical\n            assistance and studies to assist in development of\n            Bangladesh's energy resources, including a pilot\n            project to test utilization of compressed natural gas (CNG)\n            as an automotive fuel. The project would assist Bangladesh\n            in reducing its present over-dependence on imported oil and\n            petroleum products through the replacement of liquid\n            hydrocarbons with indigenous natural gas and would make\n            available the use of gas as a feedback for fertilizer production."}, "docdt": "1980-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
