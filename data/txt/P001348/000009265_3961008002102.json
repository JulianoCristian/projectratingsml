The project comprises the\n            following two components. The privatization/divestiture\n            component will finance and mobilize the necessary expertise\n            to: (a) strengthen the Economic Secretariat and Technical\n            Unit, the entity charged with implementing the\n            government's privatization program; (b) privatize, or\n            bring to the point of sale, at least 20 public enterprises\n            (PEs) and liquidate a number of nonviable PEs; (c) support\n            the further development of the Capital Market Authority and\n            the Nairobi Stock Exchange; and (d) implement special\n            studies, training, and investment promotion activities. The\n            PE reform component will finance technical assistance to:\n            (a) strengthen the Department of Government Investment and\n            Public Enterprises, (DGIPE) the entity charged with taking\n            the lead role in the reform of public enterprises to be\n            retained in the public sector; (b) restructure five large\n            PEs; (c) design and administer a safety net for retrenched\n            workers; (d) help DGIPE implement sector wide reforms in the\n            areas of corporate planning, performance monitoring, and\n            changes to the policy framework; and (e) carry out\n            complementary reforms in various offices."}, "docdt": "1992-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
