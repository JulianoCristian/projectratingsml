The project also aims at\n            improving productivity of low-income urban residents.\n            Specifically, the project would consist of the following\n            components: a) provision of about 5,000 serviced plots under\n            three sites and services schemes at North Ruseifa, Marka,\n            and Quweismeh; b) upgrading of four low income settlements\n            in the City of Amman at Jofeh, Wadi Haddadah, East Wahdat,\n            and Wadi Umm er Riman; c) small business assistance and\n            manpower training; d) consultancy services for project\n            management, design and supervision, and studies; and e)\n            provision of equipment for municipal maintenance services.\n            The project would provide housing for 41,000 low income\n            residents to be located in the three sites and services\n            areas and improved housing for an additional 15,000 in the\n            upgrading areas and represents a first step in the\n            development of a revised strategy for providing decent\n            housing to the urban poor in Jordan at affordable prices."}, "docdt": "1980-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
