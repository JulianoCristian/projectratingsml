MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECT'JRS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN
FOR A SECOND RURAL SAVINGS AND LOAIN COOPERATIVE REHABILITATION PROJECI
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Bsnin for SDR 2.8 million (US$3.8 million equivalent),
on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a second project for the
rehabilitation of the country's rural savings and loan cooperatives. The project was prepared In close
collaboration with the French Development Agency (Caisse Frangaise de D6veloppement - CFD, ex
Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique) and t..e Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) who will
respectively provide, the equivalent of US$ 2.8 million and US$ 1.9 million towards the project. Other
co-financiers - the French Aid Agency (FAC), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)
and the European Economic Community (EEC) - will provide an additional US$ 1.5 equivalent (all on
a grant basis, except for IFAD).
2.          Sector and Proiect Background. Within the framework of its Structural Adjustment
Program, aupported by IDA, the Govemment of Benin initiated in 1 97 a fundamental restructuring of
the country's financial sector. Three government-owned commercial banks and the Agricultural
Development Bank (CNCA) were liquidated, and reforms were introduced in the sector's legal and
regulatory framework. The restructuring program has been successful. By early 1993, five new
private commercial banks (including one ot intemational standing) had been established and the return
of populations' confidence in the banking sector Is attested by the substantial amount of deposits the
banks have already mobilized (increasing from CFAF 7.8 billion at the end of 1989 to CFAF 70.5 billion
at the end of 1991). These achievements are being consolidated by iurther reforms focussing on: (a)
the recovery of the liquidated banks' assets and the strengthening of judicial procedures for the
protection of creditors; (b) the restructuring of the postal savings system; and (c) the regularization
of the relationship between the Central Bank and the Govemment.
3.          However, the country's present inancial system does not address the savings and
financing needs of the Beninese economy in a fully satisfactory fashion. The new banks have so far
chosen to invest most of their resources in the monetary market, devoting only a small proportion of
the mobilized savings to (short-term) credit in favor of the domestic economy. Although this practice
is expected to change over time with the growth of countrys economy, political stability and the
emergence of a viable formal private sector, the prospects for the banking sector to provide the
necessary intermediation services to the domestic economy appear quite limited in the medium-term.
This is particularly true for the rural areas. None of the new banks are operating outside of Cotonou
and the only formal financial intermediaries active in rural areas are the rural savings and loan
cooperatives.
4.          The Rural Savings and Loan Cooperative Network is composed of 50 primary level
Caisses Locales de Credit Agricole Mutuel (CLCAMs) and six regional level Caisses R6gionales de Credit
Agricole Mutuel (CRCAMs) to which CLCAMs are affiliated. The mutualist Network was created in the
late 1 970s under the initiative and control of the govemment-owned CNCA. The strong linkage with
CNCA was in fact the root cause of much of the Network's subsequent troubles. CLCAMs/CRCAMs
were asked by CNCA to undertake commercital banking operations, subjected to interest rate ceilings
applicable to commercial banks and stripped of any real control over their lending operations. Because
of lax supeivision and political interference, the Network's recovery performance and financial situation
gradually deteriorated to unsustainable levels. In 1987, the Govemment contemplated liquidating the
cooperative network along with CNCA. However, in view of its importance for the rural populations
and economy, and after extensive discussions between the Govemment and several donor ageneies
(including IDA and CCCE), it was decided instead to rehabilitate the Network.



5.           First Rural Savinos and Loan Cooperative Rehabilitation Prolect. The First Rural Savings
and Loan Cooperative Rehabilitation Project was identified in late 1988, appraised in June 1989 and
approved by the Board in January 1990. External financing for the project was shared by CCCE
(US$ 3.7 million equivalent), IDA (SDR 2.0 million, Credit 2086-BEN) as well as FAC, EEC, the Swiss
Development Cooperation and the Govemment of Germany who collectively provided a total of
US$ 3.4 million equivalent. Project funds have been passed by the Government on to the Network as
grant and used for the financial rehabilitation of CLCAMs/CRCAMs, including the reconstitution of
deposits lost through CNCA's liquidation and the financing of their operating deficits while they were
expanding their resource base, technical assistance and training. It is expected that all external funds,
including IDA, will be fully disbursed by the end of December 1993.
6.           Overall project performance hbs been remarkably good. A Central Project Unit (CPU)
was set up under the project for setting and c:ontrolling the Network's key operational policies and
procedures. A semi-formal TCollege des Presidents", composed of elected CLCAMs' representatives,
was also established to ensure participation of the Network's members in policy-making and in
monioring of its activities.  The CPU, headed by two expatriate managers (Director and
Deputy/Financial Director) has provided strong and competent leadership to achieve the project's main
underlying objectives of (a) strengthening the Network's management and financial situation; and (b)
restoring population's confidence in the Network. Critical elements in the success of the project have
been (a) the genuine vesire of Network's members to re-assert control over the management and
operations of CLCAMs, and (b) the Government's decision to let CLCAMs determine freely their
operating policies and procedures (interest rates on deposits and loans, recruitment f staff, etc.).
7.          It was envisaged that, during the project period, CLCAMs/CRCAMs would constitute
themselves into a formal National Federation of Savings and Loans Cooperatives govemed by elected
representatives, and that the CPU would be converted into the Federation's Technical Secretariat.
Developments in this regard have been slower than expected as it was recognized that the newly
established management and financial disciplines might be undermined, should the checks and controls
exercised by a strong and independent CPU disappear too suddenly. However, CLCAMs' Presidents
have increasingly requested to have a greater weight in the management of the Network. It has nuw
been decided to formally establish the Federation and make of its elected Board the policy-making and
regulatory body of the Network. It has also been decided that the regional CRCAMs, which until now
have been engaging in banking operations, sometime competing with affiliated CLCAMs for deposits
and loans, would be transformed into purely regional service units (URCLCAMs) providing training
support and technical backstopping to CLCAMs in their region.
8.           Since 1989, CLCAMs have made vigorous efforts to restore their financial viability.
Good management and stringent credit policies have allowed a 100% recovery rate of their loans and
a satisfactory spread (24% p.a. charged on loans and 3% p.a. paid on deposits) has improved their
eaming capacity. Over half of the 50 CLCAMs were able to break-even or show profits for the year
endino September 30, 1992. Projections of the Network's future operations and financial situation
indicate that CLCAMs would have to mobilize about CFAF 10.0 billion in deposits to cover the
operating expenses of the regional service units and about CFAF 21 billion to fully cover in addition
those of the Federation's Technical Secretariat (assuming that 30% of CLCAMs' annual profits is used
for this purpose). These levels of deposits would be reached around years 2001 and 2007
respectively. It is expected that the total amount of deposits mobilized by CLCAMs will increase from
CFAF 3.5 billion at present to about CFAF 7.0 billion by the end of the project period (1998). By that
time, CLCAMs would finance about 75% of URCLCAMs' operating cost and 15% of the Technical
Secretariat's. These projections are however based on conservative assumptions with regard to
deposit growth rates (15% p.a.) and resource use policy (only 50% of total savings deposits to be
used for extending credit, the balance being invested in risk-free money-market instruments). Faster
deposit mobilization and more favorable credit ceilings would speed up the financial viability and
autonomy of the Network.



-3-
9. E-oect Ob ves.  The proposed project would be the second phase of the
Govemment's long-term strategy to develop a viable rural financial intermediation system and for
promoting broad-based economic growth and improved living conditions in rural areas. It would build
upon the achievements of, and lessons from, the First Savings and Loan Cooperative Rehabilitation
Project to continue the financial and institutional development of the Network toward the ultimate
obJective of creating a private system that would be financially viable and autonomous.
10.        Ptj2lQ;aDcriptjon. The Project would be implemented over a five-year period (1994-
98). It would support the establishment of an efficient institutional structure for the Network through:
(a) the creation of a representative apex policy-making body with a strong Technical Secretariat for
ensuring proper policy guidance for, and control over, the Network'.- operations; (b) the conversion of
CRCAMs into efficient service units (URCLCAMs) providing technical backstopping to CLCAM*; and
Cc) the training of staff at all levels. The total project costs are estimated at US$ 15.1 million for
investments (office equipment, vehicles, buildings), technical assistance and development services
provided to CLCAMS by the Technical Secretariat and the URCLCAMs. The estimated project costs
and financing plan are presented In Schedule A.
11.         The project's CLCAM Comoonent (26% of total project costs) would include (a) office
equipment for the computerization of the CLCAMs accounting system, and (b) provisions to cover past
operating losses of CLCAMs incurred until September 1992, as well as the start-up operating deficits
of about four new CLCAMs to be established during the project period. The project's URCl,LAM
Component (21 % of the project total costs) would finance the cost of development services provided
by URCLCAMs to CLCAMs: assistance for accounting/financial management, training of members and
managers, promotion of the movement to increase membership. It would also finance the renewal of
one vehicle for each of the regi,nal units. The project's National Federation Comnonent (53% of total
costs) would support the establishment of the apex-body of the Network and finance (a) te design
sr I installation of CLCAMs computerized accounting system as well as office equipment and vehicles
for the Federation's Technical Secretariat, (b) about 78 man-months of long-term technical assistance
(Secretariat's Deputy-Executive Secretary and Financial Controller) and short-term consultancies, (c)
training, study tours and ann -Y external audits of the Network's operations, and (d) the development
services provided to CLCAMs and URCLCAMs by the Technical Secretariat (technical backstopping,
training and inspection).
12.         The project's detailed financing plan has been agreed upon with the project's co-
financiers. CFD and FAC would finance CLCAMs' past losses and proJected (limited) future operasng
deficits, bu ldings, computerization of accounts and part of the technical assistance. The Swiss
Development Cooperation (SDC) would finance training, part of the technical assistance and annual
external audits. IFAD and EEC would finance part of the operations of CLCAMs and URCLCAMs In the
Atacora and Mono regions through on-going area development projects. IDA funds (US$ 3.8 million)
would finance the cost of development services provided to CLCAMs by the URCLCAMs and the
FederatiGn's Technical Secretariat to the extent that these costs would not be financed out of
CLCAMs' annual profits (para 8). IDA funds would be made available to the Govemment on standard
IDA terms. All extemal financing, including IDA's, would be passed on to the Network by the
Govemment as a grant.
13.         Proiect lmDlementation. The project would be implemAnted by the various units of the
Network under the monitoring of a 'Comite de Concertation' including representatives of the
Federation, the Govemment and donors. The Network's policy-making and supervisory body would be
the Board of the National Federation, composed of elected CLCAM Presidents and assisted by a
Technical Secretariat responsible for supervising the day-to-day activities of CLCAMs and URCLCAMs
and managing CLCAMs' excess liquidity.



- 4 -
14.         The basic operational policies of the Network have evolved through the implementation
of the First Project. Some were spelt out from the very beginning in CLCAMs statutes (freudom to fix
intbrest rate policies), others adopted to respond to specific needs or problems. These policies and
procedures were further spelt out in a comprehensive "Statement of Operational Policies" defining the
Network's policies and procedures in the areas of deposit mobilization, lending, intemal controls,
Network development and financing. The Technical Secretariat would take over from the Central
Project Unit (CPU) established under the First Project. It would be headed by a Beninese Executive
Secretary recruited under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, seconded by an expatriate financial
controller recruited to design and set up the Network's computerized accounting and management
information system and supervise its financial management.
16.         Control over the Network's operations would be effected by the Technical Secretariat,
the project's 'Comit6 de Cor :ertation' and annual external audits. There is currently a regulatory
vacuum in the countries of the West African Monetary Union (UMOA) with regard to the supervision
of grass-root financial cooperatives, as these institutions do not fall under the purview of BCEAO. The
latter, however, has launched a study to establish an adequate regulatory framework for financial
cooperatives. Once adopted, this framework would be applied to the Network's operations. Finally,
project implementation and the Network's progress toward institutional and financial viability would
be assessed during a mid-term review to be undertaken before September 30, 1996.
16.         Proiect Sustainabilitv. The Govemment's commitment notto interfere in the Network's
operations has fostered a strong feeling of ownership among members. Conservative, self imposed
prudential ratios have been strictly enforced by CLCAMs' presidents and managers, and it is now
further a~-raed that any CLCAMs which would not be able to fully cover its operating cost through
intemally ;jenerated revenues for three consecutive years would be closed down. Projections of
CLCAMs' future activities and profitability indicate that all would become profitable before the end of
the project period (except possibly very few located in the poorest areas of the country) and that they
would be able to substantially contribute to the financing of URCLCAMs' and Technical Secretariat's
operating costs. Although these projections indicate that the Network will require continued external
support beyond the project period, they also demonstrate that substantial progress would be achieved
during the project toward financial autonomy and sustainability.
17.         Lessons Leamed. The project's design capitalizes on experiences gained during the
implementation of the First Project and of similar operations in other countries (Rwanda, Burkina Faso).
It emphasizes in particular the need to build the Network from the grass roots, avoid the Govemment's
Interference and foster a sense of ownership by members, achieve transparency and rigor in policy-
making and management, put emphasis on savings mobilization and gradually relax limits on lending
only when financial discipline becomes well established, avoid using external funds, contain operating
costs at all levels and allow sufficient margins to cover these costs. It also recognizes that the
institutional development of the Network is a long-term process and that long term extemal support
will be needed before the Network can be fully autonomous.
18.         Rationale for IDA Involvement. As for the First Project, the proposed project is fully
in line with IDA and govemment strategy of fostering private investments and growth, and promoting
the establishment of viable financial institutions. The country strategy for Benin was last discussed by
the Board in February 1992. The project fits clearly with the objectives of supporting the development
of rural financial intermediation through local initiatives based on mutualist principles, removing direct
government interference in financial intermediation and generally encouraging greater involvement of
rural communities in the management of local institutions. Several countries in the sub-region are
attempting to establish or strengthen similar decentralized, mutualist rural financial Intermediation
systems, often with Bank/IDA support. IDA continued involvement in the development of the Beninese
Network would allow the dissemination of lessons and best practices, and the successful development
of CLCAMs in Benin will have wide implications for other countries. The Govemment welcomed IDA's
support for the First Project and both the Government and the Network have emphasized their desire
for continued IDA's association with the second phase of the rehabilitation program.



-5-
19.         Aareed Acons. The signing of a Subsidiary Agreement between the Govemment and
the Federa ion would be a Condition of Effectiveness of the IDA credit. The following assurances were
obtained from the Government and the Network at negotiations: (a) the Board of the newly established
Federation would be elected before December 31, 1993; (b) CLCAMs would not lend rmore than 50%
of their total savings deposits; (c) a CLCAM would be permitted to make new loans only to members
who have completely reimbursed previous loans that are due, but will not lend to any member If its
overall recovery rate is less than 90%; (d) total outstanding borrowing by a CLCAM from an existing
extemal line of credit would not exceed 30% of Its total deposits and no new external line of credit
would be accepted by the Network without agreement of the *Comite de Concertation*; (e) CLCAMs
unable to break even financially for three consecutive years would be closed down; (f) beginning In
FY94, CLCAMs would contribute 30% of their annual psofits toward the cost of URCLCAMs' services;
(g) the performance and employment prospects of the Technical Secretariat's Executive Secretary and
Financial Controller would be reviewed by September 30, 1994 by the Board of the Federation and the
project's cofinai ciers; (h) a project mid-term review would be undertaken before September 30, 1996;
and (i) the cost reduction measures and yearly monitorable indicators that have been developed and
agreed upon would be systematically included in annual work programs submitted to IDA's approval.
20.          Environmental Aspects. The project does not entail any potential environmental risk.
It has been classified as a Category C project.
21.          Proaram Obiective Categories. The project would support the development of a resilient
private financial intermediation system in rural areas. It has thus a strong institution buihding objective.
By fostering broad-based rural investment and growth, it would also have a very positive impact on
poverty alleviation.  Finally, it would promote the empowerment of rural populations for the
management of local institutions.
22.          Benefits and Risks. The proposed project would consolidate the substantial progress
made under the First Project in the fInancial and institutional rehabilitation of the country's Savings and
Loan Cooperative Network. It would provide rural dwellers with improved safekeeping services and
better access to credit for productive and social purposes. It would therefore improve rural Incomes
and living conditions. It would also provide an efficient, low cost mechanism to mobilize rural savings
for productive purposes throughout the economy. The risk of extemal pressures on the Network's
activities would largely be eliminated by the Government's commitment not to interfere in its activities
and the Network's self-imposed limits on the use of external lines of credit. The soundness of
CLCAMs' management and the cost effectiveness of their operations would be ensured by clear
guidelines and safeguards spelt out in the Network's Statement of Operational Policies and continued
strong monitoring by the Federation's Board and Technical Secretariat. The main project risk would
be that deposit mobilization be slower than anticipated and therefore that it take longer for the
Network to become financially self-sustaining. Deposit potential critically depends on rural incomes,
and cotton production and prices in particular have a significant impact in this respect. Recent
experience indicates that, despite very depressed cotton prices, CLCAMs have been able to increase
deposits at more than 15% p.a., mainly through increased membership. This trend Is expected to
continue through major efforts to seek membership from a wide range of rural dwellers (civil servants,
traders) for reducing deposit variability associated with fluctuating agricultural Incomes.
23.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

SCHJEDULE 
REPUBLIC OF BENIN
SECOND RURAL SAVINGS AND LOAN COOPERATIVE RBEHAILITATION PROJECT
Proiects with Sionificant Disbursement Laa
Public Enterorises (Cr. 1748-BEN)
The top priority of the project was to liquidate and privatize those enterprises which were not
viable or had financial problems. This did not involve high levels of disbursement but was very effective
in rationalizing the sector and Govemment's portfolio, and achieved results above expectation despite
the low disbursement level. However, a mid-term review is going to be completed In FY93 with the
objective of restructuring project activities and improving disbursement performance.
SAL 11 (Cr. 2283-BEN)
Slow disbursement is due to prolonged implementation of the restructuring measures agreed
with the Govemment and delays in the compliance with the conditions related to second tranche
release. Second tranche has now been released in May 1993.
Health Services Develooment 1Cr. 2031-BEN)
Disbursement lag is due to delays in releasing the third tranche of the quick disbursing
component. Measures awaited are: a) an evaluation of the execution of the 1992 health sector
recurrent budget and the 1992-95 sector investment program; b) the establishment of procedures for
the harmonization of the cost recovery system; and c) draft decrees and orders on pharmaceutical
legislation have to be presented to the Ministers" Council for adoption. Measures required for release
of the tranche have been agreed and are being implemented by the Govemment. The release is
expected shortly.
Telecommunication (Cr. 1960-BEN)
Although actual disbursement is 73% of forecasts, the investment program is expected to be
completed within set targets (1993) and 91% of the proceeds of the Credit have been committed.
Power Rehabilitation (Cr. 2284-BEN). Aaricultural Services (Cr. 2285-BEN). Pre-lnvestment (Cr. 2286-
These Credits were all signed in early FY92 and became effective only recently. Disbursement
Is expected to proceed normnally.
Geeral
The unsatisfactory management of special accounts by the Govemment debt management
agency contributes to slow disbursement. This problem is being addressed, inter alia. by the use of
project's implementing agencies for special accounts management.
