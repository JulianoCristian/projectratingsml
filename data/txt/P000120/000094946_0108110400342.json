sustainability is rated as likely. The World\n            Bank's overall performance is assessed as satisfactory.\n            In view of the achievements of the network and the\n            substantial impact it is estimated to have had, the overall\n            performance of the Borrower is rated as satisfactory. This\n            rating is accompanied by a caution that the plans to improve\n            the financial performance of the weaker units in the network\n            will be implemented as planned. Some of the major lessons\n            emerging from the project are as follows: Because a pilot\n            project will not provide all the lessons needed and because\n            circumstances change, the design of the follow-on project\n            must be flexible enough to allow for corrective actions\n            (such as the change in lending rules). External pressure\n            should not be allowed to influence internal decisions, or\n            even the best plans fail. Early success in project\n            implementation can foster realistic unrealistic expectations\n            and expansion of objectives, especially if there is\n            political pressure for quickly delivering the services or\n            output expected from the project. This was the case in\n            Benin--where all the projections with regard to membership,\n            savings, and loans of the organization were exceeded in the\n            early years of project implementation. Careful consideration\n            must be accorded to the short and long-term implications of\n            each rule and regulation given to the participating units."}, "docdt": "2001-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
