sustainability prospects was\n            considered as good, and performance of the Bank and the\n            Borrower was rated as satisfactory. Some of the lessons\n            learned are: 1) lengthy initial implementation delays\n            largely attributed to civil works point to the importance of\n            careful start-up planning and implementation; 2) the Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU's) steady integration within\n            division of education (DOE) enhanced implementation and\n            increased efficiency and has helped to foster borrower\n            ownership; 3) high quality external training courses and\n            well matched fellowship placements pay dividends over\n            lower-cost options; 4) like other projects of the time,\n            there were no monitor able indicators per se, although the\n            end objectives were largely used to assess progress by Royal\n            Government of Bhutan (RGOB) and missions, particularly at\n            the mid-term review (MTR) stage; 5) to achieve sustainable\n            skills transfer from technical assistance experts, it is\n            critical that national counterparts are carefully identified\n            and selected. International experts should also be carefully\n            chosen to ensure they are capable and willing to adapt to\n            local conditions and relate effectively with their\n            counterparts; and 6) the DOE' s reluctance to\n            compromise on teacher quality for the sake of expediency is\n            noteworthy and has sent a strong message to the system."}, "docdt": "1998-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
