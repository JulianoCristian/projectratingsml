Dear Sir:
We refer to the abovementioned Development Credit Agreements between the Kingdom

respectively. We also refer to your letter dated March 29, 1989, requesting the 
Association to amend the Development Credit Agreements so that the currency of the 
Special Account will be expressed in Bhutanese Ngultrums.
The Association is pleased to inform you that, after due consideration, it has 
agreed to your Ministry's request. Therefore Section 2.02 and the Special Account

Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendment by signing the 
enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to us.
Very truly yours,
