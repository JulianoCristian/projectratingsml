MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF BHUTAN
FOR A PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Bhutan for SDR 3.1 million (US$4.2
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would
be on standard IDA terms with 40 years' maturity and help finance a primary
education project. The project would be cofinanced by UNICEF for US$1.5
million and the Government of the Swiss Confederation for US$5.9 million
equivalent.
2.       Background.  Bhutan has the lowest official literacy rate (15%)
and the lowest official primary education participation rate (20%) in the
South Asia region. Inadequate teaching and poorly constructed and
overcrowded primary schools have resulted in poor quality of education and
unmet demand-for education. Most children of primary age in remote areas
are underserved as they are unable to walk long distances in mountainous
terrain to reach existing faciiities. The efficiency of the education
system is low, requiring approximately 15 years of student teaching time to
produce one primary graduate and marked by drop-out rates averaging about
45%. The education sector shares with all other sectors the general
paucity of trained staff. The Department of Education (DOE) has been
forced to recruit 36% of primary teachers from other countries (mainly
India). Expatriate teachers are 50% to 75% more costly than local
teachers, and are for the most part untrained in primary education
pedagogy. Poor pre-service preparation and lack of a comprehensive program
of in-service training and supervision are major obsLacles to improved
quality. The capacity of the DOE for planning, administration and
evaluation is low, and the provision of basic educational services to the
classroom teacher (high quality curricula, textbooks and assessment
services) is limited.
3.       The Government is making a strong effort to overcome educational
deficiencies by investing nearly 11% of the national budget (4% of GNP) in
education, with primary education targeted to receive 36% of education
expenditures during the Sixth Plan period (1988-92). Increased
availability and more equitable access to primary schooling will be
addressed by providing community constructed schools for the lower primary
grades in remote areas. In addition, the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB)
will construct 25 schools, provide 174 additional classrooms and renovate
34 existing schools. Boarding facilities will be provided in 13 of the new
schools to allow children from remote areas to attend upper primary grades.
The cadre of trained national teachers will be expanded by introducing



-2
lmpro-ements in the service conditions of Bhutanese teachers and by
doubling the output from the Teacher Training Centers (TTCs), thus
virtually eliminating dependence on expatriate teachers by the year 2000.
Quality improvements are already being addressed by a modest expansion of
in-service training, increased supervision, simplification of the
curriculum and improvement in teaching materials.
4.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Major impediments to Bhutan's
development efforts are the low quality and limited capacity of the primary
education system, which deprive the majority of citizens of the basic
skills of literacy and numeracy necessary to their economic and physical
well-being. These impediments are major constraints on the availability
and quality of students with higher levels of education and training needed
to meet the technical and administrative manpower requirements of the
economy. The proposed project initiates support from the Association for
the education sector by helping to establish a quality base and increased
access to the education system. This focus was chosen in recognition of
the fact that no long-term improvements can be made at any level without
higher quality at the base of the system. The Association's involvement in
preparation of the projecc assisted the RG08 in identifying a long-term
development strategy for the primary subsector and integrating external
assistance. The project will address the issue of high unit costs of
primary education by institutionalizing practices that will result in
increased efficiency. The Association's involvement is envisioned as long
term to address, with a series of operations, various sector constraints
and priority needs.
5.       Project Oblectives.  The proposed project ''1 support the RGOB's
development plan for primary education, which is de-Lgned to accommodate an
enrollment growth rate of about 68 per annum. It will raise the quality of
education and student achievement and lower the unit costs of primary
schooling in Bhutan. Specifically the project will: (a) increase the
number and quality of primary schools; (b) increase the number and
effectiveness of primary school teachers; and (c) strengthen administrative
and educational support services of the DOE.
6.       Project DescriRtion. The proposed project will comprise three
components: (a) primary school development; (b) teacher training
institutions; and (c) educational administration. It will include
construction of 12 primary schools (11 with boarding facilities). Each of
the 12 schools will have a network of community constructed lower primary
schools in remote areas serving as feeder schools. The proposed project
also will support expansion of the number and effectiveness of primary
school teachers through increasing the capacity of the primary TTCs by
constructing a new TTC at Kanglung, increasing the dormitory capacity of
the TTC at Paro, and by doubling output through an accelerated training
program. The quality and frequency of pre-service training will be
improved. In addition, the project will include strengthening of education
administration by the addition to the DOE of staff trained in the areas of
curriculum and examinations, planning and evaluation, teacher training and



-3-
personnel. The project, to be carried out within seven and one-half years,
provides funds for civil works, furniture and equipment, vehicles,
technical assistance and incremental operating costs. The total project
cost is estimated at US$13.6 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$6.5 million (48%). A breakdowr, of the costs and financing
plan (cofinancing by the Association, UNICEF and Switzerland) is shown in
Schedule A. Retroactive financing of US$400,000 will be provided for
expenditures after the appraisal date of July 31, 1987 on design, site
surveys and soils tests. UNICEF will administer its portion of the project
and follow its own guidelines for procurement and employment of
consultants. The Association will administer the Swiss-financed portion of
the project and follow IDA procedures. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Bhutan are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
is also attached. In addition, the Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7010-BHU
dated February 29, 1988 is distributed separ.Ately.
7.      Aireed Actions.  The Government has provided assurances that:
(a) a teacher cadre policy providing better career opportunities for
teachers will become operational by July 31, 1988; (b) a technical
assistance contract providing services to the faculty of the TTC at Paro
will be signed by July 31, 1988; (c) there is adequate provision in the
Sixth Five-Year Plan for financing the six percent per annum enrollment
expansion target in the primary sub-sector; (d) the planned output of
trained primary teachers will eliminate dependence upon foreign teachers by
the year 2000; (e) the access roads for Phase II and Phase III schools will
be constructed by January 31, 1990 and 1991, respectively; and (f) the
final bid documents for Phase I schools will be completed by July 31, 1988.
The establishment of the Project Implementation Unit and appointment of key
personnel is a condition of credit effectiveness.
8.       Benefits. The project will provide long term benefits that will
support the overall economic development of Bhutan consisting of improved
and more equitable access to primary education, greater capacity in the DOE
and increased efficiency in the primarv education system. Access to
primary education will increase and more equitable access for students in
remote populations and female students in particular will be provided.
Strengthening of the DOE will facilitate planning, management and
monitoring of a rapidly growing sector and enhance the DOE's capacity to
support primary teachers. This support will come through regular
supervision, in-service training and higher quality classroom resources
such as curricula, textbooks and assessment services. Containment of
recurrent costs will lessen the financial impact of increased primary
enrollments. Tlie cost of educating a primary school graduate is expected
to be almost halved through better teacher deployment, Bhutanization of the
teaching staff and reduction in dropout and repeater rates.

9.       ilaks.  Possible risks are that the Government may overreach its.
capacity to staff and finance the primary education expansion program.
With respect to staffing, the risk of teacher shortages has been reduced by
increased pay and improved service conditions for teachers and an
accelerated teacher training program. The risk of insufficient staffing
for construction trades has been reduced by the phasing of construction
over five years. Financing risks have been reduced by introducing controls
on recurrent expenditures such as: instituting a conservative 6f per annum
enrollment growth policy, raising student to teacher ratios from 28:1 to
36:1 during the life of the project, reducing dependence on expensive
foreign teachers, and increasing efficiency through reduced dropout and
repeater rates.
10.      ReggMndatign. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
