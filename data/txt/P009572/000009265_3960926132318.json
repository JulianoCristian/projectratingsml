of education and student\n            achievement and lower unit costs of primary schooling in\n            Bhutan.  Specifically, it seeks to (a) increase the number\n            and quality of primary schools; (b) increase the number and\n            effectiveness of primary teachers; and (c) strengthen\n            administrative and educational support services of the\n            Department of Energy (DOE).  To that end, the project\n            consists of three specific components:  (a) primary school\n            development, (b) teacher training institutions and (c)\n            educational administration.  In addition to financing the\n            construction of school and teacher training facilities, the\n            project intends to finance 8.4 staff-years of technical\n            assistance and 17.8 staff-years of fellowships and\n            placements, as well as some vehicles and equipment."}, "docdt": "1988-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
