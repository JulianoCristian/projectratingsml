the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial; the Bank's performance was satisfactory;\n            and the borrower's performance was satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: specialized (private) operators\n            are the preferred approach for medium-size cities: after\n            decades of stagnation in improving water service in\n            medium-sized cities, the project demonstrated that under the\n            right circumstances a private operator can significantly\n            improve water services. National Government's Technical\n            Assistance Program is critical: the Departmental Water Plans\n            (PDA) represents the second generation national government\n            policy initiative to promote and consolidate private\n            operators by channeling resources through and assigning more\n            sector responsibility to the departments. Operator selection\n            process needs to be refined: The original project concept of\n            awarding concession contracts based on the lowest cost\n            subsidy was theoretically sound, but did not work well in\n            practice. Need to better incorporate technical dimensions\n            into performance goals and investment plans: a number of\n            common technical issues were encountered which hindered\n            improvements in service, including: inadequate raw water\n            supply sources, frequent power outages, high levels of\n            unaccounted for water, low levels of micro-metering, and\n            lack of attention to network sectorization. Wastewater and\n            storm water drainage policies and programs need to be\n            developed: the expansion of sewerage coverage under the\n            project was minimal and none of the project municipalities\n            have wastewater treatment."}, "docdt": "2011-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
