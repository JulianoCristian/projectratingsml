F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The development objectives of the project are: (i) to support water sector reform by
facilitating the incorporation of the private sector into the management and operation of


                                                 ii
water utilities participating in the project for the purpose of creating an enabling
environment for improving the efficiency and sustainability of these utilities, and by
providing them with financial support to ensure their viability; (ii) expand the coverage
of water and sewerage services in participating municipalities; and (iii) facilitate the
access of populations in low income areas of participating municipalities to water and
sewerage services.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

   1.1. Context at Appraisal

Providing water and sanitation services to Colombia‘s 1,122 municipalities, most of them small
and relatively poor, has always been a challenge. Prior to 1987 water service in Colombia was
provided through two different systems: municipal companies in large cities such as Bogotá,
Medellin, and Cali, and directly by the National Government through the Municipal
Development Institute (INSFOPAL) in small and medium sized cities. In 1987 INSFOPAL was
abolished and financing responsibility was shifted to FINDETER, the Regional Development
Financing Institution. The water sector then entered a transition stage until 1994, when the
National Planning Department (DNP) was assigned the function of planning and technical
assistance for the sector.

The 1991 Colombian Constitution defined a model of increased decentralization for the
provision of public services and promoted a shift away from direct provision of services by
municipal government towards one where service is provided by public or private companies. In
support of these processes, beginning in the mid-1990s Colombia implemented a set of
institutional reforms in the sector that provided a framework for private participation in service
provision.

The 1994 Law of Public Services (Law 142) mandated that all public service entities convert to
legally autonomous stock companies with the possibility of being municipal-owned, private, or
mixed. Law 142 also established a national tariff regulator, the Comisión Reguladora de Agua
Potable y Saneamiento (CRA). The regulatory framework was complemented by Law 60 of
1993 and Law 715 of 2001 which created the General Revenue-Sharing System (SGP), a tax-
sharing system which determined the resource distribution of national government transfers to
the municipalities, part of which is allocated to the water sector.

In 1998 the Corporate Modernization Program (PME) for the introduction of private sector
participation in the water sector was established in the Ministry of Economic Development. The
goal of the PME is to provide technical assistance to decentralized entities (municipalities and
departments) for partnerships with the private sector. The PME focused on the Caribbean coastal
region, where coverage and quality were most lacking, and institutional weaknesses evident. The
PME adopted a novel approach whereby the national government provided most of the
investment financing while still providing financial incentives for improved performance by the
operators.

The World Bank-financed Water Sector Reform Assistance Project (―the Project‖) was designed
to support the PME and concentrated on the departments of the Caribbean coast. The Project
design was partly motivated by the positive experience from two successful private operator
contracts, signed for Cartagena in 1995 and for Barranquilla in 1996. The Project was considered
a pilot project to introduce specialized operators to small and medium sized cities, and was
considered a high risk-high reward project. As shown in this ICR the Project is evaluated as a
successful pilot project that had a significant impact on Colombia‘s water sector as well as
improving water service in specific subproject cities.

    1.2. Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The development objectives of the Project 1 were to: (i) support water sector reform by
facilitating the incorporation of the private sector into the management and operation of water
utilities participating in the Project for the purpose of creating an enabling environment for
improving the efficiency and sustainability of these utilities, and by providing them with
financial support to ensure their viability; (ii) expand the coverage of water and sewerage
services in participating municipalities; and (iii) facilitate the access of populations in low
income areas of participating municipalities to water and sewerage services. Physical
investments were limited to the eight departments of the Caribbean coast.

These objectives were expected to be achieved by providing: (i) technical assistance for
incorporating private sector participation in the management and operation of the water and
sewerage services in the utilities in about 3 medium size cities or regional associations of
municipalities, with populations of up to about 300,000 inhabitants, and in the utilities of about
25 small municipalities with populations of up to about 12,000 inhabitants; and (ii) financial
support to the utilities which have successfully incorporated the private sector; and which will be
directed at benefiting the poor, as well as ensuring the financial viability of these utilities.

The table below presents a streamlined version of the indicators presented in Annex 1 of the
PAD. Since all of the Project municipalities have over 90% of their population in the lower
economic brackets (see Annex 2), project development indicators (ii) expand service and (iii)
serve low-income areas have been merged into one set of indicators for the ICR.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators: The PDOs were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the primary target group comprised a
population of an estimated 700,000 people in low-income communities in Colombia‘s Caribbean

  The Project Loan Agreement also includes a 4th objective ―(i) to improve environmental protection practices in
connection with the provision of water and sewerage services and (ii) to define rural water and sanitation policies,
and to develop adequate methods for increasing coverage, both in connection with water and sewerage services rural
sector.‖ Since there were no PDO indicators for these objectives, and the amount of Project resources allocated for
these activities were limited, the ICR adopts the PAD objectives.

coastal departments. These populations are typically assigned to the first three (and lowest
income) consumer categories in Colombia‘s six point classification (strata) of consumers.2 The
primary target group was not revised during project implementation, however, beneficiaries
increased to approximately 1.6 million people largely as a result of an unexpected number of
medium-sized municipalities participating in the project.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component A (US$61.8 million): Investments in water supply and sanitation works in medium-
size cities and in small municipalities.

Component B (US$0.8 million): Environmental management capacity strengthening for the
sector, with a focus on wastewater management.

Component C (US$ 0.9 million): Development of a rural water and sanitation policy.

Component D (US$6.5 million): Project management and training.

1.6 Revised Components: The Project components were not formally revised.

1.7 Other significant changes: There were no significant changes in the Project design.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The key design element of the Project was the requirement to utilize private operators in order to
access loan funds. Although the Project design built upon the successful introduction of private
operators in Cartagena and Barranquilla, introduction of private operators in small and medium-
sized cities was a much more risky undertaking and the overall PAD risk rating was evaluated as
―high‖. The pre-dominant concerns were that: i) municipalities would not want to participate in
the program; and ii) there would be little appetite from private operators to work in poor small
and medium sized cities in the Caribbean which have historically suffered from poor governance.

The Project design benefitted from the insight that excessive risk could not be shifted to the
private operator until the deteriorated systems had been improved to the point where the
operating revenue streams had stabilized at a sustainable level. Accordingly the Project was
prepared with a number of key design aspects such as (i) generous public financing to
rehabilitate the run-down systems in the targeted municipalities; (ii) the use of domestic, rather
than international, private operators in order to build a national pool of small and medium sized
private operators; (iii) generous and continuous technical assistance from the National

Government project implementation unit to the small-scale private operators; and (iv) the
drafting and refinement of transparent bidding documents for two types of schemes to partner
with specialized operators.

The two standard contract types differed in their focus on financing of investments as described
below.

      The ‗construction with operation‘ model was designed for small municipalities, generally
       with a population less than 12,000. The basic concept is that the national government
       would define the investment program, and the municipality would then contract a
       ―constructor-operator‖ for both the infrastructure construction in the first 2-3 years, and
       operation of the system for ten or more years. It was assumed that contractors would be
       enticed to secure the construction contract in exchange for the less-than lucrative
       operational obligations. In this model the municipality is the Employer and the
       ―constructor-operator‖ is the contractor.

      The ‗operation with investment‘ model was designed for medium-sized municipalities
       and followed a more traditional concession model. The national government would
       define the investment program, and then operators would bid for the concession contract
       based upon the ―lowest subsidy‖ required to meet the pre-defined investment amounts. In
       theory, the Operator would be able to generate a positive cash flow from operational
       efficiencies to finance part of the investment program. In this model the operator serves
       as the Employer for all construction contracts.

The Borrower for the Loan is the Republic of Colombia, and the Project was designed to be
managed by the national government, originally through the Ministry of Economic Development.
The actual implementation of the Project, however, in terms of contracting would be through the
municipalities, in the case of the constructor operator model, and the operators, in the case of the
operation with investment model. The Project was prepared in a programmatic and flexible
manner with none of the participating municipalities identified during appraisal.

The Project was prepared and brought to the Bank Board of Directors in less than one year. This
was possible since the Project was prepared by the project implementing unit in the Ministry of
Economic Development under the on-going Bank financed Municipal Development Project
(3336-CO). The commitment of the Borrower was high as evidenced by: i) amending the on-
going Municipal Development Project Loan Agreement to create a new component for water
utilities' modernization and reallocating US$5 million for the sector policy reform program; ii) a
strong information dissemination effort regarding the government‘s policy, which resulted in
generating a demand by mayors for participating in the project; iii) numerous private sector
participation processes being initiated during project preparation in both medium size cities and
small municipalities; and iv) a financial contribution of nearly half the project cost through
national government funding.

2.2 Implementation

The Project closing date was extended from June 30, 2007 to October 31, 2010 through three
extensions. The Project experienced a number of adjustments during implementation which are
highlighted below.

National Government Reforms-Creation of MAVDT: With the advent of a new presidential
administration in 2002, the Ministry of Economic Development was merged with the Ministry of
Environment to form the Ministry of Environment, Housing, and Regional Development
(MAVDT). The rapid creation of the MAVDT proved initially disruptive to implementation of
the Project due to high turnover of staff and frequent management changes. Over the lifetime of
the Project four different ministerial counterparts were assigned, each of whom understandably
required time to learn the Project‘s design and status of implementation. The appointment of the
first Vice-Minister of Water in 2006 helped to stabilize project implementation and staffing.

Loan Cancellation: Disbursements under World Bank financed projects are fully integrated
within the Colombian central government budget. When projects are implemented slower than
forecast, the portion of the annual appropriations for investments under the central government
budget that cannot be utilized in a given year is lost and cannot be recuperated through budget
appropriations in later years. As a result of the slow Project start-up US$4.31 million of budgeted
resources were ―lost‖ and subsequently cancelled from the US$40 million loan, resulting in a
final disbursement of US$35.69 million.

Shift to Medium-Sized Cities: Only three medium-sized cities were expected to participate in the
Project under the ―operation with investment model‖. During implementation, however, this
expanded to 18 municipalities participating in the Bank-financed Project as a result of the
MAVDT‘s focus shifting to medium-sized cities during the early phases of the Project. The
national government provided more financing then originally estimated, increasing from US$30
million to US$45.9 million for the entire PME program. The Project loan resources were
therefore spread out in smaller amounts to a greater number of medium-sized cities but this was
partially compensated by higher level of counterpart funds.

Conversely the number of small municipalities participating under the ―construction with
operation‖ model was only seven, under three separate contracts, considerably less than the
original forecast of fifteen. Private sector interest and municipal interest in the smaller
municipalities was less than originally anticipated, and the MAVDT focus on medium-sized
cities diverted attention from the smaller cities.

Lingering Sub-Projects: Two sub-projects experienced significant delays which resulted in
multiple extensions of the Project closing date. The operator originally selected for Magangué
(Aguas Kapital SA ESP) was extremely slow in implementing the investment program, and was
replaced by a new operator (Aquaseo SA ESP) in 2010. The La Linea subproject in Bolivar
experienced delays in the installation of a critical pipeline due to complications with a parallel
highway construction project.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design. The PAD was formulated in 2000, and there have been subsequent changes in the
Bank‘s guidelines. Overall the ICR considers that the selected monitoring indicators were
appropriate to measure the project development objectives.

The PDO indicators in Annex 1 of the PAD were reorganized for the ICR to be consistent with
the current methodology and more congruent with the stated project objectives. The original
objectives call for expanding water and sewerage services in participating municipalities (PDO
2), and also specifically among poor communities (PDO 3). Since the Project only intervened in
poor municipalities (see Annex 2) where over 90% of the residents fall into the lowest three
strata, only one set of indicators is used in the ICR to measure the improvement of water and
sewerage services.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental Safeguards (OP4.01): The Project was classified as a category B project. Most of
the investments comprised rehabilitation of existing water supply and sewerage systems without
any significant negative environmental impact. No wastewater treatment plants were built under
the Project. Each of the construction contracts included standard environmental and safety
requirements, and the contracts were supervised by independent construction supervisors to
ensure compliance with environmental and safety requirements.

Procurement: Procurement related activity took place at two levels:

Selection of Operators: The Project Loan agreement required the World Bank to provide a no-
objection to the selection of the operator. It is important to note that this no-objection is not for a
Bank-financed contract, but rather for the selection of an Operator based on agreed-upon World
Bank-MADVT procedures and criteria. During the early stages of the Project, the Bank worked
with MAVDT to develop model concession bidding documents, which incorporated the
following aspects: i) the investment program is defined by consultants contracted by MAVDT;
ii) the long-term tariffs are established in the bid documents; and iii) the contract is awarded to
the operator which proposes the ―least-cost‖ subsidy necessary for meeting the established
investment amount. The selected operator is provided flexibility to adjust the investment
program, but not the amount, over the course of time.

During the course of the Project, 18 municipalities signed contracts under the ―operation with
investment‖ model and received the required Bank no-objection. The operator procurement
process and subsequent implementation did not proceed smoothly however. Some of the
common complications include: i) no bidders or only one bidder; ii) failed concession contracts;
and iii) directly negotiated contracts. The award of the concession contracts needed the approval
of both MAVDT and the Bank, which helped to ensure a certain level of contract integrity and
transparency. Annex 5 contains a summary of lessons learned in the selection/procurement of
specialized operators.



                                                  6
Works, Goods, and Service Contracts: For the ―operation with investment‖ model the operators
were the implementing agencies acting as the Employer; for the ―construction with operation‖
model the municipalities were the implementing agencies acting as the Employer. In total there
were 12 operators and three municipal entities (two serving multiple municipalities) acting as
implementing agencies and contracting under Bank procurement guidelines. This
decentralization of procurement responsibility was only possible due the technical support and
supervision provided by the MAVDT, which had to train the implementing agencies and oversee
the procurement process. The Project‘s procurement performance was generally rated as highly
satisfactory/satisfactory throughout the life of the Project and there were no cases of mis-
procurement. The Project was the subject of an INT investigation in early 2009 associated with
the La Linea sub-project. The INT report has been completed and concluded that there was no
evidence of malfeasance.

Financial Management: The auditors issued unqualified (clean) opinions on the projects
financial statements for the audit periods 2006 to 2009. The audit reports contained several
internal control and non-compliance findings, issues that as of the project closing date have been
corrected. However, the two latest audit reports have been submitted 2 months late, and the
contracting of the auditors for the 2010 audit is delayed, despite the Bank's No Objection to the
Terms of Reference provided on January 13, 2011. Therefore the final audit report, for the period
January 1, 2010 to October 31, 2010, will not be submitted by the due date of April 30, 2011.
The MAVDT plans to have the auditors contracted by May 31, 2011 and issue the final report by
August 15, 2011. The quarterly interim financial reports (IFRs), which are not audited, were
submitted within the contractual date and in general they have been acceptable.

The ISR Financial Management (FM) rating up to March 2009 was assessed as Moderately
Unsatisfactory (MU), mainly due to the following issues : (a) the Government Official
information system (SIIF) was not capturing all the project transactions, thus manual records had
to be kept; (b) deficiencies in the internal controls; and (c) delays in the submission of
withdrawal applications. These conditions have improved, and as of April 2010, the FM rating
was upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

During the course of the Project a number of legislative reforms and executive decrees were
adopted to improve the enabling framework and sustain the reforms. By 2005 the MAVDT and
the Bank realized that in order to expand private sector participation and strengthen service in
smaller municipalities, it would be necessary for the Department governments to take more of a
leadership role. The Department of La Guajira was chosen as a pilot, and the Bank approved the
on-going La Guajira Water and Sanitation Infrastructure and Service Management Project in
2007 (P096965).

Based mainly on experience from this project and partly on the La Guajira model, the national
government created the Departmental Water Program (PDA) in 2007 (CONPES Policy Paper
3463) which channels national government funds for water and sanitation through the
department government and requires municipalities to ensure water utilities sustainability
stimulating private sector participation..

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The Project was considered a pilot project to test a novel approach to private sector participation
in the small and medium-sized cities. The results of the Project were perceived to have an
important impact on Colombia‘s overall national water and sanitation policy and investment
program. The Project also responded directly to the need to improve water and sanitation
services in the Caribbean region. At the start of the project only 60% of the residents had access
to the distribution network, which only operated intermittently.

At a higher policy level, the Project directly responded to the Colombia Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) of 1997, which identified the poor and deteriorated state of the country‘s
infrastructure as a critical constraint to economic growth. The government‘s strategy emphasized
private sector participation to expand water and sanitation services and improve wastewater
treatment infrastructure. The CAS identified three key sector-related objectives: (i) creation of
mechanisms to facilitate private sector participation in the provision of urban public services, (ii)
increase in quality and coverage of water supply and sanitation services, and (iii) achieve
sustainable economic growth by improving infrastructure services. The project contributed to the
achievement of these objectives.

The Project also played an instrumental role in strengthening MAVDT‘s Corporate
Modernization Program (PME) and helped lay the ground work for the national policy on the
Departmental Water Plan program.

The current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), dated March 4, 2008, is derived from the 2006-
2010 National Development Plan which comprises five development pillars, each of which has
clear goals and progress indicators. The Project directly supports the pillars of ―Promotion of
Equity‖ and the goals of ―Livable Cities‖ and ―Infrastructure for Development‖.

Based on the close alignment of the Project Development Objectives with Colombia’s
development priorities and the Country Partnership Strategy, the ICR rates the relevance of
the Project as “high”.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (Efficacy)

The first development objective of the Project is to: ―support water sector reform by facilitating
the incorporation of the private sector into the management and operation of water utilities
participating in the Project for the purpose of creating an enabling environment for improving the
efficiency and sustainability of these utilities, and by providing them with financial support to
ensure their viability.‖

Annex 1 provides a summary of overall project costs, financing and a list of Bank-financed and
non-Bank financed projects by municipalities. Under the overall PME program, 36
municipalities in the Caribbean region now have private operators; twenty five of these
municipalities received World Bank financing. The total cost of the PME as of 2010 was $75

                                                 8
million, of which the Bank loan financed US$24 million 3 . The table below summarizes the
indicators for the incorporation of private sector operators in the Caribbean region. The
indicators are only for the Bank-financed subprojects.

Operation with Investment - Achieved: The number of PSP operations with investment contracts greatly exceeded
the estimate for medium sized cities in the PAD. In addition, the MAVDT expanded the program beyond the Bank-
financed subprojects.

Construction with Operation - Not Achieved: The number of PSP contracts for smaller cities using the
Constructor-Operator model was significantly lower than PAD targets. This was not necessarily a bad outcome as in
general the Constructor-Operator model is not functioning particularly well.

The table shows that the Project was highly successful for medium-sized cities and greatly
exceeded original targets. The experience with smaller cities was less successful however as only
three ―construction-operation‖ contracts were signed with seven municipalities. This is partly
explained by a conscious and rational decision by MAVDT to focus on medium sized cities as a
priority. Since the Project was designed in a flexible and programmatic manner, the shift in
focus to medium sized cities is not a shortcoming.

Based on the success in introducing private sector participation in medium-sized cities
combined with modest achievements for small cities, the ICR rates the achievement of PDO 1
as “substantial”.

The second PDO relates to the expansion of water and sewerage services in participating
municipalities, and facilitating access for low-income populations. Since all of the participating
municipalities have over 90% their populations in the low-income stratum (Strata 1, 2, and 3)
only one set of indicators are used with the assumption that all of the service improvements are
directed at the low-income groups. Each indicator is analyzed separately below.

There was a significant increase in the water supply infrastructure coverage for medium-sized
cities, increasing from 61% to 85% which is above the target value of 80%. The 15% standard
deviation of the municipal average, however, reflects the fact that 5 of the 18 municipalities did
not meet the target value. There were some successes in medium sized cities, including
significant expansions of water supply infrastructure in El Banco (Operagua el Banco), five
municipalities in Atlantico (Triple A), four municipalities in Cordoba (Uniaguas), Maicao in La
Guajira (Aguas de la Peninsula), San Marcos (Aguas de la Mojana) and Sincelejo (Aguas de la
Sabana) in Sucre and Sincelejo.

There was no significant increase in water supply infrastructure coverage for the small
municipalities with the construction-operation model. The efficacy rating for small cities,
however, is evaluated as modest, as there were some improvements in the water supply
infrastructure in all three subprojects. For example, in the case of the La Linea sub-project,
which covers four municipalities in Bolivar, the primary focus was on improving the main water
distribution line connecting the cities rather than expanding the distribution network.

The provision of sewerage services in medium-sized cities (all without treatment) lagged behind
water supply, and the target of 65% was not achieved, although there was a significant increase
in coverage from 43% to 53%. The only cities which met the target were Sincelejo (81%),
Corozal (79%), Sabanagrande (79%), Soledad (71%), and Sahagun (72%). It should be noted
that all of these cities started the project with coverage rates above 60% and thus the increase
was not dramatic. There is essentially no sewerage service in small cities. The lack of focus on
sewerage is understandable given that usually the first priority for operators and customers in a
constrained economic environment is water supply.

Provision of water supply infrastructure coverage does not guarantee adequate service, as most
cities suffer from the problem of intermittent supply. There was a significant increase in
continuity in medium cities, with continuous supply coverage increasing from 2% to 53% for the
total Project population. The systems operated by Triple A in Atlántico (5 cities) and Uniaguas
in Córdoba (2 cities) achieved 90% continuous supply coverage. In almost all other cities, even if
continuous supply was not achieved, the level of service, in terms of hours per day, increased
significantly. Thus even though the target was not achieved the efficacy for medium cities is
rated as substantial. Water supply service did not improve in small cities, although there are
prospects for future improvements due to targeted investments made to strengthen the primary
networks.

The overall rating for Project efficacy is calculated using a population weighted scoring
system as shown in the table below, and the overall rating for efficacy is considered
substantial.

3.3 Efficiency

Project efficiency is evaluated on two levels: i) the efficiency of the water utility as measured by
staff per 1,000 connections; and ii) efficiency of Project investments, as qualitatively measured
by a water engineering expert. Both parameters are rather crude measures of efficiency, as an
operator can be efficient even with a relatively high staffing ratio, and evaluation of investment
efficiency contains a certain level of subjectivity. Nevertheless, these parameters provide useful
insights into efficiency of investments and operations.

An analysis of global investment efficiency was undertaken for six subprojects (15 cities), which
serves as a type of least-cost economic analysis. A traditional economic cost-benefit analysis was
not undertaken due to the large number of subprojects, the data intensive nature of the exercise,
and the common recognition that providing water and sanitation services provides significant
health and other economic benefits. As shown in Section 4, the ICR analysis placed great
emphasis on financial analysis to examine sustainability issues.

For medium sized cities, the population weighted value of staff per 1,000 connections decreased
significantly from 7.8 to 5.6, while the average value was 4.4, indicating that at least some
operators were close to the target value of 4. The story the construction-operation contracts in
small cities is less clear. It appears that staffing may have increased slightly, but this could be
due to the construction activities undertaken by the contractor.

A scoring system was developed for qualitatively assessing investment efficiency in each
subproject. In total six subprojects (15 cities) were evaluated and the methodology and results
are presented in Annex 3. Operators in medium-sized cities generally made good investment
decisions, particularly the two largest operators: Triple A in Atlantico and Aguas de la Sabana in
Sincelejo and Corozal. The evaluation indicated that the investment programs in the two
construction-operation contracts (La Linea and San Onofre) were not well formulated. It is
important to highlight the ―constructor-operator‖ was not primarily accountable for the definition
of the investment program which was defined in advance by the MAVDT/municipalities through
consultancy contracts. For example, during ICR preparation the operator for the regional sub-
project La Linea (Giscol) noted continual challenges in negotiating amendments to the existing
contract to adjust the investment program. This highlights a built-in tension in the ―constructor-
operator‖ model in which the Employer has to control the scope of construction but the
constructor/operator needs flexibility to adjust the investment program according to operational
requirements.

The overall rating for Project efficiency is calculated using a population weighted scoring
system as shown in the table below, and the overall rating for efficacy is considered
substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The ICR rates the overall outcome of the Project as “satisfactory” based on a “high” rating
for relevance, and “substantial” ratings for efficacy and efficiency. The Project was successful
in introducing the private sector operator model to the Caribbean region of Colombia, and
improvements in service were demonstrated by three operators in medium sized cities covering
12 municipalities: Triple A, Aguas de la Sabana, and Uniaguas. The construction-operation
model has not yet demonstrated its viability, but fortunately the Project scaled back on this
model during implementation and focused on the operation with investment model.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The Project has had a dramatic impact on poverty. Approximately 1.3 million people in the
lower economic stratum (1, 2, and 3) received improved water supply service, although the level
of improvement depends on the specific municipality. There was also a 23% increase in the
number of households connected to the water distribution systems, from 61% to 84%, certainly
almost of all them from low-income households. Households not connected to the distribution
systems typically purchase water from water tankers, often at high prices. Higher connection
rates do not only imply greater convenience and access to safe water, but the cost of water also is
significantly reduced. This is particularly true in Colombia where low-income households
receive implicit subsidies through lower utility tariffs.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutional strengthening has occurred at multiple levels. At the national level, the Project
helped build the capacity of MAVDT, particularly through the Corporate Modernization
Program (PME), in the implementation of the Project. Component D financed a significant share
of the specialized consultant team in MAVDT that helped promote, structure, and supervise the
introduction of private operators under the Project and throughout the country. Efforts to
improve environmental management (Component B) and rural water and sanitation (Component
C), however were less successful than expected.




                                                        13
  Component B: Environmental management capacity strengthening for the
  sector, with a focus on wastewater management. Wastewater management smaller
  municipalities in Colombia is a particular challenge with only treatment levels of less
  than 30%, and treatment plants often not functioning properly. The Project financed
  the development of a decision support tool for assisting in the planning of smaller
  municipal wastewater treatment plants. Generic plans, costs, specifications, and
  manuals were developed for over 13 treatment technologies. The planning and
  decision support tool allows users to work through different options, pick the most
  appropriate treatment technology, and then provide guidance on the planning and
  design. Although potentially useful, the ICR team understands that the planning tool
  has not been formally disseminated and put into practice.

   Component C: Development of a rural water and sanitation policy. To address
  the challenges water services in rural areas, the following activities were financed
  through the Project: i) the preparation, publication and dissemination of the document
  "Public Policy Guidelines for Drinking Water and Sanitation for Rural Colombia‖, ii)
  a Rural Health Inventory in 18 departments of the country; and iii) a series of
  capacity building exchanges and workshops at the community, local government and
  international levels. While policy directions were identified, the MAVDT‘s rural
  water program became inactive and a national rural water policy was not formally
  defined. During the course of the ICR evaluation the Bank team was informed the
  MAVDT is currently formulating a rural water policy to address this recognized gap
  in sector policy that is directly linked to the PDAs and which will be structured based
  on the outputs from this Project component.


The Project also helped to build a base of private operators who gained experience in dealing
with smaller municipalities. Under the Project there were 14 private sector concession contracts
which have helped to widen and strengthen the pool of competent operators in the sector. The
general trend is for operators to gain experience in a larger municipality and then spread out into
neighboring smaller municipalities, bring their experience and expertise to bear in the small
markets that usually would be unattended. This was certainly the case for Triple A in Atlántico,
which expanded outwards from the city of Barranquilla.

The Project also helped to at least partially break down the short-term view of water service
delivery at the municipal level where mayors are elected on four year cycles. Previously there
was a tendency of mayors to rely on inefficient direct municipal management which afforded the
opportunity for political interference. Such short-term horizons have proved highly detrimental
to the coverage and quality of water supply and sewerage operations that are capital-intensive
and require professional management. Through the stability afforded by long-term operator
contracts the previous ―short-termism‖ has been replaced by steady improvement of the capacity
and asset base of the private operators which has then resulted in higher coverage and quality of
services.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

An ICR review workshop was conducted in Bogota on April 11, 2011 with representatives of the
MAVDT. The Bank team presented the following components: i) evaluation process
methodology, ii) identified strengths and weaknesses of project design, iii) principal results
including technical and financial analyses, iv) overall scoring of the Project and stakeholders,
and v) recommendations and lessons learned. See Annex 7 for a description of discussion.
MADVT endorsed the overall results of the ICR including the overall evaluation of the Project
as satisfactory. MADVT also endorsed the satisfactory performance rating of the World Bank
and highlighted that the World Bank and MADVT worked in partnership in Project design and
implementation. Given the overall success of the Project, the PME, and significant effort
expended by MADVT in Project design and supervision, MADVT representatives felt that a
satisfactory rating was warranted.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Policy Risk: The national government promotion and support of the private sector option in
Colombia has been instrumental in achieving the Project results. The Colombian government has
formerly adopted this policy through the CONPES Document 3385 of 2005, which established
that allocation of National Government resources would be linked to processes of business
modernization.
In addition, the promotion and consolidation of improved operational management is one of the
main objectives of the PDA, as adopted in 3463 CONPES documents 2007, Act 1151 of 2007,
and Act 1176 of 2007. The risk that in the future the national government will reverse its strong
policy support operators is therefore considered low.

Contractual Risk: This risk refers to breaches in contract, either by the municipality or the
operator, which would result in a cessation of the contract. Most of the operator contracts have
experienced multiple amendments and the arrival of new municipal administrations often results
in a reexamination of the contractual arrangements. There have already been a number of sub-
projects in which the original operator was unable to comply with contract stipulations and has
since been replaced with new operators that have demonstrated their capacity to sustain
operations. For example, in Magangué the original operator (Aguas Kapital) was not performing
well and was replaced with MAVDT facilitation by another (Aquaseo). The contractual risk is
therefore considered to be substantial.

Financial Risk: This refers to the risk that the water business in a specific municipality may not
be profitable over the long-run and thus not sustainable. The financial risk rating is considered
substantial. A comprehensive financial analysis of five operators covering 14 municipalities was
undertaken and the results are presented in Annex 3. A fundamental indicator is the working
ratio, which is also a PDO indicator, is presented below:

(Medium-Cities)
Construction-Operation    0.92             0.77         < 0.6               0.8                  0
(Small Cities)

For the operation with investment model, three operators were analyzed. The weighted average
working ratio decreased slightly to 0.87, which is still significantly above the target of 0.6. In
2010, three largest cities all had 2010 working ratios under 1.0: Soledad, Sincelejo, and Maicao.
The average working ratio however is 1.2, which indicates that most operators are struggling
financially—particularly the smaller ones. For example, in the five Triple A municipalities in
Atlántico that were analyzed, only Soledad had a working ratio under 1.0. In Atlántico, Triple A
subsidizes operations in the smaller municipalities for social objectives, primarily because it has
sufficient cash flow from its two major operations in Soledad and Barranquilla. Similarly, for
Aguas de la Sabana the more lucrative operations in Sincelejo allow it support the smaller
neighboring city of Corozal.

In general, the operators showed improved operational and commercial performance, as
measured by collection rate (85%-96%), micro-metering (> 80%), and falling operating costs.
The key driver for financial sustainability appears to be tariff and transfer practices in each city.
Tariffs were originally defined in the concession contract, but in most cases the tariff regime has
been modified to either follow the national regulatory regime or to annually negotiate tariffs and
transfer with the municipal government. In general, operators which have linked their tariff
regime to national regulations have achieved, or are close to, full cost recovery levels. In contrast,
operators which tariffs linked to the original contract, or negotiate tariffs with the municipality,
are generally struggling financially.

The most illustrative case of the importance of the tariff regime is the case of operator Aguas de
la Sabana. In 2002 when the operator initiated its contract in Sincelejo and Corozal, tariffs in the
two municipalities were largely similar. However, Sincelejo has since adjusted tariffs to align
with the national regulatory framework while Corozal has not. By 2010, Sincelejo‘s tariffs were
twice that of Corozal‘s tariffs. Although both municipalities have decreased their reliance on
municipal transfers, the operation in Sincelejo is now profitable, while the operator is struggling
financially in Corazal.

The overall rating of risk to the Project development objectives is based on the policy risk level
(low), the contractual risk level (substantial) and the financial risk level (substantial) and is
considered as substantial.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

The ICR rates Bank performance during preparation as “satisfactory”. The Project design was
well aligned with the Government‘s priorities, incorporated the experience from private sector
participation both within Colombia and abroad, and helped structure model bidding documents
for two types of novel contracts: i) operation with investment; and ii) construction with operation.
The Project was designed in a flexible and programmatic manner, which allowed it to evolve
over time as necessary. The PAD explicitly identified the main risks and accurately identified the
Project risk level as ―high.‘‖ Minor shortcomings during preparation include the somewhat
misplaced emphasis on small cities utilizing the ―construction with operation‖ model and the
over reliance on model bidding documents which in practice did not prove very effective during
implementation—shortcomings that only became evident during project implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision

The ICR rates Bank performance during supervision as “satisfactory”. The Project was prepared
and supervised by same Bank task team leader until July 2009, until the very closing stages of
the Project. The Bank team provided considerable technical support to both the operators and
the MAVDT during Project implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: The ICR rates the overall Bank performance as “satisfactory” given that Bank
performance during both preparation and during implementation has been rated as ―satisfactory‖.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) National Government Performance

The Ministry of Economic Development was initially responsible for the project preparation, and
the Project was prepared by the project implementing unit for the then on-going Bank financed
Municipal Development Project. The Project was approved in October 2001, and the Uribe
presidential administration took office at the start of 2002. The new administration merged the
Ministry of Economic Development into the newly created MAVDT. In the early years of the
Project there was at times insufficient staff and frequent management changes from MAVDT
which hindered Project implementation. The formal establishment of a Vice Minister of Water
in MAVDT helped to stabilize Project staffing and management, and the Project moved into high
gear after 2006. MAVDT provided significant support and supervision for the Project, helping to
structure and supervise the concession contracts, entering into agreements with municipal
governments for the transfer of Bank funds, and supervising Project implementation, in
coordination with the Bank team.



                                                17
The Bank-financed Project was part of the broader MAVDT Corporate Modernization Program
(PME) which supported the introduction private operators in an additional 10 municipalities (See
Annex 1). Actual counterpart funding was 100% greater than originally forecast, increasing from
$15 million to $30 million 4. In addition, the government adopted a series of resolutions and
decrees to strengthen private sector participation.

Although there were early short comings in the national governments implementation of the
Project, these were compensated by the increasing acceleration of implementation and expansion
of the Project concept over time. The overall national government performance is therefore rated
as “moderately satisfactory.”

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

The Project was primarily implemented by the operators, who were responsible for executing the
works, either through construction contracts in the case of the 11 operation with investment
contracts or directly in the case of three construction with operation contracts. As expected, the
performance of the operators varied considerably with some clear leaders, such as Triple A and
Aguas de la Sabana, and obviously ineffective operators such AguasKapital in Magangué. The
overall operator performance is judged as satisfactory given the amount of works executed as
well the overall improvement in infrastructure quality and service in most subprojects.

    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

While the National Government performance was rated as “moderately satisfactory”, the
performance of the Implementing Agencies, who were responsible for the bulk of projection
execution, was rated as “satisfactory". Therefore the overall borrower performance is rated
“satisfactory.”

6. Lessons Learned

General Lessons for Colombia’s Water Sector:

1. Specialized (Private) Operators Are the Preferred Approach for Medium-Size Cities:
After decades of stagnation in improving water service in medium-sized cities, the Project
demonstrated that under the right circumstances a private operator can significantly improve
water services. The Colombian experience in the Latin America context where private sector
participation is increasingly rare is noteworthy. The key ingredient is national government
support, including: an enabling policy context, infusion of financing, and technical assistance
coupled with supervision. The Project, however, only represents the beginning of a process in
Colombia that has yet to be fully consolidated and has many shortcomings to address.

2. National Government’s Technical Assistance Program Is Critical: The Departmental
Water Plans (PDA) represents the second generation national government policy initiative to

    Refers only to Component A3. See Annex 1.



                                                18
promote and consolidate private operators by channeling resources through and assigning more
sector responsibility to the Departments. Nevertheless, there will always be a need for
comprehensive and significant national government technical and regulatory support and
oversight to departments, municipalities, and operators. This requires an adequate allocation of
budget, staffing, and continuous attention by the responsible national government agency.

3. Operator Selection Process Needs to Be Refined: The original Project concept of awarding
concession contracts based on the lowest cost subsidy was theoretically sound, but did not work
well in practice. Original investments plans were not well formulated, tariff regimes not
maintained, and actual subsidy levels varied widely. The quality of the operator is the most
important factor, and in practice this has little to do with which bidder offers the lowest subsidy
requirement during bidding. An alternative approach would be to select operators based on
experience and quality (similar to consultant selection) rather than primarily on financial
considerations (such as a civil works contractor).

4. Need to Better Incorporate Technical Dimensions into Performance Goals and
Investment Plans: A number of common technical issues were encountered which hindered
improvements in service, including: inadequate raw water supply sources, frequent power
outages, high levels of unaccounted for water, low levels of micro-metering, and lack of
attention to network sectorization. Sophisticated water utilities (such as Triple A) are usually
able to address these technical challenges, but most of the smaller operators are overwhelmed by
these problems. In some cases, unrealistic performance targets were set without a clear plan to
resolve these issues. There is a need to improve technical assistance to the operators and
municipalities.

5. Must Guarantee that Pledged Subsidies Are Provided to the Operator: Subsidies are
provided to both support investments and to cover below-cost tariffs for low-income strata in
Colombia. The Project established clear mechanisms for channeling national investment subsides
through independent fiduciaries that ensure funds go directly to investment project (as opposed
to being diverted by municipal governments). Operators, however, faced a constant challenge in
ensuring that municipal governments provided their agreed-upon subsidies. This issue is being
slowly addressed through a number of national government decrees, but direct negotiations
between operators and mayors is still the norm and can potentially undermine the financial
sustainability of the operator.

6. Utilization of National Tariff Regime for Private Operators Is Preferred. The ICR
analysis shows that when tariffs are set according to national regulatory framework administered
by the CRA, cost recovery improves, dependence on municipal transfers decreases and financial
results are enhanced. In contrast, tariff regimes formulated at the start of the concession contract
were often based on inaccurate investment and operational assumptions that resulted in operator
under-funding. Likewise, tariffs which are based on direct negotiations with municipal
governments are often disadvantageous to operators and based on political considerations rather
than actual financial needs.

7. Strategy for Small Municipalities Still Lacking: The construction-operation model for
small municipalities (less than 12,000) did not perform well under the Project and the long-term

                                                19
sustainability of the contracts is uncertain. There is a need to develop new approaches for serving
this segment of the population.

8. Wastewater and Stormwater Drainage Policies and Programs Need to Be Developed:
The expansion of sewerage coverage under the project was minimal and none of the Project
municipalities have wastewater treatment. Although an initial focus on water supply is
understandable, the problems associated with collection and treatment will need to be addressed
in the future, requiring new policies, strategies and investments. None of the municipalities have
storm-water drainage systems, resulting in significant damage to roads and economic losses
during storms. There is a need to develop clear national government policies and strategies to
address these pressing issues.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies:

MADVT representatives objected to the national government performance rating of moderately
satisfactory, noting that the delay in the final audit report was a relatively minor issue.

Water Quality Monitoring8

The issue of water quality was captured through a broader indicator related to disinfected
supply which was interpreted to be intended to capture data of water potability in
participating municipalities. Given that there was no indicator specified in the PAD that
related directly to water quality, it was not included as part of the evaluation of the PDOs.
Monitoring of this indicator was initiated, however, in 2007 by the National Institute of
Health through the Risk Index of Water Quality for Human Consumption (IRCA) which
defines the physical, chemical and bacteriological quality of water through monthly
samples. The most recent data collected (December 2010) through the IRCA for each of
the participating municipalities is presented below.

Annex 3: Economic Analysis: Evaluation of Investment Efficiency9

This Annex presents the engineering economic analysis of selected municipal water and
sewerage systems comprised of a qualitative assessment of the efficiency of investments
in regards their effect of increasing service. To evaluate the efficiency of investments a
four point scale was applied as defined below:

Investment Efficiency                Criteria

Negligible                           Refers to those investments that have not generated a real impact on the
                                     conditions of service to users and have not positively influenced
                                     performance indicators.

                                     Example: Extending network coverage with limited production capacity

Moderate                             Refers to those investments that have generated a limited impact on the
                                     conditions of service, but have been defined through inappropriate
                                     prioritization criteria.

                                     Example: Construction of storage tanks as part of an operation
                                     characterized by intermittent supply.

Substantial                          Refers to those investments that have generated a modest impact on the
                                     conditions of service, even if they were defined with appropriate
                                     prioritization criteria.

                                     Example: Expansion of treatment capacity in a system whose source is
                                     subject to intermittent electricity.

High                                 Refers to those investments that have generated a positive impact on the
                                     conditions of service, and are the outcome of proper planning and
                                     prioritization.

                                     Example: Installation of back-up power in a system reliant on pumping
                                     stations.

                           management. There has also been a prioritization of investments in
                           sanitation rather than in water supply, despite awareness of the existing
                           limitations of service.

Insergrup     San Onofre   In response to energy intermittency, the operator has not focused on        Negligible
                           energy alternatives that would facilitate the operation and continued
                           improvement of continuity. Investments in water supply have focused
                           on strengthening production components (rehabilitation of wells,
                           pumping stations, and the expansion of semi-buried storage tanks) as
                           well as optimizing the distribution network. This approach has
                           strengthened the capacity which was necessary to improve conditions of
                           service. However it is worth noting that in the prioritization of
                           investments, major works were left out such as optimizing or replacing
                           the conduction line from the tank to the distribution network, the
                           primary distribution network configuration and the sectorization of
                           networks with macrometering, which would have positively impacted
                           conditions of service, particularly the continuity of supply.

                               Annex 4: Financial Analysis


The PAD stated that ―the proposed reform program will be successful only if it is
structured to attract potential investors and lenders. In order to ensure success, the
proposed PSP structures must allow sufficiently attractive rate of return to potential
investors and provide adequate financial comfort to lenders‖. The ICR therefore assessed
efficiency of the Project based on a financial analysis of 14 operators, representing 67%
of all World Bank financed subprojects.

To examine how successful the project was a financial analysis of the service as well as
of the operators was carried out. This analysis was based on: the utilities‘ audited
historical and pro-forma financial statements from the year the contract started to 2009,
the non-audited financial statement of 2010, and the projected financial conditions to the
end of the contract. The following indicators were measured: (i) estimated net present
value and internal rate of return from operation during the contract lifetime; (ii) estimated
net present value of shareholders‘ cash flow and internal rate of return during the contract
lifetime; (iii) cost recovery through tariffs and fund transfers from Municipalities; and
(iv) financial performance of the operation. The evaluation is complemented with a
sensitivity analysis, which shows room the operators have for additional improvements
and returns.

The financial results from the operation were analyzed based on historical results of the
operation complemented with the expected results for the remaining time of the contract.
The revenue stream of the operation was estimated for each municipality when
information was available; while the revenue stream of shareholders was estimated for
each operator, which in a number of cases served more than one municipality.

Results
The results of the analysis indicate that all operators have realized improvements since
the initiation of their contracts, yet a number are still showing losses. Improvements are
most evident in the working ratio, which was selected in the PAD as one of the
performance indicators, and measures the relation between operating costs (without
depreciation) and operating revenues. Most operators have decreased their working ratio,
however, only one (Giscol) reached the expected target. Upon further analysis arising
from known problems in service provision in this specific case, the principal driver for
having reached the working ratio target is the contractual model (constructor -operator)
which is designed to allow the operator to generate revenues not only from the operation,
but more importantly from the construction of civil works.

In assessing the aggregated financial performance of the operators with contracts in
multiple municipalities it is of relevance to note that all but one show positive results,
with net margins ranging between 5% and peaking as high as 22%. Yet when
disaggregated at the municipal level only four of the fourteen operators chosen for the
sample show positive net income, with losses as high as 91% of revenues. Importantly,
the reason for these differences is that operations in some municipalities are profitable
and therefore compensate the losses of neighboring municipalities served by the same
operator. The variability of results can largely be explained by differences in tariffs,
transfers from municipalities, operating costs and commercial performance.

Tariffs and transfers were initially defined in the respective operation contracts, however
with appropriate amendments some municipalities and operators have since either agreed
to adjust tariffs to align with the national regulatory framework, or to annually negotiate
tariffs and corresponding transfers for subsidies provided to low income customers.
Depending on these agreements the sharing of both sources of revenues (tariffs and
transfers), and the resulting cost recovery vary widely among operators. In general those
that have adjusted tariffs to the regulatory framework have achieved or are close to
achieving full cost recovery, have decreased dependence on transfers from the
municipality, and have improved their financial results. Meanwhile, those with tariffs
and transfers negotiated on a yearly basis or with tariffs that remain linked to the
operation contract, have neither reached full cost recovery, nor achieved positive returns.

These differences have resulted in important variations in tariffs among some
neighboring municipalities which share same operator, same water production system,
and same socioeconomic conditions. When ADESA initiated its contract in Sincelejo and
Corozal in 2002, for example, tariffs in the two municipalities were largely similar.
However, Sincelejo has since adjusted tariffs to align with the national regulatory
framework while Corozal did not and by 2010, Sincelejo‘s tariffs were twice that of
Corozal‘s. Although both municipalities have decreased their reliance on municipal
transfers, the operation in Sincelejo is now profitable, while Corozal has increased its
operational losses and also decreased cost recovery.

Operational and commercial performance has generally improved through improved
revenue collection rate, micro metering, and operating costs. In a number of
municipalities for example, the revenue collection rate is between 85% - 96% and
household metering has increased from to levels higher than 80% in most municipalities.
Importantly, notable improvements in service continuity has generated tacit acceptance of
installing household meters. While operation costs per cubic meter produced have
decreased in most cases analyzed, there is still room for improvements particularly
through reductions in unaccounted for water and gains in efficient energy usage.

*In Arjona the 2010 revenue collection rate is higher than 100% because it includes accounts payable
in arrears.

The capital structure of the operators is also revealing in regards to how each company is
financing its overall operations and provides insight into its comparative level of risk
exposure.
Using the balance sheets of the operators results show that both Triple A and Giscol
present sound debt-equity ratios, with 40% or more of their assets financed with
equity. However in Giscol this result could be explained by the Government transfers
received in anticipation of the works to be implemented, and therefore the situation is not
that sounds as it appears; no further analysis could be made due to lack of information.

Financial returns were evaluated for the provision of service (by municipality) and the
operator as a whole, the net cash flow was estimated using actual values from the year of
contract initiation to 2009, and projected values until the end of the contract. For the
projection it was assumed that all indicators shown in 2009 remained constant, that is,
service coverage, operating costs, tariffs, municipalities‘ transfers, and unaccounted for
water. Tariffs and transfers from municipalities were projected based on 2010 values
adjusted only by inflation. The net cash flow of the each municipal service was estimated
without financing. The net cash flow for the operator was estimated using existing
practices for dividend distribution. Cash flows were transformed to 2009 prices to show
results in real terms without inflation.

The results show that the operation in Soledad (Triple A), La Linea (Giscol), and
Sincelejo (ADESA) will yield positive returns assuming current conditions prevail.
However, as previously noted the returns obtained by Giscol are based on payments
received for construction of works rather than the operation through improved service
provision. In Soledad and Sincelejo, although improvements could be achieved and
therefore improved financial returns obtained, existing returns have come based on
service improvements and efficiency gains.

  (1) In the case of Soledad, the returns for the operator correspond to the present value of the annual payment shareholders are
 getting from the operation, which corresponds to 4.5% of revenues . This amount is registered as an administrative cost of the
 operation. Capital and Dividends were not estimated due to lack of information.


A sensitivity analysis was conducted to measure the impact on returns. The chosen
variables for this analysis were: tariffs, municipalities‘ transfers, and operating cost. The
analysis was done for those operators and utilities whose returns were lower than 10% in
the base case scenario. The results were varied indicating that some municipalities
remain very sensitive to small changes in the selected variables, while in others the
required changes are significant as is the case of Corozal.

Lessons learned from the financial analysis

A. The contracts should provide incentives to the operators for improving the service and
   financing as much as possible the operation and the required investment. In the
   financial analysis of the sample of the utilities some flaws were noticed, which can be
   addressed in the new contracts.

B. Current contracts can allow operators to obtain profits even when they provide poor
   service. Such is the case of construction-operation contracts, which gives more
   incentives for doing the construction than the operation. Same with the concession
   contracts such as the one in Maicao, which provides more incentive in supervising
   the works than doing the operation. The new contracts should focus on operation with
   investment, paying more attention on incentives for efficiency improvement.

C. The financial analysis of the sample of utilities showed that when tariffs were set
   according to National Regulatory Framework, cost recovery improves, dependence
   on municipal transfers decreases, and financial results improves. When tariff reflects
   the cost of providing the service, and this is accompanied by commercial efficiency,
   the customers get the right signal for water efficient usage. If this is the case, the
   transfers from the municipalities would be used not only to cover operating costs just
   to compensate for subsidies of poor income customers, but also to partially cover
   investment. New contracts should promote the design of tariffs according to the
   regulatory framework and established targets that give incentive for efficiency
   improvements.

D. Some of the municipalities have been subsidizing others; such is the case of Sincelejo
   with Corazol. This can put in risk the whole operation. The new contracts should
   allow the financial balance on the operation of each of the municipalities included in
   the contract. Tariffs and amount of transfers should be measured in detail to avoid
   deficit in one municipality to be covered by another municipality.

          Annex 5: Specific Lessons for the Corporate Modernization Program10

The following points highlight some of the lessons learned in the development and
selection of specialized operators under the PME program.

Programming of the Resources Contributed by the Nation: Structuring of the early
concession contracts underestimated the time needed for processing national government
contributions, and as a result some operators received resources much later than expected,
thereby reducing service improvements expected of the new operators.

Write-Off of Pre-Existing Liabilities: In some processes, the liabilities of the old public
companies, prior to the arrival of the private operators, were not covered and the
responsibility was delegated to the municipalities. This generated the risk of labor unrest
as workers made legal claims against the municipality. In one case, the start date was
delayed for almost two years because the electric power company did not provide service
until the municipality paid the arrears.

Bid Preparation Time: In most processes, short periods were assigned for bid
preparation considering the agreements have durations of ten or more years. Periods of
less than two months for the preparation of proposals were identified in at least nine
processes. This tendency is likely to provoke uncertainty, as it forces bidders to use high
safety factors in their estimates, and discourages participation of investors who are more
risk averse or who have business models that demand a good knowledge of the
infrastructure.

Uncertainty of Investment plans at Pre-Feasibility Level: Many municipalities that
initiated the concession process had large investment backlogs, lacked basic information
on the extent and quality of the infrastructure, and did not have Master Plans. However,
given the urgency of presenting a solution to limited water services, and the short time
frame with which city mayors were granted to initiate the process, concession agreements
were structured based on conceptual investment plans and poorly defined Master Plans.

Definition of Scope and Quality of the Concession Contract Supervision
(Interventor): The supervision role should be based on meeting the established
commitments but in most cases the contract did not include a definition of the monitoring
tasks, nor of the indicators to be monitored. In addition municipalities often appointed
contract supervision firms that did not have the correct profile, and they evidenced more
interest in intervening in the operator‘s administrative decisions than in the achievement
of contract targets.

Rapid Implementation of the Immediate Investment Action Plan: The initial PME
model allowed for a selected operator to only have a conceptual investment plan and that

studies at the design level were initiated once the operation started. The operator was then
responsible for submitting the project for approval and beginning the necessary
proceedings to sign the financial support agreement with the Nation, and to later
implement the bidding process for the procurement of works. This proved to be a lengthy
cycle which resulted in a negative effect on community perceptions of the process as a
result of limited improvements in the quality of service. Recent processes have included
schemes allowing for the essential works to begin immediately following the arrival of
the operator.

Continuity of Municipal Political Support: Often concession processes that were
awarded during a specific mayor‘s term were subject to the opposition of other party
candidates during the next mayoral election campaigns. A newly elected opposition
mayor often presented obstacles to the operator by delaying municipal contributions and
using the service as a political tool. The lesson learned is that the process to establish an
arrangement with a new operator must involve not only the municipal administration but
also the community in general and the other political groups in the region.

                 Annex 7: Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

 An ICR review workshop was conducted in Bogota on April 11, 2011, between the ICR
team and representatives of the MAVDT. The presentation comprised the following key
components: i) evaluation process methodology, ii) identified strengths and weaknesses
of project design, iii) principal results including technical and financial analyses, iv)
overall scoring of the Project and stakeholders, and v) recommendations and lessons
learned.

The workshop was well attended and outputs equally well received from MAVDT
participants. There was general consensus with the Project scoring based on its overall
relevance, compliance with PDO indicators, efficiency of investments, and level of
financial risk. Following the workshop, the MAVDT submitted a formal request that the
scoring of their performance be increased from Moderately Satisfactory to Satisfactory in
light of i) a significant increase in counterpart funding throughout the life of the project
($30M to $45M), ii) the expansion of the project using counterpart funds to include
municipalities outside of the Colombian Caribbean coast, iii) the direct link that the
project has to the existing national policy as defined in the Planes Departmentales de
Agua, and iv) the close and continuous contact that the Ministry had with the operators
involved in the project.

Discussion focused on several lessons learned, the most salient of which included:

      Recognition that the key variables of project design include water tariffs,
       available financial resources for investment, and the defined service delivery
       targets for an operator. Given that the relative weight/importance of these
       variables changes across different municipalities, the quality and experience of
       the selected operator was noted to be of critical importance.
      Debt liabilities assumed by newly installed operators from their public
       predecessors was noted to be a particularly challenging problem in establishing a
       steady pace of project implementation and ensuring the sustainability of the new
       operators.
      The role of the supervisor/interventor for the operator (contracted by the
       Municipal Government) in supervising the performance of the operator was
       highlighted as a critical but often neglected issue. It is important to define clearly
       the supervisor‘s role and provide sufficient budget for the task.

   Annex 8: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


1. The Ministry of Environment, Housing and Territorial Development believes that
   significant benefits were obtained through the implementation of the Business
   Modernization Program (WEP), supported by the World Bank through IBRD loan 7077-
   CO, in improving services water and sewage in terms of coverage, continuity, quality,
   sustainability, water culture and reasonable costs in those participating municipalities,
   with major advances in most cases.

2. In addition to the improvements achieved in the indicators of service delivery in
   participating municipalities, the loan was instrumental in the political dynamics of linking
   private-sector involvement in the administration and operation of water and sewage
   systems in the country, and promoting institutionalization of regional schemes as a tool
   for municipalities where a lack of sustainable institutional policies and a profound
   weakness in planning for the use of funds from different sources were evident.

3. The implementation of the Project is considered to be the essential input for the design of
   the current national government policy of the Departmental Water Plans (PDA), which
   includes within its main objectives the acceleration and expansion of the institutional
   arrangements for the provision of public services of drinking water and basic sanitation
   as well as furthering the use of regional schemes to capitalize on potential economies of
   scale.

4. The focus of the Project on medium and small cities has strengthened the market for
   specialized operators in the country, which increases the viability of processes occurring
   in the context of the PDA. Thus there are currently around 160 municipalities with
   specialized private in the country that are serviced by at least 30 business groups.

5. Regarding the results and lessons presented and discussed at the workshop held on April
   11, 2011, it is considered that the analysis and conclusions presented by the Bank's
   evaluation team provided an integrated overview of the aspects of the implementation
   experience of the loan, without neglecting those who are not adequately represented by
   quantitative indicators of the project. However, with respect to the overall performance
   rating of the Ministry presented at the workshop, the MAVDT reiterates the request that
   was respectfully communicated of April 13, 2011, so that it is reconsidered.
