                         environment for improving the efficiency and                                             sustainabi lity of these utilities, and by providing them with financial
                         support to ensure their viability; (ii) expand the coverage of water and sewerage services in participating
                         municipalities; and (iii) facilitate the access of populations in low                                       income areas of participating municipalities to water and

                         populations of up to about 300,000 inhabitants, as well as in the utilities of about 25 small municipalities with populations of up to about 12,000 inha
