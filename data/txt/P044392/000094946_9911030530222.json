The key lessons\n            call, primarily, for flexibility in project design,\n            particularly for emergency operations, for, although a\n            flexible approach was followed in financing certain items,\n            allowing a quick response to emergency needs, there were\n            nonetheless, difficulties in securing donor financing, which\n            caused implementation delays in the second phase of the\n            project, with further delays in disbursements of the Trust\n            fund Credit, also because of lack of available financing.\n            This indicates that, in the absence of co-financing\n            commitments, project components would better remain\n            independent, and viable on their own, considering the\n            importance of a timely closure in an emergency project.\n            Advance mechanisms for emergency operations are critical, as\n            demonstrated by the difficulties experienced in handling\n            transfers, and adjustment disbursements, through the Project\n            Start-Up Advances. It is suggested, an extended Project\n            Preparation Facility could be useful, and thus avoid\n            difficulties encountered in project transfers of funds.\n            Attention should be given to the essential role of a strong\n            project unit within the beneficiary, for, its effective\n            contribution will prod success, through adequate support and autonomy."}, "docdt": "1999-10-06T00:00:00Z"}
