The project will consist of:\n            (i) the establishment of a Fisheries Manpower Development\n            Center, a self-contained training facility to meet the\n            fisheries sector's trained manpower needs; (ii)\n            financing of teaching equipment for the training of\n            refrigeration technicians; and (iii) a Fisheries Village\n            Development component consisting of the development of four\n            existing fisheries cooperatives comprising five villages by\n            providing integrated fish landing, handling, storage,\n            marketing, transport and repair facilities to enable them to\n            handle all fisheries-related activities from catch to final\n            retail marketing.
