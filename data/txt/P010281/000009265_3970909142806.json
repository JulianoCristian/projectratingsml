of the Refinery Energy\n            Conservation and Modernization Project for Pakistan was\n            satisfactory. The project achieved its major objectives, its\n            impact on institutional development has been substantial,\n            sustainability is likely, and both the Bank and Borrower\n            performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, there is a need for a much higher\n            degree of autonomy to parastatals and trust in key\n            officials. Overall, the state-owned refineries can perform\n            better if given autonomy and the MOP and MPNR's\n            monitoring role is confined to ensuring that the refineries\n            stay within the policy guidelines defined by the Government.\n            Second, in light of the substantial investments required to\n            reconfigure the NRL in the medium term, the GOP should\n            seriously consider developing a strategy for the involvement\n            of the private sector by appropriating changes in the\n            ownership structure of the NRL. Finally, the Bank should pay\n            more attention to the evaluation of the implementing\n            agency's authority and capability when designing and\n            appraising a project."}, "docdt": "1997-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
