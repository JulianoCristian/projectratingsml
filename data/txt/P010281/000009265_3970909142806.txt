PAKISTAN
REFINERY ENERGY CONSERVATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(LN. 2842-PAK)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Refinery Energy Conservation
and Modernization Project in Pakistan, for which LN. 2842-PAK in the amount of US$21 million
equivalent, was approved on June 16, 1987 and made effective on March 3, 1988.
The loan closed on June 30, 1996, following two extensions to the original closing date of
June 30, 1993. Final disbursement took place on November 5, 1996, at which time a balance of
US$1.38 million was canceled.
This ICR was prepared by Mikael Mengesha, Task Manager (SAIEF), Lakdasa Wijetilleke
(IENOG/Consultant) and Richard James (Financial Consultant), and reviewed by Per Ljung,
Division Chief, Energy and Project Finance, South Asia Region. The Borrower provided
comments that are included as Appendix B to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's final supervision/completion mission in
January 1996. It is based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan and Project Agreements,
supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, internal Bank
memoranda and material in the project file. The Borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR
by preparing its own evaluation of the project implementation and commenting on the draft ICR.

REFINERY ENERGY CONSERVATEION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(LN, 2842-PAK)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
An adequate supply of energy from petroleum is critical to fuel Pakistan's expanding
economy. At appraisal, Pakistan's three refineries were found to be inadequate and far below the
required capacity to meet the country's petroleum products requirements and were the primary
reason for the shortfall in domestic petroleum fuel supply. The refineries were designed during the
early 1 960s when oil was relatively inexpensive, and refineries endeavored to minimize capital cost
by designing equipment which are inefficient by current standards. The processing configuration
was ill-suited to market patterns dominated by distillate petroleum fuels, and refining capacity was
insufficient to meet demand. All of these factors exacerbated the energy deficits (para. 2).
Recognizing the possible adverse impacts of increased dependence on imported refined
petroleum products, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) accorded high priority to restructuring the
energy sector under the Sixth Plan (FY84-FY89). At that time, a core investment program was
identified under the Bank's Energy Sector Loan (LN. 2552-PAK) that pointed to the need for
refinery modernization. The Refinery Energy Conservation and Modernization Program was one
of the first projects initiated under the priority investment program (para. 3). The project
beneficiary, National Refinery Limited (NRL), is Pakistan's largest and most integrated refining
complex in terms of the range of its petroleum products.
Project Objectives
The primary objectives of the project were to: (i) improve NRL's efficiency; (ii)
reduce energy consumption through, among other measures, the generation of electricity from
waste heat; (iii) increase crude oil processing capacity and modify the output mix to better match
demand; and (iv) strengthen production optimization and control systems and train staff. The
objectives were realistic, relevant to the country's needs, and consistent with the Bank's and GOP's
strategy for the development of Pakistan's energy sector (para. 6).
Implementation Experience and Results
The project substantially achieved its institutional objectives and, on completion of the
power plant component, will substantially achieve its physical objectives. The overall assessment
of the project can be rated as satisfactory.



ii
The project's estimated cost at appraisal was US$51.0 million, including foreign costs
of US$27.4 million. Foreign costs were to be financed by the Bank (US$21.0 million) and
suppliers credits and other sources ($6.4 million). Local costs were to be funded by NRL. In
actuality, foreign funding from suppliers' credits and other sources was not required since (i)
additional Bank funds were available to NRL since PERAC used internal funds to finance lab
equipment and (ii) local engineering consultants, as opposed to foreign, were used for
implementation of three of the four components. In addition, NRL did not utilize the entire
budgeted Loan amount for training because supplementary grant funds were made available from
the Government of Japan for this purpose. On completion, the project is now estimated to cost
US$39.4 million with financing of the foreign costs by the Bank of US$19.6 million. The project
will be completed by December 1997 compared with the appraisal target of June 30, 1993 (paras.
20 and 26).
Although smaller project components were completed about a year behind schedule
due to the particular nature of revamp projects spread across the entire refinery and delays caused
during refinery turn-arounds, the co-generation power plant addition, which comprised about 60
percent of the project cost, significantly exceeded the time estimated at appraisal. This was
primarily due to micromanagement of procurement by the Ministry of Production (MOP), despite
the fact that the power component was co-financed by the Bank and the implementing agency,
NRL, following Bank guidelines. Procurement delays were further exacerbated due to the limited
autonomy granted to NRL even though the contracting arrangements were restructured in 1993
with clearly assigned responsibilities for ENAR Petrotech Services Limited (ENAR) the local
consultants on the hydrocarbon components, foreign contractors for the power component and
NRL. The power component was later further delayed pending the repair of the boiler, providing
steam for the turbine power plant, and other process requirements which were damaged in a gas
explosion in October 1996. The explosion affected areas outside the physical boundary of the Bank
project. (para. 20)
Project Sustainability
The modernization and balancing of the crude processing unit, the removal of
bottlenecks in the naphtha platformer and hydrotreater, and the revamping of the lube unit achieved
their intended development objects. Upon completion by December 1997, the 7.5 MW steam
turbine power plant is also expected to meet its objectives (para. 22). The sustainability of the
power plant component is assured as long as the refinery is in operation. However, the
sustainability of refinery operations and its profitability may be hampered if NRL is unable to retain
adequate profits (currently a minimum of 10% and maximum of 40% return on ex-refinery prices
set on import parity basis are retained) to make required investments to meet future changes in
petroleum fuels specifications which have now become mandatory in most countries to mitigate air
pollution. Overall, the project is rated as likely to sustain the achievements realized at project
completion (para. 23).



iii
Summary of Findings. Key Lessons Learned and Future Operation
NRL staff are well trained and experienced. NRL's operation of the refinery process
units is not anticipated to pose any problems. With regard to the power plant component, NRL will
need assistance from their engineering consultants to ensure the turnkey contractor honors all
warranties and guarantees until the boiler is repaired and the power plant is commissioned.
Agreement was reached with GOP\NRL to make appropriate arrangements with the turnkey
contractor and the consultants to get the required assistance (para. 30).
Given the large investments needed to meet the growing demand for petroleum
products in Pakistan with an annual growth rate of nearly 12%, an increased level of private sector
involvement in NRL is crucial to develop and fund projects such as this one in the future. The
Government has taken major steps to develop the energy sector with private sector participation
under the Petroleum Policy of February 1994 by providing various incentives. Further mitigation
of transport-related air pollution in the metropolitan areas of Pakistan is a high priority to GOP.
Therefore, the Bank is supporting GOP in developing Clean Fuels Standards, followed by a Fuels
Reformulation Study to review the health costs of lead in gasoline and sulfur In diesel, with a view
to evaluating further investments by NRL and other refineries to mitigate the effect of petroleum
products use on the environment (para. 31).
Overall, the state-owned refineries can perform better if given autonomy and the MOP
and MPNR's monitoring role is confined to ensuring that the refineries stay within the policy
guidelines defined by the Government. Attempts to micro-manage operations have a negative
impact on operations and take away the responsibilities for refinery operations from NRL
management. In addition, in light of the substantial investments required to reconfgure NRL in the
medium term, GOP should seriously consider developing a strategy for the involvement of the
private sector by appropriate changes in the ownership structure of NRL. The Bank should pay
more attention to evaluation of implementing agency's authority and capability when designing and
appraising a project.(para. 32).

REfFINERY ENERGY CONSERVATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(LN. 2842-PAK)
PART I - Project Implementation Assessment
Name:    Refinery Energy Conservation and Modernization
Loan:    2842-PAK
RVP Unit:    South Asia
Country:    Pakistan
Sector:    Energy
Sub-sector:    Refinery
Backgrond
1.    The Refinery Energy Conservation and Modernization Project was identified at a time
when the demand for energy was strong and inevitably growing to fuel Pakistan's expanding and
increasingly energy intensive economy. Growth in consumption of liquid petroleum fuels,
during the years immediately preceding project appraisal, registered an average annual rate of 6
percent, with diesel and fuel oil growth exceeding 10 percent in some years. Pakistan's domestic
energy resources, however, were being developed at a much slower pace due to public sector
financial constraints and the government's inability to mobilize private sector capital.
2.    The limited capacity of Pakistan's three refineries-the Attock Refinery, the Pakistan
Refinery and the National Refinery-also hindered production. Old and outmoded, they were
designed and built in the 1960s when energy prices were low and capital investments were
minimized. With rapid increases in oil prices, international oil companies rationalized their
operations, added energy conservation facilities and modified their processing configurations.
Similar measures, however, were not implemented in Pakistan's refineries. As a result,
Pakistan's processing costs were higher than necessary, and the mix of products did not match
demand. Continuing shortfalls in domestic supply resulted in Pakistan's increasing dependence
on imported energy.
3.    Recognizing the possible adverse impact of increased dependence on imported petroleum
products, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) accorded high priority in the Sixth Five Year Plan
(FY84-FY88) to restructuring the energy sector. The overall objectives of the Sixth Plan were to
complete the adjustment to high world energy prices by reducing the elasticity between growth in
gross domestic product (GDP) and energy demand, and by sharply increasing investment to
improve energy sector operations and efficiency. The Bank and the GOP formulated a package
of policy reforms and priority investments under an Energy Sector Loan (LN. 2552-PAK), aimed
at overcoming key bottlenecks in commercial energy supply systems. A core investment



- 2 -
program including refinery energy conservation, upgrading of existing refinery operations and
conversion of residual fuel oil to more valuable petroleum products were accorded high priority
in the reform package.
A. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
4.        This project was one of the first projects under the core investment program for the
refinery subsector identified by a Bank-financed study under the Energy Sector Loan I.
Although the refinery was well managed, it was neither energy efficient nor designed to operate
as efficiently as modem refineries due to the lack of conversion facilities to upgrade fuel oil to
distillate petroleum products. The broad objectives of the Refinery Energy Conservation and
Modernization Project were to: (i) improve refinery efficiency; (ii) reduce energy consumption
through more efficient waste energy recovery and the installation of steam-driven power plant;
(iii) improve crude oil processing capacity and modify' the output mix; and (iv) strengthen
production optimization and control systems. The objectives were realistic, relevant to the
country's needs, and consistent with the Bank's and GOP's strategy for the development of
Pakistan's energy sector.
5.    The project was designed to meet the above objectives through the following
components:
v     debottlenecking the refinery to increase its processing capacity by about 30 percent,
and thereby increase the production of naphtha, kerosene, diesel oil and fuel oil;
-     increasing the capacity of the naphtha reformer capacity to enable the refinery to
process surplus naphtha, and thereby produce additional octane blending
components;
*     reducing the consumption of fuel oil and losses in the refinery processes;
*     utilizing excess steam in the refinery system for generation of electricity; and
*     improving general refinery operations by providing training.
B. Achievement of Objectives
6.    Overall, the project substantially met its major objectives. The sector policy objectives
under the project were achieved through an improved ex-refinery pricing formula, applicable not
only to NRL but other existing refineries, to reflect import parity prices. In addition, the cap on
retained refinery profits was raised to allow NRL to invest in needed refinery re-configuration and
other improvements. Institutional development objectives were substantially met through both in-
house and external training of staff which continued throughout the life of the project, covering
disciplines from refinery management, operations, and marketing to quality control and assurance.
However, the research and development activities by PERAC/NRL envisaged under the project
were only partially realized. The completed project components have met all of their intended



-3 -
objectives; the power plant component, once completed, would also meet its physical
development objectives.
7.    Component One: Balancing and Modernizing the Crude Processing Unit and Component
Two: Debottlenecking the Naphtha Hydrotreater and Platformer. Since their operations are
interdependent, the benefits derived from balancing and modernizing the crude processing unit
and de-bottlenecking the naphtha reformer are assessed jointly. The crude unit modernization
was completed in February 1990 and the naphtha reformer in May 1995. The completion of these
two project components resulted in the following tangible benefits:
(a)   the refinery capacity was increased by 15,000 barrels per stream day (bpd) to 50,000
bpd;
(b)   the naphtha reformer capacity was increased from 2,500 bpd to 3,230 bpd;
(c)   the yield of kerosene was increased by 3,402 bpd (135,900 metric tons per annum);
and
(d)   refinery energy consumption and losses were reduced by 25 percent from 2.857
mmBTU per ton to 2.143 mmBTU per ton of feed.
8.    Component Three: Process Modifications to Lube Unit I. This project component
involved the modification of the lube oil refining process. The lube unit was made more energy
efficient, adopting advanced state of the art technology. The process modifications enhanced
product quality, reduced some energy consumption, as well as marginally increased yield.
9.    Component Four: Addition of a Captive Power Plant. The addition of a captive power
plant was intended to enable the Fuel Refinery and Lube Unit II to better meet its power
requirements by utilizing the surplus energy available from an existing steam boiler, rather than
relying exclusively on external sources for its total power supply. As the captive power plant
utilizes available energy, this addition will result in financial savings to the refinery and provide
greater reliability of power supply to NRL. To date, a 7.5 MW steam driven power generation
plant has been installed and is scheduled to be commissioned by January 1998; the 4.5 MW
diesel engine standby generators have been installed and are undergoing reliability tests. Upon
completion, the plant will supply 7.5 MW of power, out of NRL's total power demand of 21
MW and the combined system can if needed meet about 40 percent of the total demand for the
refinery.
10.   Component Five: Studies, Training and Technical Assistance. The studies commissioned
and consultants engaged under the project have enabled NRL to implement all components of the
project envisaged at appraisal, except for a few energy conservation sub-components which
became uneconomic due to increases in the investment cost after the bidding stage. About 60
NRL staff completed technical and management training in refinery operations and planning as
envisaged.  They attended international seminars on refinery economics, operations and
maintenance.

C. Economic Performance
11.   The project is essentially revamping of the National Refinery Limited, in order to
maximize the utility of existing process and infrastructure facilities and exploit the potential for
energy conservation at minimum incremental capital and operating costs. The return on
investments on a revamping project of this nature are generally high. The current return on the
project is considered satisfactory at 32 percent despite being lower than the 42 percent estimated
at appraisal. The net benefits and economic rate of return (ERR) computed are given in the table
below.

*Figures taken from the project's Staff Appraisal Report "Pakistan - Refinery Energy Conservation and Modemization Project,"
Report No. 6648-PAK, May 29, 1987.
12.   Increase in the margin between petroleum products and crude oil (which are 50% higher
than appraisal forecasts) have contributed to almost a doubling of the benefits from the Crude
Processing Unit. More importantly the increase in through-put was achieved with minimum
investment and without having to increase energy consumption.
13.   The benefits from the Platformer Debottlenecking component are lower than appraisal
estimates since they are extremely sensitive to the price margin between naphtha feed input and
output of reformate. The margin between the input and output price was squeezed as the price of
the naphtha feed input rose in response to high demand.
14.   The benefits from  the Lube Unit Modification component are lower than appraisal
estimates since even though the weight of fiuel saved is about the same as at appraisal, the value
is considerably less given that the absolute price of crude oil dropped by half to lower than
US$15 per barrel in late 1992.
15.    Substantial increases in the capital cost of the Steam Turbine Plant resulted in a lower
return than estimated. The original estimate was made on a standard frame basis. However, the
much higher bid prices received reflected the non-standard nature of the 7.5 MW steam turbine



required by NRL. The overall cost was further exacerbated by the fact that the rupee has
depreciated against the US dollar by a factor of two.
D. Major Factors Affecting the Project
16.   Significant delays in project implementation due to the dispersed nature of the revamp
work, which at times were put on hold until refinery turn-arounds were completed led to two
extensions to the original closing date of June 30, 1993, although the Bank closed all categories
after the initial one year extension with the exception of the captive power plant component.
Availability of grant funds from Japan removed the incentive to use Bank funds for training. For
this reason, combined with MOP reluctance to clear shortlists for training (para. 18), loan
proceeds amounting to less than US$2 million, allocated for training, were not fully utilized.
17.   Factors Subject to Government Control. Delays in project implementation were
largely a result of unnecessary Government interference and included:
(i)   limited authority vested in NRL (and even PERAC as the holding company) to
make procurement decisions;
(ii)  limited authority granted to NRL to commit funds and a low level of authority to
incur expenditures without the prior approval of MOP;
(iii) procurement procedures requiring MOP to review all procurement decisions, and
which more often than not, involved MOP questioning NRL recommendations and
decisions and unnecessarily reviewing consultant recommendations, especially
when these had already been reviewed and cleared by PERAC; and
(iv)   need for GOP approval to train personnel or commit funds to research and
development activities, and delays in granting these approvals;
18.   The training of staff was made difficult throughout the life of the project by MOP's
continued reluctance to clear shortlists of candidates for external training.
19.   The addition of the power plant, representing about 60 percent of project costs, was most
adversely effected by delays in implementation. Bid documents for this component were issued
over the period August 30 to September 15, 1992; bids were received on March 31, 1993; and
the evaluation was completed and recommendations made on July 27, 1993. After protracted
delays due to the need for a revised evaluation report and to queries and objections raised by the
MOP, a contract was finally signed with the supplier as recommended by the evaluation
committee on March 15, 1994, nearly nine months behind schedule. This unnecessary delay
(despite interventions by supervision missions) was the main reason for the delayed completion
of the project. While the need for monitoring of expenditures by the Ministry responsible for
parastatal agencies is required to ensure that government procedures are adhered to, the micro-
management of refinery operations defeated its purpose, particularly since these activities were
of a specialized technical nature.



-6 -
20.   Factors Not Subject to Government or Implementing Agency Control. After the
award of the contract, progress on the power plant component was satisfactory. The 4 MW
diesel generation set has been completed and is currently being commissioned. Completion of
the 7.5 MW steam turbine power generation unit, scheduled to be commissioned by December
31, 1996, was interrupted by an explosion in the boiler generating the steam, resulting in
extensive damage to both the furnace refractory and the boiler. Until they are repaired, the 7.5
MW steam turbine power generation unit cannot be commissioned and therefore project
implementation cannot be completed. It is estimated that the component will be completed in
December 1997. The boiler damage not only impacted project completion but also posed a
major problem with regard to the warranties and guaranties provided by the turnkey contractor
for the captive power plant. The Bank assisted NRL in developing a plan to ensure that the
accident would not negatively impact the supplier's performance guarantees. These measures are
discussed under future operations (para 29).
21.  The implementation of the naphtha reformer unit was delayed primarily because of delays
in the supply of furnace material from the UK vendor. These delays were exacerbated by
disagreements on amendments to the original Letters of Credit (LC) when the Bank closed all
Loan categories, except for the power plant. The Bank's special commitment lapsed, requiring
NRL to take over the responsibility for guaranteeing remaining payments.
E. Project Sustainability
22.   The sustainability of refinery operations and its profitability has been enhanced by the
investments undertaken, particularly when the power plant is commissioned. However, NRL's
sustainability may be hampered if NRL is unable to retain adequate profits (currently a minimum of
10% and maximum of 40% return on ex-refinery prices set on import parity basis are retained) to
make required investments to meet future changes in petroleum fuels specifications which have
now become mandatory in most countries to mitigate air pollution.  The balancing and
modernization of the crude processing unit improved its capacity and energy efficiency. Given
the continued increasing demand for all grades of petroleum products and the severe shortage of
refining capacity in Pakistan, the capacity increase from 34,500 to 50,000 bpd (a 30 percent
increase) and modernization of the crude unit will serve the country well. The attendant energy
conservation component will reduce processing costs by about US$6 million equivalent; again a
sustainable benefit. The naphtha reformer expansion and the installation of ancillary facilities
has enabled NRL to convert excess naphtha into 28,000 tons per year of high octane gasoline
blending component (HOBC). With consumption demand for high octane gasoline rising
rapidly, this component is an important addition to NRL.
23.   The captive power plant component would provide stable and uninterrupted electricity for
critical major equipment such as the fuel refinery. Although, additional generating capacity in
Pakistan is projected to increase by over 5,000 MW over the next ten years, frequent power-dips
can not be avoided and would pose a threat to efficient refinery operations, until the entire KESC
power distribution system  is rehabilitated.  The training and research and development
component (eventually financed primarily from the Japanese grant) provided essential activities
to develop human resources and technical capabilities and will make major contributions to

NRL's success. Overall, the project is likely to maintain the achievements realized at project
completion.
F. Bank Performance
24.   The Project was identified during implementation of the Bank's first operation in the
subsector (Refinery Engineering and Energy Conservation Project Loan 2218-PAK), which
involved mostly low-cost investments but also helped define the additional energy conservation
measures of a more capital intensive nature that became the physical aspects of this operation.
The Bank having determined that the initial proposal for such energy conservation investments
formed part of the least-cost solution to improve the efficiency of NRL was able to develop a
good overall framework in the SAR for building on the ex-refinery pricing policy reforms set out
in the GOP's "Kazi Committee Report" of 1986. In addition, appropriately the Bank made a
condition of appraisal, agreement on a sectoral investment strategy to facilitate private sector
investment in the refinery subsector.
25.   During supervision, the Bank played a significant role in over time improving ex-refinery
prices for all existing refineries, in assisting NRL to solve numerous procurement problems and
providing guidance as required during project implementation. The Bank's mediation role was
able to limit micromanagement by MOP and give comfort to consultants and contractors who at
times felt there were undue delays in NRL's decision making. The Bank carried out ten missions
after the loan became effective, almost one each year, with a reasonable continuity of staff drawn
from Bank headquarters and the Resident Mission. The frequency of the supervision missions is
deemed adequate given that it was not always possible to obtain mission clearance to Karachi
due to civil disturbances during most of 1993-95. Bank supervision was largely concentrated on
discussing factors that impeded implementation with GOP, financial matters and other
problematic contractual issues due to excessive micromanagement from Islamabad. When the
completion of the power plant was delayed, the Bank intervened to ensure that the consultants
continued to be retained to provide critical assistance to NRL until the commissioning of the
power plant.
G. Borrower Performance
26.   NRL has benefited from the professional experience gained through the project,
particularly in implementing energy conservation measures. PERAC and NRL gave adequate
support to the project during both appraisal and implementation. However, GOP should have
delegated more authority to the Beneficiary, NRL, thereby expediting the implementation of the
project. Unnecessary intervention in project management and procurement by GOP caused
delays in implementation, resulting in a deficient rating for Borrower performance in
implementation. NRL's overall perforrnance, however, is considered satisfactory despite the
lack of autonomy to manage the project independently of GOP. NRL staff on both the
hydrocarbon and power components were motivated and performed and understood their roles
and functions. However, there was scope for maintaining greater oversight and coordination with



- 8 -
contractors. Also, strikes and the law and order situation in Karachi, particularly in the general
industrial area of eastern Karachi, impacted the implementation schedule. Contract management
was significantly improved in the latter half of the project, when NRL management, the
consultants and contractor were able to better coordinate their efforts. Recognizing the need to
develop a critical mass of management skills regarding the captive power plant, a new Power
Division under a General Manager has been established for the operations phase of this
component.
27.   While the trend in policy dialogue has always been positive, there remained a strong
disposition in MPNR to regulate returns to NRL and the other refineries through a cost-plus
approach. Hence GOP was slow in implementing the Bank's policy advice in this area until
recently, when eventually the ex-refinery pricing formula began to approach import parity
pricing levels. To date no grassroots refinery projects have been initiated, partly due to the
volatility of petroleum markets, but also partly because of investors perception of a highly
regulated market.
H. Assessment of Outcome
28.   The project needs to be separated into two parts to comment on the outcome. The
outcome of first part, refinery (hydrocarbon) project components related to balancing and de-
bottlenecking, was highly satisfactory. The project components were timely, well conceived,
met all of their objectives, and enhanced the refinery's economic and financial viability. The
following specific benefits were achieved:
*  Refinery crude distillation capacity increased from  34,000 bpd to 50,000 bpd,
increasing production as follows:
(in metric tons per annum)
LPG         5,000
Naphtha      11,100
Kerosene     135,900
Diesel Oil   171,600
Fuel Oil    219,600
*  Naphtha reformer capacity was increased from 2,980 bpd to 3,800 bpd.
*  The lube unit revamp resulted in the reduction of energy cost consumption in this unit
by 4,970 metric tons of fuel oil equivalent.
*  Energy consumption was reduced from 3.1 tons per 100 metric tons of feed to 2.9 tons
per 100 tons of feed for the refinery.
*  In addition, the demonstration of benefits from NRL's modernization and energy saving
investments lead the other two refineries to initiate similar investments.

29.   The second part, the captive power plant, is still a work in progress. The addition of the
power plant well ensure a stable supply of electricity for critical refinery units. The 4 MW diesel
power generation unit has been installed and is under commissioning. The 7.5 MW steam
turbine unit is 95 percent physically complete but cannot be commissioned until December 31,
1997, for the reasons explained earlier. When operational, it will eliminate frequent power dips
and power failures which impact adversely on the operation of critical equipment in the refinery.
I. Future Operation
30.   The project components comprising the balancing and modernization of the crude
processing unit, debottlenecking the platformer and hydrotreater, and process modifications to
the lube unit improved and enhanced ongoing operations. NRL staff are well trained and
experienced and need no additional assistance to maintain operations. With regard to the power
component, the 4 MW diesel oil generation set is being commissioned by the supply and erection
contractor. NRL staff has understudied the contractors personnel and will be involved in the
commissioning of the unit. This is not a complicated plant and NRL's experience operating the
refinery provides adequate background to satisfactorily operate the new facility.
31.   The plant which requires considerable assistance to ensure satisfactory future operations
is the 7.5 MW steam turbine power plant. Steam turbines are prone to be troublesome if not
properly maintained and operated. In this project, the problems are further compounded by the
fact that the power unit cannot be commissioned as scheduled due to the failure of the process
boiler, referred to in para 20. This poses a major operational problem as the contractor's
obligation typically ceases 30 days after notice is given that the plant is ready for commissioning.
NRL will not be able to commission the plant until end-December 1997 which could jeopardize
the warranties and guarantees on the plant. The Bank has had extensive discussions with NRL
regarding the measures to be taken to ensure that the contractor will honor all warranties and
guarantees after the steam boiler is repaired and will assist NRL to obtain adequate experience to
operate the power plant thereafter. To this end, NRI will enter into an agreement with the
contractor to honor guarantees and provide adequate operations assistance after the plant is
commissioned and until NRL staff obtain enough experience. NRL will also enter into an
agreement with the consultants employed by NRL to manage the implementation of this
component and retain their services until (i) the steam turbine power plant is commissioned, (ii)
the plant has achieved a satisfactory level of on-stream performance, and (iii) guarantees have
been met. The Bank is supporting GOP in developing Clean Fuels Standards, followed by a Fuels
Reformulation Study, to review the health costs of lead in gasoline and sulfur in diesel. We remain
concerned about NRL's ability to meet fuel specifications, if it does not make further investments
soon to mitigate the effect of petroleum products use on the urban air quality in particular.
J. Key Lessons Learned
32.   An issue that has repeatedly arisen when implementing projects in most south Asian
countries is the limited autonomy given to parastatal agencies. The primary objective of GOP in
establishing parastatals was to provide these institutions with a high degree of autonomy in order to
gain efficiencies and compete with private sector industries. These objectives are negated by the



- 10-
degree of micro-management the Ministries engage in, resulting in unwarranted delays. A major
lesson to be learned is the need for a much higher degree of autonomy to parastatals and trust in the
key officials. The Ministries' role in monitoring the activities of parastatals should be confined to
ensuring compliance with GOP's broad policy guidelines. The line agencies should be responsible
for all actions pertaining to daily operations, including procurement and project implementation.
The necessary checks and counter-balances will be provided by the Government Auditor who is
required to monitor all financial- and operations-related activities, thus ensuring that the State's and
public interests are safeguarded.  Monitoring of operations is not only extended to micro-
management but also to duplication, resulting in many instances of virtual gridlock.
K. Evaluation of Program Objective Categories
33.   The sectoral objectives were to improve the efficiency of refinery operations, reduce the
dependence on petroleum product imports, and minimize the net economic costs of energy
supply to the country. Despite the fact that the NRL refinery supplies only about 3.0 million tons
per year of products, i.e. 20 percent of the country's requirements of petroleum products (6.5
million tons per year of crude processed at three refineries and about 9 million tons per year of
products are imported), the project made a small yet significant contribution towards: (i)
reducing imports of refined products by converting a greater proportion of the crude oil to more
valuable distillate petroleum products; (ii) reducing the consumption of energy per unit of crude
oil processed; and (iii) providing the facilities to use process steam to generate electricity for
refinery operations. In addition, the project provided both NRL and ENAR Petrotech, an
opportunity to gain valuable project management and implementation experience and training for
some of its key staff.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
REFINERY ENERGY CONSERVATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(LN. 2842-PAK)
Mission's Aide-Memoire
1.    A World Bank Mission comprising Messrs. Mikael Mengesha, Lakdasa Wijetilleke and
Ms. Julie Fraser visited Pakistan from January 28 through February 2, 1996 on a supervision
mission, prior to the Loan closing date of June 30, 1996 of the above mentioned Project. The
Mission would like to thank officials of GOP, PERAC and NRL for the cooperation and
courtesies extended to it.  Mission discussions, review of Project progress, findings and
agreements reached are summarized in this aide memoire.
2.    Project Progress. The current status of the five Project components is summarized
below:
(i)  balancing and modernization of the           completed
crude oil processing unit
(ii)  debottlenecking of the naphtha              completed
hydrotreater and platformer
(iii) process modification to the lube-oil        completed
refinery ( unit 1 )
(iv)  addition of a captive power plant           80 percent completed
(v)   studies, training and technical assistance  studies and technical
assistance completed,
about 50 staff have
received training,
compared to the
original targeted 100
3.    Components (i), (ii) and (iii) were completed well within the scheduled implementation
target dates envisaged in the Staff Appraisal Report. The scope of component (v) was reduced
considerably with regard to training of staff and technical assistance, as part of these activities
were funded under a Japanese aid program.
4.    With regard to component (iv), addition of a captive power plant, implementation is
targeted to be completed by June 30, 1996. The mission reviewed the work plan leading up to
power plant installation and commissioning. The power plant comprises a steam turbine and



-21-                              Appendix A
Page 2 of 5
associated boiler to generate 7 MW and diesel engines to generate a further 4 MW. Both units
have been fabricated, shop-tested and transported to the Karachi port. The detailed engineering
for civil works and site clearance are also complete. The time allowed in the implementation
schedule is adequate to meet the scheduled completion date of June 30, 1996. NRL, their
consultants and turnkey contractor have worked effectively as a team and overall performance
has been most satisfactory. The mission is satisfied that the targeted completion date will be
met. As for next steps to ensure the viability of the operation phase of the Captive Power Plant,
it was agreed that NRL should prepare a staffing plan so that adequate manpower is made
available and trained to ensure smooth operation and maintenance.
5.    The implementation of the Captive Power Plant was initially delayed by over two years
due to delays involved with the selection of the turnkey contractor for the supply, installation
and commissioning of the power component. The Project's closing date, which at Board
presentation was June 30, 1994 had to be extended by two years to facilitate completion of this
component. At the time of loan extension a work plan to ensure timely completion of the Project
was jointly developed by the Bank and NRL. The mission is pleased to report that NRL has
maintained this schedule with no lag so far and expects that the contracted date of completion
will be met.
6.    Operational Performance of Completed Items. Items (i) and (ii), the balancing and
modernization of the Crude Distillation Unit and the debottlenecking of the naphtha reformer,
have to be considered jointly as most benefits are interdependent. These units were completed
in February 1990. Tangible benefits from these component are: (a) increase in the crude unit
capacity by 15,500 barrels per day; (b) increase in the yield of light naphtha by 2.5 volume
percent, which in turn resulted in a larger proportion of heavy naphtha to the platforner, a direct
consequence of which is lower severity of operation of the platformer; the tangible benefits of
lower severity operation are lower energy costs per unit of feed and longer catalyst life; (c)
increased yield of kerosene by 1.7 weight percent; and (d) reduced energy consumption, despite
the increase in through-put total energy consumption has decreased by 2,560 tons of fuel oil
equivalent per annum. NRL has computed the total savings at $5.1 million. The total
expenditure on these items was $5.9 million. The benefits have paid for these two items in
slightly over one year.
7.    With regard to item (iii), benefits from process modifications to the Lube Unit, have not
been computed as yet. Expenditures for this component were US$1.4 million. The primary
benefits are enhancement of product quality and marginal increase in yield. In terms of the
benefits from item (v), which covers training, studies and technical assistance, the benefits from
training are long-term and not readily tangible. Studies commissioned under the Project and
consultants engaged have enabled NRL to implement almost all components of the project
envisaged at appraisal, except for a few energy conservation sub-components which became
uneconomic due to increase in the investment costs after the bidding stage.
8.    Disbursements. Out of a total loan amount of US$21 million over US$10 million has
been disbursed with a further US$9 million fully committed to the turnkey contractor and
expected to be disbursed upon delivery to site of all the imported equipment by early February
1996. Almost 100 percent of equipment and material payable under these commitments are now

at Karachi port and will be transported to the site shortly. Loan proceeds amounting to less than
US$2 million, not fully utilized under the allocation for training and technical assistance,
partially due to the availability of Japanese aid for training and technical assistance, as explained
earlier, will be canceled by the Bank as savings.
9.    Implementation Completion Report. Since this mission will be the last supervision
mission prior to project completion, the mission discussed the modalities of preparation of the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR). The mission provided NRL with ICR preparation
guidelines and sample copies of the ICR to enable NRL to staff to prepare the required
documentation to assist the Bank's ICR mission which will visit NRL towards the middle of
April 1996 to initiate preparation of the borrower's evaluation of the project's implementation
record and outcomes.
10.   Project Sustainability and NRL's Clean Fuels Program. The sustainability of refinery
operations and profitability in the future will be predicated by the ability of NRL to meet future
changes in petroleum fuels specifications which have now become mandatory in most countries
to mitigate air pollution, from the transport sector in particular. Reformulation of gasoline and
diesel oil will be required in Pakistan within the next few years. The mission therefore raised
these issues with NRL and was informed that NRL is required to reduce the lead level of
gasoline to 0.35 milligrams per liter from the current levels and that NRL is proposing to install a
Pentane Isomerization unit. However, the mission is of the view this investment itself is not
likely to be adequate, even in the medium term to meet the increasingly stringent environmental
requirements in the region, which Pakistan will have to be ultimately be measured against.
While the proposed lead level is an improvement, most developing countries will have to
embark on lead reduction in two stages, initially reducing to 0.15 grams per liter and finally to
0.013 grams per liter, which in effect is unleaded gasoline. The mission also explained that the
reduction of lead and options for compensating for octane loss have to be selected with caution,
as there are other unwanted adverse impacts which may develop, such as excessive benzene and
aromatics levels, high RVP etc., if the wrong choices are made.
11.  In this connection the mission also discussed the need to reduce the sulfur level in diesel
oil. Currently, the sulfur level in diesel oil is fixed at 1.00 weight percent. Here again, the
mission cited examples in various countries where fuels reformulation programs to reduce sulfur
have been initiated. The effect of sulfur, besides the contribution to acid rain and engine wear
and tear, is the serious health impacts caused by contribution to the formation and propagation of
suspended particulate material (10 microns and below) which give rise to respiratory diseases.
The mission explained that over the past seven years the Bank has assisted countries to develop
air quality management and fuels reformulation programs and subject to senior Bank
management approval, would be willing to assist the Government of Pakistan to develop an
affordable, time and cost effective study/program, should GOP request Bank's assistance.
12.   Future Project Monitoring Steps by Bank. As discussed in paragraph 9, the next step
is a final mission to confirm that the project has been completed as now envisaged.
Simultaneously, the next Mission will also commence the preparation of the ICR. Performance
indicators will be on the basis of the data that will be prepared by the NRL project team per the
proforma tables provided by the Mission.

13.   Other Actions By GOP and NRL. Environmental issues that are now given high
priority have surfaced since this project was prepared some eight years ago. These could
undermine the viability and the sustainability of the investments. It is therefore imperative
that adequate steps to reformulate fuels are taken by PERAC/NRL to ensure that investments
made and to a greater extent the viability of the refinery itself is not jeopardized. The investment
requirements are likely to be substantial and preparation of process modifications are complex
and implementation could take 4 years from approval of a program. Hence, the mission
recommends that high priority should be given to the preparation of an integrated  fuels
reformulation program. In this connection, it is worth noting that all the proposed refinery
projects in Pakistan, as far as the mission has been able to ascertain, are under no
obligation to meet current internationally accepted reformulated fuels specifications. Three
large refinery complexes are in their pre-project preparation stages. Unless the necessary
investments are included in these projects, it will become costly, if changes have to made at a
later date. This would also aggravate the air quality pollution problem.
14.   NRL Financial Performance. NRL's product sales were 2.75 million metric tons in
FY94 and 2.66 million metric tons in FY95. This generated net sales revenues of Rs. 13.3 and
Rs. 14.2 billion in FY94 and FY95 respectively, a 6.5% increase. Operating costs for FY94 and
FY95 were Rs. 13.2 billion and Rs. 15.2 billion, resulting in net income after tax of Rs. 0.35
billion and a loss of Rs. 0.11 billion respectively. In FY95, NRL achieved a current ratio of 0.97
and a debt:equity ratio of 49:51, meeting the Bank's financial covenant for debt:equity but falling
short of the required 1.0 current ratio. The Mission advised NRL that it should examine its
working capital management with a view to enhancing its cash management and reducing NRL's
dependence on short term loans, which had more than doubled from FY93 to FY94 and increased
by 6.3% in FY95.
15. The Mission noted that the FY95 figures mentioned in the above paragraph, are based on
unaudited financial statements. In this regard the Mission advised NRL management that the
company is in violation of the covenants under the Loan, by not submitting audited financial
statements by December 31, 1995. The Mission therefore requests GOP to finalize the necessary
tariff adjustments by end-January 1996, and NRL to submit audited financial statements to the
Bank at the latest by March 31, 1996.
16.   Confirmation of Aide Memoire Findings and Recommendations. The findings and
recommendations contained in this aide memoire are subject to review and confirmation by the
Bank's senior management. The Mission will send to GOP a final version within two weeks of
its return to Washington.

TIMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
NATIONAL REFINERY LIMITED
KARACHI
PAKISTAN
A. INTRODUCTION
1.    National Refinery Limited (NRL) was incorporated as a Public Limited Company on
August 19, 1963. The Company installed and commissioned Lube Refinery-I in June 1966.
Subsequently, Fuel Refinery and a BTX Unit were installed and commissioned in April 1977
and April 1979, respectively. The Company installed a Second Lube Refinery which came on
stream in January 1985.
2.    Refineries are generally heavy consumers of energy. The Lube Refinery-I was
designed in 1960 whereas the Fuel Refinery was designed during 1974-75. Oil, which
provided the energy for the refinery was relatively cheap during these years; the incremental
capital costs to conserve energy from various process streams could not be justified and hence
there was no incentive to recover waste heat by addition of energy conservation equipment.
With the sharp escalation of crude oil and petroleum products prices during 1979-81, energy
conservation became an item of high priority, particularly in refineries similar to NRL, which
were designed and built during the 1960-70 decade. Consequently, with the objective to
operate the refineries efficiently at optimum capacity with minimum energy consumption per
unit of feed processed, a contract was awarded in October 1983 to M/s Stone & Webster
Corporation of USA to conduct an Energy Management Audit and Conservation Study. The
scope of study included a general audit of major systems and equipment of NRL, to identify
potential areas for significant energy conservation and to recommend the scope of a detailed
study be for assessing the cost/ benefits of energy conservation projects identified by Stone and
Webster detailed below:
(a)   Balancing and Modernization of Crude Distillation Unit of Fuel Refinery
(b)   Balancing and Modernization of Platforming and Associated Hydrocarbon Unit
(c)   Self Generation of Power at NRL
(d)   Process Modification at Lube Refinery
3.   In order to confirm the cost and benefits of each scheme, contracts were awarded to
M/s Lummus, UK, M/s UOP Inc USA and M/s Foster Wheeler, USA/Italy who carried out
techno-economic and cost studies for the above schemes. Studies by the consultants confirmed
the financial and economic viability of the four projects.

Page 3 of 9
4.    Based on the Consultants' studies and estimated potential benefits, a Loan in the
amount of US$21 million was approved by the Bank to cover the foreign exchange costs of the
four projects. IBRD Loan 2842-PAK became effective in July 1988.
ENERGY CONSERVATION PROJECTS
5.    Balancing & Modernization of Crude Distillation Unit of Fuel Refinery. The PC-1 of
the scheme was approved by ECNEC on March 12, 1986. This scheme envisaged balancing
of crude distillation unit for processing additional crude of 15,500 barrels per day. The
additional crude will be processed by utilizing the energy saved through the various energy
conservation measures which are part of this project.
6.    The total cost of the project is Rs. 137.773 million as follows:
(Rs. in Million)
Foreign Exchange Cost         46.641
Local Currency Cost           91.132
The project was completed in December 1989.
7.    Balancing & Modernization of Platforming & Hydrobon Units. The project envisaged
balancing and modernization of the Platforming and Associated Hydrobon Unit to process low
value surplus naphtha to produce of 28,000 tons of HOBC and 1750 MT of LPG which are
deficit products in the country.
8.   The total cost of the project is Rs. 268.542 million as follows:
(Rs. in Million)
Foreign Exchange Cost          131.779
Local Currency Cost            136.763
The project was completed in May 1995.
9.    Self Generation of Power at NRL. The project envisaged installation of 7.5 MW steam
turbine along with a stand-by Furnace Oil Engine. The estimated cost of the project is Rs.
542.141 million as follows:
(Rs. in Million)
Foreign Exchange Cost         319.038
Local Currency Cost           223.103
10.   Completion target of the project was September 1996, but due to major break down of
Boiler-V, the source of steam supply, the commissioning of 7.5 MW steam turbine is expected
by June 1997. However, the testing and comnmissioning of Furnace Oil/Diesel Generator is
anticipated in January 1997.

Page 4 of 9
11.   Process Modification at Lube Refinery. The scheme envisaged process modification at
Propane De-asphalting (PDA) in order to improve overall thermal efficiency of heat
exchanging equipment and effective heat recovery. The modifications will involve installation
of heat exchangers for recovery of waste heat, multi-stage solvent recovery system at PDA.
The total cost of the Project is Rs. 71.362 million as follows:
(Rs. in Million)
Foreign Exchange Cost          21.826
Local Currency Cost            49.536
The project was completed in January 1995.
TRAINING OF REFINERY MANPOWER
12.   The objective of the Refinery Manpower Training Programme is to impart practical
training to refinery personnel in various functional areas such as operations, energy
conservation and management, design, technical services etc. in a scientific way with the
assistance of international consultants and to up-grade the quality of these personnel which has
now become imperative in view of the Refinery Energy Conservation and Modernization
schemes.
13.   A total of 60 Engineers of different disciplines are trained in Japan Corporation for
Petroleum Industry Development (JCCP Japan) and Universal Oil Product Company of USA
(UOP USA/USSR).
14.   The total cost of implementation is Rs. 2.575 millions in foreign exchange.
B.   ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTlYES
15.   Following are the benefits being realized in NRL after completion of the above
mentioned projects:
(i)   The crude processing capacity has increased from 34,500 to 50,000 bpd,
increasing production as follows:
M.TQNS
LPG           5,000
Naphtha     111,000
Kerosene    135,900
Diesel Oil   171,600
Fuel Oil    219,600
(ii)   Although the crude refining capacity has been increased by 15,500 bpd, the
energy consumption has not increased. Instead the energy has been conserved.



-29-                           Appendix B
Page5 of 9
The energy consumption has decreased from 2.857 MMBtu/Te of Crude in
1988-89 (before revamp) to 2.143 MMBtu/Te of Crude in 1991-92 (after
revamp). Based on excess crude processing of 655,743 Te after revamp, the
energy saving in TOE is 11,800 tonnes. This includes energy conserved due to
shutdown of Kero-Hydrobon, viz, 2,560 TOE. Therefore, the net energy saved
due to balancing and Modernization of Crude Distillation Unit is 9,240 TOE.
(iii)  The revamp of Crude Distillation Tower has allowed an increased processing of
local crudes. The processing of local crude has now increased from about
12,000 to 16,000 bpd. This is an increase of almost 33 %.
(iv)  The addition of Pre-Flash Tower has allowed to reduce the load on main tower
by at-least 10 percent. This allowed NRL to improve the cut points of light and
heavy straight naphtha. The yield of light naphtha (also known as straight run
gasoline) increased in volume from 7.5 % to 10%. Thus the additional light
naphtha has increased the potential of producing motor gasoline by about
16,000 Te.
The change of cut-point of light naphtha has in turn resulted in the change of
cut-point of heavy naphtha. The new cut-point has allowed to lower the
severity of reaction at Platforming unit thus improving the processing
conditions.
(v)   The separation efficiency of middle distillates has considerably improved as a
result of even distribution of vapor-liquid load in the crude distillation tower.
The production of kerosene has improved by 1.7% wt. over furnace oil.
(vi)  The processing capacity of Hydrobon & Platforming Unit has increased from its
design 2,210 bpd (2,880 bpd operating before revamp) to 3,800 bpd, i.e. an
additional up-grading of low value 32,000 tons of export naphtha annually to
higher value products. Reformatted production capacity has increased from
2,500 to 230 bpd.
(vii)  Increasing the processing capacity of Platforming unit has enhanced producing
capacity of 90 octane reformatted by additional 28,000 tonnes and LPG by
additional 1,750 tonnes per year.
(viii) Additional production of 28,000 tonnes of reformat (90 octane) has increased
the manufacturing capacity of motor gasoline by an additional 86, 000 tonnes
per year.
(ix)  Multi-stage recovery system at PDA unit of Lube Refinery-I has reduced energy
consumption by 4,970 TOE with an increased solvent recovery.



-30-                           Appendix B
Page 6 of 9
(x)   As a net result of energy conservation, the consumption of energy has reduced
from 2.80 MMBtu/Ton (7.26 tonnes per 100 metric tonnes of feed) to 2.21
MMBtu/Ton (5.73 tonnes per 100 metric tonnes of feed).
(xi)   Once the 7.5 MW Power Plant is made operational and supplying to the vital
units, the power dips and failures will be eliminated and the down-time will be
considerably reduced.
C.   PROJECTS IMPLEMENTATION
Balancing and Modernization of Crude Distillation Unit of Fuel Refinery
16.   The pumps, air cooler, pipes and pipe fittings instrumentation and desalter
modifications parts were procured from M/s Ingersoll Rand, M/s Hudson Italiana, M/s
Phoceenne, M/s Rosemount, M/s Fisher, M/s Yamatake, M/s Honey Well, M/s Nuvov
Pignone and M/s Howmar International. All the material reached in time.
17.   M/s Enar Petrotech Services Ltd (M/s ENAR) were appointed as Engineering
Procurement and Construction (EPC) Contractor to carry out all the engineering design,
preparation of technical specifications for equipment, tender documents, bid evaluation and
supervision of construction activities of the Project.
18.   The job of civil works was awarded to M/s Abaseen at Rs 3.963 million and completed
successfully. The job of mechanical works was awarded to M/s SEFEC at Rs. 3.923 million
and completed successfully. The job of electrical and instrument works was awarded to M/s
ENAR at Rs. 1.695 million and completed successfully.
19.   The project was completed successfully in time.
Balancing and Modernization of Platforming and Associated Hydrobon Unit
20.   The pumps, compressor, heaters, exchangers, pipes and pipe fittings, instrumentations
and insulation material for the project were procured from M/s. Dresser, M/s Nuovo Pignone,
M/s Born Heaters, M/s Luigi Resta, M/s Phoceenne, M/s Fischer, M/s Foxboro, M/s
Rosemount and Yamatake. All the material reached in time except heaters material from Born
Heater, which was delayed by 46 weeks.
21.   M/s ENAR were appointed as EPC Contractor for the engineering design, preparation
of technical specifications for equipment, tender documents, bid evaluation and supervision of
construction activities of the project. The contract price of M/s ENAR was Rs 16.00 million.
22.   Civil works contract was awarded to M/s Jammy Constructors (Pvt) Ltd, at Rs. 2.855
million and completed successfully. Mechanical works contract was awarded to M/s SEFEC
Engg. (Pvt) Ltd, at Rs 7.358 million and completed successfully. Instrumentation works
contract was awarded to M/s United Engg. Construction (Pvt) Ltd, at Rs. 2.378 million and



-31-                            Appendix B
Page 7 of 9
completed successfully. Electrical works contract was awarded to M/s Modem Engg. Works
at Rs. 1,645,500.00 and completed successfully.
23.   The project was delayed by 44 weeks due to:
(a)   delay in approval from Ministry of Production for award of contract to pumps
and compressor bidders and
(b)   delay in supply of furnace material by M/s Born Heaters International, UK
Self Generation of Power at NRL
24.   Presently, NRL Electrical supply system is hooked-up with the KESC electric grid
network system. Due to the frequent power failures and power dips of KESC, supply had
become very unreliable. This resulted in dangerous electrical stresses on H.T/L.T electric
motors. Moreover thermal shocks on mechanical equipment resulted in leakages and safety
hazards and production loss.
25.   NRL therefore planned to put up its own power generation system to ensure
uninterrupted power supply and reduction in down time of the Refinery. NRL being a vast
petroleum and a petrochemical complex was not having enough experience of implementation
of power generation project. Therefore, IBRD approved Consultant M/s Electrowatt
Engineering Services Ltd, (EWI) were engaged in 1988 for the following jobs:
(a)   Preparation of EDS Package.
(b)   Tendering and Evaluation work.
(c)   Design Review and Project Implementation.
26.   Two stage competitive bidding was done as per Consultant guidelines of M/s EWI and
the job was awarded to M/s Siemens, Germany in May 1994. Due to delay in establishment
of operative L/C, commencement date of the contract was September 1994 with a contractual
completion date as September 1996. On the request of NRL, Siemens Germany agreed to
complete the project by June/July 1996. However, due to late clearance of equipment from
custom and other problems, sub-contractors of Siemens Germany could not complete the job in
time.
27.  In October 1996, unfortunately, we had a major break down of Boiler-V, the source of
steam supply. This requires major repairs and may take more than six months. It is expected
that Turbo Generator will be completed by June 1997. However, Siemens Germany are trying
their best to complete the Diesel Generator set by end-January 1997.
Process Modification at Lube Refinery
28.   The pumps, pipes and pipe fittings, instrumentation and insulation material for the
project were procured from M/s Dresser, M/s Phoceenne, M/s Fischer, M/s Foxboro, M/s
Rosemount, Mls Yamatake and M/s Cape East. All the material reached in time.

Page 8 of 9
29.   M/s ENAR were appointed as EPC Contractor for same activities as mentioned in
Hydrobon Unit at S.No.2. rhe contract price was Rs 11.00 million. Civil works contract was
awarded to M/s Jammy Constructors (Pvt) Ltd, at Rs 1.471 million completed successfully.
Mechanical works contract was awarded to M/s SEPEC Engg. (Pvt) Ltd, at Rs 3.790 million
and completed successfully. Instrumentation works contract was awarded to M/s United
Engg. Construction (Pvt) ILtd, at Rs 1.225 million and completed successfully. Electrical
works contract was awarded to M/s Modern Engg. Works at Rs. 847,698.00 and completed
successfully.
D.  MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
30.   The major factors which delayed the project implementation were:
(i)    Limited authority granted to NRL to make procurement decisions. For
procurement above Rs 20.00 million, the decisions were taken by the Ministry,
which questioned NRL reconmmendations and decisions.
(ii)   Delays by the Vendors in supplying the material. For example delivery of
furnace material was delayed by 46 weeks.
(iii)   Need for govertnment approval to train ptersonnel and delays in getting these
approvals.
The implementation of the Projects were delayed by over 36 months because of one or more of
the above reasons.
31.   The project component most adversely effected was the implementation of the power
plant, which represented about 50 percent of the project cost. It comprised one 7.5 MW steam
turbo generator and one 4.0 MW stand by fuel oil diesel generator.
32.   Bid documents for this component were issued in August - September 1992. Bids were
received on March 31, 1993 which were evaluated and recommendations finalized by July 26,
1993. After many clarifications from the Ministry, a contract was signed with the supplier on
May 15, 1994. The commencement date of the contract was September 30, 1994 and
completion date of the project as September 30, 1996.
E.    IBRD PERFORMANCE
33.   IBRD approved a foreign currency loan amounting to US$21.00 million effective from
July 1988. The World Bank played a major role in assisting NRL to resolve difficult
problems as well as providing guidance as required during project implementation. All phases
of projects were executed in close adherence to World Bank guidelines, and procedures for



-33-                            Appendix B
Page 9 of 9
pre-qualifications and procurements World Bank extended its fullest cooperation in making the
progress of the projects smooth. There were several missions/visits of the World Bank to
NRL for monitoring and advice. They also helped in resolving many problems with various
Agencies. During the entire process of implementation, the World Bank remained in close
contact with NRL and observed the physically progress of all projects and expenditure. NRL
also kept the World Bank posted in respect of the progress of the projects regularly.
34.   There was no problem in the cash flow to make regular payments to the Contractors.
The borrower experience strict supervision and adherence to rules in the procurement process,
which helped us in financial discipline.
35.   The Bank was gracious enough to grant extension in the Loan to complete the projects
especially, the Self Generation of Power Project.
