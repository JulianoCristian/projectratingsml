Further,\n            the project aims to promote a refinery pricing system that\n            will provide adequate incentives for efficiency\n            improvements, and assist Government in formulating an\n            optimal investment program for the refinery sector as a\n            whole.  With this in mind, the project includes (i)\n            balancing and modernization of the crude processing unit;\n            (ii) a captive power plant; (iii) debottlenecking of the\n            hydo-treater and platformer; and (iv) process modifications\n            to lube unit I.  In addition, the project supports (v)\n            efficiency improvement measures; and (vi) studies, training,\n            technical assistance, research and development.  These\n            measures, identified under the previous refinery engineering\n            project, will yield significant benefits at relatively low\n            incremental cost, by modifying existing process units and\n            adding ancilliary facilities."}, "docdt": "1987-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
