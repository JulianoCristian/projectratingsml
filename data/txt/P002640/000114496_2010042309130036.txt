Excellency:
     We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (Emergency Flood
Reconstruction Project), dated May 25, 1989, between The Republic of
the Sudan and International Development Association (the
Association), as amended by letter dated January 9, 1990.
     As discussed between representatives of your Government, the
National Reconstruction Implementation Unit and the Association, we
hereby propose to amend the Development Credit Agreement of take
into account the latest developments concerning the implementation
of the above-referenced Project.  These amendments deal, in
particular, with the deletion of the urban housing component and the
addition of flood-related agricultural activities in the Northern
Region.  Furthermore, the allocation of the proceeds of the Credit
to the various Categories has been changed to reflect revised cost
estimates and actual expenditures.  The details of the proposed
amendments of the Development Credit Agreement are as follows:
Section  3.01
1.   A new paragraph (d) shall be added to read as follows:
          "(d) The Borrower shall ensure that the Northern
          Agricultural Production Corporation will carry out the
          activities under Part A.4 (b) of the Project in
          accordance with the relevant provisions of this
          Agreement and present to implementation arrangements
          acceptable to the Association."
Section 3.04
2.   The reference to "Part A.4 of the Project" in this Section
shall be
replied by "Part A.4 (a) of the Project".
9.   Part of Section I in Schedule 3 to the Development Credit
Agreement shall be renumbered and amended to read a@ follows:
     "6. Office equipment and supplies under Parts A, B, C, E, F
     and G of the Project and vehicles under Parts B, C, E, F and
     G of the Project may be procured under contracts awarded on
     the basis of comparison of price quotations solicited from a
     list of at least three suppliers eligible under the
     Guidelines, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the
     Association."
10.  In Section II of Schedule 3 to the Development Credit
Agreement, the reference to "Parts B, C, E, F and G of the Project
shall be replaced by "Parts A, B, C, E, F and G of the Project".
     Please indicate your agreement to the amendments proposed
above by signing the form of confirmation on the enclosed copy of
Page  2
