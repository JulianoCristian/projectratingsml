MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
Subject: Project Completion Report on Sudan
Emergency Flood Reconstruction Project (Cr. 2011-SU)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on the Sudan Flood Reconstruction Project
(Credit 201 1-SU) prepared by the Africa Regional Office. The Borrower did not submit Part II.
The Bank responded promptly to a government request for emergency assistance to
replace and repair facilities and services damaged by exceptional floods in 1988. Although
implementation was delayed and then shortened somewhat by a general suspension of disburse-
ments, the project substantially achieved its objectives. Government institutions were strength-
ened as planned and aid was coordinated from other sources for the government's emergency
program. Physical results were generally in line with targets for the agricultural, primary
education and health components, close to targets for the telecommunications component, but
only a third of the Khartoum urban component was implemented. An urban planning study was
completed for Khartoum and a design study helped establish a flood early warning system.
The PCR gives a succinct account of the project experience and draws some useful lessons
on the Bank's role in aid coordination; on the organization of multi-agency aid projects, including
the need for a central coordinating agency in government; on the benefits of Bank staff continu-
ity, and notes the high costs to the Bank of such emergency assistance.
The outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory, institutional development as substan-
tial, but sustainability is uncertain because of budget constraints.
No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SUDAN
EMERGENCY FLOOD RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
(CREDIT 2011-SU)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Sudan Emergency Flood Reconstruction
Project, for which IDA Credit 201 1-SU in the amount of US$75.0 million (SDR54.9 million
equivalent) was approved on May 4, 1989. The credit was closed on October 31, 1993, two years
behind schedule. US$67.5 million, or 90 percent, of the credit was disbursed as of April 14, 1994.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Division of Country Department 11 in the Africa
Region (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and 111). The Borrower was requested to prepare Part
II but no submission was received.
Preparation of this PCR began after the Closing Date, and is based on the President's
Memorandum to the Executive Directors; the credit documents; supervision reports; quarterly reports
prepared by the Borrower; correspondence between IDA, the Borrower, and the cofinanciers; and
internal IDA memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SUDAN
EMERGENCY FLOOD RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
(Credit No. 2011-SU)
Evaluation Summary
Objectives. The Project was designed to help Sudan restore the damage caused by devastating
rains and floods in August/September 1988. Specifically, the IDA credit financed activities
to: (a) restore productive facilities, essential infrastructure and social services destroyed by the
flood; (b) strengthen the Government's institutional framework needed to manage the flood
reconstruction program, including the coordination of aid from other donors; and (c) provide
the basis for an early warning system for future floods. IDA support was directed to the
agricultural, education, health, telecommunications and urban (Khartoum) sector after taking
into account the support that was expected to be provided by other donors.
Implementation Experience. Implementation of the reconstruction program was greatly
facilitated by the comprehensive planning process that took place in Sudan as soon as the
flood waters receded. All prospective donors were invited and many participated in
producing a multi-sectoral reconstruction plan within a three-week period. This was followed
shortly thereafter by a coordinating meeting organized by the Bank during which the donors
and the Government agreed on how to allocate and coordinate the resources available for
reconstruction.
Implementation was also facilitated by the establishment of a Government organization
(NRIU) to coordinate the donor-supported reconstruction activities, with actual
implementation carried out by each Government sector organization. The coordinating unit
operated at a high level throughout the life of the program.
Some delay was caused at the beginning of the program by considerations external to
the flood reconstruction program itself such as the Government's reluctance to implement a
comprehensive economic adjustment program and the intensification of the war in Southern
Sudan. Also, the urban component was consistently behind schedule because of the
institutional weaknesses within the Khartoum City Government and its lack of familiarity with
IDA procedures. This delay was further aggravated by poor contractor performance of a
major urban contract. As a result of these and other factors, the project was concluded about
two years behind schedule, having accomplished about 80 percent of its physical targets.
Results. Overall, the project achieved its objectives even though not all of its physical targets
were attained. In addition to restoring facilities and social services destroyed by the flood, an
early warning system was designed and installed and is now in use. Other donor assistance of
about 80 percent of the original financial commitments was also achieved on a parallel
financing basis in support of the reconstruction effort.



iii
Sustainability. Sustainability is not relevant to the Project components dedicated to restoration
of existing facilities. The early warning system seems likely to remain in use due to Sudanese
concern for Nile flooding. The utilization of the urban plan for the City of Khartoum is
inhibited by the serious budget constraints that restrict all new construction.
Findings and Lessons Learned. The principal lessons learned include the following:
a)     The Bank can play a catalytic role in mobilizing and coordinating donor
support for emergency reconstruction. Early action to identify the needs, spell them out in an
integrated report, and give all interested donors an opportunity to participate in the process
can lead to a successful and well-coordinated result;
b)     Reconstruction programs frequently are multisectoral and therefore inherently
complex; this complexity can be mitigated somewhat by channeling each donor's assistance
(including the Bank's) into a limited number of sectors;
c)     For a multisectoral program of emergency assistance, a central coordinating
agency is necessary in order to serve as a contact point for donors and the recipient agencies
even when actual implementation is to be carried out by the various sector organizations;
d)     Continuity on the part of the Bank staff and recipient country staff greatly
facilitates project implementation;
e)     However, such efforts are extremely costly in terms of staffing, travel and
coordination, and without the additional support obtained from UNDP, might not have been
successfully conducted.

2. Background
2.01   In August/September 1988 Sudan experienced three weeks of unprecedented high levels of
rainfall, including a 200 mm rainstorm August 4-5 in the Khartoum region, more rain in one day than
the annual average rainfall. This was accompanied by high levels of flooding of the Nile and other
rivers, including sheet flooding down wadis, which had not seen water in living memory. These
events caused devastation for a large portion of the population, particularly in the Khartoum and
Northern Regions where there was damage on a massive scale to agriculture, property and
infrastructure. Some two million people were left homeless, agricultural areas along the Nile River
around Khartoum and to the north were devastated, and essential services such as health, education,
and communications suffered severe damage. For example, in the Khartoum area, over 80 percent of
the schools were damaged or destroyed. In the Northern Region, the fruit trees of small farmers
were swept away by the flood, which will take years to replace as productive assets.
2.02   Emergency relief efforts began almost immediately after the heavy rains, with the assistance
of UNDRO/UNDP and with the support of the international community and local and international
NGO's. This assistance was directed towards the immediate relief needs of the flood victims through
the provision of food, medicines, and temporary shelter as well as emergency medical relief to
prevent epidemics. These efforts were generally successful, and no epidemics occurred.
2.03   In late August, the Government of Sudan requested the World Bank to undertake an
assessment of the reconstruction requirements resulting from the flood and to coordinate donor
reconstruction efforts. The World Bank, in response to this request and with financial support from
the UNDP and ODA, undertook a mission to Sudan to survey the reconstruction needs and to outline
a reconstruction program that could be supported by donors. The World Bank invited other donors to
join in the mission, and a number of them did so (AfDB, EEC, France, Germany, IFAD, IMF, Italy,
Jordan, U.K., UNICEF, UNIDO and WHO). The Mission produced a report dated October 17,
1988, outlining an Emergency Flood Reconstruction Program (EFRP) costing US$407.5 million,



2
which represented what reconstruction the Mission estimated that the Government could implement
during the next two to three years. The program included assistance to a number of different sectors,
as follows:
Cost
Sector                                              (US$ millions)
Agriculture                                                  97.4
Rural Water                                                  24.0
Education                                                    36.2
Health                                                       38.6
Industry/Construction                                        50.3
Power                                                        34.9
Telecommunications                                           34.4
Transportation                                               33.5
Urban (Housing, Streets & drains)                            56.3
Program Coordination and Flood Prevention                    2.0
$407.5
The Mission recommended that the donor community consider financing 90 percent of the program in
view of Sudan's precarious financial situation (the normal limit for IDA financed projects was 80
percent at that time).
2.04   On November 18, 1988 an advance from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of
US$600,000 was approved so that design work could begin for the telecommunications, education and
urban components, and to assist in the establishment of a project coordination unit, as recommended
in the EFRP report. An additional US$570,000 of PPF financing was made available for the same
purposes on February 22, 1989.
2.05   A Special Donors Meeting was held in Paris on November 29, 1988 to coordinate the support
from the various donors and to firm up their levels of assistance. The Bank indicated that it would
act as "lender of last resort" by applying its financing to parts of the program not financed by others.
The meeting generated preliminary indications of donor financing of about US$300 million, including
IDA financing of about US$24.1 million from the reallocation of ongoing projects and US$75 million
in the form of a proposed new IDA credit. Donor support was somewhat mitigated, however, by the
Government's delay in implementing a structural adjustment program that had recently been worked
out with the assistance of IDA and the IMF, and by the fact that the war in the Southern part of
Sudan appeared to be at a political stalemate and was generating large numbers of refugees.
2.06   Negotiations with IDA were concluded on December 12, 1988 for the IDA Credit but the
Project was not reviewed by the Board until the following May. This delay was the result of the
uncertainties generated by a deteriorating political situation and the intensification of the war in the
South. For the same reasons, a request to the Executive Directors for the reallocation of US$ 24.1
million from ongoing projects was delayed. Ultimately, however, the new credit was approved by the
Executive Directors on May 4, 1989 and signed on May 25, 1989. A new Government came to
power on June 30, 1989 through a military coup, somewhat delaying the effectiveness process, but in
due course the conditions for effectiveness were met and the Credit was declared effective on July 27,
1989.



3
2.07   The project met the Bank's criteria for emergency lending due to the flood's significant
impact on the national economy, the need for reconstruction to follow the emergency relief provided
by others, and the temporary nature of the emergency requirements. The IDA component, in addition
to providing critical support not covered by other donors, included provisions for the design of an
early warning system to provide more advance warning in the event of future floods, as well as the
first steps in designing a rational urban plan for the City of Khartoum.
3. Proiect Objectives and Description
3.01   Project Objectives. The Project was designed to assist Sudan to implement a portion of the
EFRP by financing activities that would: (a) restore productive facilities and essential infrastructure;
(b) relieve human suffering and deprivation by restoring social services and housing destroyed by the
flood; (c) strengthen the institutional framework needed to carry out the Reconstruction Program; and
(d) outline the requirements for an early warning system for future floods. In addition, the Project
was intended to serve as a catalyst for donor financing and coordination in the reconstruction effort.
3.02   Project Description. The Project, intended to be implemented over a two to three year
period, consisted of reconstruction activities in several different sectors, including (all figures include
contingencies):
(a)    the provision of credit and critical agricultural inputs supplied through the Agricultural
Bank of Sudan and the Ministry of Agriculture (US$19.9 million equivalent);
(b)    primary schools and related technical assistance (US$14.8 million equivalent);
(c)    provision of drugs, chemicals, spraying equipment, transport and technical assistance
for the Ministry of Health to assist in the control of malaria and endemic diseases
(US$4.3 million equivalent);
(d)    equipment, spare parts, tools and test equipment, vehicles and consulting services for
the Sudan Telecommunications Public Corporation (US$12.0 million equivalent);
(e)    the provision of building materials to low income families in Khartoum to enable
reconstruction of their dwellings, rehabilitation of some of Khartoum's streets and
drains, technical assistance for a Project Management Office for the City of
Khartoum, and a strategic urban planning study for the capital city (US$24.2 million
equivalent);
(f)    a study for an early warning system for future floods (US$0.65 million equivalent);
(g)    technical assistance and equipment for the National Reconstruction Implementation
Unit (US$2.3 million equivalent); and
(h)    Unallocated (US$5.7 million equivalent).
IDA planned to finance 90 percent of each component, with the Government to finance the remaining
10 percent.



4
3.03 Other IDA Reconstruction Support. IDA also planned to support the financing of the EFRP
through reallocation of funds from existing credits for a total of about US$24.1 million, some of
which required approval by the Executive Directors, for additional support for the agricultural sector
(US$22.1 million) and highway repairs (US$2.0 million).
4. Project Design and Organization
4.01   The report dated October 17, 1988 referred to in para. 2.03 produced in collaboration with a
wide array of donors, was a comprehensive and detailed document outlining the reconstruction needs
and the programs required to address them. This was accomplished in a single three week mission in
Khartoum, and made it possible for all of the donors to relate their planned aid to an overall program
design.
4.02   The Government requested that the Bank be involved in all nine sectors identified in the
EFRP document. However, the Bank thought that this would lead to increased complexity of project
design and implementation, and therefore channelled its financing into only the five sectors that
lacked adequate financing from other sources.
4.03   The Project design was based on the concept that project implementation, including
procurement and construction, would be carried out by the regular agencies and ministries of
Government, many of whom were familiar with IDA procedures. At the same time, there was a need
to provide for a central locus for coordination and support to the various agencies, and a point of
contact for the donors, in view of the many sectors involved. Therefore, the project design included
the establishment of a National Reconstruction Implementation Unit (NRIU), working under the
guidance of a National Reconstruction Task Force (NRTF), to coordinate and expedite the EFRP and
to provide assistance and training in procurement and other procedures to Government agencies where
required.
5. Proiect Implementation
5.01   Implementation Schedule. The Project was originally scheduled to be completed by October
31, 1991, slightly less than three years after negotiations took place. Project startup was delayed by
about six months because of considerations outside of the Project (see para. 2.01), and
implementation took about four years thereafter until disrupted by a suspension of disbursements on
April 2, 1993 because of the Government's inability to service its debt obligations to the Bank/IDA.
By this time most project components had been substantially completed except for the reconstruction
of urban streets and drains. The project was formally closed on October 31, 1993, two years later
than the originally planned date.
5.02   There were several reasons for the delay in project completion compared to the original
appraisal estimate:
(a)    External factors such as political instability and the war in the South led to a delay in
project startup and occasional delays during implementation;
(b)    The Government agencies that had not worked with IDA previously (the Ministry of
Health for the health component and the City of Khartoum for the urban component)
had to learn IDA's procurement and approval procedures, in some cases with staff



5
who had no prior experience working with donor organizations.
(c)    Some components such as the urban streets and drains required detailed design work
prior to seeking bids from contractor, and
(d)    an overvalued official exchange rate, which inflated local costs to unrealistic levels,
led to delays in the provision of local currency for some project components, although
this problem was ultimately resolved satisfactorily by the Government's willingness to
fund any shortfalls.
5.03  At the same time, there were a number of positive factors that caused implementation to
proceed steadily and harmoniously during the life of the project. First, the creation of the NRIU as a
central coordinating mechanism, while retaining the actual procurement and implementation functions
within the regular sector agencies, proved to be an extremely satisfactory arrangement. Second, the
Government assigned competent and experienced personnel to the NRIU, and while there were some
personnel changes during the life of the project, several key persons stayed with the project over the
entire period. Third, the Bank also maintained unusual continuity of personnel assigned to the
project, with at least four persons (either regular Bank staff or consultants) involved in it from the
appraisal mission to completion.
5.04   Project Risks. One risk identified at appraisal related to the generally weak implementation
capacity of the Government. The establishment of NRIU to provide support to the weaker
organizations was only partially successful in improving the performance of those agencies that had
not worked with the Bank previously. While NRIU itself performed at a high level, some of the
implementing agencies were reluctant to ask for or accept assistance from another organization.
Those agencies familiar with Bank operations generally performed well.
5.05   The other risk identified at appraisal related to possible donor coordination difficulties. This
did not turn out to be a problem, for three reasons:
(a)    The EFRP report produced in October 1988 provided a frame of reference for the
entire program to which all donors could relate.
(b)    The Paris meeting on November 29, 1988 provided a forum in which all donors could
express their intentions and interests, and could adjust their programs in the light of
other donor intentions; the Bank's willingness to serve as "lender of last resort"
facilitated this process.
(c)    The follow-up during implementation by the supervision missions and the use of a
local donors' coordinating group, stimulated and supported by the Bank's Resident
Representative, maintained a spirit of cooperation among the cofinanciers throughout
the implementation period.
5.06   Proiect Redesign. Several factors evolved during implementation that led to changes in the
project design. The Urban component had originally included approximately US$10.0 million for
basic materials for the construction of low cost housing on a self-help basis. However, in view of the
delay in Project startup, most families that had lost their homes had made other living arrangements
by the time that the Project became effective. It also was apparent that it would be very difficult to



6
identify the appropriate recipients. Therefore half of the funds originally allocated for housing
materials was made available for additional repairs for Khartoum streets and drains, and the other half
was allocated to the agricultural sector.
5.07   Also, the US$24.1 million originally identified for transfer from other credits was reduced for
several reasons. Some of the originally estimated amount turned out to be needed for the completion
of the original projects, and hence was not available. Also, another portion would have required
deviations from the original project purposes significant enough to require approval from the
Executive Directors, which at the time was deemed inappropriate (para 2.06). Ultimately only $11.6
million was made available from reallocated funds (US$9.1 million for the agricultural sector and
US$2.5 million for highway repairs) through projects where the flood rehabilitation work was
sufficiently similar to the original project purposes that Board approval was not necessary.
5.08   Another reallocation occurred in June 1991 in response to a severe drought in that year. IDA
agreed that up to US$3.00 million of Credit No. 201 1-SU could be used for drought rehabilitation
(US$1.0 million for essential drugs and US$2.0 million for agricultural inputs such as seeds and
fertilizer). The Credit Agreement was amended accordingly, with the funds to be used for drought
mitigation administered as part of Credit 201 1-SU.
5.09   The changes in the allocations between the original estimate and the final versions, and
disbursements by sector as of April 14, 1994 are as follows, including the US$3.0 million made
available for drought rehabilitation:

5.10   Cofinancing. At the time of the first supervision mission in June 1989, total donor financing
of US$285 million, including US$99.1 million from IDA (US$ 75.0 million from the New Credit and
US$ 24.1 million estimated to be made available from reprogramming of existing Credits), was either
under implementation or was estimated to become available, compared to the US$300.0 million
amount that had been indicated at the Paris meeting in November 1988. During the life of the
project, some donors (notably Japan) increased their support while others reduced or eliminated theirs
as follows:

5.11   All of the cofinancing was on a parallel basis except for US$1.8 million of the Netherlands
for highway repairs. This amount was deposited with IDA for implementation along with the
reallocated IDA funds that were used for this purpose.
6. Project Results
6.01   Physical Results. The physical results achieved by Project financing were generally in line
with the original targets, although there were shortfalls in some sectors, as follows:
a.     ARriculture - Agricultural credit for the purchase of seasonal inputs by farmers
affected by the flood, as well as pumps, spare parts and fuel for agricultural
machinery was largely implemented as planned. US$27.24 million for this sector
(compared to an original allocation of US$19.9 million) was invested.
b.     Education. 48 new primary schools were constructed to replace schools severely
damaged or destroyed by the flood, compared to an original target of 50 schools
(construction of two schools in remote areas was delayed due to a delay in delivery of
construction materials), along with furniture and teaching materials. Only US$10.88
million of IDA funds were required to complete this component compared to an
allocation of US$13.0 million due to the devaluation of the Sudanese pound, which
greatly reduced the local cost of construction in dollars.
c.     Health. Supply of drugs, chemicals and spraying equipment to reduce an expected
high incidence of malaria and diarrheal diseases was made available and applied
successfully, with reported noticeable results in the reduction of the incidence of
malaria, particularly in the Northern Region; US$4.20 million of the US$4.3 million
allocation was utilized in carrying out this component.



8
d.     Telecommunications. Equipment and spare parts to rehabilitate the transmission lines
and exchanges in Khartoum were procured and installed as planned. The other major
element of this component, the replacemilent of the exchanges in several outlying
cities, was delayed due to issues related to their design and cost, which were not
resolved by the time that the Credit was suspended. US$12.58 million was utilized.
e.     Urban.  The housinlg materials compoinenit included in the original program was not
implemented due to the delay in Project startup, as explained in para. 5.06. The
component to renovate the damaged streets and drains in Khartoum was partially
completed, as follows: (i) draini clearing was about 90 percent completed; (ii)
bituminous road repairs were about 50 percent completed; (iii) the gravel road repairs
were not carried out due to a conltract dispute that delayed startup until after
suspension of the Credit; an(d (iv) the addition of new drains to prevent future flood
damage was about 60 percent comipileted at the time of Credit suspension. The Urban
Planning Study for the City of Khartoumil was completed by a well qualified consultant
and made available to the Government. In total, US$18.86 million of the US$22.22
million allocation for the urbani sector was utilized.
f.     Flood Early Warning Study. This study was carried out and the results were
incorporated into the design of an early warning system for use by the Ministry of
Irrigation. The system, based on the collection of internationally available weather
data and its incorporationi into a computerized model, has been put in place, personnel
have been trained in its application, and it is no,w tunctioning. Total disbursements
were US$1.02 milllion, exceeding the originial allocation of US$0.65 million.
g.     Program Coordination. NRIU was successfully established, and adequately fulfilled
its role as project coordiniator. Disbursements for equipment, consultant support and
training totalled IJSS2.2() millioni compared to an original allocation of US$2.3
million.
6.02   Overall, physical results could be considered to have achieved about 80 percent of their
targets, based on a percentage completion in each sector as follows:
Results Achieved
Sector                          (Percent)
Agriculture                           9(
Education                             96
Health                               1((
Telecommunication                     70
Urban                                 60
Flood Early Warning                  1(0
6.03   Proiect Objectives. The Project can be considered successful in meeting its overall objectives
of restoring productive facilities and essential infrastructure, relieving human suffering by restoring
social services, strengthening the institutional framework needed to carryout the EFRP, and
establishing the basis for an early warning system. The establishment of NRIU as an effective unit
greatly facilitated the implementation of overall donor support for the program as well as the IDA



9
financed components. The housing objective was not met for reasons explained earlier. On the
negative side, implementation took considerably longer than originally planned, in part due to political
and other external factors beyond the control of the Project, which to some extent reduced the
favorable impact of the Project on the flood victims. Also, the suspension of disbursements on April
2, 1993 reduced the level of physical achievements below what could have been accomplished by the
October 31, 1993 Closing Date. Nevertheless, on the whole the Project can be judged as having
accomplished its objectives successfully.
7. Project Sustainability
7.01   The issue of sustainability is only applicable to the Flood Early Warning System and the
Khartoum Urban Plan, since the balance of the Project was dedicated to the restoration of existing
facilities and not the achievement of institutional objectives in the particular sectors. Regarding the
Early Warning System, it is in place and is functioning, and it appears likely that the Government will
continue to use it in view of the importance of the level of the Nile and related water systems to
Sudan's extensive irrigated crop production system. Regarding the Urban Plan, this is less likely to
be implemented because of the serious budget constraints that inhibit all new construction.
Nevertheless, it should provide useful guidance at such time as physical expansion of the city's
facilities is possible.
8. Bank Performance
8.01   The Bank's performance in putting together a comprehensive, multi-sectoral recovery
program, complete with detailed documentation in a single mission over a period of less than two
months, was especially impressive. Several of the sectoral plans were later criticized by other donors
as being excessively generous, but on the whole the EFRP document provided a useful framework for
all donors interested in participating in the recovery program. The design of the IDA Project was
sound, and in retrospect the decision to limit the number of sectors receiving IDA support was correct
as this reduced the complexity of an inherently complex operation.
8.02   The Bank's supervision missions were adequate, utilizing sector specialists for each
component as necessary. Relations with NRIU were good during the life of the Project. It was also
helpful that some of the same personnel participated in the Project from the original appraisal mission
until Credit closing, which provided unusual continuity throughout the life of the Project.
9. Borrower Performance
9.01   The borrower's performance varied for the various components. The Government assigned
competent and experienced staff to NRIU, and generally its performance was excellent. The greatest
difficulties were with the Urban component, where the City of Khartoum had no prior experience
working with donor organizations. The other sector implementing organizations were generally
satisfactory, although they were sometimes slow in preparing and evaluating bidding documents.
9.02   Auditing of project accounts was always behind schedule. Specifically, the Audit Report for
the FY91-92 period was five months overdue at the time of the last supervision mission in May 1993.
The Auditor General's Office is reluctant to hire private auditors from project funds, as the Bank has
often suggested.



10
10. Project Relationships
10.01 The Bank's relationships with the Government and its various implementing agencies were
good throughout the project period, as were its relationships with the cofinanciers.
11. Consulting Services
11.01  Most of the Consultants, contractors and suppliers engaged in the Project performed
satisfactorily. However, the joint venture firm that obtained the contract for the road repairs for the
Urban component was less than inadequate, and was partly responsible for the failure to complete 50
percent of this component before the Credit was suspended.
12. Proiect Documentation and Data
12.01 NRIU kept good Project records, and prepared and submitted quarterly reports on time. In
some cases, NRIU had difficulty in obtaining project information from the implementing agencies, but
generally they were able to do so on a timely basis.
13. Findings and Lessons
13.01 The principal lessons learned include the following:
a)     The Bank can play a catalytic role in mobilizing and coordinating donor support for
emergency reconstruction. Early action to identify the needs, spell them out in an
integrated report, and give all interested donors an opportunity to participate in the
process can lead to a successful and well-coordinated result.
b)     Reconstruction programs frequently are multisectoral and therefore inherently
complex; this complexity can be mitigated somewhat by channeling each donor's
assistance (including the Bank's) into a limited number of sectors.
c)     For a multisectoral program of emergency assistance, a central coordinating agency is
necessary in order to serve as a contact point for the donors and the recipient agencies
even when actual implementation is to be carried out by the various sector
organizations.
d)     Continuity on the part of the Bank staff and recipient country staff greatly facilitates
project implementation; and
e)     However, such efforts are extremely costly in terms of staffing, travel, and
coordination and without the additional support obtained from UNDP, might not have
been successfully conducted.
