    Adjustment Loan will support financial sector reforms,\n            supplementing ongoing reforms in the real sector. The loan\n            will be disbursed in two tranches, with parallel financing\n            from the European Union and the African Development Bank.\n            The financial sector reform program, within the context of\n            the Free Trade Association (FTA) with the European Union,\n            aims at upgrading critical performances among the service\n            industry, thus contributing to an economic growth.\n            Specifically, the project will address the financial\n            strengthening of the banking system, while improving loan\n            collateral and foreclosure procedures. Bank privatization\n            and consolidation are policy measures included in the\n            project, as is the modernization of banking law and\n            prudential regulations. Comprehensive reforms of the\n            government securities market will promote monetary control,\n            while regulatory frameworks of non-bank financial\n            intermediation will be enhanced. The project will benefit\n            the banking system, and, while the presence of the\n            Government will be reduced, this will contribute to a\n            stronger market discipline in the management of state-owned\n            banks. The banking system's capacity to adjust to\n            external and internal shocks, will also benefit from the\n            project, as will greater savings mobilization, through\n            financial intermediaries."}, "docdt": "1999-03-26T00:00:00Z"}
