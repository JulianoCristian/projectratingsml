II)\n            is rated satisfactory and sustainability is likely. Both the\n            and Borrower performances are regarded as satisfactory. ECAL\n            II incorporated the lessons of ECAL I by focusing narrowly\n            on upgrading the performance of the financial sector and\n            specifically the banking sector. Given the importance of the\n            banking system in the Tunisian financial sector, it was\n            correctly chosen as the principal target of reforms. An\n            extensive reform package for the insurance sector was not\n            included under this loan because although necessary, the\n            reforms could not have been effectively implemented during\n            the ECAL II timeframe. Instead, preparatory work for\n            insurance sector reforms was done during ECAL II, and the\n            reform measures have been included as part of ECAL III. The\n            series of ECAL adjustment operations in Tunisia have\n            demonstrated the value of appropriately targeted and\n            sequenced reform measures in the long-term development of a\n            country's economy. One particular weakness in ECAL II\n            also provides an important lesson: it is crucial to obtain a\n            firm, binding commitment from all parties having decision\n            authority over actions targeted by the operation. The\n            privatization of the merged bank was included as a condition\n            for the release of the second tranche. Given that the\n            Borrower did not have exclusive control of the merger\n            decision, this measure should not have been included."}, "docdt": "2002-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
