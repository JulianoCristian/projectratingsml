                       THE REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR

              SECONDPOVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORTCREDIT

                                CREDIT SUMMARY


Borrower:       The Republic of Madagascar

Amount:         SDR 53.9 million (US$SO million equivalent) credit

Terms:          Standard IDAterms: 40-year maturity

Description:    A series of single tranche Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs),
                provided in the form o f budget support, i s envisaged to support
                implementation o f Madagascar's Poverty ReductionStrategy Paper (PRSP).

                PRSC 2 is consolidating and deepening support for policy and institutional
                reforms in governance and human development commenced under PRSC 1.
                On governance, PRSC 2 assists the Government incontinued implementation
                o f its 2004 Priority Action Plan for public expenditure managementreforms,
                and in developing the follow-on 2005 Priority Action Plan. The main
                achievements have included improved alignment o f the 2005 budget to the
                priorities o f the PRSP, introduction o f program budgets, which have both
                introduced a medium-term perspective and improve the link between sector
                priorities and budget allocations. There has been continued progress in
                implementing the new Procurement Code, with most o f the draft
                implementing rules and regulations ready, and the Procurement Oversight
                Institution established by decree. A transitional integrated financial
                management system i s functional in Tamatave and is expected to be
                functional in August 2005 in the central treasury and four other regional
                treasuries, and this will greatly facilitate budget execution and monitoring.
                The Auditor General has made strong efforts to clear the backlog o f the draft
                budget execution laws (Projet de Loi deRiglements) till 2001. TheProjet de
                Loi de Reglements for 2002 and 2003 are expected to be finalized by
                December 2005. The institutional and legal environment for anti-corruption
                has been significantly strengthened, and the Anti-Corruption Agency is now
                operational. Customs reform is now being guided by reform strategy and
                action plan. PRSC 2 continues to support the Government's Education for
                All Agenda with continued support to policy measures aimed at increasing
                access to, and quality of, primary education, including the update o f the EFA
                plan, elimination o f school fees, provision of learningmaterials to all primary
                students, teacher recruitment, reform o f the curricula and reinforcement o f
                management capacity at central and decentralized levels.           Primary net
                enrolment rates have increased dramatically, beyond expectations, to well
                over 90 percent.      Now, the challenge lies in improving the quality o f
                schooling and enhancing learning outcomes. PRSC 2 also supports policy
                andinstitutional reforminthe nutrition sector, including the establishment of
                a National Nutrition Council and its supporting secretariat, the Office
                National de Nutrition. PRSC 2 has also supported health reforms, through
                the updating o f the national policy on health and the introduction of a
                Medium Term Expenditure Framework for the sector. Health outcomes for
                immunization and infant and child mortality have improved significantly
                between 1997 and 2003, with the child mortality declining from 163.9 in
                1997 to 94 in 200314, a 43 percent decline. PRSC 2 has also supported

                improved access to rural water through the development o f a Water for All
                program, and scaling up implementation with higher budget allocations and
                increasedsector capacity.

                The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA, 2003),                  the
                Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR, 2003), and the 2005 Public
                Expenditure Review (PER) provide the analytical underpinnings for the
                public sector reform agenda, and updated analysis for the Education for All
                underpins education reforms. A Health Sector Note has provided the
                foundations for the health policy reforms. A supporting Governance and
                Institutional Development project is assisting the government to put in place
                systems to strengthen budget management, and finance technical assistance
                and capacity building.

Benefits:       The proposed series o f PRSCs will contribute to Madagascar reaching its
                development goals. The reforms supported will strengthen the institutional
                infrastructure needed to improve the public sector's capacity to carry out its
                role more effectively. In addition, strengthened monitoring and evaluation
                will lead to an enhancedaccountability and results focus. Improved delivery
                o f public services is essential if the Government is to reach its goals for
                poverty reductionand improve the quality o f life inMadagascar.

Risks:          The Bank sees the following risks in the implementation of the PRSP: (i)
                various external shocks including cyclones; (ii)political risk and
                deterioration o f popularity for the President and his reforms, and with
                forthcoming elections in eighteen months, short-term considerations could
                dominate, jeopardizing longer-term PRSP goals; (iii)unsatisfactory
                implementation o f budgetary and governance reforms could hamper the
                delivery o f results; (iv) erosion o f trade preferences and slow pace o f reforms
                allowing other developing countries to become more competitive; (v) low
                confidence o f private sector investors in the Malagasy economy; and (vi)
                difficulties in PRSP implementation, due to weak institutional capacity,
                under-financing or lack o fa coherent donor effort.

                The Government and Bank are undertakingseveral measuresto mitigate risk.
                A Risk Management and Social ProtectionReview by the Bank is underway
                to assess riskprevention and mitigationstrategies, andthe Bank has modified
                procedures for its Community Development Project to rapidly respond to
                emergencies. On governance reforms, the Bank is continuing to support
                reforms in the areas o f public financial management and capacity building
                through ongoing operations, the governance project and WBI capacity
                buildingsupport. The Bank proposes to mitigate political risk by trying to
                achieve quick successes, by accelerating disbursements, as was seen inFY03
                and FY04. On trade, the government is accelerating reforms to improve
                competitiveness, and actively participating in trade negotiations. On the last
                risk, the donor community has intensified efforts at coordinating assistance
                programs, harmonizing disbursements and procurement procedures and
                developing common programmatic approaches around the PRSP. The donor
                community i s increasing its level o f financial aid to Madagascar, and is also
                providing technical assistance and support for capacity building for
                sustainability.
Estimated
Disbursement:   SDR 53.9 million (US$SO equivalent) will be disbursedina single tranche
                following effectiveness.

                      SECONDPOVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT
                                       PROGRAMDOCUMENT

                                        I.INTRODUCTION

1.      This ProgramDocumentproposesa second Poverty ReductionSupport Credit (PRSC) for
Madagascar for US$SO million. This operation follows the first PRSC approved by the Board on July
20, 2004, and continues the implementation o f the three-year policy and institutional reform agenda as
laid out inthe policy matrix. This operation i s an integral part o f the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) to support the implementation o f the Government's poverty reduction strategy, as spelled out in
the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The objective of Madagascar's PRSP i s to promote rapid
and sustainable development to reduce poverty by half in ten years. To attain this objective, the PRSP
lays out three key priorities: (i)  improving governance; (ii)    promoting broad based growth; and (iii)
providing human and material security. A cross-cutting pillar of monitoring and evaluationunderpins the
strategy.

2.      The implementationof the programsupported under the first operation (PRSC 1) has been
satisfactory. Most of the prior actions for PRSC 2 are broadly on track to be completed by mid-June
2004. The programdocument reviews the progress made inimplementing the poverty reduction strategy,
with particular emphasis on the areas o f focus of PRSC support (governance and human development).
The reform program supported under PRSC 2 has continued to deepen and consolidate reforms that
commenced with PRSC 1infightingcorruption, improving public expenditure management and customs,
and inimplementingthe Education for All and nutrition programs. Inaddition, reforms to expand access
to safe drinkingwater, improve health outcomes andprovide protection from shockshave also advanced.

3.       The PRSC program for the first three PRSCs focuses explicitly on the strategic axes of
governance and human development as explained above, and includes specific policy actions inthese
areas. The PRSC does not include any specific policy actions on the pillar of broad-based growth. While
we do have a policy dialogue inthese areas as part o f the PRSC, the Bank support for growth is through
our significant portfolio o f ongoing investmentprojects ininfrastructure, environment, rural development
and the new Integrated GrowthPoles project beingpresented to the Board inFY06. Startingwith PRSC
4, the focus on growth will be enhanced, based on the analytical work that i s currently ongoing, on the
investment climate, the financial sector, and landrights.

4.      Madagascar has continued to make good progress in implementing its poverty reduction
strategy over the last year, despitethe difficultyear markedby exogenous shocks. While 2004 has
been a difficult year, with many external shocks, and the impact of the 2003 tax-exemptions taking effect,
the Government has responded appropriately with policy adjustments aimed at maintaining
macroeconomic stability. Two cyclones hit Madagascar in early 2004 causing widespread damage to
infrastructure and agricultural land and leaving thousands homeless. The policy decision to give a two-
year tax exemption in September 2003 for investment goods and unfortunately, a range of luxury
consumer goods, spurred imports. In addition, imports increased due to the accelerated implementation
of the investment program, and increase in the international price of oil, and contributed to a sharp
depreciation o f the exchange rate in the first half o f 2004, leading to inflationary pressures. Erratic
management inthe early part of the year by the Central Bank contributed to exchange rate volatility. The
Government responded to these shocks quickly in May 2004 with a mix o f monetary and fiscal policy
measures complemented by safety nets, and the exchange rate stabilized. But, the sharp increase in


                                                       1

international oil and rice prices continued to put pressureon inflation. The Government has continued to
adjust its policy to manage inflation. Inflation for the year 2004 was 27 percent (year on year), but the
inflation calculated for prices excluding oil and rice, was a more modest rate ofjust over 6 percent (end
November 2004, year on year). Rice prices, which had continued to rise sharply during the first two
months of 2005 contributed to 30 percent inflation inFebruary 2005 (year on year). But rice prices have
started declining in March 2005 and overall inflation for 2005 is expected to decline to single digit
figures. The latest inflationnumbers show a decline inApril 2005 to 21.9 percent (year-on-year).

5.       Despite these large shocks, GDP growth in 2004 is projected to remain robust at 5.3 percent
due to strong growth of the Export Processing Zones (EPZs), tourism and increased public investment,
especially for infrastructure. Madagascar has also maintained its focus on implementing its poverty
reduction strategy, as documented in its First Annual PRSP Progress Report, with good results evident
particularly in the implementation o f the roads program, Education for All, nutrition, and improving the
institutional environment for anti-corruption. Madagascar reached the Heavily Indebted Poor Country
(HIPC) Initiative Completion Point in October 2004 bringing significant debt relief and improved
prospects to maintain sustainable debt levels inthe medium term. Madagascar has also recently become
the first country to receivefinancing fromthe MillenniumChallenge Account.

                      11. RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

                               A.     MACROECONOMIC          PERFORMANCE
6.       The macro-economic environment in 2004 has been difficult, marked by exogenous shocks,
sharp depreciation o f the exchange rate, with high inflation but the reform program that Madagascar
embarked upon after the economic and political crisis o f 2002 has continued to be implemented steadily,
and growth is still projected to be a robust 5.3 percent in 2004. As noted in the PRSC 1 program
document, Madagascar was hit by two back-to-back cyclones barely a month apart inearly 2004, which
rendered over a third o f a million people homeless, destroyed 300,000 hectares (or 10 percent) of
agricultural land and causedwidespread destruction of infrastructure, including around 4,600 damaged or
destroyed schools and health centers. There was a huge increase in imports in the first part of 2004,
linked to the tax-exemptions granted in Fall 2003, the impact of the cyclone, the scaled-up
implementation of the investment program and an increase in the international price of oil. This put
pressure on the exchange rate which depreciated strongly. Erratic and unsuccessful attempts by the
Central Bank to maintain the value o f the FMG against the Euro, led to volatility in the exchange rate
market. The Government responded with a series o f measures and since the middle of 2004, the
exchange rate has stabilized.

7.       Given the recent volatility of the exchange rate and its adverse impact on the economy,
Madagascar has adopted measures to ensure exchange rate stability and competitiveness, and
secure an adequate level of international reserves. These measures include the issuance of guidelines
by the Central Bank in December 2004, with technical assistance from the IMF, for intervention in the
foreign exchange market with the aim o f directing Central Bank interventions to achieving its foreign
assets objectives and at dampening sharp swings that would create uncertainty'. The establishment o f a
continuous inter-bank foreign exchange market with an electronic trading system is expected to provide
accurate information to the operators and reduce the volatility o f the exchange rate. The transition to the
Ariary, the newcurrency introduced fully inJanuary 2005, was orderly.

' Indeed, in2004 the Central Bank reduced considerably its international reserves to the equivalent 2.8 months of
imports as opposed to 4 months in 2002 and 3.3 months in 2001, in an attempt to stabilize the nominal exchange
rate.


                                                      2

8.       But inflation poses a major risk. The depreciation of the exchange rate put pressure on prices.
This combinedwith sharp increases ininternationaloil andrice prices has contributed to inflation of 27
percent year-on-year at the end of December 2004. The Government has made policy adjustments to
manage inflation. The Government increased the Central Bank base rate inthree steps from 7 percent to
16percent andraisedreserverequirements from 12percent to 15 percent. Inmid-2004, non-wage current
expenditures were reduced by 10 percent, while efforts were made to protect priority expenditures in
education and health.      The VAT on luxury consumer goods was also re-instated. But rice prices
continued to rise through February 2004, on the heels o f highinternationalprices, and low imports inthe
first halfo f the year, whichpromptedthe Government facilitation o frice imports with selectedcompanies
for sale at a regulatedprice of FMG3500kg. A dual rice market existed, with the regulated rice available
inlimitedquantities, and open market rice at around FMG 7-8,OOOkg. The highrice prices have likely
caused hardship for local consumers, especially during the lean season of November-February 2005.
Producer prices are reported to have been higher for the early harvest than previous years, which should
be good for rural farmers. Consumer prices have finally started declining in March 2005, and inflation
endApril 2005 stands at 21.9 percent (year-on-year).

9.       The Government implemented safety net programs to help the poor deal with the negative
economic shocks (cyclones, highrice prices and overall inflation). Donor and government financing for
safety nets reached around US$16-18 million for these shocks inadditionto the regular fundingo f around
US$2.8 million for safety nets through the Community Development Fundproject. The most important
intervention was labor-intensive public works programs. But in response to the large increase in rice
prices, towards the end of the year, the labor intensive public works included free health care and child
care in highly affected areas o f Antananarivo and Toamasina. Emergency nutrition packages were also
made available to childrenunder the age o f five, pregnant and lactatingwomen.


                                     B.   MEDIUM     TERMOUTLOOK

10.      Growth has rebounded quickly after the 2002 crisis. After a sharp decline of 13 percent in
2002, growth was 9.8 percent in2003 and i s projected to reach 5.3 percent in2004. The macroeconomic
projection o f the IMF under the PRGF forecasts an average growth rate o f 6.5 percent over the medium
term (2005-2008).

11.      The reforms adopted inthe last two years are expected to promote a private sector, export-
led growth in the medium-term. Exports are projected to recover from the adverse impact of the
2002 crisis and average 20.6 percent of GDP over the forecast period. Recovery has already taken
place with exports/GDP reaching 22 percent of GDP in 2004 thanks to a surge in tourism receipts and
good performance o f textiles. Despite the expiration o f the Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) and the
instability o f the prices o f primary products such as vanilla, exports are projected to remain stable at
around 20 percent of GDP inthe medium-term. Textiles, tourism, miningand shrimps are still expected to
account for the bulk o f Malagasy exports.

12.      Overall investment will average 23.7 percent of GDP against an average of 15.7 per cent
over the 1997-2001 period and will be driven mainly by an increase in private investment. Private
investment is projected to reach 15 percent of GDP for the year 2005, compared to an average of 8.1 per
cent o f GDP between 1997 and 2001, and i s projectedto average 13.5 percent o f GDP over the forecast
period. Although foreign direct investment (FDI) still remains low after the crisis, amountingto 1percent
o f GDP in 2004, it i s expected to increase in the coming years with a projected average of 1.5 o f GDP'.
The privatization of the cotton company, direct investment in tourism and mining and the investment
related to the implementation of the management contracts in infrastructure (airports, ports,
telecommunications, electricity and water) will give impetusto an increaseinFDI.

13.      Government expenditures will average 21 percent of GDP over the forecast period, with
public investment averaging 10.2 percent of GDP versus 7.4 percent of GDP over the 1997-2001
period. Government expenditures on capital reflect the 2004-2008 investments in roads, in irrigation
(FERHA) and the planned investments under the Bank's Integrated Growth Poles Project on energy,
water and sanitation investment in Nosy Be as well as additional infrastructure around the EPZ and
information communicationand technology (ICT) parks of Antananarivo.

14.       A few export-oriented sub-sectors will play a major role in driving growth although all
sectors are expectedto improve their performance. The EPZ sector will grow at an average rate of 5
percent. Despite the extension o f the AGOA and Madagascar's price competitiveness, growth in the
sector will gradually decrease due to the impact o f the expiration of the MFA and a projected decrease in
intemational prices in textiles. Tourism and related activities are expected to grow further given the
planned private investment in hotels3 and the increasing number o f tourists (254,000 tourists visited
Madagascar in 2004 compared to 179,000 visitors in2001). Current reforms in air transport such as the
implementation of the open-sky policy, the opening of additional gateway cities and the planned
concessioning of the main airports in 2005 are expected to further increase the number o f tourists in the
coming years. A number of large scale investments are expected to take place inminingfrom 2005. The
sector i s projectedto grow by 5.6 percent in2005 but will experience a net increase from 2006 onwards at
an annual rate of 8 percent with the planned investments inthe sector. Fisheries will grow at a stable rate
of 3 percent thanks to a sustained growth in the shrimp sector. Madagascar still benefits from the niche
export market for highquality farmed shrimp with the EuropeanUnion due to good farming practices and
the stringent quality controls adopted by the large corporate firms. The creation o f certification in 2005
will also helpincreasethe value o fMadagascar's shrimp.

15.      Agriculture i s projected to sustain the good performance initiated in 2003 and 2004 in the
medium-term, with an annual growth rate of 3.5 percent. Despite the cyclones, agriculture grew by
3.5 percent in2004. A significant increase inproducer prices inrice in20044, the implementation of the
FERHAprogram aimed at rehabilitating and establishing a viable maintenance mechanismfor the large
scale irrigation in Madagascar from 2005 onwards and the impact o f the road program are expected to
provide stronger incentives to producers. In addition, the emphasis on agriculture as spelled out in the
vision, MadagascarNaturellement (see Section 110, and additional donor support for the sector provided
by the MillenniumChallenge Account are expected to sustain the projected growth performance of the
agriculture over the medium-term.



 FDIis expected to increase from SDR30 millionin2004 to SDR 61.7 millionin2008.
 The FrenchholdingACCOR has announced a significant investment inMadagascar. The restructuring of the state-
owned hotels and the rksewes fonciers touristiques are starting in 2005 and the Integrated Growth Poles Project is
expected to start by end-2005.
  I t was reported that producer prices increased from 700 Fmg on average in the previous years to 2000 Fmg in
2004.

16.      The Government has started to implement a number of actions to increase tax revenues
gradually and support the planned increase in public investment, with the goal of reaching 13
percentof GDP in 2008 from 10.9 percentof GDP in2004. The increase intax collection is necessary
to support fiscal consolidation without imposing limitations on the required levels o f expenditures in
relation to the growth and poverty reduction objectives. Inthe short-term, the Government will address
tax administration weaknesses and broaden the tax base. Customs' reform will be at the core. In
September 2004, The Government rescinded the VAT on the luxury consumption goods exempted for
two years in September2003. Major reforms under way include actions to: (i)       strengthen the Sewice des
Grandes Entreprises (SGE) collecting tax fkom large enterprises; (ii)      close loopholes that reduce tax
collections and to recover arrears and amounts in dispute; (iii) rationalize the tax and tariff structure; (iv)
install one-stop shops inthe mainports to speed up customs clearance. The Government has merged the
customs and import taxes into a single tax; customs duties credit has been eliminated (crbdit de droit);
payments o f the customs duties through the banking system is mandatory since April 2005; and the
immunityofcustoms agents from enquiriesandprosecution hasbeenabolished.

17.      In the medium term, the balance of payments is projected to improve with the level of
international reserves recovering gradually and reaching the equivalent of 3.5 months of GNFS
imports at the end of the forecast period compared to 2.7 months in 2004. Along with an
improvement of the capital and financial account due to the net increase in FDI, the current account
balance deficit, including grants, i s projected to decrease steadily from 10.6 percent of GDP in 2004 to
4.7 percent of GDP in2008, with the trade account deficit registering 5.5 percent o f GDP compared to 9
percent o f GDP in2004.

 18.     Madagascar attained the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries W P C ) completion point in
October 2004. Subsequent to the approval by the Executive Boards of IDA and the IMF, the
Government met with representatives of the Paris Club group on November 16, 2004 to discuss the
reduction of its stock of debt. The Paris Club cancelled its share of the debt in the framework of HIPC.
After assuming full delivery o f HIPC debt relief, the NPV of external debt would be reduced to the
equivalent to 194 percent of exports. At the request of the Malagasy authorities, most bilateral creditors
have committed to grant additional debt relief to Madagascar. If this assistance is forthcoming, the NPV
of external debt will represent the equivalent to 137 percent of exports at end-2003, restoring debt
sustainability below the thresholds o f 150 percent (see Table 4).        Madagascar is exiting from the
enhanced HIPC Initiative with significantly improved chances to achieve and maintain sustainable debt
levels over the medium term.

 19.     Debt Data Management. The authorities have undertaken steps to improve debt data
management. All the loans for which the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance were responsible had

been entered into the UNCTAD's (DMFAS) new database system (SYGADE) and an integrated data
management system will be established between the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance. In
addition, the authorities have contacted relevant internationalagencies to buildcapacity on debt analysis5.

20.     Between1960 and 2001, per capita incomeinMadagascar declinedfromUS3430to US$230,
and as a consequence poverty increased, especially during the 1980s. The long economic decline
impacted adversely onpeople's quality o f life as demonstrated by the low levels o f many social indicators
and access to basic utilities. With the resumption o f sustained growth duringthe period 1997-2001, there
was poverty reduction, but limited to urban areas. The poverty profile is available from the analysis of
the 2001 household survey. A household survey has recently been completed (in March 2005) and the
analysis i sjust commencing. Recent trends inhouseholdwelfare are available from a recently completed
commune survey and the Demographic and Health Survey of 2003/2004 and the updated poverty profile
from the 2004 household survey will be presented inthe next PRSC document.

21.     Poverty in Madagascar is mainly prevalent in rural areas with 77 percent of the rural
population being poor in 2001 compared to 44 percent in urban areas. In contrast to urban poverty,
which had a strong correlation with economic performance, particularly during the last five years, the
trends show that rural poverty has steadily increased, irrespective of the evolution o f the economic
situation.

22.     About 80 percent of the rural populationhas no reliabletransport services due to poor road
conditions, and of these one third has no road access at all. Studies suggest that lack o f access to

roads and markets, low agricultural productivity and rural poverty are closely associated. Inparticipatory
investigations, as well as quantitative analysis of household surveys, rural families stress poor roads and
the need to improve agricultural productivity among their major concerns. This is mirrored, for example,
inthe relationship between yields and remoteness.Ruralhouseholds better connected to markets have a
significantly higher productivity than those living inmore isolated areas and the same relationship holds
for the use of modem inputs such as fertilizer.           Isolation also implies lacking access to financial
institutions and credit, forcing poor farmers to sell at times of low, post-harvest prices.

23.      Education is negatively correlated with poverty. Individuals in households with few or no
members who have completed primary education are more likely to be poor. The difference between
urban and rural areas is significant interms of school enrolment, completion and literacy rates. But, the
Government's priority to primary education and policy initiatives under the Education for All program,
including the abolition o f school fees, recruitment of teachers for rural schools, rehabilitation and
reconstruction of school establishments, payment o f FRAM teachers' salaries in the and distribution of
materials and supplies have ledto a very large increaseinenrolment, andthis has beenpro-poor.

24.      While there have been improvements in health status indicators, health services for the
urban poor and rural population remain inadequate. While overall trends have improved for
immunization, pre-natal consultation, and skilled attendance at delivery, low income populations remain
inequitably served. For example, based on the recent DHS, only 32 percent of the lowest quintile of the
population, based on an asset index, are completely immunized, compared with 80 percent among the
better-off population. Furthermore, while the child mortality rate significantly decreased from 163.9 in
1997 to 94 in 2003 (a 43 percent drop), the poor-rich differential in child mortality remains highas 3.5.
Low incomes are compounded by low effective health coverage (60 percent o f the population live within
5 km of a health facility) and an insufficient number of physicians and other health care providers in
existing health facilities. While free access to drugs in2002 and 2003 boosted health facility utilization,
the supply system failed to sustain drugavailability due to the absence of the demand-side "pull" from the
patients and the peripheralhealth centers.


  B.     THEGOVERNMENT'S           STRATEGY FORREDUCINGPOVERTYAND ITSIMPLEMENTATION

25.      Implementation of the PRSP is proceedingwell (see Table 5). The Government prepared its
First Annual Progress Report outlining progress in implementing its PRSP in July 2004.                  The
Government is preparing a Progress Report for the calendar year 2004, and is planning to prepare its
Annual Report on a calendar year basis to correspond to the budget cycle with a mid-year report on
implementation in July to inform the budget preparation for the following year. InNovember 2004, the
Government articulated a vision up to 2015: Madagascar Naturellement (see Box 1). While recognizing
the enormous potentialofMadagascar, this visionputsa renewedfocus onruraldevelopment, throughthe
roads program, education and health and establishing better linkages between the urban and rural areas,
and increasing the value added in agriculture. The vision sees a transformation o f Madagascar from a
subsistence economy to a market economy, increased exports, and enhanced linkages between rural
economy and the industrial economy through agro-industries, pharmaceuticals, textiles and the
transformation of mineral products, and through economic services such as tourism and agricultural
credit. Inline with its vision, the Government has presented a results-framework (LaPolitique Gdnkrale
de I'Etat 2005) which aims for growth of at least 7 percent, inflation o f 6 percent or less and private
investment of at least 14 percent.       The key priorities identified include the reinforcement of the
effectiveness of Government, good governance, infrastructure, education for all, rural development and
environment, drinking water for all, health and AIDS prevention, private sector development, and
tourism. These priorities are formulated as national programs, and there is a strong focus on integrating
donor interventions into the national programs. The Government has prepared an update of the PRSP


                                                        8

incorporating this vision and this was discussed at a two-day workshop in early June 2005 involving a
wide range of stakeholders.

StrategicAxis I:Good Governance

26.      Inthe area of governance, the main elements of the PRSP include the fight against corruption,
improved public expenditure management, respecting democracy, establishing an equitable justice
system, and implementingdecentralization.

27.      The Government has continued to focus on fighting corruption and implementing public
finance reforms. The Anti-Corruption Agency is now fully functional.          The Government remains
committed to implementingpublic finance reforms and improving the efficiency and equity of public
funds (see Section IV for a detailed description of the reformprogram). The implementationofthe 2004
Priority Action Plan has been satisfactory, and based on this plan, the govemment has strengthened its
budget preparationprocess (e.g. by aligning the budget closer to PRSP priorities) as well as introducing a
medium term perspective into the budget (through the introduction o f program budgeting for all
ministries). Other reforms include the implementation o f the key recommendations o f the independent
audit o f the Treasury, and strengthened internal and external controls. The Government has established
regions and competitively selected chefi de rkgions to co-ordinate development activities across
communes.

28.      There has been some progressinthe functioning of customs andjustice. The improvements
in customs have been geared to speeding up clearance processes, combating corruption and improved
revenue collection. The Govemment has prepared a strategy and action plan to implement customs
reforms. Justice reformi s gearedtowards deterring corruption inthe sector, expediting the processing o f
cases, and improving the legal environment for the economy.

StrategicAxis 2: Broad-Based Growth

29.      The Government's strategy for broad-based growth is geared toward maintaining
macroeconomic stability and achievinghigh annualgrowth. The main elements of the Government's
strategy for broad-based growth focus on facilitating private sector development, accelerating the roads
program, rural development, fostering public-private partnerships and greater opening up o f the economy.

30.      The ambitious transport sector program has been successful in rehabilitating the road
network. However structural reforms have been slower. In 2004, the Government rehabilitated
around 2,700 km o f road. The creation of the Agency for Terrestrial Support (ATT) and the Road
Authority have been delayed and are expectedby end-2005 andmid-June 2006 respectively.

31.      Ruraldevelopment and environment are criticalelements of the Government's strategy to
fight poverty, since over four infive poor people live inruralareas. The Government has implementedits
priorities, including institutional strengthening, the implementation of its Action Plan for Rural
Development, and taken steps towards the establishment o f Fond d'Entretien des Rbeaux Hydro
Agricoles (FERHA) to provide financing for the maintenance o f irrigation infkastructure. The
Government has continued to implement the National Environment Action Plan (NEAP), focusing on
institutionalreforms, improving governance, and improvingthe financing for the environment.

                               Box 1: Vision 2015 Madagascar Naturellement
                                                       -
Madagascar Naturellement, the vision for the country in 2015, was defined by the President of Madagascar
during a Cabinet meeting on November 24,2004 :Madagascar will be a country known worldwide for the beauty
o f its rich and well-protected biodiversity. The diversified and rich natural resource base (agriculture, favorable
climate combined with the large surface o f available land, livestock and fisheries, mining) will contribute to the
creation o f products with high value added such as essential oil, agri-business, pharmaceutical, mining etc.
Madagascar will be a reputable destination for ecotourism. The rural areas will grow steadily, thanks to more
diversified and transformed agricultural products and the development o f industrial infrastructure in the regions.
Exports will be on a upward trend to support the current account balance and help stabilize the exchange rate.
Broader impact o f growth and a progressive redistribution o f its benefits will help reduce poverty substantially.
Education and health will be accessible to the population and infrastructure will be well developed allowing for free
movement o f goods and people. The gap betweenthe rural andurbanareas willbe smaller and movements o fpeople
from rural areas to urban areas will be limited. Investments will be secured and Madagascar will develop
harmoniously.

                                 What is rewired to achieve the 2015 obiectives?

The strengthening of the rural areas as a prerequisite to shared and accelerated growth. With the majority o f
the population eaming their living from agriculture emphasis should be put on the strengthening o f the rural areas.
This approach also entails indirect actions through the strengthening o f the linkages of the economy to the rural
areas  -  development o f industrial activities related to agriculture (agri-business, pharmaceutical, textile, tourism,
mining) to increasehigher value-added agricultural exports.

Improved govemance and capacity; provision o f assets through infrastructure, education and health; enhanced
openness to the world economy; promotion o f a market economy thiough the abolition o f monopolies, rent seeking
andpredatory behavior.

Better infrastructure through measures ranging from: (i) rehabilitation o f ports and airports to support
                                                                    the
exports; (ii) the creation o f adequate storage facilities in regions, and: (iii) creation o f agro-cities aimed at
                                                                                   the
supporting the development o f specific product value chains.

Education: introduction o f training on agriculture insecondary education; strengthening o fresearch andtraining on
agri-business, tourism and textiles through partnership with international experts.

Incentives through standards, regulation and tax system: acceleration o f land titling; improved rural credit;
flexible landtaxation system depending on the use o f land; setting up o f norms and certification.


                                       L a Politique Gknkrale de 1'Etat in 2005

La Politique Gknkrale de I'Etat are the critical actions and results in2005 that are critical steps towards attaining the
objectives o f Madagascar Naturellement in 2015. There are 3-5 results by Ministry which form part o f the result:
agreement between the President and his Cabinet.

Update of the PRSP: (i) Madagascar Naturellement vision into the PRSP ;(ii) coordination o f tht
                           include                                                         improve
donors' program to reflect the Government's vision; (iii) and elaborate on 2005 and 2006 action plan basec
                                                             revise
on the followings priority areas.

Priority areas: (i)strengthen the capacity o f the Government and high officials; (ii) govemance; (iii
                                                                                                 good
infrastructure ;(iv) education for all; (iv) rural development, agri-business and environment (v) water for all; (vi)
health; HIV-AIDS; (vii) private sector development and (viii) tourism.

32.      The Government has continued with public enterprise                       reform. TELMA, the
telecommunications company was privatized in June 2004, and the cotton parastatal (HASYMA) was
privatized in October 2004. A management contract for the sugar company (SIRAMA) commenced in
June 2004 for the plant in Ambilobe, July 2004 for Namakia and October 2004 for Nosy Be and
Brickaville. The energy parastatal (JIRAMA) was put under management contract inFebruary 2005. Air
Madagascar i s continuing operations under a management contract, and the Government has announced a
free sky policy inFebruary 2005. The NorthernRailway has been concessioned, and plans to concession
the Southern Railway are underway.

33.       The Government has continued to consolidate and simplify the tariff structure. The import
tax and customs duty were consolidated into a single customs duty in the 2005 Loi des Finances. The
two year exemption granted for luxury consumer goods and investment goods in September 2003 was
partly rescinded by reinstating the VAT on luxury consumer goods in September 2004. The VAT will
decrease from 20 percent to 18 percent in September 2005 when the import tariff and VAT are re-
imposedon tax exempted goods. Tariffs on rice were reduced from 20 percent to 10percent. This was in
responseto the new economic environment, where the depreciation o f the exchangerate and higher world
prices of rice, mean that a lower tariff still ensures that at the prevailing producer price most farmers
would be able to recuperate production costs, while ensuring a reasonable retail price for urban
consumers.

StrategicAxis 3: Human andMaterialSecurity

34.       Under the strategic axis of human and material security, the main objective i s to enhance
human capacity and strengthen each individual's assets, through education, health and nutrition.
The PRSP views the commune as the main local service provider and the anchor for all interventions in
this domain.

35.       Ensuring a basic education for all Malagasies      -Education    for All (EFA) remains the top
priority. Enrolment rates have continued to increase, with a net enrollment ratio of over 90 percent
in the school year 200415 (see Section IV for details). The main policy initiatives include keeping the
Madagascar EFA plan on track, gradually introducing a nine-year quality basic education; ensuring
equality of access to education; and improving the cost-efficiency o f education, through reductions in
grade repetition and improved primary completion rates. The enrolment increase in response to these
policy initiatives has exceeded expectations and the Government has updated its EFA plan. Madagascar
has also submitted its application for the EFA Fast Track Initiative, and it i s expected that Madagascar
will receive incremental funding to support its EFA plan. But, while the enrollment increase has been
remarkable, the challenge now lies inretaining the children inschool and ensuring they learn. Improving
the quality of schoolingremains a bigchallenge.

36.       The objective o f the Five Year Health Plan (2002-2006) o f the Ministry o f Health (MoH), as
reflected in the PRSP, i s to improve the access o f the Malagasy people, especially the poor, to health
 services and protect them from diseases by immunizing all children; improving the access o f women to
prenatal care and to assisted childbirth; combating public health problems; improved access to medical
care and medicines, and improving the performance and financial viability of the health system. The
Government's strategy for improved access to health care by the poor includes (i)       institutingappropriate
 financing mechanisms based on solidarity for the indigents at health center level; (ii)   establishing equity
 funds at hospital level to protect the poor from overwhelming expenditures; and (iii)        piloting mutual
 insurance schemes inareas where seasonalvariations inincome hamper access to health care temporarily.

 37.      Specifically, in a context of scarce financial and human resources, the M o H will assure health
 care availability by: (i) making existing health facilities (health centers and first referral hospitals) fully


                                                      11

functional;    (ii)boosting referrals from peripheral health centers to hospitals through improved
communication and transport; (iii)       setting up mobile preventive and curative clinics to reach populations
lacking access to primary health care facilities; (iv) extending the range o f drugs and consumables
available inpublic health facilities; and (v) guaranteeing free or subsidized treatment for life threatening
diseasesor dissaseswith significant externalities.

38.      M o H will also seek to ensure minimum levels of health care quality by: (i)             strengthening the
drug and consumables' supply system; (ii)        providing regular on-the-job training opportunities for health
staff; (iii)ensuring propermaintenance of buildings,equipments and vehicles; and (iv) setting up a proper
quality assurance mechanism. It will seek to contain the growth of public health expenditure by: (i)
promoting efficient healthcare delivery (good quality services at the least possible cost), notably through
rationalizing human resources management (qualifications, incentives and geographical redeployment
between urban and rural health facilities); (ii)    targeting the poor for free or subsidized interventions; and
(iii) informeddecisionondrugpolicyissuesandtechnologicalchoices.

Note:This list includessomeprior actions for PRSC2

 39.      Strengthening the fight against malnutritionand continuation of the national AIDS awareness
 and prevention campaign are also important priorities in the PRSP. Communicable diseases targeted by
 the GOM include malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, schistosomiasis, plague, STI and HIV/AIDS. Priority
 activities include supporting surveillance activities, prevention and improving patient care individually or
 through mass treatment.       Activities to reduce non-communicable diseases include improved health
 infrastructure, referral and care programs, and prevention and community mobilization. The targeted
 illnesses include cardiovascular disease, cancers, mental disorders, and diabetes. The Government will

also implement activities for prevention of disabilities and improved access to public infrastructures for
individuals with disabilities.

40.      Inrural water supply, the Government's objective is to expand coverage to 80 percent of the
rural population and 100percent of urban areas by 2015. Drinkingwater for all i s one o f the priorities of
the Government, as outlined in the Politique Gdndrale de 1'Etat 2005. The Government has prepared a
strategy for water and sanitation for all, and has significantly increased its allocations in the budget for
2005 to scale up the implementationof its drinkingwater program.
                         c.WORLDBANKCOUNTRYASSISTANCESTRATEGY
                      AND SUPPORT TO THE IMPLEMENTATIONOFTHE PRSP

41.      The Bank's support to Madagascar, as outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy of
November 2003, is geared towards the implementation of the PRSP, using ongoing and new
investment lending and budget support, analytical work, and the services of the broader Bank Group (IFC,
MIGA, and WBI). The FY05 program for Madagascar reflected the transition to programmatic lending
with the first single-tranche annual Poverty Reduction Support Credit approved in July 2004.              A
supplemental credit for US$50million for the Community DevelopmentProject was also approved to aid
Madagascar rebuild its infrastructure after the devastating back-to-back cyclones o f early 2004. A
supplemental credit for health will also be approved in late FY05. InFY06, an Integrated Growth Poles
Project and a secondHIV/AIDS project i s plannedalong with the PRSC 2.

42.       As notedinPRSC 1Program Document,the CAS also outlines a program of analyticaland
advisory activities (AAA) (see Table 6) to underpin its policy dialogue and programmatic lending.
Two key analytical reports have been completed this year. The integrative Development Policy Review
on Sustaining Growthfor Enhanced Poverty Reduction outlines the growth strategy and priorities for
reform for Madagascar to achieve shared growth. The Public Expenditure Review, which provides
recommendations on the public expenditure reform agenda and specific recommendations for the
transport, education and environment sectors, also helped underpin the key reforms for PRSC 2. The
findings of the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA, FY03) and the Country
Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR, FY03) as noted before, have also been critical in defining the
reform program of the Government. The Government remains committed to monitoring progress in
implementingits public expenditure reformprogram under the HIPC Public Expenditure Assessment and
Action Plan. Madagascar i s also a pilot country for the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA), which is ajoint initiative ofthe World Bank, EU, IMF,DFID, France, Norway and Switzerland,
to develop a strengthened approach to public fmancial management. The PEFA approach includes a
country-led strategy on public financial management reforms, a coordinated program o f assistance by
donors and aperformance measurement framework. The EducationFor All program strategy and costing
was updated and revisedto take into account the higher than expected enrolment increase and a plan has
been submitted by Madagascar to the Fast Track Initiative inMay 2005. A Health Sector Note, currently
being finalized informs the health sector dialogue and uses new analysis from two recently completed
surveys (the Demographic and Health Survey, and the Study o f the efficiency and equity of health
facilities). The ongoing Investment Climate Assessment, the Financial Sector Assessment Program and
the landtenure review will underpinthe reforms under the growth pillar insubsequentPRSCs.

      D.     DONOR    COLLABORATIONINSUPPORTINGTHE IMPLEMENTATIONOFTHE PRSP

Cooperationwiththe MultilateralandBilateralDonors

43.       The donors are collaborating to support Madagascar inimplementing its development vision, by
providing financial `and technical support in a coordinated way. The European Union (EU), France
(Agence Frangaise de DCveloppement, and the French Co-operation) and the World Bank have initiated
joint-donor missions in October 2004 to review the implementation of the PRSP and supervise their
respective budget support operations. This i s part of the overall effort to harmonize our assistance and
reduce the transactions cost for the Government. A follow-up joint donor mission i s plannedinFall 2005
to review the h u a l PRSP Progress Report for calendar year 2004, and the draft budget for 2006. The
AfDB, EU, France and the World Bank have signed a Partnership Agreement with the Government to
provide a framework and to lay out procedures and modalities for a multi-donor approach to budgetary
support. The AfDB i s also in the process o f preparing its Country Assistance Strategy and we are
discussing the possibility of coordinating our budget support closely, starting with PRSC 3. The AfDB
will soon also have a localoffice which will greatly facilitate greater co-ordinationwith them.

44.       Inthejoint supervisionmissions, commonareasofsupport withthe EUincludethepublic sector
reform agenda, education and health with the EU's program o f budget support (Programme d'Appui
Budge`taire a la Rkduction de la Pauvretk, PARP). The public expenditure reform agenda support i s co:
ordinated to support the Government's Priority Action Plan. The Government has convened meetings
periodically with the key donors to inform them o f progress on implementation. Key reforms in public
 financial management and against corruption are bringing financing from IDA together with technical
 assistance from the EU, GTZ and the French Cooperation. Donor coordination around implementing
 customs reforms has also improved. Ineducation, the donors coordinate support around the Educationfor
 All implementation. Inhealth, the key donors are also coordinating support usinga sector-wide approach.

 45.      Inaddition, transport, water, agriculturalandenvironmentalsectorreforms andinvestment needs
 continue to be approachedtogether with other partners through sector-wide approaches. As noted above,
 the Bank i s continuing to conduct joint supervision and evaluation missions o f Madagascar's (i)  PRSP
 with all bilateral and multilateral donors present (and issuance of joint aide memoires); and (ii) HIPC
 progress together with all multilateral donors. Lastly, the Bank continues to work closely with other
 multilateral and bilateral donors and the UN family, in particular, on emergency efforts such as post-
 cyclone reconstruction projects, which are needed when natural disasters threaten the country's longer
 term poverty reduction.

 Coordinationwiththe IMF

 46.      The Bankclosely collaborates and coordinates activities with the IMFstaff. The staffs ofthe two
 institutions conduct joint assessments o f the PRSP implementation regularly. IMF and World Bank staff
 also work closely together on (i)    reforms set out at the decision point of the Highly Indebted Poor
 Countries Initiatives (HIPC); (ii)analysis and reforms in public financial management; (iii)other
 governance reforms, including customs; (iv) support of the privatization program; and (v) participation in
 the integrated framework trade project. The Bank also contributes to the IMF's regular monitoring o f the
 Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility(PRGF).

 47.      The IMF completed its Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement with
 Madagascar inFebruary 2005, presented its Article IV consultation along with their Ex-Post Assessment
 to their Board inearly June 2005, and will be beginning discussions on a newprogram shortly. The staffs


                                                     15

o f IDA and IMF will continue to coordinate the content of the PRSC and PRGF to ensure that the
instrumentscomplement one another. Ingeneral, the structural and social benchmarks will be covered by
the PRSC, while the PRGF will cover macroeconomic issues.


                          E.     DONOR    SUPPORT FOR CAPACITY BUILDING

48.     Capacity constraints can hamper Madagascar's ability to achieve its development
objectives. The donor community is supportingMadagascar in strengthening capacity, through a
range of technical assistance grants and training initiatives designed to enhance the implementationof the
PRSP. The key donors involved insupporting the strategic pillar of governance, include the World Bank,
European Union, UNDP, French Co-operation, the African Development Bank, GTZ, and USAID. A
number of donors are very active insupporting education (UNICEF, French Co-operation, AfDB, AFD,
Japan, USAID and World Bank). Donor coordination, to support capacity buildingefforts, are also being
enhanced through the round table for public expenditure management reforms, and through the proposed
Budget Support Group.


         IV. POVERTYREDUCTIONSUPPORT CREDITS PROGRAM

49.     The first Poverty ReductionSupport Credit approvedin July 2004 was the first of a series
of annual single tranche development policy lendingoperations provided as budget support for the
implementationof key elements of the PRSP. The design o f the PRSC program comprising the first
three PRSCs (see Figure 1) to support the PRSP was basedon discussions with the Government, the pace
o f the reform agenda, the existing knowledge base and analysis of development issues, other donor
programs, and IDA resources. The objective o f the first three PRSCs (2004-2006) is to consolidate
reforms underway in the public sector, fight corruption, improve transparency and accountability, and
improve service delivery in education, health, water supply and nutrition. As outlined in the PRSC 1
ProgramDocument, a set of clear, well-defined milestones, policy actions or indicators have been defined
to transitionto PRSC 2.

50.      The implementationof the program supportedunder the first operation(PRSC 1)hasbeen
satisfactory. While there have been delays, the indicative triggers for PRSC 2 are broadly on track to
being completed (see Box 2 for lessons learned from PRSC 1). Inthe area o f public finance reform, the
implementation of the 2004 Priority Action Plan was satisfactory, though there have been delays in
operationalizingthe new Procurement code and ininstallingthe integrated financial management system.
The Education for All program is being implemented steadily. The enrolment increase has exceeded
expectations, but the implementation of some key measures, such as the delays in schools getting the
school grants and partial implementation o f the planned school constructionprogram has likely impacted
on the quality o f service delivery. The institutional structure for delivering nutrition services has been
strengthened. The Government i s working on updating its national policy on health, and has prepared a
medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) for the health sector. As part o f this MTEF, they are also
costing attainingthe healthMDGs, usinga marginalbottlenecks approach.

5 1.     ExpectedResults: The policy matrix inthe PRSC 1program document outlines the sequencing
o f policy actions and institutional reform measures until 2006. The Government team has updated the
policy matrix, both to streamline it, and to extend it out one year.          Table 8 reviews progress in
Madagascar towards achieving the key development objectives, as outlined in Table 6 and Annex IX of
the PRSC 1program document.

52.     Based on the data available to date, the Government's strategy is delivering results. The
Government i s using its budget in line with its strategic priorities - roads and education command large
shares. These resources are being translated into results on the ground. More children are inschool today
than ever before (over 90 percent), and a larger percentage are likely to complete primary school. With
the implementation of the roads program in rural areas, the percentage o f rural population with reliable
access to transport has increased from 45 percent in2003 to 52 percent in2004, and the condition of the
main road network has improved too. Rice productivity has increased from 1.8 tonshectare in 2003 to
2.4 tonsihectare in 2004, achieving the target set for 2006. Access to safe drinking water in rural areas
has also improved. Immunization rates have remained stable and more women give birth in health
centers than before. Infant and child mortality rates have declined significantly between 1997 and
2003/04, with the child mortality rate declining from 163.9 to 94 per 1000 over this period.

                      Box 2: LessonsLearned-Implementationof PRSC 1
The overall implementation o f the reformprogramsupported under PRSC 1has been satisfactory, but
several lessons have been learned inthe transition to budgetary support.

What worked

         Enhanced inter-ministerial dialogue with the supervision missions fostering dialogue between
         the Ministryo f Finance and other sector ministries, but there i s still scope for improvement.
         Improved donor eo-ordination among budget support donors, with the launching o f joint
         donor missions (fiist in October 2004, and a second planned for Fall 2005). A Partnership
         Agreement betweenthe Government and budget support donors (EU, WB, France with the U S
         and IMF as participants but not signatories) which outlines the principles o f collaboration with
         the objective o f harmonizing our assistance and reducing transactions costs to the Government
         has been signed.
         Sustained co-ordination and harmonization especially in the areas o f public financial
         management, education, nutrition and health. Much o f this co-ordination was ongoing before
         the PRSC, but this was sustained and strengthened with the transition to budget support.
         Increased budgetary allocations to priority sectors (especially, education) with the transition
         to budget support in 2004. In 2005, the high allocations to education were sustained and
         health, nutrition and rural water supply received significant increases inbudgetary allocations,
         inline withthe Government's priorities.

What worked lesswell

         Unpredictableflow of funds: 2004 was a volatile and difficult economic environment. With
         the sharp depreciation o f the FMG and the cyclone needs, the expenditure needs increased,
         specially the cost o f imports. In addition, revenue collections were below expectations and
         there was a delay in donor aid flows. The main adjustment came through reduced
         expenditures, with a freeze in commitments in March 2004, reduction in expenditures mid-
         year, and a shortened expenditure cycle.        While the Government attempted to protect
         expenditures in priority sectors, the unpredictability and stop-and-go cycles likely affected
         service delivery in all sectors, and delays (e.g. in school construction, payment o f the caisse
         &cole,delivery ofnutrition services).
         Reforms took longer than anticipated: Ingeneral, the reforms took longer to accomplish than
         originally envisaged, highlighting the over-optimism o f the results, capacity constraints, a
         greater needto prioritize, andneed for timely delivery o f donor technical assistance.
         Capacity for procurement and financial management in sector ministries needs to be
         improved. Despite technical assistance to prepare the sectors to transition to budget support,
         capacity constraints remain and " f i e fighting" was needed to ensure that key programs
         remainedontrack.

Moving forward

         Better align donor disbursements with the budget cycle of the Government: The donors,
         including the EU and the WB are seeking ways to better align their budget support
         disbursementswith the Government's budget cycle, to ensure that the Government has the
         resourcesupfront to implement their development priorities.
         Continue support for public Jinancial management reforms, with particular focus on
         improvingbudgetexecution and implementation, andbetter revenue forecasting and especially
         greater attention to capacity buildinginsector ministries for budget formulation, procurement,
         and financial management.
         Greater realism in setting targets: Being more realistic about what is achievable, and
         working with the Government to prioritize its existing capacity to scale up implementation
          Greater needfor monitoring and co-ordination among the Government to monitor the reform
         program.

                  STRATEGICAXIS 1:IMPROVINGGOVERNANCE

53.      PRSC 2 will continue to support the first strategic axis of the PRSP, and consolidate reforms
initiated under PRSC 1, inpublic finance, anti-corruption and strengthening the judiciary. Assistance by
the Bank will also focus on deepening reforms in the areas o f customs, decentralization, and capacity
building. The reform program is based on strong analytical underpinnings, in particular the recently
completedPER. The Governance and InstitutionalDevelopment Project (PGDI), which became effective
inMarch2004, isprovidingtechnical assistance for the implementationofthesereforms.


                              A.    PUBLIC EXPENDITURE       MANAGEMENT

54.      The budget is the Government's main instrument for implementing its development strategy.
However, weak budget and expenditure management has been a main characteristic of the
Madagascar system for many years. The recently completed PER identified the following key issues
that continue to hamper effective budget preparation and execution:

0 Budgetary allocationsare notyetfully aligned with PRSPpriorities. The 2004 and2005 budgets are
     broadly inline with PRSP priorities - allocations for primary education increased by 39 percent and
     for primary healthcare by around 15 percent over the period 1997-2004. Public resourcesallocated to
     the transport sector increased by annually 18 percent on average over the past five years. Inline with
     government policy to withdraw from productive sectors allocations in particular for energy,
     agriculture and environment fell substantively - from 33 percent o f non-interest expenditures in 1997
     to 26 percent in2004. At the same time, the distribution o fbudgetary allocationsto sectors i s not yet
     in line with the administration's intention to "bring Government closer to the people". The central
     Government maintains control over the bulk of budgetary resources; only 3 to 4 percent o f the
     national budget i s managedby the communes.

0 Budgetpreparationfaces significant challenges. These are: (i)lackofreliable macroeconomic and
                                                                      a
     fiscal parameters guiding the preparation process; (ii) little involvement of sector ministries in the
     preparation process, (iii)no systematic mechanism to discuss budgetary disputes--inter-governmental
     consultation about the budget i s limited to budgetary conferences; and (iv) strategic discussion and
     decision-making on fiscal and budgetary policies at the Cabinet level i s limited and ad-hoc. In
     addition, the gap between revenue forecasts and revenue inflows is substantial: revenues had to be
     adjusted downwards by 22 percent in2001 and 44 percent in2002. The main problems include lack
     of a clear methodology and lack of capacity inthe relevant departments to accurately project inflows.

 0 The problem of separate recurrent and capital budgets.              Although a consolidated budget i s
     presented to Parliament, the Government i s still operating on a dual budget system with different
     procedures, timelines and institutional responsibilities for recurrent and investment expenditures.
     This dual budget system reinforces the inconsistencies betweeninvestment and (non-salary) recurrent
     expenditures.

 0 Budget execution rates need to be closely monitored. Budget execution rates have deteriorated since
     the end o f the 1990s from 96 percent in 1998 to 75 percent in2001, mainly because of weak revenue
     collection and budget implementation problems. Estimates for the 2003 budget execution show a 92
     percent execution rate, which would indicate that Government's efforts to streamline the execution
     process have begunto bear fruit. HIPC funds (representing 6 percent o f the Government's budget in
     2003) which were executed based on simplifiedprocedures reached an execution rate of 99 percent.



                                                     23

     Budget execution problems, notably of capital expenditures, are mainly causedby cumbersome and
     complex disbursement procedures.

     Budget execution is hampered by administrative bottlenecks.             As processing payments in
     Madagascar is complex with around 11 different stages that each requires a formal approval,
     "simplified procedures" to release funds are frequently applied. These procedures should, however,
     be reserved for exceptional cases. In addition, shortcomings in the procurement and control system
     increase the administration's transaction costs.

    A flawed system ofJinanciaf monitoring. Key information is not available, in particular execution
     data on investment projects financed by donors. Since 2000 the social sectors (education and health)
    have produced regular budget execution reports. In 2003, additional reports were prepared by the
    ministries o f agriculture, justice, water and forest, and public works to fulfill a Government
     commitment inthe HIPC context. There i s no systematic reconciliation processbetween the Treasury
     and the Central Bank. As a result of these deficiencies, the Treasury faces difficulties in closing the
     annual accounts within the statutory timeframe and the Auditor General i s not able to validate these
     accounts as required by the law. Over the past two years, the treasury accounting system was
     strengthened to improve the closing o f Government accounts in a timely manner. As a result the final
    accounts for the years 1997 to 2000 and 2002 have been sent for review to the Auditor General. The
     accounts for the years 2001and 2003 are expected to be submittedin2005.

     The need to transform the budget into a management instrument. The budget is not yet seen as a
    reliable planning instrument because actual releases typically vary substantially from the allocated
     amount. As a consequence, the budget is not used as a management instrument that guides the
     implementation of policies and programs. There is also no effective monitoring and evaluation
    mechanism inplace that systematically tracks implementation o f Govemment policies and programs.

ReformProgram

55.      The Governmenthas prepareda Priority Action Plan for public finance reforms for 2005
which incorporates some key recommendations of the PER. This sustains the Government's
operationalization of its public expenditure reform program, in the priority action plan for 2004, which
was developed in conjunction with all key donors and validated in early 2004. Since the medium term
reform program i s wide in scope, the priority action plan i s an important step towards prioritizing and
sequencing public finance reforms. The plan builds on the findings and recommendations o f previous
analytical work and i s closely linked to the annual business plan o f the Ministry o f Finance which was
first developed in 2003. In 2004, the donors and the Government also set up a round table to jointly
monitor the implementation o f the reforms as well as to discuss problems, solutions and necessary
technical assistance. For the World Bank, as noted above, this technical assistance i s provided through
the PGDI, whose main focus i s to strengthen the existing system of public finance inMadagascar.

56.      To better benchmark the implementation of the public finance reform program, an
extended set of indicators, developed by the Joint Secretariaton Public ExpenditureManagement
and FinancialAccountability(PEFA-Secretariat), was introducedin early 2005. Madagascar is one
of the pilot countries for the introduction o f these indicators which ultimately aim at harmonizing public
finance reform indicators used by multilateral and bilateral development partners. The Government has
made a self-assessment on the basis o f these indicators. It i s anticipated that the Govemment will fully
apply these indicators inthe year 2006.




                                                      24

57.      The PRSC process is supporting the Government public reform program ina sequencedway, all
o f which are key steps inthe implementation o f the priority action plan. The realization under PRSC 2,
which builds on the reforms started under PRSC 1include:


(i)     Co-ordination of the Reform Program

a    The Government implementedsatisfactorily the priority actionplan for 2004 (see Table 9).
e    The Government developed a priority actionplan for 2005 to sustain the reforms started in2004.
e    The co-ordination committee (Cellule de Suivi et de Coordination des Rdformes des Finances
     Publiques) established in the Ministry o f Finance to co-ordinate, monitor and evaluate reforms i s
     operational.
(ii)     EnhancingBudget Formuiation

     The 2005 Loi des Finances allocates a higher share of resources to key PRSP priorities
     (education, health, nutrition, transport, rural water supply), but there are reductions in the
     allocations to justice. In the Loi des Finances 2005, the allocations to the Ministry of Education
     increased from 18.3 percent of the budget in 2004 to 20.9 percent in 2005; for Ministry o f Health
     from 6.3 to 7.8 percent and for the transport sector from 13.3 to 22.1 percent.
     A new calendar for the budget preparation for the year 2005 was introduced, which advanced
     the timetable for the preparation of the budget. The objective is to strengthen the involvement of
     the sector ministries inthe budgetpreparationprocess.
     Program budgets were introducedfor all ministries with the budget year 2005, a year ahead of
     schedule. The sector ministries were required to align budgetary allocations with policy objectives.
     These budgets were prepared for a three year period to ensure a medium-term perspective o f
     budgetary allocations. The new system intends to improve the presentation of the budget and its
     alignment with policy priorities of the government as specified in the PRSP. The introduction of
     program budgets posed a significant challenge for the administration - the finalization of the budget
     document was delayed because of difficulties in implementing the new system. Experience from
     other countries indicates that these reforms will take time to yield the intendedresults; they should be
     complemented by a systematic program o f training and capacity buildingwhich aims at establishing
     or enhancing relevant capacities inline ministries.
     The reform agenda ahead includes further improvement in the allocations to priority sectors,
     and enhancingstrategic decision-making during the budget formulation process.Inline withthe
     recommendations of the PER, the Government i s considering (i)        introducing a Budget Framework
     Paper, which outlines - early in the budget preparation process - the macroeconomic framework
     under which the budget is being developed; (ii)       enhancing the role o f Cabinet by systematically
     ensuring strategic decision-making at the different stages o f the budget preparation process, (iii)
     strengthening the participation of line ministries based on an effective planning and consultation
     process, and (iv) refocusingbudgetary conferences onpolicy objectives, prioritization of needswithin
     the hardbudget constraints andresults achieved onthe bases ofresources allocated. To accommodate
     these changes, further adjustments to the calendar for the preparation of the annual budget are under
     review.

(iii)    Strengtheningbudget execution

0    The Treasury is implementing the recommendations of an independent audit which was
     conducted in 2003.       In 2004/2005 treasury accounts were updated and the final accounts
     (Comptes des gestions) for the year 2000 and 2002 have been submitted to the Auditor General. The
     accounts for 2003 will be submitted by June 2005, and for 2001 in December 2005. Significant

     The development of an integrated financial management system, which will encompass a budget

    management operations at the deconcentrated levels o f Government. As the implementation of the
    integratedfinancial managementsystemwill take several years, the Government has decided to put in
    place, with World Bank support, an interim core accounting system which was developed in the
    provincial treasury of Tamatave. The systemis fully operational inTamatave, and will be operational
    inthe maintreasury office inAntananarivo, and four additional treasuries (Mahajanga, Antsiranana,
    Toliara, Fianarantsoa) by August 2005. The installation has been delayed due to problems with the
    equipment. This interimsystem covers 80 percent of the treasury operations. The Treasury has also
    improved its internal control system by strengthening the operational efficiency of the Brigade de
    Trtsor.
0   Implementationrules and regulations and standard bidding documents (SBDs) are presently
    being prepared for the new Procurement Code adopted by Parliament in 2004. Most of the
    implementation documents and SBDs, and are expected to be completed by June 2005, but the
    process o f validation and adoption will take place after that. The new Procurement law, which i s line
    with international best practice, incorporates the findings and recommendations of the CPAR of the
    year 2003. There has been a delay with the preparationo f the implementation decrees and standard
    bidding documents mainly due to difficulties in finding a suitable consultant. The work on the
    institutional framework for the new procurement code has commenced and the decree establishing the
    new procurement oversight institution was issued inearly May 2005. Inview of the implementation
    delays the new procurement code is likely to be fully applied only towards early 2006 after the
    training for the ministerial staff i s completed inapplyingthe new code andaccompanying regulations.
    Inthe teams view, despitethe delay, the reformis well ontrack to beingcompleted, andwe propose
    to follow this in PRSC 3 with a trigger that the Procurement reform i s fully operational. With the
     fully functional procurement framework, we expect atransparent procurement systemwhich includes
    inter alia, that the oversight mechanism i s able to measurethe performance of the national system and
    the performance o f implementing agencies inaccordance with the new code, the appeal mechanism i s
     operational andbidderscomplaints are fairly andprofessional treated ina timely manner.
0    To improve debt management the Central Bank i s presently implementing a modem debt
    management system which shouldbe operational inthe secondhalfof 2005.


(iv) Strengthening Accountability
     Progress with regard to the improvement o f the intemal and external control functions has been
     mixed:

0    A General Inspectorate for Finances (IGF) was established in 2004, as the principal controller of the
     Ministry of Finance, in line with the recommendations of the CFAA. Difficulties in recruiting
     adequate personnel have, however, delayed the commencement of the work of the IGF. But the
     internal control function has been ensured by the Inspection Gtntrale de 1'Etat (IGE) during this
     transition period. The internal control cadre of the treasury (Brigade du Trtsor) was strengthened by
     recruiting additional staff and modernizing its operations. The Government i s in the process o f
     makingthe IGF fully operational.
0    The oversight function of Parliament has been further strengthened through capacity building and
     training o f the Public Finance Committee.
0    The Auditor General has cleared the backlog o f accounts and prepared draft budget execution laws
     ("projet de loi de r2glement") for the years 1998 until 2001. The 1998 law has been examined by
     Parliament, and 1999 will be submitted to Parliamentshortly. For those from 2000 onwards, the final
     production was delayed due to difficulties inestablishing the overall balance, as requiredby law. The
     decree and supporting balances were prepared inmid-May 2005, which has enabled the production of
     theprojet de loi de r2glement for 2000 and 2001. The "catching up" meant that the laws for 2002 and
     2003 have been delayed. It i s presently envisaged to finalize the examination o f the draft budget
     execution laws for 2002 and 2003 by December 2005.

(v)   ResultsFocus: Introduction of basicperformance management under way,

0   The Government hasintroduceda results matrix for all ministries and departmentsin2005 (la
   Politique Gdnkrale de 1`Etatpour 2005") to monitor the implementation o f policies and programs.
    This builds on the results orientationthat the Government introduced in2003, with businessplans for
    all line ministries which outline the work program for the respective year. Many business plans,
    however, lack realismand detailed costing; they also do not feed into the programbudgets, which are
    prepared in a separate exercise. The results matrix for 2005 will be tracked on a regular basis, and
    implementation progress and bottlenecks will be discussed at the Cabinet level. As a next step, the
    Government intents to integrate the different activities into a coherent results-based management
    framework. Under such a systempolicy-related information is systematically collectedat all levels of
    Government, consolidated by a well-functioning mechanism at the centre of Government and
    scrutinizedfor potential follow-up. The system shouldgenerate regularreports about the status of the
    implementation of the Government program, which should be sent to Cabinet for discussion and
    strategic decision-making.

58.      The indicative triggers for the PRSC 2 for public expenditure management include the
satisfactory implementationof the priority action plan for 2004. The overall implementationof the
priority action plan is considered satisfactory as the majority of the intended reforms are well
under way. The implementationstatus of the triggers for PRSC 2 are as follows:

0   Budget for 2005 allocates greater shareofresourcesto PRSPpriority sectors relative to 2004, with
    adequate fundingallocated to key priorities (such as education, health, nutrition) -this action has

                                      B.    FIGHTINGCORRUPTION

61.     There has been steady progress in the fight against corruption. In the Transparency
International Corruption Perception Index o f 2004 Madagascar was ranked 82nd out of 145 countries




                                                     29

(after no. 88 out o f 133 in2003 and no. 98 out o f 102 in2002). The new WBI governance indicators6for
2004 confirm that Madagascar i s well above Sub-Saharan African average in all examined areas, in
particular the control of corruption, regulatory quality as well as voice and accountability.                 The
Government was elected on an anti-corruption platform, and has made it the cornerstone o f its PRSP.
The Government sees corruption as one of the main sources for the lack of progress in the socio-
economic development o fthe country. The key issues include:

    e    Pervasive corruption in a number of sectors (i.e. mining, judiciary) and public services (i.e.
         customs, medical services, traffic police), which severely affects overall efficiency and delivery
         o f services.
    e    The lack o f ethical standards in the public services with widespread non-application of formal
         rules and regulations by public servants.
    e    Informalandor corrupt behaviorremains by-and-large unpunished.

ReformAgenda

62.      Reforms started under PRSC 1 have been deepened and extended, with important
improvements in the regulatory framework for the fight against corruption. The Anti-Corruption
Commission (Conseil Supirieur de Lutte Contre la Corruption, CSLCQ, which was established in2002,
to raise awareness about corruption, and co-ordinate all governance and anti-corruption efforts prepared a
new general "anti-corruption law" which becameeffective inSeptember 2004. This law aims to improve
investigation and prosecution of corruption cases as well as to establish the institutional framework for
the fight against corruption. Based on the new law the government has adopted several implementation
decrees since July 2004 including: (i)        a new regulation for the declaration of assets which intends to
improve the compliance rate of public and elected officials based on the experience with the initial decree
of the year 20027 and (ii)the decree to establish the independent Anti-Comption Agency (with
investigative authority), which will operationalize the Government's anti-corruption strategy. Inaddition
the government passed "anti money laundering" legislation. A new law regulating political parties and
their financing has been submitted to Parliament. Other decrees that will be prepared in 2005/2006
include (i)a decree to regulate recruitment into the public sector', and (ii)an application decree
specifying the rules andregulations concerning conflict-of-interest issues.

63,       The key instrumentto fight corruption,the independent Anti-Corruption Agency (Bureau
          IndCpendant Anti-Corruption, BIANCO) became operational in October 2004. Since its
          inception BIANCO has focused on three areas (i) examination o f corruption complaints (the
                                                                   the
          office has received over 850 complaints, the majority o f which deal with land titling and the
         judiciary), (ii) prevention, inparticular training and sensitization of public servants o f the police,
          customs and land titling services. Inthis context, BIANCO has also provided support to manage
          several recruitment processes into the public sector; and (iii)     further investigation. This includes
          the preparation of independent audits o f public services (the audit of the land titling service is
          under way; a draft audit report has been submitted and is awaiting validation). Two additional
          audits are planned for 2005/2006 - an audit o f customs and a review o f the mining sector. In
          addition, independent procurement reviews are planned for the "education for all program" and o f
          investment programs inthe transport sector.


'The
 Govemance Research Indicators 1996-2004
      experiences with the new decree are encouraging: inMay 2005, about 60 percent o f the public and elected
officials required (intotal 4,328 individuals) have submitted their declaration o fassets. BIANCO is presently
considering various options to fiuther increase compliance.
'Theexisting   recruitment process is a source of significant Corruption. To address this problem, BIANCO has been
providing advisory support to recruitment process in2004/2005.

         Moving ahead, in 2005/2006, the governmentintendsto introducethe concept of labelingof

well as to conduct a baseline survey to assess the prevalence of corruption in the public and the private
sectors.

Expectedresults

65.      Themainresults at the endofPRSC 3, andtheir current status, include:
     0   Adopt sectoral anti-corruption strategiesand beginimplementation- this activity is under way: a
         general anti-corruption strategy hasbeen validated which includes the establishment o f an
         independent anti-corruptionagency (BIANCO). Sectoral strategy will complement these
         activities.
     0   The regulatory framework for the fight against corruption improved-this activity i s underway;
         a new anti-corruption and money launderinglegislationhas already beenpassed;next steps
         includeregulations concerning conflict-of-interest andpublic recruitment
     0   Independent audits and evaluations have been commissioned to address corruption intargeted
         sectors/public services-this activity is under way.
     0   An anti-corruption survey confirms areduction ofcorruption inMadagascar -this activityis
         plannedfor 2005/2006.


                                               C.     JUSTICE

66.      Beginninginthe mid-90sYMadagascar launched a vast legal andjudicial reformprogram which
included the consolidation and publication o f existing laws, review and modernization of its business
laws, training of judges and court personnel, review o f judicial procedures and review of the work
environment o fjudges. Among the most noteworthy achievements o f the program are the establishment
o f the Ecole Nationale de la Magistrature (ENMG) and the new generation o fjudges and court personnel
that it has produced, publication o f a complete set o f business laws which had previously been largely
inaccessible, preparation and adoption of several key pieces o f business laws and completion of a
comprehensive study o fthejudicial process.

67.      The Government has made judicial reform an important element of its overall governance
strategy. The main issues to be addressedinclude:

         Lack of credibility of the judiciary The credibility o f the judiciary has been seriously
         underminedby widespread corruption and inefficiencies. Thejudiciary is one of the main targets
         o f the newly created Anti-Corruption Commission. The new Government also put under
         investigation anumber o f magistrates becauseof corruption charges.

         Low performance of the judiciary: This is due to procedural and institutional inefficiencies as
         well as lack of performance orientation of the existing staff. This problem affects all areas of the
         judiciary and has lead to a significant backlog of cases, inparticular at the lower courts. A key
         reason i s the lack of service standards and evaluation methods to examine judicial work. Inmany
         areas the case load handled by magistrates and other personnel is not in line with international
         standards. Inareas that require specialization such as commercial proceedings not enough trained
         magistrates are available to deal with existing cases.




                                                      31

Reform Program

68.     As noted inthe PRSC 1document, the Government has identifiedfive broadpriority areas which
form the basis for its reform strategy: (i)  fight against corruption, (ii)
                                                                          expedition of proceedings, (iii)
reform of business laws, (iv) rehabilitation of court and prison infrastructure, and (v) humanization of
detention facilities. The reforms intend to further deepen previous reforms and to consolidate the
achievements, in particular in the areas of training, capacity building and codification of texts and
regulations. The needs of the private sector are a major consideration in the legal and judicial reform
strategy.

69.     The implementation of this strategy is severely hampered by budgetary constraints; the
year 2005 has seen a net reduction of the (already low) recurrent budget of the Ministry of Justice
whichraises concerns about feasibility and sustainability of the government strategy.

70.     PRSC 1 supported the development of the reform strategy which would form the basis for
the implementation of the reform program. The implementation of this strategy has seen mixed
results in 2004/2005. To improve efficiency of the judiciary and simplify judicial proceedings, the
Ministry of Justice prepared new legislation, in particular a law regulating the affairs of commercial
enterprises (loi sur les sociktks commerciales), including an implementation decree, and a law
rationalizing the procedures o f the civil courts (loi sur les prockdures collectives).        To address
deficiencies at the level of the commercial sections o f the courts a number o f magistrates were trained in
commercial proceedings.       The Ministry has also established "model courts" in Antananarivo and
Ambatolampy which would serve as a reference for the reform o f other jurisdictions. To reduce the
existing backlog o f cases (22,000 inAntananarivo alone) the government recruited a task-force; the work
of this group has reduced the number of open cases to almost zero in Antananarivo. The government
programto reduce the backlog o f cases will be extended to other jurisdictions inthe country.

71.     The introduction of service standards, however, which is seen as a key instrument to
improve individual performance and the performance of the jurisdiction has made little progress.
At present, only for the lower courts service standards have been proposed and are awaiting validation.
Standards for the higher courts are still outstanding. Key problems include resistance in the judiciary as
well as lack o f reliable statistical data which could serve as the basis to systematically monitor and
evaluate performance. In addition, the internal control of the Ministry o f Justice remains weak and
fragmented. Further technical assistance will assist the Government to improve the statistical service as
well as the efficiency o fthe internal controlcadre. Another area of concern is the fight against corruption
in the judiciary: while the disciplinary commission in the Ministry of Justice has begun to address
corruption complaints and the Ministry of Justice has asked for support of the Anti-Corruption Agency,
BIANCO, corruption remains a key problem in the judiciary. To address this problem the Government
intends to improve operational efficiency of the disciplinary commission as well as to strengthen self-
regulation mechanisms inthe different brancheso fthejudiciary.


Expected Results:

72. The expectedresults at the end o f PRSC 3 and their current status include the following:

0    Backlogof pendingcourt decisions reduced-this activity i s inprogress. The year 2004/5 has seen
     a net reductionof the backlogof cases of about 22.000 inthe capital. The programwill be
     expanded in2005/2006 to other lower courts.

                                               D.    CUSTOMS

73.      Despite some progress in 2004/2005 customs reforms i s lagging behind expectations. Key
problems include revenue generation significantly below projections as well as the perception that
corruption has not yet been effectively addressed. In addition, service standards (i.e. time for the
clearance o f shipments) are not systematically enforced. The poorly functioning customs service raises
transactions costs and is a constraint for the functioning of the private sector.

ReformProgram

74.      There has been some progress in the functioning of customs since July 2004. Customs
reforms are geared towards speeding up the clearance process, combat corruption and improve revenue
collection.    The Government has repeatedly stated its commitment to enhance the performance of
customs. An ambitious reformprogramto restructure customs services was developed inApril 2003. Its
objective i s to build capacity (modernization, computerization, training and accountability) for the
customs administration to fulfill its role as a transparent revenue collector and facilitator of trade. A
contract was signed with a private service provider to enhance the system of pre-shipment inspections. It
i s envisaged that over the next three years, inspection rates will decrease from 100 percent to 10 percent,
with inspections focused on highrisk imports. A platform for a systematic dialogue with the private
sector was established which serves as the basis to discuss reformprogress.

75.       Since July 2004, the following reforms have been undertaken. The tariff system was
simplifiedwith the merger of the customs and import duty inthe 2005 Loi des Finances. The customs
regulations were modernized, including the elimination o f the customs duties credit (crkdit de droit);
institutingmandatory payments o f the customs duties through the banking system since April 2005; and
abolishing the immunityof customs agents from enquiries and prosecution. The customs administration is
also expanding the coverage of its automated data processing system (SYDONIA) to improve operational
efficiency.   The new system has been installed in the main customs office in Tamatave in 2005. To
accelerate customs clearance process a `one stop' customs service (guichet unique) was established in
Mahajangaand Diego Suarez; two additional `guichets' will be established inAntananarivo and Tulear in
2005.    According to statistics produced by the customs service the time for customs clearance of
containers has been reduced from an average o f 10 days in 2002 to about 48 hours in 2004 in the main
customs office in Tamatave. To address corruption more effectively the customs directorate is worlung
closely with the Anti-Corruption Agency BIANCO with activities focusing primarily on training,
sensitization as well as the application o f administrative sanctions (Le. regular rotation of customs agents,
in2004/2005, 430 agents). These measures have ledto a notableincrease of satisfaction among private
sector operators.

76.       At the same time, revenuegenerationby the customs directorateremainsfragile. Inthe first
quarter o f the year 2005 customs was able to generate only 65 percent of the revenues projected in the
budget 2005 - main reasons include a lower than expected inflow of merchandise but also continuing



                                                      33

governance problems inthe customs directorate. To address existing problems the Government intends to
further streamline customs operations as well as to intensify the collaboration with the pre-shipment agent
and the port authorities.

77.      Another key issue has been the lack of a coherent vision for customs reforms, in particular the
implication of the private sector in customs operations. To address the Govemment has produced, with
assistancefrom the World Customs Union, a reform strategy and action plan designed to improve revenue
generation, introduce service standards and reduce corruption. The Government i s also considering
introducing `Tradenet' to improve revenue generation; a feasibility study will be launched in2005.

78.      The trigger under PRSC 2 for customs i s the adoption o f a time-bound action plan for the year
2005 and to begin implementation. This trigger was completed inJune 2005 with the formal adoption
of the actionplan. As mentionedabove, implementationofthe reforms hasbeen under way.

79.      The indicative trigger for PRSC 3 is the satisfactory implementation of the customs action
plan.


                                        E.    DECENTRALIZATION

80.      In2004, the Governmentputinplace the new regions which have become (together with the
communes) the second operational level below the central government. The main functions of the
regions are to facilitate commune development and to represent the central government. The new legal
framework for the regions also stipulates that the deconcentrated services of the central government report
to the regional chiefs. These chiefs were selected on a competitive basis and nominatedby the President.
As a first step the regions were required to prepare Regional Development Plans: these plans were
validated for the majority o f the regions by the relevant stakeholders in early 2005. A training plan for
the regional chiefs and their staff has been developed which focuses on development planning, public
financial management and monitoring and evaluation. A first training seminar was organized in April
2005.

81.      Public finances in Madagascar are heavily centralized with about 95% of revenues and
expenditures managedby central authorities. Financial capacities at the communal and regional levels are
constrained by insufficient and poorly targeted transfers and a regulatory framework that leaves the
collection of most local revenues in the hands o f inefficient deconcentrated state agents. Budgetary
allocations to the communes inthe 2005 budget have remainedat the 2004 level which i s not inline with
the Govemment commitment to increase resources allocated and managed by the communes.
Government reforms are under way to strengthen revenue collection as the communal levels. It is also
envisaged to intensify the collaboration between specific sectors (Le. health, education), the regions and
the communes inview of increasingcommunal service delivery.

82.      Under the PRSC reform program, the Government i s proposing to address these shortcoming
through three major interventions: (i)  reforming the transfer system and formula and scaling up of pilot
experiences with decentralized tax collection; (ii) establishing a local development f h d that will provide
block-grants to communes for local investments and capacity building; (iii)reinforcing communal
capacities and create synergies between communes by supporting the creation o f inter-communal
associations and regional training and resource centers. Future PRSCs will continue to support and
deepenour dialogue inthis area.

83.      The indicative trigger for PRSC 3 is the increase of resource allocations for the communes.




                                                     34

ExpectedResults:

84.     The expected results at the end PRSC 3 include the following:


    0   Resource allocations to the communes have increased - this activity has not been
        accomplished.
    0   Review the system o f fiscal transfers to communes - this activity has been partially
        accomplished: a proposal for the adjustment o f the transfer (ESW) was prepared by the World
        Bank in2003/2004 and validated by the Government but is awaiting implementation
    0   A local development fundhasbeen set upto provide investment and capacity buildingsupport to
        the national level - this activity is in process; a baseline study for the establishment of the fund
        which outlines different design options was prepared in May 2005; discussions about these
        options are ongoing.


                                 F.     TRAININGAND CAPACITY BUILDING

85.     The implementationof the governance reform programwill require substantialinvestments
in training and capacity building, in particular in the areas of public financial management, planning,
change management and monitoring and evaluation.             In collaboration with the World Bank, the
Government i s implementing an innovative capacity building and change management strategy that
consists of the following elements:

a Cabinet retreats focus on better defining the overall vision and implementation strategy. In
    2004, the first retreat took place with participants from all over the world who commented on the
    Government strategy, as well as shared experiences and best practice. The results fi-om these events
    were used to refine the Government program. The second retreat focused on improving service
    delivery. A thirdretreat, heldinMay 2005, was designed to foster cross-sectoral collaboration within
    the government ministries, and included a focus on using a rapid results initiative to improve
    implementation (see below). The rice crisis motivated a focus on the entire rice chain, and included
    internationalbest practice onprice stabilization mechanisms.

a Leadership training for the senior management level within government is aimed at
    strengthening consistency and cohesion of the core government leadership team (President,
    Prime Minister, Vice Prime Minister, Ministers and Permanent Secretaries) as well as to strengthen
    their ability to manage and direct rapid change. A series of workshops in Madagascar and Canada
    were organized to improve the effectiveness of the Government team and to share experience.
    Additional training i s programmed for 2005 to assist senior government officials in implementing
    complex changes. This program will be directed by a change management expert from Harvard
    University. Complementary leadership training will enhancethe capacity ofthe Regonal Chiefs.

a Additional capacitybuilding activitieswilltarget the middlemanagementinthe public sectorto
    improve overall performance orientation and the link between political decision making and

    developed by the Presidency (`Politique Gdndralede I'Etat 7.
    administrative implementation. The basis for the training will be the new results framework


a To improve cross-sectoral collaborationand the focus on tangible resultsthe Government has
    decided to build on the experiences with "rapid results" in other countries. A first exercise,
    launched in early 2005, is focusing on the production, importation and distribution of rice. Cross-
    sectoral teams have been created who worked out `rapid results action plans' which were presented to



                                                     35

   Cabinet. The team are supported by international experts for the `rapid results' methodology. It is
   envisaged to use this approach also inother areas.

   To better institutionalizethe comprehensive changes in the area of public finance the Ministry
   of Economy, Finance and Budget (MEFB) has set up a task force that organizes professional
   training for the public finance personnel at the central and deconcentrated levels of
   Government. The training will primarily focus on the big spending ministries (education, transport,
   health) and will comprise planning and execution o f expenditures as well as monitoring and
   evaluation. First training sessions have been conducted for the Ministries o f education and health. It
   i s anticipated to further deepen public financial management capacity over the course of the year
   2005.

   In parallel the Government is strengthening quality and effectiveness of local training
   institutions,in particular in high priority areas such as development planning, publicfinancial
   management and monitoring and evaluation. The two professional training institutions for the
   public sector (Centre National de Formation Administrative, CNFA, and Ecole Nationale de
   1'Administration Malgache, ENAM) have received substantive support to modernize their curricula
   and equipment as well as to improve quality and quantity o f their trainers.

ExpectedResults:

86.     The expected results at the end of PRSC 3 include the following:

    0   Effectiveness of the Govemment leadership team enhanced; consistency between political
        decision malung and administrativeimplementationimproved-this activityhasbeenpartially
        achieved; additional activities are plannedfor 2005 and 2006.
    0   Capacity incritical areas incore government services strengthened -training and capacity
        building inthe areas of public financialmanagement, developmentplanning, change
        managementand monitoring and evaluationis ongoing.
    0   Capacity and quality of local training institutions improved-this activity is ongoing; it i s
        anticipatedthat capacityand quality ofENAMand CNFA will be significantly
        strengthenedby the endof 2005.


                   STRATEGICAXIS 2: BROADBASEDGROWTH

87.     The Bank's support for the second strategic axis of the PRSP on broad-based growth includes a
significant portfolio o f investment lending, and policy dialogue. But the first three PRSCs do not include
any specific policy actions as triggers. The engagement in these areas will be deepened under hture
PRSCs, starting with PRSC 4, and implementation of these reforms continues to also be supported
through investment lending operations. As noted inthe PRSC 1Program Document, the Bank's support
for the growth pillar i s also provided through our significant investment lending operations in private
sector development; transport, rural development and environment (see Table 7).

                                A.     PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

88.     The PRSP emphasizes the importance of creating an investment climate that is conducive
for private-sector led growth, and some steps have been taken in 2004 to improve the investment
climate, to implementpublic-private partnerships (PPP), and to improve co-ordination of policies and to
give voice to the private sector and civil society, more broadly. GUIDE, the one-stop shop for enterprise
creation, has continued to perform well and facilitates setting up enterprises, with the time neededto set
up an enterprise reduced to just 3 days in 2004. As noted before, the reform o f public enterprises has


                                                     36

advanced since July 2004 with the privatization o f the cotton company, and management contracts for
operating the energy and sugar companies.

89.     Reformsinthe energy sector have advancedin2004, but muchremainsto be done, and the
energy situation is critical. As noted before, the energy company JIRAMA, has been put under
management contract since February 2004. The energy sector strategy was prepared in late 2004 and
aims at liberalizing the sector by enhancing competition in the medium term through the breakdown of
electricity provision (production, transport and distribution) andregulation of activities. The Government
has set up a supervisory and regulatory agency L 'Ofice de Rdgulation de Electricitd (ORE) to regulate
and monitor activities inthe energy sector. The Fonds National de 1'Electricitd (FNE), set up to support
rural electrification by providing subsidies to rural electrification providers, is also operational. The
Agence pour le Ddveloppement de 1'Electr$cation Rurale (ADER) has been created to promote service
provision, including rural electrification by the private sector, supervise and finance rural electrification
through the FNE, and monitor the environmental impact o f projects. About 150 rural electrification
plants are expected to be completed on an annual basis.

90.      There has also been some progress in improving prospects for the key export-oriented
driving sectors for growth. The tourism sector, which has grown strongly in2004, will benefit from an
investment from a French company ACCOR which will invest in several hotels in Madagascar. The
development o f the rkservesfoncidres touristiques, clusters where investment in ecotourism and resorts,
i s expected to start in 2005. The shrimp sector which i s an important earner of foreign exchange, has
introduced a certification systeminDecember 2004 for Madagascar shrimp certifying that it follows good
environmentalpractices.

91.      The Bank is conducting an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) and Financial Sector
Assessment (FSAP) in FY05 which will further help in formulating and refining the strategy in these
areas to underpin future reforms.

                                             B.    TRANSPORT

92.      The transport sector, and in particular, the roads program plays a key role in
Madagascar'sgrowth and povertyalleviationstrategy. As notedbefore, remotenessis associatedwith
poverty, and improving access is critical for many aspects - enhancing productivity in rural areas,
improving access to social services and expanded access to markets. Three decades of inappropriate
sector policies have led to serious deterioration o f the country's transport infrastructure. It is estimated
that from 1970 onwards the country lost on average 1,000 kilometers o f roads per year due to lack o f
maintenance, or the loss and deterioration of over 80 percent o f the network over the last 30 years. In
April 2000, after almost ten years of sector dialogue and very little lending, the country adopted a
comprehensive transport sector policy which aims at (i)focusing the Government's role on strategic
planning, sector oversight and coordination; (ii)creating agencies for sub-sector management and
regulatory functions that are jointly controlled by the public and private sectors and gradually user-
financed; (iii)divesting operational activities to the private sector, through privatization and
concessioning arrangements; (iv) developing the local private sector for works design and execution; and
(v) rehabilitatingtransport infrastructure to appropriate levels and ensuring their maintenance thereafter.

Reform Program

93.      After the 2002 crisis, the Government launched an ambitious road rehabilitation and
maintenance program (2003          - 2008)    with the objective to rehabilitate or provide periodic
maintenancefor approximately2,000 kmper year. Since 2003, nearly 2000 kmo fnational roads have
been improved increasing the percentage of the national road network in fair and good condition from 49
percent in 2003 to 61 percent in 2004. For rural roads, the least cost design, such as spot improvements
for basic access, was not systematically applied to rehabilitate roads with low traffic, leading to


                                                       37

significantly higher costs per km, and reducing by one-third the length of rural roads that could be
improved. Hence, only 900 kmhave been rehabilitated in 2004. To rationalize the management of the
rural roads, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MTPT) is developing a technical design
approach for rural road improvements according to the specific levels of service needed for each type of
rural road. In 2004, the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) contracted for the maintenance of 7,300 km,
which utilized 70 percent of the funding. Ofthe remaining 30 percent, 20 percent was allocated to routine
maintenance ofrural roads and 10percent to emergency works.

94.      There hasbeendelay in settingup the autonomoussub-sector agencies. The Maritime, Ports
and River Agency (APMF)has been operational since October 2004 and its boardhas been able to install
a measure o f independency. The appointment o f the agency's key personnel, however, i s still incomplete.
The Civil Aviation Agency (ACM), which has been operational since 2000, has been restructured based
on an organizational audit, to be more efficient and to enhance the capacity of the technical personnel.
Laws creating the Roads Authority (AR) and the Land Transport Agency (ATT) were voted by the
Parliament inDecember 2004. A workshop involving the main stakeholders was held inFebruary 2005
to review the progress made inthese institutionalreforms and it i s expected that ATT will be operational
by end of 2005 and AR by mid-2006. Inthe meantime, since 2003, a National Roads Databasehas been
developed which stores information on all aspects of the main road network as well as a computerized
system for monitoringprojects undertakenby the Ministry. A draft transport statistical yearbook was also
producedin2004.

95.     In March 2005, the Vice Primature Office in charge of Economic Programs, Ministry of
Transport, Public Works, and Regional Planning was dissolved, and two separate ministries were
created: the Ministry o f Public Works and Transport and the Ministry of Decentralization and Regional
Planning. This reorganization seems appropriate and i s likely to provide a better focus for policy and
planning. There i s concern, however, that this development and the associated personnel changes will
bringfurther delays to the institutionalreforms that were initiatedin2000.

96.      The Government is using public-private partnerships for managing the transport
infrastructure. As noted before, Air Madagascar is operating under a management contract and
Northern Railway as a concession. The concessioning o f Southern Railways i s ongoing, and is expected
by end-2005. The main port of Toamasina, which handles more that 80 percent o f the total traffic, has
been restructured its container terminal i s beingconcessioned, with the helpof the IFC and it i s expected
that the concession will be inplace inJuly 2005. The Government i s also planningto concession 12 main
airports.

                             c. RURALDEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT AND

 97.      Rural development and environment are critical elements of the Government's strategy to
 fight poverty, since over four in five poor people live in rural areas. Agricultural productivity is low
 andnaturalresource degradation is widespread.

 98.      The main elements of the Government's rural development sector strategy reform agenda
 adopted under the Rural Development Policy letter recognizes the need for approaches to provide
 integrated solutions to multiple problems simultaneously (e.g. through growth poles, value chains etc).
 The strategy aims to address four mainchallenges:
 (i) improvingfood securityandfood production,inparticularriceproductivitythroughimproved
          applied research to produce locally produced high yielding rice varieties; scaling up communal
          village granaries to facilitate access to working capital; appropriate management of rice import
          tariffs and taxes to balance producer and consumer interests
 (ii)     sustainable intensijkation and diversifzcation of agricultural production through rural roads,
          agricultural technology, landpropertyrightsandwater management
 (iii)    improving the value-added of natural resources as providers of extractive products and
          environmental services through puttinginplace a comprehensive forest zoning plan, establishing
          a transparent, competitive system for the allocation o f long-term concessions to technically
          qualified companies; extending the current ban on the provision of logging permits untilthe new
          licensing system i s operational; improving governance in the forest sector by simplifylng the
          framework o f exploitation and taxation, strengthening o f the field presence of the Water and
          Forests Department, and collaborating with the Ministry of Finance on improving forest tax
          regulations and tax collection; and scaling-up forest management transfers to communities while
          assuring adequate long-term support and monitoring; and
 (iv)     making the sector institutionalframework more effective and efJicient by linking the Action Plan
          for Rural Development (PADR) and NEAP to a national and regional land use planning process
          to facilitate an integrated approach towards public sector investments at the regional level aimed
          at optimizing synergy between sector-specific interventions.

 99.      In the vision, Madagascar Naturellement, there is a renewed focus on rural development.
 The year 2005 has been declared the "Year o f Rural Development" by the President of Madagascar, with
 the intended objective of self-sufficiency inrice production by the end of the year. The initial objective
 o f increasing rice yields by 8 percent annually has been increased to 13 percent per year. In2004, despite
 the losses associated with the cyclones, agricultural growth was 3.5 percent, significantly higher than the
  1.3 percent in 2003. Rice policy was a dominant policy issue in Madagascar since mid-2004. In early
'2004, the reduction inthe rice production due to the cyclone, the sharp depreciation in the local currency
 and an increase in the international price of rice contributed to price increases. Early announcements o f
 state intervention in case o f a steep increase inthe price o f rice created uncertainty among private sector
 importers. Rice imports in the first half of the year in 2004 were only 59,000 tons as compared to
  150,000 tons in 2003 during the same period. The shortage in rice with high prices triggered a
 Government facilitated rice import operation with selected private operators with this rice sold to
 consumers at 3,500 FMGkg. Finally, inMarch 2004 rice prices have started to decline with the harvest
 coming in. In2005, as notedbefore, rice tariffs were reduced to 10percent, giventhe higher international
 prices o f rice and the depreciation in the exchange rate, which provided added protection for local
 producers. The Government i s focusing on the entire rice value chain and intends to improve access to
 agricultural inputs, revitalize the seedmultiplication centers and rehabilitate the irrigation schemes inhigh
 potential agricultural areas.

Reform Program

100.    The implementationof the Government's institutional reformprogram for the Ministry has
commenced since its adoption in June 2004 and is aimed at supporting the decentralization process and
improving the quality of services. Inthis connection, the re-assignment o f staff and budget towards the
regions has begun. The 2005 budget for goods and services for the Ministryhas been re-aligned, and 80
percent i s allocated to the newly established regonal divisions and 20 percent to the Central ministry.

101.    The Government has developed its LandPolicy Letter which was validated by a wide range
of stakeholders in February 2005.          The Government adopted this letter on May 3, 2005.           The
Government's objective i s to put in place a land rights registration system based on the principles of (i)
decentralization o f the land administrationto the lowest level of local government; and (ii) designing and
implementing policy reforms following a process o f piloting and learning by doing. Pilot activities are
underway in two areas (guichet foncier communal in the Lac Alaotra and skcurisationfonciire in the
Haut Bassin du Mandrare). The Bank i s undertaking AAA on Land and Property Rights Review which
will serve as aninputto the National LandTenure Program.

102.    The implementationissues for making the maintenance fund for irrigation schemes (Fonds
d'Entretien des Rbseaux Hydro Agricoles, FERHA) which was established in September 2003 fully
operational are being addressed. A Task Force is finalizing the operations manual for FERHA. A
national workshop on the maintenance of irrigation schemes was held in April 2004.                Financing
mechanisms for funding FERHA are under discussion, and will be finalized as part o f the preparation for
the Watershed Management Project.

103.    The competitive research fund (Fonds CompbtitiJs de Recherche Appliqube, FCRA)
established by decree in June 2004, is operational. It is beingmanaged by an autonomous body made
up of a wide range of stakeholders (Ministry representatives, producer organizations, private sector and
universities). This committee has selected 30 proposals, based on a request for proposals in the second
halfo f 2004, for financing before December 2005.

104.    The locust early warning system (LEWS) has been developed and implementation has
commenced. The National Locus Control Center has been restructured and a capacity buildingprogram
for the staff and local governments, and rural communities i s under implementation. A rural radio
program is also beingpiloted inselected communities at riskto facilitate communication. The program i s
well on track to beingfully operational by end-2005.

105.    The Government has continued to implement the National Environment Action Plan
(NEAP) in 2004. The Government has sustained and improved the forest exploitation adjudication
system, by publishingthe status o f forest exploitation permits for the years 2002, 2003, and 2004 inthe
newspapers once every quarter during 2004. Mining and forest exploitation has been prohibited in
sensitive areas. Fire monitoring committees have been created and are operational at commune level,
allowing the forest service to know the status o f bushfires per commune.             The list of commune
vertehouges is now available and used as a daily tool within the Directorate General o f Water and
Forests.

106.    The decreemaking the Office Nationale pour 1'Environnement (ONE) the one-stop shop for
enforcing the MECIE(National EnvironmentalImpact) law was passed in February 2005. The one
stop shop is now operational and extension to regions i s under preparation. The Foundation for Protected
Areas and Biodiversity (FPAB) was created inNovember 2004. The options to transfer tourist revenues
for the operations and management o f protected areas i s under discussion by a committee set in 2005 up
for makingthe environment financially sustainable.

STRATEGIC AXIS 3: PROVIDINGHUMANAND MATERIALSECURITY

107.     The three PRSCs will support the Third Strategic Axis of the PRSP on human development
through a sequenced and gradual process. PRSC 1 supported the implementation o f the Government's
Education for All (EFA) program and improved service delivery innutrition. PRSC 2 has deepenedthe
engagement by supporting policy and institutional reforms in health, rural water supply and social
protection, and continues to consolidate the reforms started under PRSC 1,


                                              A.    EDUCATION

108.     Basic education is an important priority of the Government. The PRSP commits the
govemment to allocating 25 percent o f the domestic budget to education. In 2003, the Government
prepared a Strategic Plan for the Reform and Development o f the Education Sector along with a detailed
plan o f action for Education for All, which covers the first nine grades o f school (called "Education
Fondamentale"), with concrete proposals for achieving the target o f universal completion of the primary
cycle (grades 1-5). These documents, which were in line with PRSP priorities, were presented at a
meeting of the Friends of Madagascar in October 2003, which was attended by donors, the leading
representatives o f the Education Ministries as well as the Minister o f Finance and the Vice-Prime
Minister.

109.     Despite a relatively high gross enrolment ratio at the primary level, most children do not
complete even the primary cycle. Insufficient provision o f schooling facilities (classrooms and teachers)
i s a significant constraint on expanding access and improving quality. The average pupil-teacher ratio i s
close to 60, but inpoorer localities, the ratio rises to 70 or 80. The repetition rates inthe primary cycle -
around 30 percent - are among the highestinsub-Saharan Africa, leading to tremendous inefficiencies in
the use o f scarce public resources. Less than 40 percent o f students who enter class 1complete grade 5.
Achievement levels in the primary cycle, as measured by student performance on standardized tests in
language and mathematics, are low.

110.     The inadequacy of teachers reflects both an absolute shortage as well as problems with a
rational deployment of teachers (based on pupilnumbers) and a highproportion o f teachers who are in
administrative jobs in either the Central Ministry or in local education offices. Communities have
responded to this shortage by hiringteachers at the school level; these teachers, however, are of variable
quality and there are no criteria for their recruitment.

111.     In 2002, the government abolished all student charges for primary school. Free textbooks
and pupil materials were also provided under the World Bank education project and were later financed
bythe domestic budget. Further,the Govemmentextended financial contributions to communities for the
hiringof local teachers. This ledto atremendous surge inenrolments, not only innew entrantsinto class
1but the retum of children who had earlier dropped out or had never enrolled. This unexpected surge in
enrolments has compounded the problem of rapidly expanding access while ensuring that quality
improves.

112.     Inearly 2004, the three ministries of Educationwere mergedinto a single Ministry inorder
to ensure that there was an overall strategic direction to the education sector and that sub-sectoral
priorities andtrade-offs couldbe undertaken with greater ease.




                                                       42

ReformProgram

113.    The most dramatic progress has occurred in enrolments at the primary stage. Against an
expected target o f about 2.89 million students in 2003/04, an estimated 3.37 million students were
enrolled. As a result, the net enrolment rate i s over 90 percent. This large increase was supported by the
measures taken by the Government, such as the free supply o f textbooks and pupil materials,
enhancements in the subsidies for community teachers and provision of funds to schools, all o f which
were financedby the enhancedallocations inthe domestic budget supported by the PRSC.

114.     However, progress on other indicators for the implementationof the EFA Plan has been
relatively limited. There has been no significant reduction in the repetition rate, which continues to
hover around 30 percent. The completion rate also continues to be low. Recent achievement surveys
indicate either a stagnation or even a reduction in average achievement levels, compared to 1999. This
partly reflects the fact that the effects of recent reforms and measures will take some time to produce
results onthe ground.

115.     Significant progress has been made in expanding schooling facilities but they fall short of
the targets set. About 1413 classrooms were constructed, against a target of 2000; the 30 percent
shortfall was due to difficulties in construction management, lack of timely availability o f budgetary
allocations and the rising unit cost causedby the devaluation of the FMG and consequent increase inthe
price o f imported materials. The shortfall in the realization o f targets for teacher hiring are even larger.
Only 50 percent o f the 1800 new planned teachers could be recruited. There has been no progress made
in redeploying teachers from the areas with low pupil-teacher ratios to those with high pupil-teacher
ratios. Recently, the Government has introduced measures to ensure that new recruits are assigned to a
specific school inorder to ensurethat they do not move back to another region.

116.     Measures have been taken to improve quality but more is required: A major quality
improvement program has been launched with the help of UNICEF (Approche Pur les Competences),
which includes training of teachers, providing support in classrooms and the development o f teacher
guides. A provisional training plan for pre-service and in-service training of teachers has been prepared
and about 5 percent of the salary expenditure for 2005 has been budgeted for training. Revision of the
training curricula and o f rehabilitation o f training facilities has been undertaken. Nevertheless, there has
been no significant progress on key issues identified inthe EFA plan: training o f teachers inpedagogical
methods for multi-grade teaching, or teaching inlarge groups, establishment o f a multi-year training plan,
or improving the mastery o f the language of instruction by teachers. Although the Government has
adopted inprinciple a measure to reduce repetitionrates within the 2-year cycles o f the primary stage, the
results are affected by the lack o f effective communication o f the new strategy to teachers and
communities. The difficulties inredeploying teachers to bringdown pupil-teacher ratios and the variable
quality o f the community teachers are among the main factors which impede progress on quality. The
proposal to raise the subsidies for community teachers to about 2.5 times per capita GDP, against the
current level of 0.7 of per capita GDP (a level which is too low to attract quality teachers), has also not
been implementeddue to lack o f availability o f the budget.

 117.    The Ministry has started to address the issue of improving management and
implementationcapacity.Followingthe merger o f the three Ministries, the Ministry has commissioned a
study on the functional reorganizationof the Ministry.A study to develop a planfor the rationalization of
human resources within the Ministryhas also been commissioned (this i s a PRSC 2 trigger as well). The
Ministryis also undertaking studies on strengthening the statistical capacity and on improving financial
management and procurement capacity. Introduction o f information technology inthe Ministryhas begun
with the appointment of an ICT director inthe Ministry,the supply o f computers to provincial offices and
the development o f an intranet. Most o f the measures for improving management in key areas, such as


                                                        43

construction management, textbook management, and personnel management remain to be elaborated in
detail.

118.    Budget executionand budget preparationcontinue to face problems. Apart from the general
problems o f budget execution (for example, an effective execution period of 9 months), the problems of
the execution of the 2004 budget were reflected in delayed payments for community teachers, caisses
scolaires, and for construction. Final data on the execution o f the budget for 2004 are not yet available.
The execution problems partly reflect overall budgetary constraints, which led to suspension of
commitments inmid-year, and also the lack o f budget execution capacity within the Ministry to prepare,
monitor and modify quarterly cash flow and procurement plans. In line with the overall program of the
government, the Ministry has now adopted programbudgets. The preparation of the 2005 budget posed
significant problems due to lack o f clarity about these program budgets and the difficulties of
coordination between the MENRS and the MEFB. Another issue i s the lack o f effective linkage between
the mediumterm projections for educational expenditures, based on the strategic goals and objectives of
the Ministry, and the annual budget preparation, leading to shortfalls in the allocation of resources for
some key inputs.

119.    Madagascaris on the list of potentialcandidates to receive funding from the Educationfor
All-Fast Track Initiative. In2005, Madagascar i s expected to receive interim grant financing from the
EFA-FTICatalytic Fund, basedon its updated EFA plan of April 2005, which has been endorsedby the
local donors (see next para).

120.    Theprior actionsfor educationunderPRSC2 include:

    0   The implementationof the EFA Plan is sound as assessed by a joint-donor evaluation: As
        noted above, while there has been significant increase inenrolments, many of the other expected
        results of the plan have not been met, nor have many key strategies been implemented. The
        Government prepared a revised EFA plan in April 2005, taking into account the lessons learnt
        over the last two years, and submitted it to the EFA FTICatalytic Fundto access additional grant
        funds. The local donors have preparedajoint assessmento f this plan and its implementationover
        the last two years, using a tool prepared by the EFA-FTI. The assessment was undertaken in
        early May 2005. The overall assessment is that the EFA plan i s sound, and that the Government
        i s adjusting its strategy appropriately to focus on quality and improving completionrates.

    0   Preparation of HR rationalization study: The study on HR rationalization has been
        completedinMarch2005. The issues that are to be addressedinthis planare highly contentious
        (for example, the redeployment of teachers from administrative positions, a more rational
        deployment of teachers across schools) and linked to overall reform o f the civil service. Careful
        thought will have to be given to implementreforms in a participatory manner, involvingteachers
        and communities, andperhaps pilotingthem insome areas.

121.    The indicativetrigger for PRSC3 is that the implementationof the EFA remains on track.

ExpectedResults

122.    The enrolment rates have increased beyond expectations, and the current primary net
enrolment rateis projectedto bewell over 90 percent.

123.     Malnutrition rates remain high in Madagascar, but the negative trend since 1997 has been
reversed. The results of the anthropometric survey, conducted by INSTAT between May and August
2004 show a reduction inthe national underweightmalnutrition rates among children under five from 43
percent in 1997 to 35 percent in 2004. Stunting, or chronic malnutrition rates remain very high at 47.5
percent. Decreasing stunting takes long-term commitment and intensified attention towards pregnant
women in order to reduce low birth weight. Impressive improvements have been made concerning
exclusive breastfeeding o f children under six months (from 43 percent in 1997 to 67 percent in2003/04
based on the DHS) and Vitamin A supplementation among children under five (from 4 percent to 76
percent over the same period). However, micronutrient deficiencies, especially iron-deficiency among
young children remains very high, with more than two-thirds o f children under the age o f five suffering
from anemia. In addition, seasonal short-term hunger among school-aged children has been highlighted
as a major impediment to learning.

124.     The quality of nutrition services, integration of basic health services at the community-level,
and strengthening of the referral system for severely malnourished children, has improved in
recent years, but requires more attention to address the remaining challenges, iron deficiency anemia
among young children, seasonal hunger - especially among school-aged children -           and systematic
nutrition surveillance.

125.     The reversal of the negative trends and improvements in the nutrition situation in
Madagascar are the results of strengthened capacity to develop policies, implement programs at the


                                                   45

community level and improved quality of nutritionservices. Under Government leadership, all the
nutrition partners have adopted a harmonized approach for community based nutrition activities, and a
National Community Nutrition Program was developed and i s being piloted in 22 regions. Further
progress though is needed to consolidate capacity and coordinate within the key-sectors, such as health
and agriculture. The National Council for Malnutrition and Office National de Nutrition (0") which
represent all stakeholders innutrition inMadagascar, are very well placed to take on these extra efforts.

ReformProgram

126.     The Government is highly committed to continuing the reduction of malnutrition as
evidencedby the adoptionof the first NationalNutritionPolicy inApril of 2004 under PRSC 1and
the creationof the NationalCouncilfor Malnutrition(C")             and its secretariat, the Office NutionuE
de Nutrition (0") inNovember2004 to lead the implementationofthe NutritionPolicy andprograms.
A NationalNutritionAction Planwas developed over the last months of 2004 andtechnically validated in
March 2005. The Government of Madagascar and Parliament also demonstrated very strong political
commitment by approving a US$23 million budget for nutrition programs in 2005; this i s significantly
higher than inearlier years.

127.     Significant progress has been made in the fight against malnutrition, with continued
support fromthe Government to 3600 nutritionsitesin2004, reachingover 650,000 childrenunder
the age of 3 for growth promotion and counseling services. Impact survey data shows significant
decreases in severe and moderate underweight malnutrition rates in the program areas, with an
improvement o f 43 percent inthe moderately underweightrate inthe Seecaline sites versus 32 percent in
the non-Seecaline sites. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis o f the monitoring data of the Seecaline
project shows that the underweight rate improved on average between 18 percent and 40 percent during
1999-2002 inthe Seecaline sites. Moreover, the sites which were exposed longer to the program have a
differential advantageon the malnutrition rate (approximately 8.0 percentagepoints per additional year of
exposure to the program).      As a result of the demonstrated achievements o f 10-year investment in
nutrition services at the community-level and the renewed political attention to the issue, extensions of
nutrition sites, integration of basic health services and improved referral systems are being established
under the ongoing programs supported through PRSC 1and is foreseeninfuture financing.

128.     A comprehensiveschool nutritionand healthprogramis reaching almost 2 million school-
aged children in the program areas and is programmedto be extended nation-widein the next
years. Seasonal school-feeding programs are foreseen to address the short-term hunger problem during
the leanperiodinfood-insecure areas of Madagascar.

129.     The first two triggers for PRSC 2, the creation o f the National Council for Nutrition and the
establishment o f its secretariat (Office National de Nutrition), were fulfilled inNovember 2004 (creation
bydecree). The coordinator ofthe ONNwas appointed inMay 2005.

ExpectedResults

130.     The mainoverall outcome is areductioninthe childunderweightrate of 20 percent between2004
and 2007, based on the results o f anthropometric surveys (2004 & 2007).                  In addition, the
institutionalizationo fnutrition and the development o fthe National Community NutritionProgramwould
lead to sustained commitment and investment innutrition for the long term at the national, regional and
commune level (integration o fnutrition indicators inthe Regional and Commune DevelopmentPlans).

131.     Recent progress on several key outputs in child health' has significantly improved infant
(mostly post-neonatal) and juvenile mortality rates. Despite the absence o f a formal health sector
policy document, constant changes in organization and personnel within the Ministry of Health and
Family Planning (MoH), and insufficient medical specialists and paramedical staff, the sector continues to
implement a number o f effective interventions while promoting several promising public-private
initiatives. Under M o H direction, for example, based on the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)
between 1997 and 2003104, the vaccination rate for DTC3 increased from 46 to 61 percent. By highly
subsidizingthe price o f insecticides, impregnated bednets and home treatment for malaria inchildren and
by complementing delivery through public health services with an effective social marketing program
through the private sector, prevention and care for malaria have been made available nationwide at an
affordable price. For example, financial accessibility of bednets greatly improved, resultinginalmost no
difference betweenthe four lowest quintiles inbednet ownership". However, as has been demonstrated
elsewhere" IMCI (integrated management o f child illnesses) has remained limited to a few pilot sites
without providingconvincing evidence o f its effectiveness.

132.     Safe motherhood remained largely unaffected over the last years-the                    maternal mortality
ratio (MMR)was 489 and 469 respectively in 1997 and 2003/04--jeopardizing the likelihoodthat
Madagascarwill reachthis MDGby 2015. While antenatal care increased77 percent to 80 percent and
the presence of skilled staff at birthhas increased from 47 percent to 54 percent over the same period, the
lack of progress of health care at first referral level, inparticular at the district hospital level, servingthe
large majority of the rural population, precluded any improvement in maternal care. Deaths due to
abortioncontributed significantly to the MMR (40 percent inrural areas, and approximately 52 percent in
Antananarivo), andbetter family planning interventions would considerably improve maternalhealth.


 Between 1997 and 2004 (DHS 1997 andDHS 2003-2004), the immunization rate increased from 46% to 61% and
the modern contraceptive prevalence rate increased from 9.7% to 18.3%; a national measles campaign covering
approx. 7 millions children and youths took place inOctober 2004, vitamin A distribution campaigns take place bi-
annually nationwide; 360,000 permanently impregnatedbednets and more than one millionhome treatment for
malaria inchildrenunder five were sold at a highly subsidizedprice.

133.     Control of malaria, tuberculosis and leprosy made significant progress due mainly to
increasedavailability of resources. Indoor sprayings with insecticide combined with implementationof
a sophisticated surveillance system" in recent years has helped contain the number of malaria cases to a
minimum on the highlands. Intermittent Presumptive Therapy with Fansidar in pregnant women was
scaled up last year. Social marketing of highly subsidized permanently impregnated bed nets increased
mother and child prevention in the coastal regions. Furthermore, social marketing o f highly subsidized
permanently impregnated bednets and of pre-dosedpre-packed chloroquine for home treatment increased
mother and child protection against malaria in the coastal endemic regions. Diagnosis and treatment o f
tuberculosis improved with the expansion of DOTS (directly observed therapy system) and increased
drugavailability nationwide.

134.     Although variable, control of other transmissible diseases (schistosomiasis, plague and
filariasis) is lagging behind. While mass treatment of hyperendemic villages for schistosomiasis with
Praziquantel was initiated as early as 1997, the MOHwas not able to decentralize the capacity to organize
these mass treatments at district level. Despite major advances in the diagnosis of plague through the
development o f a specific rapid field test, the number of deaths due to plague didnot decrease, and only
major progress in urban sanitation will improve the situation. Regarding filariasis, the M o H i s still
consideringwhich strategy to use to scale up its control.

135.     With 0.93 percent of HIV positivepregnantwomen nationwide, the HIV/AIDS epidemicis
close to generalization, necessitating major Government and partner efforts to contain the
epidemic. While occurring later than most o f its neighbors, the Madagascar epidemic has increased
sharply. The population i s at higher risk due mainly to the very highsexually transmitted infection (STI)
prevalence rate. Highly subsidized pre-packed pre-dosed STI treatment kits are sold through social
marketing through both the public and private sectors, allowing to effectively cover all areas. Since the
establishment of the ComitC National de Lutte contre le Sida (CNLS) to implement the MAP, numerous
activities (information, education and communication, peer education, mass media communication,
cinemobiles in villages, etc.). However, while knowledge of HIV/AIDS satisfactorily progressed from
1997 to 2003J04 (from 69 percent to 79 percent for women, and to 88 percent for men), behavior change
has laggedbehindamong high-riskgroups inhot spot areas as well as among the generalpopulation.

136.     While the quality of basic health care is acceptable, the health system performs poorly at
hospitallevel, limiting referralto urban areas and only then when it is not further compounded by
financial barriers. Population coverage (<5km) is limited to 60 percent of the country.               Further,
approximately 25 percent o f health facilities in covered areas suffer from inadequate medical and
paramedical staff (~nderstaffing/absenteeism)'~.While quality issues at the periphery pertain mainly to
staffs lack o f skills (only 32.3 percent o f healthproviders measured the respiratory frequency inchildren
with acute respiratory infection with no difference public and private provider^'^), quality o f services at
hospital level i s affected by the lack o f proper medical specialists, lack o f equipment, of maintenance, of
proper drugs and consumables, etc."

ReformProgram

137.     Over the past year, the health sector, a number of initiatives are underway to prepare the
health sector to transition to programmatic support. These have been summarized in a recent health

`'Detection  of epidemics using malaria rapidtests with Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS).

sector note, and include the following. In2003, technical assistance was provided to strengthen district-
level planning and budgeting capabilities, and two international NGOs have provided hands-on support
over two budgeting exercises. Since October 2004, the Bank has (along with the technical assistance)
provided additional financing for the health districts, approximately doubling the existing recurrent
expenditure budget. Inaddition, UNICEF i s progressively introducingMarginal Bottleneck Budgetingat
the district level and will cover about 50 percent of the districts by the end of the calendar year. The
sector has also benefited from a significant amount of analytical work, including the efficiency and equity
inhealth facilities study in2003 duringthe gratuity period (which will berepeatedina few months after
more than one year implementationof the new cost-recovery scheme) and the DHS 2003-2004. A health
sector MTEF has beenprepared within the context of the Government's public finance reforms, and two
important studies (a national health accounts and a human resources study will begin in 2005 and be
completedby the end of the calendar year.

138.     Health service delivery will be improved both at peripheral and hospital levels in order to
help reach the MDGs. Mother and child health should benefit from: (i)          a more equitable repartition o f
health manpower between urban and rural areas; and (ii)further increase in effective preventive
interventions (increased immunization and oral re-hydration therapyI6 coverage, introduction of
community based treatment of acute respiratory infections (ART) with antibiotics, zinc supplementation,
etc.). Regarding safe motherhood, significant progress should be expected through the strengtheningof
the regional hospitals (in addition to the 6 provincial hospitals 16 district hospitals will be upgraded as
regional hospitals) and the installation of 38 ambulance inreferralhospitals connected to large scale radio
communication network (currently under installation). The already improved contraceptive prevalence
rate should benefit from the creation o f a Secretariat ExCcutif for Family Planning which will prioritize
the 24 percent women categorized as unmet needs for contraception. Furthermore, the M O H will launch
the delivery o f a revolutionary contraceptive im~lant'~,which i s much more easily inserted and removed
than Norplant and which can be targeted to the poorest women, for whom payments for oral or injectable
contraceptives constitute a barrier, even if the cost i s minor. The number of treatment centers for
tuberculosis will be dramatically increased inorder to improve compliance with treatment and to reduce
the proportion of lost to treatment.

139.     Madagascar's efforts to provide services to the poor have been based on increasing the
availability of quality services and ensuring the financial accessibilityof these services. With respect
to availability, in addition to the ongoing program of infrastructure rehabilitation, the Ministry has taken
steps to formalize a benefit package for staff working in remote/difficult locations in order to provide
incentives for physicians, who were redeployed inrural health centers in 1998, and other staff to remain
intheir posts. Adequate supply of drugs was restoredwith the reintroduction of costrecovery inJanuary
2004 (after a period of free distribution during the 2002 crisis), and the 35 percent markup on generic
drugs is among the lowest in Africa. However, this low level of mark-up does not leave much room for
additional resources to improve quality (incentives, etc.) and will be probably reconsidered after the
current crisis i s over. While the Government has succeeded in maintaining low drug prices through
subsidies to compensate for the high devaluation during 2004, it will have to carefully manage the
restoration of prices reflecting drugs' real cost inthe upcoming months. Moreover, a substantial number
o f drugs and products (mainly the ones with the highest externalities) distributedinthe public as well as
inthe private sector arehighly subsidized'*. Given that drugs and consumables are cheap, free or highly
subsidized at first contact level, health care i s affordable for most of the people at the periphery, allowing

for a relatively simple exemption system. Inaddition, special services have been organized for the poor
in several areas, including free nutritional rehabilitation services for severely malnourishedchildren and
mothers in35 hospitals nationwide (contracted out to NGOs).

140.     Cost-recovery was reinitiated at health center level, but with accompanying exemption
policy measures for the poor at this level. Despite the documented highprevalence o f poverty among
the general population and the introduction of payment mechanisms to assist those who have been
identified as poor to have access to basic health services Cfonds d'dquite!, the small number of persons
who claim to be indigent indicates that there may be significant cultural barriers to identifying oneself
publicly as poor or indigent. Similar measures are gradually being introduced in hospitals, given the
impoverishing effects o fhospitalization, where most surgical and other consumables are not available and
must be purchased in private outlets, ending up in unreasonably expensive bills. MOH has begun
studying the creation of equity funds at hospital level which could be complemented with a mutual
insurance scheme where feasible.

                                       D.     RURAL   WATERSUPPLY

142.     The provision of drinking water services figures prominently in the PRSP as part of the
objective to promote Human Development in particular for the poor and is among the top five
priorities of the President agenda in "Madagascar Naturellement". Water and sanitation are o f prime
importance for the development o f Madagascar because of their complementary role inpreventingdisease
and reaching the Millennium Development Goals. Access to improved water supply and sanitation,
accompanied by effective hygiene education, can be effective inimproving both health and productivity,
improving the quality o f life and providing increased opportunities for education and employment,
especially for women and girls.

143.     In2004, the access to safe drinking water was only 14 percentinrural areasand 66 percent
in urban areas. Diarrhea is the third cause of morbidity and mortality in Madagascar. The active
population lost 6 million work days per year, estimated at 50 billion Ariary and primary students lost 3.5
million days o f school per year due to water borne diseases and an environment of inadequatehygiene.

144.     The likelihoodof attaining the MDG, Le., providing 52 percent of the rural populationand
77 percent of the urban population with access to potable water and sanitation by 2015, remains
constrained by a couple of issues. First, sector investments are insufficient to overcome demographic
growth. In2003, for example, sector investments, which accounted for USD 12 million, provided 150,000
additional people with safe water, whereas the population has increased by more than 400,000 over the
same period. Supply side interventions to meet the MDGs by 2015 would require an total amount of USD
60 million a year. Second, the sustainability o f the service remains an area of concern, inparticular for
water systems installed in small towns, where the service deteriorates after some years, due to inadequate
management and no efficient cost recovery system. Third, sector execution capacity, includingtechnical




                                                      50

and operational capacity in the Ministry at central and provincial levels, as well as in NGO's and the
private sector, is still limited.

145.     However, since 2002, a series of actions were undertaken to improve the legal and
institutional framework in the water and sanitation sector. Thirteenenforcement decrees of the water
law were adopted in 2003 as part of the sector reform. The roles and responsibilities of sector
stakeholders are clear and well defined. Government, through the Ministry in charge of water and
sanitation plans and monitors all sector activities; ensure donors' coordination and leads regular and broad
stakeholders consultation processes, through the WASH (Water Sanitation and Hygiene) committee. A
rural water supply and sanitation strategy was validated in 2003. The strategy i s based on the Demand
Responsive Approach (DRA) concept, where communities make informed choices on the technology
option, contribute to the capital cost with cash or in kind contributions and take responsibility for the
operation and maintenance costs and receive adequatetraining to manage the water facilities. Inaddition
to the water supply program, education hygiene and sanitation promotion are included as a package to
achieve effective and sustained used of improved water and sanitation services and hygiene practices.
Finally, NGOs and the private sector are in charge o f the technical study, construction, community
mobilization, maintenance and morerecently inthe management o f larger pipedwater systems.

ReformProgram

146.     First, the sector has developed a full set of tools necessary to movetoward a programmatic
approach and to scale up investments. The MEM/DEA presented its "Water and Sanitation for All"
program inFebruary 2005 to the donor community. This strategy proposes a long term vision and clear
objectives to reach the MDGs and solutions to increase sustainability o f the services and sector delivery
capacity. The Directorate of Water and Sanitation has elaborated its first program budget for the 2005-
2007 period. In addition, the RWSS sector has prepared a manual o f procedures, including technical
norms and standards for water and sanitation sub-projects implementation and management, to be usedby
all stakeholders. Finally the sector undertook in 2004 an exhaustive field inventory of all water point
facilities existing inthe country, which will be used as the sector baseline for measuring sector progress
and has set up a water points computerized database. The results o f the field inventory were validated in
April 2005.

147.      Second, the sector has implemented a new policy framework for ensuring more efficient
management of water services, in particular in localities with a population above 1,000 inhabitants.
Villages authorities or communes can contract, under a lease or management contract, the operations o f
the water systems to private operators, promoting efficient pricing, and technical and commercial
operations through transparent and competitive contractingprocesses. That new approach has been tested
in2005 inabout 25 localities andwill contribute to provide about 100,000 people with improvedpotable
water services.

148.      Third, in response to high priority for potable water supply in the PRSP, the Government
has substantially increased domestic funding to the sector. The allocation for water supply tripled,
from USD 1.5 million in2004 to USD4.5 million in2005, representing 38 percent of the total allocations
of the Directorate o f Water and Sanitation Program budget. The allocation to the Directorate o f Water
and Sanitation increased by 40 percent between 2004 and 2005 that i s from USD 10.6 million in2004 to
USD 14.6 million in 2005.         Expenditures towards rural areas account for 82 percent o f the 2005
Directorate of Water and Sanitation Program budget. The 2005 program will provide 250,000 additional
people with safe water.

149.      PRSCZ will be instrumental in increasing sector delivery capacity and scaling up rural
water supply infrastructure to increase access, affordability and sustainabilityof water supply and


                                                      51

sanitation services in rural and semi-urban, in particular by: (i)     improving sector programming and
monitoring activities, through the Directorate of Water and Sanitation Program budget and, annual
govemmentNVASH members sector reviews and coordinated donors support in order to increase sector
accountability, measuring progress in program implementation and getting information about value for
money and (ii)   by strengthening the operational and technical capacity of the ministry incharge of water
and sanitation at the central and provincial levels to better plan, manage and monitor the implementation
o f the "Water and Sanitation for All Program".

PRSC2 Trigger

150.     The indicative trigger was that the Directorate of Water and Sanitation in Antananarivo
and its decentralized departments in the six provinces are adequately staffed and equipped to
implement successfully the proposed RWSS program "Water and Sanitationfor AN". The trigger
has been mostly implemented. The Water and Sanitation for All strategy was produced in February
2005, and based on the results of a study to reinforce capacity inthe provincial offices, the equipment i s
largely inplace, and the recruitment is ongoing for the personnel. Hence for the prior action for PRSC 2,
the trigger hasbeen slightlymodified to reflect the current status.

ExpectedResults

151.     The mainresults expected by 2007 inthe rural water and sanitation sector with the support of the
PRSC are the following:
     -   The sector wide approach is in place. The program budget of the Directorate of Water and
         Sanitation i s the reference framework for strategic and operational programming and the
         monitoring and evaluation o f all sector activities. Investments to the sector have increased
         significantly.

     -   The ministry in charge of Water and Sanitation at the central and provincial levels has the
         capacity to plan, manage and monitor the implementation o f the "Water and Sanitation for All
         Program".

     -   Access to safe water will increase from 14 percent in 2004 to 20 percent in 2007 in rural and
         semi-urban area and about 1,000,000 additional people will be served over the three years
         program.


                                       E.      SOCIAL PROTECTION

152.     Seventy percent of the population lives in poverty, 23 percent are acutely poor, and shocks
are widespread. Interms o f natural disasters alone, more than 30 cyclones, 6 droughts and 2 famines
have hit the island nation since about 1970. Madagascar's on-going risk and vulnerability analysis finds
that other shocks, including human disease, locust infestation and livestock disease, are widespread, if
less visible than natural disasters.

153.     Existingsafety net programs are ill-adapted to effectively managingthese risks. The current
system of safety nets has evolved in response to various crises. As a consequence, much of today's
spending appears to be crisis-driven, to the detriment o f longer term strategic aims.            Moreover,
beneficiary groups have not been rigorously defined nor prioritized. Although social protection spending
comes to approximately 7 percent o f Government expenditure (above-average for comparable countries),
the lack of a clear definition and prioritization o f vulnerable groups creates the risk that these resources



                                                      52

will be spread across broad beneficiary populations, to little effect, rather than concentrated on the
neediest groups. In order for Madagascar's social protection resources to achieve maximum impact, a
greater portion o f resources need to be invested further upstream, in risk prevention and mitigation
instruments; in a more coordinated fashion, with less overlap between different partners' activities; and
for the benefit o f well-defined, agreed-uponvulnerable groups.

154.     In 2002, the Government created a Technical Committee on Social Protection (TCSP) to
address the issues raised above, through development of a comprehensive Risk Management and Social
Protection (RMSP) Strategy. Though the TCSP has been effective in this role (the RMSP Strategy is
expected be completed in early FY06), it is not a permanent Government body, and its mandate does not
extend to implementing the strategy nor undertaking social protection reforms. Madagascar now needs a
permanent institutional framework for social protection, with a mandate to implement the RMSP
Strategy, to lead social protectionreforms, and to guide/coordinate future investments inthe sector.

Reform Program

155.     The TCSP i s in the process of finalizing a Social Protection Policy Note, and the R M S P
Strategy, The Policy and Strategy will help Madagascar to set clear objectives, reform goals, and
cost-effective interventions. They will be based on an assessment o f the priority areas of vulnerability,
and will take into account the needto balance short-term, risk-coping instruments with long-term, growth-
enhancing social protection interventions. The Policy and Strategy pieces will provide the analysis
necessaryfor social protection reforms envisioned under PRSC3.

156.     The TCSP has also done initial research on the creation of a permanent institutional
framework for social protection. Because resources are over-invested in emergency management and
response, it i s critical that the mandate o f this social protection agency/committee/secretariat encompass
management o f all welfare-harming risks, and not only highly visible natural disasters and other
emergencies. The Government has recently created the "Cellule de Prevention et de Gestion des
Urgences (CPGU)" that includes a Steering Committee and an Executive Secretariat. Clarification about
the mandateo fthis new organizationwill decide whether a more specialized agency i s needed.

  STRENGTHENINGMONITORINGAND EVALUATIONOF THE PRSP

 157.    The PRSP lays out the principles of the monitoring and evaluation system, the institutional
framework, the objectives of the system as well as the modality o f operations with civil society and the
donor community. The objectives of the system are to monitor inputs, outputs and outcomes, and evaluate
impacts. To date, the monitoring and evaluation system i s at an embryonic stage.                 Institutional
responsibilities need greater clarity. The Secretariat Technique h 1'Ajustement (STA) does not have
adequate capacity to meet its function o f coordinating the technical aspects of PRSP preparation and
monitoring. Capacity to monitor the implementation o f the PRSP needs to be strengthened at the sector
ministry level also. The Institute o f Statistics (INSTAT), which is the central agency of the national
statistical system, suffers from mismatch of technical expertise, uncertain financial position, and limited
analytical capacity. The Center for Economic Research Studies (CREAM), a research center of MEFB, i s



                                                        53

also weak. Buildingin-country analytical capacity to generate quality policy analysis and informpolicy-
makers' decisions also remains amajor challenge.

ReformProgram

158.    The PRSCsare supportingthe followingreforms:
e       the developmentof a concreteplanfor strengtheningthe monitoringand evaluationsystem.
        An Institutional Development Grant has just been approved to support this important activity.
        Madagascar will be a pilot country for a donor coordinated statistical capacity buildingtechnical
        assistance withthe EU, DFID, PARIS 21and the World Bank. The elements of such a plan could
        include (a) strengthening the logical framework for the PRSP to linkthe combination of projects,
        programs and policies to outputs and development outcomes. The data collection plan would be
        made consistent with this framework; (b) clarifying the institutional structure for monitoring and
        evaluation; (c) capacity buildingplan, for STA, INSTAT, and key sector ministries, to enable
        these institutions to undertake their functions; (d) further elaboration of the Statistical Master Plan
        from INSTAT to the national statistical system to include a well developed capacity building
        plan, data collection system and medium-term financing plan to improve predictability of
        resources and updating of the legal and institutional framework for the National Statistical
        System to clarify mandates and responsibilities, and improve coordination and harmonization;
        and (e) a clear policy for open access to public information to strengthen government
        transparency and accountability, and to elicit the participationo f civil society inmonitoring PRSP
        implementation and especially service quality and delivery. This would include, among others a
        protocol for open access to primary data.
0       Support to the 2004 household survey: Technical assistance to support the new household
        survey (Enqugte Prioritaire aupr2s des Mdnages, EPM) in 2004 (comparable to the 2001 EPM
        survey), with a module on vulnerability was provided. Data collection has just been completed
        and analysis i s ongoing.

Povertyand SocialImpactAnalysis

159.    The Government i s committed to undertaking poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) o f key
policy reforms. To inform the content o f this PRSC and to inform other critical policy issues, ex-ante
poverty and social impact analysis has been undertaken inthe past year. The areas include:

(i)     Poverty and social impact analysis of the impact of changing rice tar&%. The changed economic
        environment o f 2004, with a sharply depreciating exchange rate and higher world prices o f rice,
        altered the balance between the interests o f rice producers and consumers. In 2003, rice tariffs
        were at 20 percent. Analysis showed that at the new exchange rate and world prices o f rice, the
        tariff could be reduced. This was done in the 2005 Loi des Finances with rice tariffs being
        reduced to 10 percent. Further analysis i s being undertaken to provide the Government policy
        options to manage future rice crises better.
(ii)   Analyzing thepoverty and social impact of cost-recovery in the health sector: The participatory
        work on this issue is commencing, and results are expected inthe next six months. The work will
        focus on understanding the effectiveness o f current and proposed safety net mechanisms in
        targetingthe poor for protection from health fees inbothurban and rural areas, at the hospital and
        health post level through qualitative field work and analysis of existing quantitative data. In
        addition, it will seek to understand the evidence on the distributional impact of reinstatement of
        cost recovery, to develop a consensus among stakeholders (NGOs, ministrypersonnel etc.) on the
        appropriate role for a safety net mechanism.




                                                      54

(iii)   Land tenure - Recognizingthe importance of a transparent and well-functioning property rights
        regime to meet the growing demand for formalization, reduce disputes and court cases, improve
        the investment climate, increaseagriculturalproductivity among the rural poor, and promote good
         governance more broadly, the Government has made land tenure reform one of its key priorities.
        New land legislation will be presented to parliament in July 2005, to be followed by a piloting
        phase (supported by the EU, FAO, France, FAD, the U S M C A program), to test community-
         driven and decentralized approaches to formal registration and conflict-resolution. A PSIA will
         complement these efforts by providing an ex-ante evaluation of the impact o f land tenure
         securitization. The study will be based on a detailed farm-level survey specifically designed for
        thispurpose, collected duringApril-May 2005 inthe Lac Alaotra region, the mostimportantrice-
         growing area of Madagascar (and also the main focus o f the Watershed Management Project).
        Information was gathered from 1700 households on land productivity, investment, land
         documentation, conflicts and tenure insecurity. The study will compare outcomes - land values,
         investment, land conflicts, land leasing, and productivity - across titled and untitled plots to
        assessthe economic and social costs of tenure insecurity.


                       V. CREDITIMPLEMENTATIONAND RISKS

                                      A. CREDIT ADMINISTRATION

160.    The key prior actions that have been completed prior to Boardpresentation of PRSC 2 are shown
in Table 13. While PRSC 3 is designed to support the overall implementation of a broad range of
reforms, there are a number of core monitorable actions proposed as indicative triggers for PRSC 3. They
will serve as the basis for the Bank to proceedwith PRSC 3.
Disbursement,Reportingand Auditing Arrangements

161.     The safeguard assessment carried out by the IMF identified some weaknesses in the B C M
(Madagascar Central Bank) control environment, especially in the areas of internal control and financial
reporting. However, an agreed action plan with the B C M authorities have been developed to address
them. The follow-up report issued in March 2005 by the IMF revealed real progress in the
implementation of this action plan. In addition, steady progress has also been noticed in the
implementation of the priority action plan for public finance reforms. As a result no additional fiduciary
arrangementswill be required.

162.     The proposed credit will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy
support. Credit proceeds will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation o f the development policy
program and not tied to any specific purchases or be subject to procurement requirements. Once the
credit is approved by the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds of the credit will be disbursed in
compliance with the stipulated single tranche release conditions. Once the Bank's Board approves the

Implementation

163.     The responsibility for implementing the PRSC program in Government rests with the
Ministry of Economy, Financeand Budget. This represents a change since the Vice Prime Minister's
office was dissolved in March 2005. The Government has continued to take the lead in updating the
program policy matrix, and the Ministryo f Economy, Finance and Budget coordinated inputs from all the
relevant ministries to update the policy matrix.
                                   B.    ENVIRONMENTAL         ASPECTS

164.     The proposed PRSC 2 i s a development policy credit insupport of a broadprogram o f policy and
institutional reforms, for which the environmental requirements of OPBP 8.60 apply. The PRSC 2
program does not pose any significant environmental impacts. The Bank`s overall strategy has focused
on further strengthening of the Government's legislative andinstitutionalcapacity to address environment
andnaturalresource management.

165.     The Government of Madagascar adopted the National Environment Action Plan (NEAP)in 1989
to give greater coherence to efforts to manage the natural environment. To this end, a Policy has been
developed inorder to mainstreamenvironment within economic development. The Policy i s well defined
in the Charter of Environment published in December 1990 and modified in July 1997 and in the
Environment Policy Letter adopted in August 2003. This Policy is to be implemented throughout the
NEAP designed for fifteen years in three phases. The institutional and regulatory framework have been
putinplace andimplementedduringthe IDA supported EnvironmentProject 1through the publicationof
the first MECIE Decree (National Environment Impact Legislation) in 1992. This legislation was revised
in 1995, 1999 and finally in 2003 to integrate national natural resources management and economic
growth strategies. The IDA supported Environment Project 2, included a focus on integrating the
environment program into national development. Several sectoral policies have been developed and
implemented.

166.     The third environment project approved inApril 2004 aims to consolidate the gains from the first
two phases. It aims to conserve and value the importance and quality of the natural resources to allow
sustainable economic growth and better quality o f life.        Special emphasis is placed on improving
governance, particularly inthe forestry sector through: (i) institutional reforms aimed at separating policy-
making and regulatory functions from operational responsibilities; (ii)         improvement o f the forest
exploitation and adjudication system; and (iii) intensificationo f tavy and bush-fire control measures. This
would ensure an adequate coherence o f sector legislation with the environmental legal framework as
reflected in both national legislation, as well as Madagascar's participation in international conventions
and treaties. In addition, the role o f national institutions in charge of managing natural resources and
environmental impact, mainly between the Ministry of Environment and Water and Forest and the
National Office of Environment (ONE), has been clarified. This would ensure better management of
standards such as cost effectiveness, quality o f services, speed o f EA process. Among other decisions, it
has been agreed to establish a one stop shop in ONE for the evaluation of EIAs and the issuance of
environmental permits. Moreover, decentralization of legislation process is underway with an important
information campaign and a capacity buildingprogram. Finally, for the sake o f good governance and to
provide a strong signal to the private sector, these institutions will aim to ensure that all public
investments effectively comply with the existing legislation. The policy is flexible and its implementation
progressive. Sector investments, such as investments in water and sanitation will be carried out in line      .
with an implementation framework and a manual o f procedures which takes into account the experience
of IDA-financed projects (PAEPAR and FID) and the national environmental impact legislation. The
manual of procedures incorporates the environmental impact framework tested in the latter projects,
which was found satisfactory.

167. The mainrisksto the implementationof the povertyreductionstrategy include:

      First, Madagascar remains vulnerable to extemal shocks including cyclones and increase in
      intemational prices of key commodities, such as oil and rice, which regularly undermine
      growth and poverty reduction. The Bank i s finalizing a Risk and Social Protection Review to
      assess needed risk prevention and mitigation strategies for the extemal shocks Madagascar
      faces. The Bank has also modified procedures for its Community Development Project (FID
      IV) to allow the project to respond to emergenciesrapidly. Inaddition, to contain the damage
      from cyclones, the construction o f schools, and re-construction o f damaged infrastructure i s
      anti-cyclonic. The Government has set up a Cellule de Prevention et de Gestion des Urgences
      (CPGU) to manage, co-ordinate and monitor programs to prevent crisis, and manage them
      better when they do occur. Finally, the Government has made rice an important policy focus,
      focusing on the entire rice value chain (production, distribution, marketing), and i s also looking
      at policy options to better stabilize prices.
      Second, political stability remains key for implementing the PRSP. The President's popularity
      remains high, but with the next elections in 18 months from now (December 2006), short-term
      election objectives could dominate the policy agenda, potentially affecting the implementation
      of the PRSP. The Bank i s focusing on transparency and trylng to change the culture of
      granting ad hoc privileges through the govemance project and WBI capacity buildingsupport.
      The Bank is assisting the Government achieve its development objectives, andhas accelerated
      disbursements o f its portfolio starting FY03.
      Third, maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment remains critical, and managing the
      high inflation in the face of continued high intemational prices could prove challenging and
      affect macro-economic and social stability. The IMF monitors the macro-economic program
      regularly.
      Fourth, slow progress in implementing public finance reforms could hamper service delivery.
      Budget execution has been unpredictable, with stop-and-go cycles. The unreliability of revenue
      forecasting and delays in donor aid flows has meant that expenditures adjust to revenue
      shortfalls, thereby hampering effective budget execution. The Government has prioritized its
      policy actions in public finance, through the production of annual Priority Action Plans,
      starting in 2004. The Government has also started implementing a customs reformplan. But,
      ifprogress on implementation of these plans is slow, the impact on poverty reductionwould
      likely not materialize. To mitigate this risk the Bank is continuing to support the reforms
      proposed in the areas o f public finance, budget programming, procurement, institutional
      development and capacity building. The Govemance technical assistance project i s the key
      operation inthe Bank's strategy that will allow Madagascar to increase its capacity to absorb
      extemal aid and use it effectively in the pursuito f its PRSP objectives. In addition, ongoing
      operations will continue to put a heavy emphasis on institutional strengthening, training and
      capacity building.
      Fifth, the political leadership has a clear vision ofreformand is strongly committedto moving
      the PRSP agenda forward. Yet, implementation o f these reforms relies on civil servants at
      different levels. But implementing and delivering on the Government's ambitious reform
      program could be limitedby weak capacity. As noted above, to mitigate this risk, the Bank i s
      supporting institutional strengthening, training and capacity building.
      Sixth; sustainable poverty reduction will depend on maintaining growth at high levels,
      attracting private investment into the labor-intensive manufacturing sector and into ago-
      businesses with spread effects to rural areas, as outlined inMadagascar Naturellement. The



                                                   58

erosion o f trade preferences, and the expiration o f the MFA is expected to impact the growth of
the textile sector inthe EPZ. Failure to reestablish the confidence of private sector investors in
the Malagasy economy, which was affected by the politicaland economic crisis in2002, would
undermine the prospects for high growth and poverty reduction. As o f today, the FDIremains
low at 1percent of GDP, half the value as in 2001. The perception o f conflict of interest of
elected andpublic officials couldnegatively impact on the investment climate. Riskmitigation
includes the acceleration of reforms to improve competitiveness as outlined in the Integrated
Framework report and active participation in trade negotiations (EU, WTO, regional), and
assisting Madagascar inits quest to diversify its sources o f growth, as has been outlined inthe
recently completed Development Policy Review.               The ongoing Investment Climate
Assessment will provide recommendations on improving Madagascar's competitiveness and
the Bank will continue to assist the Government prioritize and implement reforms to improve
the investment climate. The governance agenda continues to support enhanced accountability
and transparency.
Finally, as mentioned in the Joint Staff Assessment (JSA), Madagascar's PRSP is ambitious
and its objectives can only be reachedif: (i) key reforms take place; (ii)significant institutional
strengthening occurs; (iii) if donors align their support to the PRSP; and (iv) ifthe required
financial support form the donor community i s forthcoming. Several actions including the
Government's efforts to strengthen institutions and stay the course on key reforms will help
mitigate this risk. In addition, as noted before, the donor community has already started to
intensify its efforts at coordinating assistance programs, harmonizing disbursements and
procurement procedures and developing common programmatic approaches centered around
the PRSP. The donor community i s increasing its level of financial aid to Madagascar, and i s
also providing technical assistance and support for capacity building for sustainability. Co-
ordination continues to be enhanced by focusing on implementation and results, using the
PRSP monitoring framework.

UNOFFICIALTRANSLATION OF THE FRENCH            ORIGINAL

MrPaulWolfowitz
President
The World Bank
1818 HStreet NW
Washington D C 20433, U S A



              Dear Mr Wolfowitz,

1.    The Republic of Madagascar developed its Poverty Reduction Strategy in the end of July
2003 following a broad-based participatory process. The document was conveyed to your
institution, as well as to the International Monetary FundinAugust 2003, and approved by your
Executive Board on November 14, 2003. This document was updated in a broad based
participatory workshop which was held on June 2 and 3, 2005. The updating essentially aims, on
the one hand, to take into account changes inthe international environment and inthe Malagasy
economy and, on the other hand, to integrate a longer term vision which was lacking in the
previous document.

2.    The strategic axes o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) however remain the
same and include: 1) restoringthe Rule o f Law andgood governance, 2) fostering and promoting
a very broad-based economic growth, 3) fostering and promoting human and material security,
as well as broadened social protection schemes. A three year implementation program of the
strategy is expected to reduce poverty to 68% by 2006.

3.    PRSP implementation started in July 2003, and continued substantially throughout 2004,
taking advantage of the opportunity provided by the budgetary framework. Thus, the 2004
Budget was as much as possible aligned to the PRSP priorities and emphasized the support to
actions envisioned to enhance governance and public finance management, education, health,
and transport. The ultimate goal from these measures would be establishing an investment
enabling climate and ensuring a better opportunity for enhancing service delivery to the
population, and inparticular to the poor.

4.     In the area of governance, 22 regions stipulated by the constitution were created to
coordinate the actions by communes which would ensure broad based development, and to
support them through developing better synergy. Such goals are pursued through the
development and the implementation o f regional development plans, most ofwhich are currently
being finalized.

5.     Inthe same area, the fight against corruption has become more effective. The legislative
and institutional framework has undergone dramatic change. Several new laws have been
adopted by the Parliament. These are namely the "anti-corruption" law and the law relative to
money laundering. A bill on political parties relating to new rules on their funding has been



                                                 86

submitted to Parliament for adoption. The Government has decreed several texts for
implementing such laws. At the institutional level, the Independent Anti-Corruption Bureau
(BIANCO) has been operational for six months. It is, among others, in charge o f undertaking
surveys and audits among sensitive public services, and conducts investigations starting from
corruption related complaints which are addressed to them. BIANCO i s also in charge of
receivingasset declarations from electedand senior officials inthe public administration.

6.     For more transparency in the actions by the mining, fishery, and forest sectors, the
Government i s publishingon a biannual basis the list o f operating permit holders, as well as that
o f fees collected from each operator. Within the Justice sector, anti-corruption strategies have
been developed and implementedthrough strengthening internal control, inparticular inspections
injurisdictions, andenforcing service standards inbothcivil andcommercial courts. Inaddition,
as well as the 2004 promulgation of the law instituting the Supreme Court, administrative and
financial courts have been set up in the autonomous Provinces. The missiono f such courts i s to
deal with litigations anddisputesopposing the Administration andthe nonpublic sector.

7.     With regard to public finance, the 2004 priority action plan for reforming public finance
has been substantially implemented. Such a planrelates to enhancing revenues and streamlining
the expenditure circuit. Details on the achievement of both points are provided inparagraphs 7
and 8. Regarding revenues, the first goal in the Government is to increase efficiency in tax
administration; fifty (50) tax centershave been computerized. Under the same view, the software
SYDONIA ++ is installed and operational and a one stop shop is working in some customs
offices. Service standards which are aligned with the international standard are gradually being
put inplace.

8.     With regard to expenditures, several important changes occurred during 2004 regarding
public finance. Those changesbrought innovation as regards to the budget chain andprocedures.
Following texts have been issued: (i)the organic law on public finance, (ii) the new
procurement code, (iii) reorganizing the diverse control and verification bodies, (iv) texts
                         texts
merging the functions of "sous ordonnateurs" (budget officers) and credit line managers. In
addition, an Integrated Scheme for Managing Public Finance (SIGFP) i s put in place and
partially operational. Such a scheme shall cover the operations on revenues andexpenditures and
integrate the customs administration, the tax administration, the Treasury, the Budget and the
CDE. It would enhance budget execution and monitoring. For the time being, only the
Toamasina Treasury, where the systemis fully operational, canproduce monthly accounts within
less than 15 days following the end o f the month.

9.     Considerable progress has been made in the preparation of final accounts and Budget
ExecutionLaws ("lois de rbglement"). Therefore, the draft 1999 Budget Execution Laws will be
submittedto Parliament very soon. The draft Budget ExecutionLaws for 2000, 2001, 2002, and
2003 have been deposited at the Auditor General's office. The Auditor General is reviewing the
drafl Budget Execution Laws for 2000, 2001, and 2002 and is planning to send to the
Government the draft reports on 2000 and 2001 by end o f June 2005. At such a pace the draft
Budget Execution Laws for 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 will be ready for submission to
Parliament by the end of the year 2005. The 2003 Final Accounts will be submitted to the
Auditor General's office end of June 2005.



                                                87

10. The decree on setting up the Authority for regulating Procurementwas publishedandmost
implementing texts andthe standard documents for implementing the new Procurement Code are
finalized end o f June 2005. The new Code is expected to be fully operational by the beginning o f
the year 2006.

11. A substantial increase inthe budget allocated to the road sector reflects the intention by the
Government to materialize its support to investment andto stimulate shared growth. Thus, due to
a 20% increase in the budget to the transport sector, the accessible national road network has
substantially increased and rural paths have been built or rehabilitated to enhance the movement
o f people and o f goods. The works for rehabilitating and enhancing important ports (Toamasina,
Mahajanga, and Toliary) are currently ongoing to reduce business transaction costs and enhance
competitiveness. Finally, Nosy-Be and Antananarivo-Ivato airports have been enlarged to meet
tourism sector needs.

12. Other economic reform measures can be summed up as follows : (i)pursuing the
liberalization o f economic and trade activities through an adopted mechanism for setting the
domestic oil prices, (ii) promoting foreign direct investment and putting in place incentive tax
and customs measures, (iii)identifying economic growth poles which integrate free zone
enterprises, mining, fishery, tourism, and rural activities, (iv) adjusting the monetary policy and
the exchange market to the development o fthe context.

13.   Inthe social sector, the main activities relateto implementingthe EducationForAll (EFA)
Plan through the provision o f school kits and manuals to all primary education pupils, hiring
teachers, training 1,900 teacher trainees and building 1,667 classrooms. In the health area,
emphasis was put on streamlining the expenditures in the sector. Therefore the survey on the
national health accounts has been launched while the implementation o f District Development
Plans andAnnual District Work Plansreceived support in2004.

14. In the area o f water, nutrition and social protection, the main achievements for the year
2004 were on the study / building and rehabilitating o f water supply infrastructure (drilling,
wells, ...), the study / building and rehabilitating o f water conveyance infrastructure (tanks,
pipelines, distribution pipes, pumps,. ..)and on the operationalization o f the National Authority
for Water and Sanitation (ANDEA).

 15.   Due to the implementation o f these reforms, public finance has been improved through
increased tax revenues end enhanced expenditure execution. Tax pressure has moved from
 10.0% in 2003 to 10.9% in 2004. Despite considerable shocks (cyclones, oil price rise,
depreciated rate o f the Malagasy Franc and a fairly high inflation) growth remained robust in
2004 with a 5.3% growth rate. Such growth originates namely from the highperformance infree
zone enterprises, and from the tourism sector, as well as from a strong increase in public
investment.

 16.   For the 2005/2006 period, the second year for effective implementation o f PRSP, the
Government intends to consolidate and refine the measures which have been already embarked
upon, namely inthe areas o f public finance, justice, and fight against corruption, development o f



                                                  88

private sector and o f social sector. Such measures will inthe short term contribute to achieving a
6.3% growth for 2005 and 7% for 2006. As it is essentially derived through a noticeable increase
inbuildingandpublic works activities, such growth will doublejob creation inthe sector. Inthe
primary sector, the orientation o f the Government actions towards rural development will
stimulate agriculturalproduction, namely that o f rice through expanded cultivated areas or scaled
up output. Such an economic growth should allow the Government to expect increase in tax
revenues which would go from 11.4% in2005 to 12.1% in2006. The budgetary deficit excluding
grants is projected at 9.8% o f GDP in2005 whereas the foreign current deficit will be about 8%.

17.   Regarding public finance, the 2005 budget allocation was better aligned to the PRSP
priority sectors. Therefore allocation toward these sectors continues to be strengthened, namely
to Education (+25%), Health (+36%), and Transport (+78%). For nutrition, the Government
approved a budget o f 25 million dollars for the 2005 program, which accounts for considerable
increase compared to the 2004 budget. The Government has launched the 2005 Priority Action
Plan and is being implemented. SIGFP is planned to be operational inprovincial capitals inthe
2"d semester o f 2005, andwould allow real time monitoring o f the budget execution. Merging the
credit line manager and "sous-ordonnateur" (budget officer) functions is effective under the
execution o f the 2005 budget in order to expedite and enhance the budget execution. The
Government would grant particular attention to controlling public finance and strengtheningthe
external control by the Parliament, the jurisdiction control by the Auditor General and the
internal control through the operationalizationo fthe General Inspectiono f Finance.

18.   With support from WCO, the Government is specifying its overall customs reform
strategy. A priority action planfor the year 2005 is being developed andwill be validatedby mid
June 2005. This plan will strengthen the ongoing actions and focus on three strategic axes:
increasing customs revenues, enhancing customs service standards (in particular, reducing
clearance period), and anti-comption efforts. In parallel the Government envisions important
involvement by the private sector and will undertake a feasibility study for the "Tradenet"
system.

19.   The measures for encouraging private investment as o f the second semester o f 2005 will
mostly be on developing the rural sector. They will focus on putting in place new mechanisms
for funding essential agriculture infrastructure such as hydro-agricultural networks. For
encouraging investment and enhancing productivity in the agricultural sector, the Government
will set up a new land tenure policy and a new extension service policy for farmers. The
currently ongoing works on rural roads should facilitate the flow o f goods and access o f
producers to more remunerating markets. Finally, the Government would grant particular
attention to monitoring the setting up o f the integrated framework program for developing
Madagascar integration into international trade.

20.   Inadditionto consolidatingactions inthe education andhealthsub sectors, the government
would deploy the Social Protection Strategy. In education, the technical works on the Plan for
streamlining and managing human resources are completed. The consultant report including a
proposal o f several scenarios is currently available and the MENRS has to proceed to the second
stage, i.e., establishing an implementation plan. In nutrition, the National Council for Nutrition




                                                 89

(CNN) and the National Nutrition Office (0") were established in November 2004. ONN
operationalization is well on track with the appointment o f its Coordinator.

21. Regarding health, the National Health Policy is being revised andwill be finalized by end
o f June 2005. A Medium Term Expenditure Framework has been introduced inthe 2005 budget.
The future framework will better indicate the means to achieve the Millennium Development
Goals (MDG). Regarding social protection, the 2005 budget is funding actions planned under a
strategic framework.

22.     For rural water supply, capacity building in the Directorate for Water and Sanitation
(DEA) in Antananarivo and of the six Provincial Directorates is ongoing through provision o f
equipment and adequate human resources. Aside from vehicle delivery planned in the end o f
June 2005, all other equipment have been delivered and assigned to the directorates involved.
The decision on the hiringo fstaff is confirmed and staffwould be deployedby endo fJuly 2005.

23.   The Malagasy government is determined to achieve its goal of substantial poverty
reduction planned in the PRSP. We rely on the support o f the international community, and in
particular from the International Development Association, to complement the resources needed
for attainingthis goal.
