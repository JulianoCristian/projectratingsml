Introduction


1.       This document evaluates the first three Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs)
provided to the Government of Madagascar to support key elements of its poverty reduction
strategy. The three annual PRSCs helped finance Madagascar's budgets in 2004, 2005 and 2006.

This introduction summarizes what a PRSC series is and what it seeks to achieve. Table 1
illustrates the design of a PRSC series.

2.       Development Objectives and Development Outcome Indicators: A PRSC series is
typically designed as follows. The first PRSC sets the development objectives for the entire series.
Typically, these are medium-term objectives, expected to be reached by the time of completion of
the last PRSC in the series. These objectives are usually selected among the development
objectives defined by the Government as part of its development strategy. The PRSC series also
defines a set of development outcome indicators, which help monitor progress towards the
objectives. For each indicator, the first PRSC in the series defines the baseline and sets the targets
expected to be reached after program completion.1

3.       One key objective of this report is to compare the 2006 targets set at the beginning of
2004 during PRSC-1 preparation to the realized values in 2006 after PRSC-3 was completed. The
report also seeks to explain the differences between targets and realized values when they arise.

4.       Prior Actions, Triggers and Benchmarks: In order to reach development objectives and
related development outcome targets, the Government is expected to adopt a number of policy
actions during program implementation. Following a programmatic approach,2 each PRSC of the
series supports a subset of policy actions which include:

         · prior actions, which have been completed prior to Board presentation of each PRSC,3

         · triggers, whose completion during the following year represents sufficient condition
             for IDA to move to the next operation, and

         · benchmarks, whose completion during the following year may also be taken into
             account by IDA in order to move to the next operation.

5.       Results: The PRSC series also defines a number of result indicators to monitor the
implementation of triggers and benchmarks. These indicators are such that there is a direct causal
relationship between triggers and benchmarks on one side, and the corresponding results on the




1For instance, one development objective of Madagascar's PRSC series was to improve primary education.
The primary school net enrollment rate was selected as a development outcome indicator, and the PRSC
target was to increase primary school net enrollment rate from 82 percent in 2003 (the baseline year when
PRSC-1 was designed) to 88 percent in 2006 (after implementation of PRSC-3).

2A programmatic approach is an approach where one operation defines the rules to move to the next.

3To be precise, "prior actions" are those which are completed "prior" to credit effectiveness. For example,
a PRSC can be presented to the Board but become effective only after some "prior conditions" are met.

other side. For each result indicator, the first PRSC in the series defines the baseline, a target
expected to be reached after program completion and annual intermediary targets.4

6.       Policy matrix: Each PRSC includes a policy matrix which, in each policy area,
summarizes the prior actions supported by the PRSC, the triggers and benchmarks which will be
evaluated in order to move to the next PRSC, and the expected results.

7.       The rest of this document is structured as follows. Section 1 summarizes program context,
development objectives and design. Section 2 analyzes the implementation of the policy actions
and achievement of expected results. Section 3 is an assessment of development outcomes.
Section 4 assesses the risk of a reversal in the development outcomes and rates it. Section 5
assesses the Bank's and the borrower's performances. Based on the previous sections, Section 6
reports on some lessons learned.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

8.       Section 1.1 describes the country's context at the time of appraisal of the PRSC-1 and
provides the rationale for Bank assistance. Section 1.2 describes the program's development
objectives and the key development outcome indicators. Section 1.3 describes any change made
to development objectives and key development outcome indicators during PRSC implementation,
and explains the rationale for the change. Section 1.4 describes the original policy areas supported
by the PRSCs. Section 1.5 describes other significant changes to the PRSC series including
change in design, schedule or funding.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

9.       In the past decades, Madagascar's economic performance has not been consistent over
time: periods of reforms and growth have alternated with economic and political crises.


10.      The year 1997 marked the beginning of private sector-led growth and efforts to integrate
Madagascar in the world economy. The government undertook several reforms, although rather
hesitantly. These reforms, coupled with the preferential trade agreement of Africa Growth
Opportunity Act (AGOA), resulted in an increase in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), a surge in
exports, and sustained growth rate.



4For example, if a trigger consists in hiring 10,000 new teachers at primary level, the number of teachers at
primary level could be used as a result indicator to monitor the implementation of the trigger.




                                                      8

11.      At the beginning of 2002, Madagascar's progress was halted by a deep political crisis as
presidential elections were contested. As mediation efforts failed, there were practically two
different governments in place. Although the crisis was short lived, its impact was considerable:
per capita GDP declined by over 15 percent, and the incidence of poverty increased. The political
crisis ended six months later when President Ravalomanana's government was recognized
internationally. The new government embarked on many reforms, including those aiming at
restoring private sector confidence.


12.      In 2003, the economy rebounded. Real GDP growth reached 9.8 percent while inflation
remained low. The Government also formulated a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
which was endorsed by the Boards of the Bank and the IMF in November 2003. The overall
objective of the PRSP was to generate rapid and sustainable growth to reduce poverty by half in
ten years or to 34.2 percent by 2013. At the beginning of 2004 when PRSC-1 was under
preparation, the Government had already prepared the First Progress Report for the first six
months of implementation of the PRSP (July-December 2003). This report concluded that the
implementation of the PRSP was proceeding well.


13.      It became soon clear that the new government was engaged and decisive. The Bank and
other donors decided to strengthen their support to the new authorities, as the restored optimism
about the future of the economy created a window of opportunity which had not been observed
since Madagascar's independence in 1960. Responding to Government's demand for an increase
in IDA's support channeled through the Budget, the Bank decided to move to programmatic
budget support and initiated a series of three annual single tranche PRSCs. The objective of these
credits was to support the implementation of the PRSP over the period 2004-06. This report will
show that this move may have been too ambitious as the initial amounts channeled under the form
of budget support may have been too high to absorb.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

14.      The PRSP formulated by the Government of Madagascar in 2003 included three strategic
pillars to improve governance, promote broad-based growth and provide human and material
security. It also included a cross-cutting monitoring and evaluation pillar.


15.      The original program development objectives supported by the program were as follows:5


     · Overall objectives:
              o maintain a stable macroeconomic environment, and
              o reduce poverty through strong, sustainable and equitable economic growth.




5PRSC-1included baselines, targets and policy actions related to the broad-based growth pillar. However,
the broad-based growth was left to be supported by investment operations and advisory activities. PRSC-2
and PRSC-3 were streamlined to only include the areas supported by the PRSCs, which did not include the
growth pillar.




                                                   9

    · Governance:
           o improve public expenditure management,
           o fight corruption,
           o decentralize,
           o reform customs, and
           o support the justice system.

    · Human and material security:
           o Education: improve service delivery and particularly increase completion of
               primary education,
           o Health: improve service delivery,
           o Nutrition: reduce malnutrition, and
           o Water supply and sanitation: improve service delivery.

    · Monitoring and evaluation:
           o Improve the PRSP monitoring and evaluation system.

16.    Corresponding to these development objectives, PRSC-1 defines the following
development outcome indicators:


    · Overall objectives:
           o poverty rate.

    · Governance:
           o Budget management benchmarks as defined in the HIPC AAP,
           o Budget (2004-06) includes proper planning and monitoring for public spending
               in high poverty relevant areas, and
           o Government has introduced and published service delivery standards in key
               services with a large public-private interface (especially customs, land titling,
               primary education, courts, etc.).

    · Human and material security:
           o Primary net enrollment rate
           o Primary school completion rate,
           o Number of textbooks per primary school student,
           o HIV prevalence rate in sex workers,
           o DPT3 vaccination rate of children below one year,
           o Skilled attendance at birth in Centre de Santé de Base (CSB) and Centre
               Hospitalier de District (CHD1),
           o Consultation rate for treatment in CSB,
           o Child underweight rate (MDG indicator),
           o Chronic malnutrition rate (stunting), and
           o Percentage of people with access to safe drinking water.




                                              10

17.    PRSC-1 shows the status of the indicators in 2003 (baseline), expected targets in 2006,
source of data and collection frequency. The indicators were monitored during the
implementation of the program (see Annex 1).6

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

18.    The original program development objectives remained unchanged with the exception of
the chronic malnutrition indicator which was dropped from PRSC-2 and PRSC-3. This decision
was not documented.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

19.    In order to reach the original program development objectives described in Section 1.2,
the PRSC series supported the following policy areas:


· Governance:
       o improve public expenditure management by: (i) elaborating and implementing an
            action plan to improve public finance management, (ii) enhancing budget formulation,
            (iii) improving budget execution, (iv) improving the quality of public procurement,
            (v) strengthening controls on public finance management, and (vi) enhancing
            accountability and transparency of budget execution,
       o fight corruption by putting in place adequate regulatory and institutional anti-
            mechanisms,
       o decentralize by: (i) improving budgetary allocation to the communes, (ii) improving
            commune's own revenue base, (iii) strengthening capacity of the communes to
            deliver public services, and (iv) strengthening inter-communal planning and
            coordination mechanisms,
       o reform customs by: (i) developing a prioritized reform program, and (ii) increasing
            human resources and technical capacity in customs services, and
       o support the justice system by developing a prioritized reform program.

· Human and material security:
       o Education: improve service delivery and particularly increase completion of primary
            education by: (i) improving management and accountability at the level of the
            Ministry of Education, (ii) improving capacity and quality of education and training
            services delivered to communities, (iii) strengthening private-public partnership, and
            (iv) improving and linking to economic and social priorities the quality and relevance
            of post-primary education and training services.
       o Health: improve service delivery by: (i) updating the health strategy, (ii) improving
            cost recovery, (iii) enhancing management of human resources, (iv) improving
            planning and budgeting at national and sub-national levels, (v) improving financial
            management, procurement and audit, (vi) improving maintenance of building and
            equipment, and (vii) strengthening the sector M&E system.
       o Nutrition: reduce malnutrition by: (i) strengthening institutions, and (ii) modifying
            cost recovery policies to allow free access to micronutrients.



6See Table 6 in the Project Appraisal Document of PRSC-1 and Table 8 in the Project Appraisal
Documents of PRSC-2 and in that of PRSC-3.




                                                11

          o Water supply and sanitation: improve service delivery by: (i) developing a sector-
              wide approach through institutional strengthening, improved sector coordination,
              execution and review of the sector "Medium-Term Expenditure Framework 2005-07",
              (ii) formulating, adopting and implementing a national strategy to deliver water and
              sanitation in rural areas, and (iii) strengthening the sector M&E system.

· Monitoring and evaluation:
          o Improve the PRSP monitoring and evaluation system by: (i) developing a plan to
              strengthen the monitoring and evaluation system, (ii) elaborating a data collection
              system, (iii) strengthening coordination among donors.

1.5 Other Significant Changes

20.       Funding allocations for the PRSCs were revised downward substantially. PRSC-1
approved in July 2004 amounted to US$125 million. The amount corresponded to the high-case
lending scenario outlined in the FY04-06 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) dated October 2003
(World Bank, 2003). This high-case scenario programmed US$115 million for PRSC-2.
                         7

However, the amounts under PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 were revised downward: PRSC-2 amounted to
US$80 million while PRSC-3 amounted to US$40 million (Section 3.1 provides explanation).8

2. Program Implementation: Policy Actions and Results

21.       Section 2.1 describes the prior actions included in each PRSC and compares the triggers
defined in each operation to the prior actions adopted in the next operation. It also compares the
results expected for 2006 at the time of preparation of PRSC-1 to the results actually reached in
2006. Section 2.2 outlines the major factors which affected implementation. Section 2.3 describes
the design, implementation and utilization of the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system.
Section 2.4 describes the expected next phase and follow-up operations.

2.1 Program Performance

22.       PRSCs are designed so that the triggers described in one operation are expected to
become the prior actions in the next operation. Consequently, the fact that the prior actions in one
operation do not match the triggers outlined in the previous operation may indicate issues related
to the implementation of the reform program. Annex 2 compares the triggers for PRSC-2 (as
included in PRSC-1) to the prior actions in PRSC-2. Similarly, Annex 3 compares the triggers for




7Triggers to move to the high-case scenario are (i) progressive implementation of the expenditure
management reform program, (ii) implementation of the recommendations of the CPAR and CFAA, (iii)
higher level of road and irrigation maintenance, (iv) higher delivery of health and education services, (v)
implementation of the Education for All (EFA) program, and (vi) reduced leakages of public funds for
social sectors. See Annex VI of PRSC-1 Project Appraisal Document (World Bank, 2004, p.96).

8Starting in 2007, Madagascar also benefited from about US$30 million of debt relief under the HIPC
initiative.

PRSC-3 (as included in PRSC-2) to the prior actions in PRSC-3. Finally, Table 1 describes the
prior actions included in each PRSC.9

23.      Based on Table 1 and Annexes 2 and 3, the program performance in the policy areas
supported by the program has been as follows:


· Governance: Program performance was satisfactory: the program achieved good progress
    toward all major expected results and no major shortcoming was identified.

         o Overall framework: A Priority Action Plan (PAP) for 2004 for public financial
              management reforms was approved by Cabinet and its implementation had started
              when PRSC-1 was approved (Prior action in PRSC-1). A Priority Action Plan for
              2005 was also adopted and satisfactory implemented in 2005 (Prior action in PRSC-
              3). These action-plans included actions in the areas of budget formulation, execution,
              procurement and accountability (see below). The Cellule de Suivi et de Coordination
              des Réformes des Finances Publiques was established in the Ministry of Finance to
              coordinate, monitor and evaluate public financial management reforms.

         o Budget formulation: Budget formulation improved during program implementation
              (2004-06), albeit at a slower pace than originally planned.

                       During the time of implementation of the PRSCs, the Budget has become
                       more in line with strategic priorities of the PRSP, with increased allocations
                       to program that are effective in reducing poverty (an expected result).
                       Allocations in the 2004 Budget were better aligned to the PRSP strategic
                       priorities, with increased allocation to the Ministries of Education, Health
                       and Transport (Prior action in PRSC-1). The 2005 Budget allocated a greater
                       share of resources to the PRSP priority sectors and adequate funding was
                       allocated to priority sectors like education, health and nutrition (Prior action
                       in PRSC-2). The 2006 Budget continued allocating adequate resources to
                       PRSP priority sectors (Prior action in PRSC-3).

                       The budget preparation process has been adjusted to allow sector ministries
                       to increase their participation in the budget process (an expected result).10
                       However, the elaboration and application of a new calendar for budget
                       preparation took longer than expected: the new calendar was developed in
                       2006 and is now being applied for the first time during preparation of the
                       2008 Budget.

                       The budget has been linked to the political priorities through the introduction
                       and implementation of a budget de programmes within a very ambitious
                       agenda. The Loi Organique sur les Lois de Finances (LOLF) which




9Note that, by design of the PRSC series, all "prior actions" are "completed," so that the last column of
Table 1 is somewhat redundant.

10 Typically, one week separated the Ministry of Finance's initial communication of the proposed Budget
allocations to the sectoral ministries and the finalization of these allocations ­ leaving little time for sectoral
inputs and budget arbitrage.




                                                       13

                      introduced the budget de programmes was adopted in 2004. Its
                      implementation was ambitious and started in 2005.

                      All expenditures funded from external sources have been integrated into the
                      Budget. As a result, the budget has become comprehensive and now includes
                      all donor-funding (an expected result).

         o Budget execution: Budget execution improved during program implementation
             (2004-06). The Budget execution rate increased from 80 percent in 2003 to about 95
             percent in 2006, exceeding the expected result of 90 percent.11

                      Measures have been adopted to shorten the administrative circuit for
                      expenditures. The functions of gestionnaire de crédit and sous-ordonnateurs
                      des dépenses publiques have been merged into the newly created function of
                      ordonnateurs secondaires des dépenses publiques (Prior action in PRSC-1).
                      Simultaneously, the new function of gestionnaire d'activités has also been
                      created. The recent Public Expenditure Review (PER) and Public
                      Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment confirm that
                      the expenditure processes have been successfully streamlined.12

                      Measures have also been taken to modernize the Treasury. An independent
                      audit of the Treasury was conducted in 2003 and an action plan was prepared.
                      Recommendations of the audit were validated (Prior action in PRSC-1) and
                      adopted by Cabinet before being progressively implemented. The Treasury
                      prepared the final accounts for 2003 (Prior action in PRSC-2). An integrated
                      financial management system was progressively introduced, albeit at a
                      slower pace than originally anticipated. Based on this system, monthly
                      accounts were produced by the 15th of the following month by mid-2005 in
                      Tamatave (Prior action in PRSC-2). Delays in the implementation of the
                      system resulted in dropping the timely production of monthly accounts from
                      PRSC-2 and including it in PRSC-3. The new financial management system
                      has led to the completion of all expected results: cash flow management has
                      become more transparent and predictable, the operational efficiency of the
                      Treasury has improved and the Treasury has been able to provide more
                      timely and accurate information.

         o Accountability: Actions have been taken to strengthen both internal and external
             controls.

                      The Brigade du Trésor responsible for controlling the postes comptables was
                      converted into a Direction (Prior action in PRSC-1) which gave it more clout
                      and authority to act.13 Both the PER and the PEFA assessment confirm that
                      internal controls have been significantly strengthened.




11 Note that this Budget execution rate refers to the ratio of actual expenditures to revised budget
allocations. The budgets are typically revised at the beginning of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year which
reduced the likelihood of large deviations.

12See World Bank, 2007c.

13Note that the Brigade du Trésor does not control the work done by the ordonnateurs. As such, the
Brigade du Trésor is not responsible for controlling whether expenditures are adequate or not. In the


                                                     14

                      An Inspection Générale des Finances was established in 2004 (Prior action
                      in PRSC-1) whose main objective was to empower the Minister of Finance to
                      audit public finance.14

                      The Auditor General (Chambre des Comptes) has progressively cleared the
                      backlog of audited Government accounts, although at a slower rate than
                      PRSC-1 had anticipated. The examination by the Auditor General of the draft
                      budget execution laws (Loi de Règlement) for 2002 and 2003, a trigger for
                      PRSC-2, was not met. The trigger was initially weakened to "submission to"
                      instead of "examination by" and was eventually dropped due to additional
                      delays. However, the backlog has progressively been cleared.15

        o Procurement: There has been considerable progress on procurement. A new public
             procurement code was submitted to Parliament (Prior action in PRSC-1) and further
             adopted in July 2004. An oversight institution (Autorité de Régulation des Marchés
             Publics ­ ARMP) was created in mid-2005 (Prior action in PRSC-2) and became
             operational with some delays (see Annex 3). The "issuance by Cabinet of
             implementing rules and regulations for the new procurement code", which was
             initially expected to be a prior action in PRSC-2, became a prior action in PRSC-3.
             The regulatory framework has been fully operational since end-2006 with the
             enactment of the procurement code and the validation of the standard bidding
             documents and the application decrees. There has been progress to operationalize
             procurement management units in key ministries (Prior action in PRSC-3).

        o Anti-Corruption: There has also been considerable progress in the fight against
             corruption. The decree creating the Conseil Supérieur de Lutte Contre la Corruption
             (CSLCC) was adopted in September 2002. The CSLCC became functional in July
             2003. An anti-corruption law was adopted in September 2004 which created the
             Independent Anti-Corruption Agency (BIANCO) in charge of investigation,
             prevention and education. The BIANCO was fully operational by 2005 and started to
             open branch offices in 2006. It has initiated a large number of investigations leading
             to several indictments. Audits of targeted public services and large investment
             projects have been conducted. A standard "Probité" -- certifying the probity of
             participating agencies -- has been introduced. A survey on perception of corruption
             was conducted in 2006. Finally, an anti-money laundering law and corresponding
             decrees were adopted in 2004 and 2005, respectively.

        o Decentralization: Progress toward decentralization has not taken place as originally
             anticipated. The review of the transfer system and formula used to allocate fiscal
             resources to the communes (supported by the PRSCs and expected to be completed



absence of a functioning Inspection Générale des Finances, the adequacy of public expenditure
(opportunité de la dépense publique) is under the control of the Inspection Générale de l'Etat.

14Public expenditures are currently audited by the Inspection Générale de l'Etat which depends on the
Presidency and acts upon request from the President.

15La Loi de Règlement in year n is supposed to be presented to Parliament during the first session of year
(n+2). The 2004 draft budget execution law was submitted to Parliament in 2006 (although it still has not
been adopted as of mid-2007). The 2005 draft budget execution law is under preparation while the 2006
draft budget execution law is expected to be submitted to Parliament within the legal timeframe.

              by mid-2004) initially expected to be completed by end-2004 has not been completed
              as of mid-2007. The development and dissemination of regulations and tools for
              autonomous tax collection (supported by the PRSC series and expected to be
              completed by mid-2005) had not been completed as of mid-2007. The establishment
              of the Fonds Local de Development (FLD) to finance investments at commune level
              (supported by the PRSC series and expected to be completed by mid-2005) is
              expected to be operational in 2008. The corresponding expected results have not been
              met: the budgetary allocations to the communes have not increased in real terms,16
              the revenue base of the communes has not improved, while there is little evidence
              that the capacity of the communes to deliver services has improved.

          o Customs: There has been progress to reform customs. An action plan for custom
              reform was adopted (Prior action in PRSC-2) and was satisfactorily implemented
              (Prior action in PRSC-3). The quality of customs service has considerably improved
              (an expected result).

          o Justice: Progress to reform the judiciary system has been satisfactory. An action
              plan to reduce corruption and increase confidence that the legal and regulatory
              reforms are enforced was adopted (Prior action in PRSC-1). Over the PSRC period,
              the backlog of pending court cases has been significantly reduced with support under
              the Governance and Institutional Development Project.

· Human and material security

          o Education: The implementation of the national Education For All (EFA) initiative
              has been impressive. Satisfactory implementation of EFA was a prior action in each
              PRSC. PRSC-1 lists a range of quantifiable indicators for the sector, which were all
              monitored during the joint EFA missions to assess the implementation of the EFA
              program.17

          o Health: Progress in health was mixed. PRSC-1 did not include any prior action in
              health. However, PRSC-1 included "updating the health sector strategy" and
              "introducing a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework for the sector" as two triggers
              for PRSC-2. Both triggers were fully implemented and, consequently, became prior
              actions in PRSC-2. PRSC-3 did not include any prior action related to health. PRSC-
              1 included six expected results in health, but only one (District Development Plan
              available in all districts) was quantified. However, PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 did develop
              a set of results which were duly monitored.

          o Nutrition: There has been good progress regarding nutrition. The Government
              validated the National Nutrition Policy (Prior action in PRSC-1) and created a
              National Council for Nutrition and its supporting secretariat (Office National de
              Nutrition) in November 2004 (Prior actions in PRSC-2). PRSC-3 did not include any
              prior action related to nutrition. The expected result that 80 percent of children under
              five receive vitamin A twice-a-year by the end of the program was achieved. A



16The program asked for an increase in the allocations to communes but did not specify whether this
increase was in nominal or real terms. In fact, during the period under review, allocations to communes
slightly increased in nominal terms but decreased in real terms.

             number of quantifiable indicators were monitored. Data frequency depend upon
             Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) which are typically conducted every five
             years.18

         o Water and sanitation: There has been some progress in water and sanitation.
             PRSC-1 did not include any prior action related to water. However, PRSC-1 included
             "staffing and equipping the Directorate of Water and Sanitation in Antananarivo and
             the six decentralized departments in the provinces to implement the "Water and
             Sanitation for All" program as a trigger for PRSC-2. There were delays in the
             implementation of the program and the corresponding prior actions were watered
             down in PRSC-2. The Ministry and its main partners started the implementation of
             the recommendations of the 2005 sector review in the 2006-08 program budget (Prior
             action in PRSC-3). PRSC-1 included nine expected results in water and sanitation, of
             which three were quantified and one ("percentage of rural population with access to
             safe" water) was reported, along with other indicators, in annexes to PRSC-2 and
             PRSC-3.

24.      As a summary, program performance in governance has been satisfactory: the program
achieved good progress toward all major expected results and no major shortcoming was
identified. Budget formulation improved during program implementation, albeit at a slower pace
than originally planned. Budget execution also improved. Actions were taken to strengthen both
internal and external controls. There has been considerable progress regarding procurement and
in the fight against corruption while progress under customs and regarding the judiciary went well.
However, progress toward decentralization has not taken place as initially anticipated.

25.      Regarding human and material security, program performance has also been satisfactory.
The implementation of the National Education for All (EFA) initiative remained on track during
program implementation, nutrition improved and there was some progress regarding water and
sanitation. Progress regarding the health sector has been mixed.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

26.     Major factors which positively affected the implementation of the program may have
been as follows:

    · Government ownership: There is strong government ownership of the PRSP program,
        which the PRSC series seeks to support, and the government is strongly committed to
        follow through with related actions. The current President was elected on a platform for
        better governance, and the PRSCs aim at improving key elements in this area. In 2005,
        the Government introduced a performance management system for all ministries, which
        may have contributed to PRSCs implementation.

    · Country dialogue: There is an active and open policy dialogue between Government, the
        Bank and other donors in the areas supported by the PRSCs.

    · Donor harmonization: Donor cooperation around the PRSP is generally strong and
        productive. A partnership agreement (Cadre de Partenariat) between the Government
        and key budget support donors (European Union, France, African Development Bank and
        the World Bank) has been created and provides a framework for a multi-sector approach
        to budgetary support. Starting in 2004, the budget support donors have organized joint
        supervisions missions to be held twice a year with the objective of harmonizing donors'
        assistance and reducing transactions costs for the Government. A donor-group on
        education has been created to lead the dialogue with Government for the implementation
        of the EFA program. A similar approach is being considered in the health sector. The fact




                                                     19

        that there are relatively few donors in Madagascar may also facilitate better cooperation
        and harmonization.

   · Analytical activities: The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA, FY03),
        the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR, FY03) and the Public Expenditure
        Review (PER, FY05) conducted by the Bank have provided the analytical underpinnings
        for the public reform agenda of the Government and Bank's support. During program
        implementation, the Government monitored progress in the implementation of its public
        expenditure reform program as requested under the HIPC Public Expenditure Assessment
        and Action Plan. In addition, Madagascar was a pilot country for the Public Expenditure
        and Financial Accountability (PEFA) program, which aimed at strengthening public
        sector management, including the implementation of a performance measurement
        framework. Strategy and costing of the EFA initiative were updated to take into account
        higher than expected enrollment rate and a plan was submitted by Madagascar to the Fast
        Track Initiative in May 2005. A Health Sector Note finalized in 2005 provided important
        inputs to design the health component of the PRSCs.

   · Advisory activities: According to many people interviewed in the field, the US$30
        million IDA-financed Governance and Institutional Development Project (PGDI)
        approved in November 2003 has been a critical element in the implementation of the
        PRSCs. This project, which has been extended to end-2006, provides flexible resources
        including technical assistance and capacity building to the Government in the
        implementation of the PRSCs. A follow-up operation is under preparation.


27.     Major factors which negatively affected the implementation of the program may have
been as follows:

   · Timing of PRSC series: The shift to budget support may have been premature. The
        Bank may have decided to move to programmatic lending at a time when Madagascar's
        own financial management systems -- including budget formulation, execution, controls,
        monitoring, audit and procurement ­ may not have been ready for this shift. In addition,
        budget support was implemented at the time when the country decided to switch to
        program budgeting ­ which may have compounded implementation difficulties.

   · Timing of each PRSC: The preparation of each PRSC could have been better aligned
        with the Government's own budget cycle, which runs from January 1 to December 31.
        The three PRSCs were approved in July. Funds were available shortly afterwards except
        for PRSC-3 whose proceeds were released during the fourth quarter of 2006, due to
        delays related to the IMF program. This timing makes it difficult to align the
        disbursements to the budget cycle of government.

   · Amount: The FY04-06 CAS dated October 2003 foresaw a transition to programmatic
        lending under both the base-case and high-case scenarios.19 The PAD of PRSC-1 justified
        the move to the high-case scenario.20 This led to a large and rapid shift from project
        lending toward budget support: PRSC-1 represented half of the total IDA lending in

        FY05 (US$125 million out of total allocation of US$250 million). Many people
        interviewed in the field mentioned that the country may have been ill-prepared to such a
        rapid shift. Although PRSCs permit more resources to be transferred rapidly, they do not
        provide assurance that incremental budget resources are allocated to "substitute" for a
        decline in project financing, nor that public resources are allocated as planned or reach
        intended beneficiaries. In the end, thin capacities in ministries coupled with overall
        revenue shortfalls, external shocks, and a weak cash management system may have made
        it challenging to get resources to "front-line" activities.

    · Expectations: The new leadership that came to power at the end of Madagascar's
        political crisis led to a strong optimism about the future of the country. While earlier
        governments were often ambiguous and hesitant in their commitment to reform, the
        present government is much more engaged and decisive. Nonetheless, the country's
        capacity remains fragile and delays in the implementation of some reforms may have
        been due in part to overly optimistic expectations at design stage. For example, the
        introduction of an integrated financial management system and procurement reforms take
        typically more time than what was originally envisaged in the program.

    · Management of change: Challenges in the implementation of the public sector reform
        program are related to change management problems, in particular confusing and
        sometimes contradictory rules and regulations which make it difficult for the ministries to
        adequately comprehend and thus implement reforms. The breadth of the reform program
        and changes in the administrative machinery may have also exacerbated the overall
        absorptive capacity of the government to implement reforms.

    · External factors: The external environment has been relatively unfavorable to
        Madagascar during the 2004-06 PRSCs implementation period. Natural disasters (two
        back-to-back cyclones hit Madagascar in 2004 causing severe damage) and increasing
        cost of imported petroleum, on which the economy is wholly dependent, led the
        Government to curtail public expenditures in order to maintain macroeconomic stability.
        Although the Government attempted to limit cuts in priority sectors, unpredictability of
        revenues and stop-and-go cycles affected public good delivery in all sectors. In 2005, a
        structural and financial crisis in the energy parastatal JIRAMA also led to un-
        programmed budgetary outlays. In 2006, the macroeconomic environment was more
        favorable.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

28.     Background: With the exception of household surveys data which are of reasonable
quality, the M&E system remained weak at the beginning of program implementation. The
PRSCs benefited from household surveys which provided data to prepare poverty estimates and
poverty reports. However, as noted in the PAD of PRSC-1, the Government's M&E system
remained weak in 2004.21 Institutional responsibilities were not clearly defined. The Secrétariat
Technique à l'Ajustement (STA) did not have adequate capacity to coordinate the technical
aspects of PRSP preparation and monitoring. Capacity to monitor the implementation of the
PRSP also needed to be strengthened at the sector ministry level. The Institute of Statistics

resources, technical expertise and analytical capacity. The Center for Economic Research and
Studies (CREAM), a research center recently created in MEFB, was also weak.


29.      Design: Improving the M&E system was a development objective for the PRSCs
(Section 1.2). In order to reach this objective, the PRSCs supported the following actions:


    · development of a plan to strengthen the M&E system including (i) strengthening the
         PRSP framework in order to link policies, programs and projects to outputs and
         development outcomes, (ii) defining the legal and institutional framework for M&E, (iii)
         elaborating and implementing a capacity building plan for SAT, INSTAT, and key sector
         ministries, (iv) further elaborating the Statistical Master Plan for INSTAT, and (v)
         adopting policies to ensure public access to information,

    · elaboration of a data collection system which includes: (i) a new census of the population
         (the last available census was conducted in 1993), (ii) better planning of surveys (surveys
         were ad-hoc), (iii) needs assessment to strengthen administrative data systems in line
         ministries followed by the elaboration of action plans and their implementation, (iv)
         technical assistance to the 2004 Household Survey including a module on vulnerability
         (Enquête Prioritaire auprès des Ménages - EPM), and (v) improvement in collecting
         price information in provinces,

    · strengthening coordination among donors including: (i) establishment of a working group
         to support the Government in the preparation of the M&E action plan including the
         Statistical Master Plan, (ii) harmonization of donor approach, and (iii) development of a
         financing plan to support the implementation of the M&E action plan.

30.      Implementation: With the notable exception of household surveys which are held and
analyzed regularly, progress toward the implementation of the M&E system has been slow. There
is progress in areas like education where donors have been active (see Section 2.2). However, the
Government is still in the process of developing the PRSP framework and designing the legal and
institutional framework for M&E. With the exception of a few ministries and programs,
monitoring indicator systems remain weak. The INSTAT also remains weak. Delays in M&E
implementation are due to a combination of overly optimistic expectations, implementation costs,
capacity constraints and, possibly, a low level of political priority.


31.      Utilization: Household surveys are available and capacity exists to process and prepare
poverty estimates and poverty report. Also, the EFA program has developed a fully functioning
M&E system in education. However, available indicators need to be used with caution. First,
there are too many indicators with questionable data quality. For example, the PRSP has about
one thousand indicators and actions. Second, the indicators are often inconsistent through time
and across agencies, while there are constant shifts in their choice.22 Third, the last population
census took place in 1993 making the quality of population-based indicators questionable.23




22The 2006 Country Assistance Evaluation provides examples (CAE, pp. 6-7).

23For example, official statistics claim a net primary enrollment rate of 98 percent -- which does not
correspond to outcomes from household surveys or to observations in the field that hint to lower attendance


                                                  22

Fourth, the introduction and use of quantitative targets by the new administration may have
produced an incentive to inflate results.


2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

32.      The next phase consists of a new series of three PRSCs. Each PRSC is expected to
amount to US$40 million to be disbursed in a single tranche based on prior actions. This new
series is consistent with the recent CAS discussed at the Board on April 3, 2007. The new series
is expected to support the implementation of the Government's poverty reduction strategy as laid
out in the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP). The objective of the MAP is to promote rapid and
sustainable development over the next five years in line with the Government's national vision
document (Madagascar Naturally) and the U.N. Millennium Development Goals. The new PRSC
series seeks to strengthen and deepen the reforms initiated under PRSC 1-3 in the areas of
governance, budget management and service delivery.

3. Assessment of Development Outcomes

33.      This Section assesses the program's development outcomes. Section 3.1 assesses the
relevance of the development objectives and the design and implementation of the operation in
light of current country and global priorities, and Bank's assistance strategy. Section 3.2 assesses
the achievement of the program development objectives (as measured by the achievement of the
development outcomes) and includes brief discussions of causality between the policy actions
supported by the operations and the development outcomes. Section 3.3 rates the achievement of
the development outcomes and justifies the rating.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

34.      Objectives: The program development objectives described in Section 1.2 portray high
overall relevance. The objectives were consistent with Madagascar's development priorities as
formulated in the Government's poverty reduction strategy. The objectives were also consistent
with the Bank's assistance strategy. The FY04-06 CAS dated October 2003 envisaged a move
towards PRSCs. The series of PRSCs reflected proper diagnosis that improvement in public
financial management -- an area that had been relatively neglected in previous Bank's assistance -
- and human development were critical elements in the country's development strategy. The first
operation of the series (PRSC-1), approved in July 2004 for a total amount of US$125 million
(US$37 million credit and US$88 million grant), supported the implementation of policy actions
in the areas of governance and human development. Both the second operation (PRSC-2, US$80
million credit approved in July 2005) and the third operation (PRSC-3, US$40 million credit
approved in July 2006) consolidated and deepened support for policy and institutional reforms in
the same areas of governance and human development commenced under PRSC-1.


35.      Design: The selection of key development outcome indicators was appropriate. PRSC-1
rightly selected the HIPC indicators to monitor progress related to budget management. The




rates. However, data from both the household surveys and administrative data show the same trend of
significant increase in enrollments.




                                                 23

HIPC indicators were later changed to the PEFA indicators. The other two indicators under
governance were not quantified.24


36.      Implementation: Implementation of the development outcome indicators was
appropriate although changes related to the indicators were not systematically documented.
Although the shift from the HIPC to the PEFA indicators was appropriate, it could have been
better documented in PRSC documents.25 Some indicators under the "governance" pillar were not
quantified but were closely monitored in the 2007 PER and the 2006 PEFA assessment. This
could also have been documented in the PRSCs files. It could also have been useful to document
the reason why chronic malnutrition was dropped from the set of indicators in PRSC-2 and
PRSC-3.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

37.      The objective of this section is to compare targets and realized development outcomes
and to explain differences when they occur. Targets and realized outcomes may differ for the
following reasons: (i) the authorities did not take the required policy actions, (ii) the authorities
did take the required policy actions but the linkage between policy actions and targets was not
correctly established, or (iii) the authorities did take the required policy actions and the linkage
between policy actions and targets was correctly established but targets were not reached because
of the occurrence of some exogenous factors, like a cyclone for example.


38.      Based on Table 2 -- which summarizes the 2003 status of the development indicators and
their expected and realized outcomes in 2006 -- achievement of the program development
objectives has been as follows:


     · Overall objectives:
                o Poverty rate: The poverty target of 68 percent in 2006 has been reached. Under
                    the program, poverty was expected to decline from 73 percent in 2003 to 68
                    percent in 2006. The poverty rate was 69 percent in 2005 while the INSTAT has
                    projected a poverty rate of 68 percent in 2006.

     · Governance:
                o Budget management benchmarks: Progress toward the target has been
                    limited. In 2003, Madagascar met only 3 out of 15 HIPC budget management
                    benchmarks. The country was expected to meet at least 10 benchmarks by 2006.
                    In 2005, the country had met 6 out of 16 HIPC benchmarks. The 2006 PEFA
                    assessment and the 2007 PER do show an improvement of performance in
                    budget management between 2005 and 2006.




24These indicators are "Budget (2004-06) includes proper planning and monitoring for public spending in
high poverty relevant area" and "Government has introduced and published service delivery standards in
key services with a large- public-private interface (especially customs, land titling, primary education,
courts, etc.)." (see Table 2).

25The 2006 PEFA assessment has an unofficial table comparing HIPC and PEFA indicators.




                                                   24

    o Budget (2004-06) includes proper planning and monitoring for public
       spending in high poverty relevant areas: The objective has been fully met. The
       target was to "increase allocation of public resources in line with strategic
       objectives of the PRSC." Both the 2004 and 2005 Budgets allocated greater
       share of resources to the PRSP priority sectors and the 2006 Budget allocated
       adequate resources to these sectors. It could have been useful to quantify both
       the baseline in 2003 and the target for 2006.

    o Government has introduced and published service delivery standards in
       key services with a large public-private interface (especially customs, land
       titling, primary education, courts, etc.). It is difficult to assess whether this
       objective has been reached. Indeed, while the PRSC-3 PAD (p. 23) mentions
       that "implementation of service delivery standards in justice and education
       commences," baseline and target were not quantified which makes it difficult to
       assess whether this objective has been reached.

· Human and material security:
    o Primary net enrollment rate. The target has almost been met. The objective
       was for primary net enrollment rate to increase by 6 percentage points from 82
       percent in 2003 (baseline) to 88 percent in 2006. In the end, primary net
       enrollment rate increased by 4 percentage points from 93 percent in 2003
       (revised baseline) to 97 percent in 2006.

    o Primary school completion rate. The target has almost been met. The
       objective was for primary school completion rate to increase by 20 percentage
       points from 38 percent in 2003 (baseline) to 58 percent in 2006. In the end, the
       completion rate increased by 15 percentage points during program
       implementation from 45 percent in 2003 (revised baseline) to 60 percent in 2006.

    o Number of textbooks per primary school student. The target has almost been
       met. The objective was for each primary school student to have one textbook in
       2006 while there was only one book for three students in 2003 (baseline). The
       number of textbooks per primary school student increased to 0.9 in 2006.

    o HIV/AIDS prevalence rate in sex workers. PRSC-1 mentioned that annual
       surveys were expected to be conducted starting in 2005. However, it did not
       provide data on baseline or target. Surveys conducted by USAID in 2005 did
       report a prevalence rate of 1.3 percent among sex workers.

    o DPT3 vaccination rate of children below one year. The target has almost
       been met. The objective was for the DPT3 vaccination rate for children below
       one year of age to increase by 10 percentage points from 55 percent in 2003
       (baseline) to 65 percent in 2006. In the end, the vaccination rate increased by 7
       percentage points from 86 percent in 2003 (revised baseline) to 93 percent in
       2006.

    o Skilled attendance at birth in Centres de Santé de Base (CSBs) and Centres
       Hospitaliers de District (CHD1s). The target has not been met. The objective
       was to increase skilled attendance at birth in CSBs and CHD1s by 7 percentage
       points from 33 percent in 2003 (baseline) to 40 percent in 2006. In fact, skilled
       attendance decreased from 28 percent (revised baseline) to 22 percent in 2006.


                                       25

                   The available PRSC documents did not explain the relationship between policy
                   actions and target which makes it difficult to explain why the target has not been
                   met.

              o Consultation rate for treatment in CSBs. The target has not been met. The
                   objective was to increase the consultation rate for treatment in CSBs by 6
                   percentage points from 38 percent in 2003 (baseline) to 44 percent in 2006. In
                   fact, the consultation rate dropped dramatically from 57 percent (revised
                   baseline) to 32 percent in 2006. For this indicator also, the relationship between
                   policy actions and target was not clearly established, which makes it difficult to
                   explain the deterioration.

              o Child underweight rate. The objective for 2006 has been met in 2004. The
                   objective was for the child underweight rate to decrease by 5 percentage points
                   from 40 percent in 1997 (baseline year) to 35 percent in 2006. In fact, the child
                   underweight rate decreased by 8 percentage points from 43 percent in 1997
                   (revised baseline) to 35 percent in 2004.26

              o Chronic malnutrition rate (stunting). The indicator has been dropped. The
                   objective was for chronic malnutrition to decrease by 8 percentage points from
                   48 percent in 1997 (baseline year) to 40 percent in 2006. In fact, chronic
                   malnutrition declined from 48 percent in 1997 to 44 percent in 2004.

              o Percentage of people with access to safe drinking water. The target has not
                   been met. The objective was for the percentage of people with access to safe
                   drinking water to increase by 7 percentage points from 14 percent in 2003
                   (baseline) to 21 percent in 2006. During program implementation, access to safe
                   water increased by 3 percentage points from 27 percent in 2003 (revised
                   baseline) to 30 percent in 2006. Since the relationship between policy actions
                   and target was not clearly established, the difference between targeted and
                   realized outcome cannot be readily explained.




26This indicator is typically computed every ten years as the outcome of a Demographic and Health
Surveys (DHS), while no reliable and comparable indicators are available during intermediate years. In
Madagascar the last two DHSs were conducted in 1997 and 2004. It is, thus, surprising that the program set
a target for 2006. Also, it is not clear whether the implementation of PRSC-1 in 2004 has been responsible
for the set-back observed over the seven-year period 1997-2004. No indicator is available for later years.

41.      Justification: The program development objective had high overall relevance and the
development outcome indicators were selected appropriately. However, there were moderate
shortcomings in the operation's achievement of its objectives particularly those related to the
health sector. The fact that the same government has remained in place during the 2004-06
implementation period and that progress on policy actions has remained steady during the period
leads us to give each operation the same rating as the series as a whole.

outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized).28

 PRSC-2                    Moderate
 PRSC-3                    Moderate
 PRSC 1-3 Series           Moderate

44.      Justification: The rating is based on the following considerations. First, following the
deep political crisis of 2002, the political situation has stabilized. International recognition of the
new Government of President Ravalomanana in July 2002 ended the political crisis while his
power was significantly consolidated by Parliamentary elections in December 2002, which bodes
well for future political stability. Second, Government ownership and commitment to reform has
improved significantly since 2002. There is strong ownership of the PRSP program and strong
determination to follow through with related actions. Third, the public financial management
system is becoming more robust so that there is better capacity to follow through the
implementation of the PRSP program with associated budgetary provisions. Fourth, the legal
framework has been strengthened. Fifth, macroeconomic management has been satisfactory
despite a relatively unfavorable external environment.29 Political risk and exposure to natural
disasters increasing in number and intensity ­ possibly caused by global warming ­ led us to rate
the overall risk as "moderate." Had the political risk be absent, we may have considered rating the
overall risk as "negligible to low."

29Madagascar is exposed to natural disasters which bring occasional setbacks to living conditions in terms
of food insecurity and damaged infrastructure. Exposure to natural disasters represents an important risk to
development outcomes, although strong coordination among donors helps increase donors' responsiveness
to external shocks and helps mitigate this risk.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

45.      Section 5 assesses Bank and borrower performances. Section 5.1 assesses Bank
performance in ensuring quality at entry and quality of supervision and rates it. Section 5.2
assesses Government performance and rates it.

5.1 Bank Performance

46.      Definition: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of
the operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision toward the
achievement of development outcome.30 Bank performance is rated by assessing two dimensions:
(i) Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry; and (ii) quality of Bank supervision.


(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

47.      Definition: Quality at entry refers to the extent to which the Bank identified, facilitated
preparation of, and appraised the operation such as it was most likely to achieve planned
development outcomes and was consistent with the Bank's fiduciary role. 31


48.      Rating: The first two operations are rated moderately satisfactory while the third
operation is rated satisfactory. As a consequence, Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry
for the series is rated moderately satisfactory.


 Operation                  Rating
 PRSC-1                     Moderately Satisfactory
 PRSC-2                     Moderately Satisfactory (rating from QAG)
 PRSC-3                     Satisfactory
 PRSC 1-3 Series            Moderately Satisfactory

49.      Justification: Qualities at entry of PRSC-1 and PRSC-2 are rated moderately satisfactory
because there were moderate shortcomings in identification, preparation, or appraisal32 These
shortcomings were identified and broadly incorporated into PRSC-3 whose quality at entry is
rated satisfactory. Justification for this rating is as follows. First, although the Bank seized a
window of opportunity and responded positively to Government's demand for an increase in
Budget support, the decision to move to programmatic lending may have been premature while
the amount of budget support transferred under PRSC-1 may have been too large (US$125
million). Although this was a calculated risk, it may have led to too rapid and large a shift from
project lending to budget support for which the country was ill-prepared. Follow-up operations
were scaled down: PRSC-2 was revised downward to US$80 million while PRSC-3 represented
US$40 million. The next phase is expected to consist of a new series of three operations, each for

32Note that the rating for PRSC-2 is consistent with that of the May 2007 Quality at Entry Assessment.

an amount of US$40 million. Second, the policy dialogue around the PRSCs led to an
appreciation of the government position -- which was increasingly incorporated into the program.
For example, although the Bank insisted for the creation of the Inspection Générale des Finances
(IGF) in PRSC-1, it soon realized that its creation may have been problematic and was
appropriately adjusted the policies supported by the PRSCs. In the end, the IGF was not staffed
but internal controls were still strengthened through other means. Third, the preparation of PRSC-
1 may have been too hasty. The team indicated that it was given little time to prepare PRSC-1.
Finally, preparation of the three PRSCs could have been better aligned with the Budget cycle of
government.


(b) Quality of Supervision

50.     Definition: Quality of supervision refers to the extent to which the Bank proactively
identified and resolved threats to the achievements of relevant development outcomes and the
Bank's fiduciary role. 33


51.     Rating: Quality of supervision is rated highly satisfactory for the series and each
individual operation.


 Operation               Rating
 PRSC-1                  Highly satisfactory
 PRSC-2                  Highly satisfactory
 PRSC-3                  Highly satisfactory
 PRSC 1-3 Series         Highly Satisfactory

52.     Justification: The quality of supervision of each operation is rated highly satisfactory
because there was no shortcoming in the proactive identification of opportunities and resolution
of threats. The Bank had a strong presence in the field who did supervision on a day-to-day basis,
along with a HQ-based team which undertook diligent follow-up and supervision. For the
governance agenda, education, nutrition, health and rural water, the field presence was
particularly strong. In addition, the PGDI provided effective technical assistance to support the
implementation of the PRSP. Supervision of the EFA was formally done twice a year through
joint-donor missions. The nutrition project (SEECALINE), health project, rural water, and the
PGDI supervision missions, in addition to the joint-donor budget support missions all contributed
to the supervision of the PRSC reform program. During PRSC implementation, there has been a
transparent and open dialogue with government and constant adjustments were made to a
complex change process.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

53.     Definition: The rating of overall Bank performance is based on the ratings of each of the
two dimensions: (i) Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry; and (ii) quality of supervision.

54.     Rating: Overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory for PRSC-1 and
PRSC-2 and satisfactory for PRSC-3. The rating of overall Bank performance for the series is
moderately satisfactory.


 Operation               Rating
 PRSC-1                  Moderately Satisfactory
 PRSC-2                  Moderately Satisfactory
 PRSC-3                  Satisfactory
 PRSC 1-3 Series         Moderately Satisfactory

55.     Justification: The rating directly results from the ratings of quality at entry and
supervision (see World Bank, 2006, p.37).

5.2 Borrower Performance: Rating and Justification

56.     Definition: The extent to which the borrower ensured quality of preparation and
implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward the achievement of
development outcomes.35


57.     Rating: Borrower performance for PRSC-1 is rated moderately satisfactory while it is
rated satisfactory for PRSC-2 and PRSC-3, so that the overall rating is satisfactory.


 Operation               Rating
 PRSC-1                  Moderately Satisfactory
 PRSC-2                  Satisfactory
 PRSC-3                  Satisfactory
 PRSC 1-3 Series         Satisfactory

58.     Justification: There were moderate shortcomings in government performance during
PRSC-1 implementation. These shortcomings were progressively addressed in PRSC-2 and
PRSC-3. The rating is based on the following considerations. First, there is strong Government
ownership of reforms and commitment to achieving development objectives. Second, the
Government maintained a stable macroeconomic framework and implemented reforms in all
areas supported by the program, while decentralization lacked a clear framework. Third, the
Government worked together with the Bank to identify and resolve implementation issues as they
arose. Fourth, the Government did create an enabling environment to strengthen relationship and
coordination with donors, including through the creation of a partnership agreement. Nonetheless,
a possible disconnect between the political appetite for reforms and the technical capacity to
implement and absorb these reforms may have led to some difficulties in the implementation of
the PRSCs, particularly PRSC-1.

6. Lessons Learned

59.    The lessons learned are as follows:

· Development objectives: PRSCs1-3 rightly focused on the critical areas of public finance
   management and human development. Future PRSCs may want to deepen support in these
   areas and focus on critical bottlenecks rather than broadening the areas of support to new
   areas. It may also be important to identify the institutional and absorptive capacities of each
   sector, to provide budget support to those sectors with highest capacities and to use PRSCs in
   combination with sectoral projects to those areas where capacities are lowest. Projects
   designed to address specific sectoral issues, bottlenecks and capacity constraints, are critical
   for increasing Madagascar's absorptive capacity, which, in turn, is expected to increase the
   effectiveness of budget support instruments.

· Size: The amount provided under the form of budget support has been revised downward for
   a better balance of overall Bank support between budget support and projects. The next series
   of PRSCs which would consist of three annual operations for US$40 million each (out of a
   total annual IDA allocation of about US$120 million) seems to strike an adequate balance.
   Increase in budget support could be linked to credible and sustained improvement in revenue
   collection, civil service and public sector management systems.

· Design: As the Bank and other donors jointly adopt results-oriented programs, follow-up
   operations may want to better establish the relationship between policy actions on one side
   and development outcomes on the other side. This would help assess the effectiveness of
   budget support operations.

· M&E: Although support to the M&E system has already taken place through various
   instruments including the PGDI, the PEFA assessment, the EFA initiative and sectoral
   activities, the M&E system still needs to be strengthened. The policy matrix could focus on a
   few triggers and benchmarks whose completion is monitored through a small number of
   reliable results indicators.

· Supervision: The supervision of the PRSCs rightly monitors progress toward triggers and
   benchmarks as their completion is key in order to move to the next operation. The
   supervision may want to focus more on assessing progress towards the development
   outcomes, particularly in a context where the relationships between policy actions and
   development outcomes could be more clearly established.

· Timing: It seems important to better align the preparation of the PRSCs with the Budget
   cycle. PRSCs could be presented to the Board early in the calendar year, ideally following
   Budget approval. Better alignment would be all the most critical as the amount of budget
   support is increased.

· Expectations: Both Bank and Government need to have realistic expectations about the
   breadth and pace of reform implementation. In particular, the political appetite for reforms
   must be aligned with the country's technical capacity to implement and absorb these reforms.
