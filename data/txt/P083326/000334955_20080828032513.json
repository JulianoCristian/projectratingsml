Support Operations (PRSC I) for Madagascar are as follows:\n            outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to the development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also rated\n            moderately satisfactory. Ratings for the Second Poverty\n            Reduction Support Operations (PRSC II) for Madagascar are as\n            follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to the\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also rated satisfactory. Ratings for the Third Poverty\n            Reduction Support Operations (PRSC III) for Madagascar are\n            as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to the\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also rated\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1) PRSCs I-III\n            rightly focused on the critical areas of public finance\n            management and human development. Future PRSCs may want to\n            deepen support in these areas and focus on critical\n            bottlenecks rather than broadening the areas of support to\n            new areas. It may also be important to identify the\n            institutional and absorptive capacities of each sector, to\n            provide budget support to those sectors with the highest\n            capacities and to use PRSCs in combination with sectoral\n            projects to those areas where capacities are lowest. 2) The\n            amount provided under the form of budget support has been\n            revised downward for a better balance of overall Bank\n            support between budget support and projects. The next series\n            of PRSCs which would consist of three annual operations for\n            US$40 million each seems to strike an adequate balance.\n            Increase in budget support could be linked to credible and\n            sustained improvement in revenue collection, civil service,\n            and public sector management systems. 3) Both the Bank and\n            the Government need to have realistic expectations about the\n            breadth and pace of reform implementation. In particular,\n            the political appetite for reforms must be aligned with the\n            country's technical capacity to implement and absorb\n            these reforms."}, "docdt": "2008-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
