T    he Government of Kosovo has taken a decisive step towards more effectively harnessing
     the country's fossil fuel resources for urgently needed economic and social development.
Its first major undertaking towards this end is the Strategic environmental and Social Assess-

  consult and CSA Group Ltd as part of the assignment "Environmental and Social Safeguards Services for Private Sector Participation in the Devel-
  opment of new generation capacity, related transmission and the development of the New Mining Field" between July 2007 and July 2008. The

The most important activities in the area are mining
of lignite coal and power generation. Lignite has been
mined here for nearly a century. Large-scale open cast
mining operations and power generation have been
in place for about 40 years, for most of that time with
little concern for environmental impacts. Excavated
overburden from initial surface mines was dumped
outside the open cast mines, with seven dumps now
surrounding the present mining area.


Annual coal production is currently around 7 million
tons. Bardh and Mirash mines supply Kosovo B and
Mirash alone supplies Kosovo A. Lignite is excavated by
bucket wheel excavators and transported by two belt
conveyor lines (transport capacity of 1,400 t/h - 33,000
t/day per belt) to the separation plants. The lignite is     Particulates are the main emission generated by the

Water Availability. Water availability in the Iber-Lepenc
system is dependent on the the water balance in the
Gazivoda reservoir. In the EAR water supply study, total
inflow to the Gazivoda lake was determined on the
basis of the statistical water inflow data for the period
1948-1972 (only available data), provided by ILE. Table

ID  Issue                                       Proposed Mitigation Measures

                                                A water balance should be prepared including quantities of water con-

3.1 Water recycle and reuse                     sumed per each activity, source, use and final discharge. Based on this bal-
                                                ance, possible water consumption reduction measures should be identified
                                                and implemented (reuse, recycle, etc.).

3.2 Effluents from TPPs                         ing, including separation of process water from rain water (to be collected
                                                and used as process water to reduce raw water consumption) and recycling
                                                of wastewater. For TPP A revamping, see comments above.

3.5 As above                                    In the long term, capping/recycling of contaminated soils/waste heaps to
                                                avoid leaching should be addressed.

4   Waste Management

                                                Based on findings of the CLRP investigation phase and Interim Report,
                                                plans for:
                                                - Conversion of present dry dumping of TPP A ash to wet ash removal and
    Ash dump at TPP A (including by-products    covering ash dump surfaces with cohesive material;
4.1 of former gasification plant) and outside   - Partial removal of ash and overburden from unstable areas of ash dump
    overburden dumps                            TPP A as well as outside overburden dumps;
                                                - Implementation of proper measures to avoid washing out of area where
                                                high risk contaminants from former gasification and fertilizer plants are
                                                located.

                                                Complete ash dump characterization based on waste inventory in terms of
                                                types, amount and current location, including chemical characterization by
4.2 Ash dump TPP B                              means of waste excavation, sampling and chemical analysis.
                                                Risk assessment of potential impacts deriving from presence of waste with
                                                regard to release into air, surface water, groundwater and soil.

                                                Based on risk assessment results, mitigation measures should be designed
                                                and implemented including:
                                                - removal of ash from unstable areas;
                                                - ash dump capping (waste should be adequately profiled in order to assure
                                                stormwater runoff discharge and then capped with geomembranes and
                                                cohesive material).

5   Noise

                                                A noise survey should be undertaken both at the work place and at the

5.1 Noise impact                                main receptors to be identified. A proper comparison with applicable stan-
                                                dards should be performed in order to ascertain potential non compliance
                                                and necessary mitigation measures.

7   Soil and Groundwater

                                                Specific survey should be undertaken at the site including data review,

                                                Sediment sampling should be undertaken every 250 m on the two banks of
7.3 River sediments characterization            the Sitnica River. Sediment samples should be analyzed for: pH and heavy

                                                Superficial soil sampling is proposed in an area of 10 km radius from the

                                                Sampling program should be undertaken, along with analysis for disposal
