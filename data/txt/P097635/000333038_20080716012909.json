     Technical Assistance Project for Kosovo is to provide\n            environmental and social safeguard support to facilitate the\n            successful development and investments within the new mining\n            field including the development of a new lignite mine and\n            power station, in a manner consistent with international\n            best practices in regard to the management of the social,\n            economic, and environmental impacts of such developments.\n            Some of the negative impacts of the project are: i) burning\n            of open mines and explosion/burning of waste dump sites; ii)\n            risk of exposure to hazardous substances into the open\n            pits/open dumps; iii) direct contact with contaminated\n            soils; iv) pollution at work places (dust, noise emissions,\n            etc); v) air emissions and air quality monitoring; vi)\n            particulate emissions from thermal power plants (TPP)\n            transport system and from ash dumps; vii) contaminated Storm\n            water due to leaching of contaminated soils; viii) noise\n            pollution; and ix) potential for air pollutants deposition\n            on the soil from power plants. Mitigation measures of the\n            project are: 1) immediate securing (including fencing) of\n            the open mine and waste dump sites to prevent unauthorized\n            access; 2) implement access restriction devices and maintain\n            them in operation through a periodic verification service;\n            3)  impacted soil mapping should be prepared and appropriate\n            fencing/labeling should be introduced; 4) monitoring\n            campaign on noise to measure 8 hours dose and air quality\n            especially at the mines; 5) installation of settling ponds\n            to reduce the load of suspended solids and coal dust in mine\n            water; and 6) a noise survey should be undertaken both at\n            the work place or at the main receptors to be identified. A\n            proper comparison with applicable standards should be\n            performed in order to ascertain potential non compliance and\n            necessary mitigation measures."}, "docdt": "2008-07-11T00:00:00Z"}
