EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY

P         rovide production and regular supply of electricity is a prerequisite for economic development of
          the country. In Kosovo, the actual production of electricity depends mostly on its generation
          based on lignite combustion in power plants in the blocks 'Kosovo A' and 'Kosovo B'.
Kosovo, at this stage of planning the energy development, bases on the use of local resources. Lignite is
the most important energy resource of Kosovo, which supplies about 97% of total electricity
production. Estimated coal resources throughout Kosovo reach about 12.5 billion tons, of which the
amounts of 8.6 billion tons are considered that are resources with the economic profitable exploitation.
Further development of energy sector in Kosovo is found mainly in the benefit of electricity with coal
combustion. This development, using lignite reserves with rigorous international criteria on global
warming, control, emissions trading and carbon dioxide, based on capacity and quality of lignite
mining stocks in Area of Special Economics Interest (ZIVE) - " New Mining Field" and building the new
powerplant (thermopowerplant) - TPP" New Kosovo "within it.
NMF (FMR) areas of interest, for which developed the Spatial Plan, is the area of 150 km ² (from that
proposed in the decision of the announced zone No. 02/57, dt. 13.03.2009 with 143 km ²) and includes
different determinants spatial factors. Each of them requires analysis, studies and preliminary research
on social and environmental impacts caused by activities and projects of existing and planned future
developments within the energy sector.
Existing power plants, its activity of functioning until the suppression, after required rehabilitation
based on international standards allowed, TC 'Kosovo A' will develop at the latest by the end of 2017
and the technical and environmental rehabilitation, TC ' Kosovo B 'up towards 2030 years. Meanwhile,
according to the Energy Strategy for the period 2009 - 2018, expected construction of new power plant
TPP "New Kosovo" in two stages, the first operation of the blocks referring to the plan, will have a
period of at least five years, as it continues to build and develop the other blocks, so that the two blocks
in Kosovo B to be replaced completely around the year 2030.
Development and advancement of mining surface in the new mining area, under operation of the KEK
is realized according to master plan drafted by Vatenffal1, in order to supply power plants with coal.
These processes pull away, very sensitive social issues, the displacement of populations and directly
affected settlements in this area. The process of relocation, with its history, the identification,
expropriation, assessment, compensation and resettlement of population in new residential areas, is
performed prior to permit initiation of mining surface in the extraction and transport of coal to power
plants.
Rehabilitation and environmental improvement, develops as unavoidable process without stopping,
starting with the removal and new cultivation of disposed ash areas of external leaflets of overburden
and continuing with the rehabilitation, replacement and deployment of new technological devices in
existing blocks (in the obstruction of pollution and degradation in air, water and land), of degraded
areas and mining used. Construction of flood protection barriers, erosion, vibration and noise
generation, particularly the creation of the area surrounding the mining and energy generation by the
green part of this process that are mandatory and start as soon as possible of realization.

According to the Government of the Republic of Kosovo, based on the legal framework of Kosovo, is
liable the MESP - ISP (Institute for Spatial Planning) to draft Spatial Plan for the Area of Special
Economic Interest "New Mining Field." Spatial Plan is drafted with the support of a professional
working group of inter-Ministerial experts, with substantial contributions provided by the consultants
and other professional experts, foreign and domestic.
The purpose of drafting the Spatial Plan for the New Mining Field is planning of the future activities
within and outside the area for the benefit of providing electricity and heat from burning coal in
existing power plants and construction of the New TC Kosovo, the displacement of people and
material goods from the settlements affected by ongoing mining activities and environmental
improvement of quality of life of the local residents by utilizing resources in a rational, natural and
cultural heritage.
Areas of special economic interest and FMR (NMF), in a local context of Spatial Plan, is located in the
"Blue Zone" so-called "Port of Kosovo", next to TZHEK (Triangle of Economic Development of Kosovo)
and includes municipalities Obilic, Lipjan, Fushe Kosovo, Drenas, Podujevo and Prishtina as the center.
While on the local context, the area of interest "New Mining Field" will be adopted in development
plans and strategies and include municipalities (Obilic, Fushe Kosovo, Vushtrri, Drenas).
The New Mining Field, as an area of special interest economic, include separate elements and spatial
determinants such as the New Mining Field (area 'C'), Industrial Areas with existing TC with potential
locations for TC KR, transport and infrastructure corridors, existing Mines, outside storage of
overburden wasteland, storage of generated ash and protection area (buffer) around these factors
influencing spatial exposure.
The discussed analysis of the situation profile and the current situation, various problems emerged,
listed in the respective thematic areas based on Government priorities and basic international
principles are grouped into four (4) major development challenges of the FMR (NMF) areas:
1.Providing electricity and heat
2. Dispossession, displacement and quality of community life
3. Exploitation of natural resources and
4. Environmental situation
Based on available materials (analysis, research, evaluations, reports, studies, strategies and other
various drafts) and given ideas based on experiences of professional experts in the many discussions
during the workshops, is drafted also the vision statement shaped in this context:

The "Special Economic Interest Area - New Mining Field, the area of managed care, in accordance
with EU standards for the benefit of economic growth, social welfare and environmental satisfactory
condition."

Achievement of the emphasized Vision can be provided, relying on general principles (which match
the strategic plan) for the protection and development of this area of interest and analogue view to the
four Key Challenges. So as a coherent reflection of all this entire are systematized on the next Four
Millennium Development Planning:
Manufacturing and safe supply with electricity - The proposed objectives, should meet the goal of
highlighting intention and dealing with: the possibility of building units (capacity) of new electricity
generating with coal combustion; transmission, distribution of electricity and maintenance of local
power network; ongoing initiatives for the use of new renewable resources for energy production.
Planning and control of the relocation process and development of settlements - Is intended to
achieve with the proposed objectives that are: inventory and valuation of property and real-estate
property, expropriation of property and compensation of immovable property; acceptable
implementation to the relocation process - restoration of community and achievement of agreement on
the cemetery issue, planning and control of developments in the improvement of living within the area,

establishment of the Community Development and Control of development throughout the basin area
of Kosovo.
Sustainable management of natural resources – The goal which claims to be reached, by the proposed
objectives, such as rational use of lignite reserves; prevent self-combustion of lignite mine (mining) and
the rational exploitation and management of water resources .
Improvement of environmental condition and heritage Care - Here are mentioned some of the
numerous proposed objectives, by which is believed to achieve these goals, such as improving the
environmental performance of the existing TPP; closure of old units, rehabilitation and reclamation of
degraded areas, monitoring and control of environmental regulations on air, water and earth
sustainable management on “regional waste dump” in Mirash, management and use of fresh ash in
construction needs and also effective and proper care on bio- diversity and heritage (natural, cultural,
historical and industrial) in the FMR (NMF) area's.
Further, it has been worked in determining the future concept of spatial development, which enables
and facilitates decisions regarding future developments in the area. As a base for this is used the
decision of the Government of Kosovo, by which this area is declared “Area of Special Economics
Interest”, with the main goal that through development of the energy sector to grow and advance also
the economic development of the country.
The concept of the future spatial development of the FMR (NMF) interest zone, named "Trefoil and
propeller”, formulates in the schematic manner, the future developments within the four main goals -
Vision component - characterized as continuous processes. This concept emphasizes the future
development of continuous power generation energy, located in the middle of the area as a central
shaft of propeller and three pillars accompanying the processes, rational utilization of coal resource,
and population protection during treatment of settlements and environmental remediation. However,
in the FMR (NMF) area, only when are meet the required criteria of social and environmental aspects
(expressed symbolically with ecological plant - trefoil), then are allowed to place these foreseen
developments (expressed symbolically with propeller).
Through this concept attempted the achievement of future desired spatial development, of the Vision
stated in advance for the FMR (NMF) area, where actions and activities arising from the concept are
clear and appropriate. Proposed activities are in full support of coordinated planning and spatial
development in correlation with the main challenges involved in the area. Increased effort was given to
the high inter-institutional coordination, between central and local levels, affecting the alignment of
actions during the selection of priority activities and implementation of concrete projects, including
control of development within and outside of the area..
One of the main concerns of the working group has been the selection of appropriate location for new
mine development and construction of power plant “Kosova e Re”. Among possible scenarios, based
on preliminary studies and research, are analyzed and evaluated the development direction of the
mine and four potential sites for construction of TC's' “New Kosovo”. In the analysis is included the
location of industrial complex TPP "Kosova A"; location of the complex TC "Kosova B" location near
the village Bivolak and location near the village Grabovc. Evaluation of specific criteria for selecting the
location, except those general, for each scenario, it resulted that: the preferred location and suitable for
the construction of "TC KR" is option B (inside the industrial complex of TPP "Kosova B ').
General Dynamic Plan for the population displacement-replacement of the settlements in the danger
zone is prepared in the order of impacted settlements based on the selected scenario for advancement
and development of mining, in accordance with the Main Plan of Mining.
This plan and all other activities are described in detail in Chapter of Spatial Development Strategy in
the area - which is the main part of the document. Strategy under FMR (NMF) development concept,
elaborates the selected scenario which is achieved by hierarchical analyzing, firstly in goals, then each
goal at specific targets and at the end each target has its measures, its activities and concrete projects to
achieve.
Spatial Plan of the Area of Special Economic Interest "New Mining Field" ends with the chapter of the
provisions to implement, which simultaneously express the rules and responsibilities for each
participant involved in implementing the envisaged activities.

PROLOGUE


I   n general, the current output of electricity in Kosovo depends on the old power plants `Kosovo A`
    and `Kosovo B`, which burn lignite extracted from existing mines in Bardh, Mirash, and Sitnica,
    located in the western site of capital-center of Kosovo - Prishtina. Coal production from new mines
“Sibovc South-west "begins in 2010. Mineral assets of existing mining (Bardh and Mirash), are being
finalized and is expected to run out in 2011. Therefore, taking this into account, the Government of
Kosovo with its relevant sector has taken the initiative to open new mines. This initiative, of course that
besides the energy sector requires the involvement of other sectors including spatial planning sectors in
the capacity of coordinator of the planning process.
 Providing production and supplying enough electricity energy, for meeting the needs of domestic
consumption and overall economic development of the Republic of Kosovo, is a key element in this
process. Further development of surface mining should be based on capacity and the quality of mineral
reserves in the area of special economic interest (ZIVE) - "New Mining Field." Investing in building a
plant (thermo-plant),new one (TPP "Kosova Re"), with more advanced technology, higher
manufacturers efficiency and at the same time more friendly- environmentally, would be justified by
the continuing investment of many of costly rehabilitation and adoption of blocks of TC 'Kosovo A'
against durability and technology of them.
Setting up new blocks, from building up to their operation, should be developed alongside with the
functioning of blocks in the two existing power plants. It is expected that its activity, the functionality
to the wane - decommissioning, TC 'Kosovo A' with its blocks A3, A4 and A5 will develop at the latest
by 2017, while TC 'Kosovo B' with its blocks B1 and B2 (rehabilitate in 2017) until 2030.
Developments such as the construction and operation of new power plant "Kosovo Re';
decommissioning of units at TPP “Kosovo A” and the rehabilitation of “Kosovo B” blocks,
displacement of population and the deployment of settlements, mining developments in the new field
of mining by including the filling and re-cultivation of mines used in Bardh and Mirash, will cost more.
No doubt that the main responsibility falls on the Government of Kosovo and the possibility of the
Kosovo Budget. Starting from the local economic difficulties, it is clear that for the development of new
energy capacity will need assistance from other financial sources. Therefore, Government decisions and
agreements reached with the Project Company carrying, should define clearly generating capacity
needed, the position of Kosovo institutions and foreign investor obligations in the mentioned processes
during Project development, much needed for economic development in Kosovo.
Kosovo Energy Strategy for the period 2005 - 2015, drafted by the Ministry of Energy and Mines
(MEM) and approved by the Assembly in 2005, confirms the fact that in long-term schemes the coal
will remain the main fuel for electricity production of Kosovo. The same is confirmed in the revised
Energy Strategy of Kosovo for the period 2009-2018 where the development of mining lignite in the
next period is supposed to happen in Northern coal basin "Kosova." This part is also known as the
"Field of Sibovc" but, at the request of residents of that area during public consultation in this area is
now called "the New Mining Field."
This strategy, which is compiled on the first draft of SP for "FMR (NMF)" in November 2009, requires
local coal as a source to put in use for production of electricity, with a responsible approach to
environmental and socio-economic development. After using mine and coal supply to existing plants
and new ones built in phases with generating capacity of 2 x 1000 MW, its required to fill up the
surface of use of the mining area, to rehabilitate them and then to re- cultivate. Besides the activities of
mentioned processes, it‟s required to develop acceptable activities in the process of expropriation and
displacement-resettlement of the community. The result of these processes will be changes in spatial
structure, expressed as in configuration, environment, land use, landscape, settlements extension, etc..

amendments on 01 April 2010 by the Assembly, provides:
       Developing safe and sustainable energy supply so that all customers have access to efficient
        and uninterrupted supply of power, an adequate quality.
     Restructuring and developing the energy sector in accordance with the Tractate of Energy
        Community, by ensuring that energy legislation in Kosovo that is in accordance with the
        European Union Communitaire Acquiss Energy.
     Development and rehabilitation of generation capacity with coal combustion, involving the
        private sector to ensure sufficient generation of electricity for local consumption, for export and
        spare capacity.
     Development of transmission lines to ensure domestic supplies and conection with
        neighboring countries.
     Development of distribution infrastructure to reduce losses in distribution network.
     Promotion of foreign investment in the energy sector through the restructuring of the sector
        and ensuring a regulatory environment within the context of a competitive market.
     Optimize utilization of all energy resources, including local and imported resources.
     Promote awareness of environmental protection in energy activities, in accordance with
        Acquiss Communitaire of the Environment.
     Ensuring efficient use of energy and promotion of the use of renewable energy resources.
The decision of the Government of Kosovo, dated 17.12.2009 no. 07/99 (see Annex 3), realign the
transaction for `New Power Plant Kosovo` and Sibovc lignite field, with the following components:
    o Construction of new plant generating electricity "New power plant Kosova" with an initial
      installed capacity of 500 MW with expansion options up to 1000 MW of interconnection and
      related facilities.
    o Develop immediate Lignite Field Sibovc to provide coal for existing power plants in Kosovo
      (Kosovo A and B) and the new units to existing power plant "Kosova e Re" when entering the
      operation.
    o Private Sector Participation in `Kosovo B` power plant

By the same decision was asked to become the expression of interest, which will describe the details of
the transaction, the minimum criteria for selection, competition and intentions of the Government for
this transaction.
On December 18, 2009 was issued expression of interest, where requested by the applicant to submit
their credentials for pre-qualification until January 29, 2010. On 20 and 21 January 2010 was held the
international conference of investors for this transaction, which had significant interest from various
international companies. The conference consisted of two daily presentations, about investment
opportunities in Kosovo and in the field visit in the capacity of existing electricity generation and
mining. On 18 February 2010 was made the announcement of the short list of pre-qualified bidders.
On 01 April 2010, the Assembly of Kosovo approved the changes to the Kosovo Energy Strategy 2009-
2018. Changes approved by the decision Nr. 03-V-272 to the Assembly (see appendix 4), at the same
time also the recommendations of Functional Commission of Economy, Trade, Industry, Energy,
Transport and Telecommunications, that are highlighted as follows:
        Lignite resources to be available and put to use in accordance with new generating capacity
        and energy development in harmony with the interests of Kosovo.

The boundary begins at its southernmost point, from the village of Slatina, at the junction of the road
Peja - Pristina and Bellaqevc / Bardh - Magura (old airport road) and runs eastwards by way M9 to exit
in the city Fushe Kosovo, respectively in quotes; X = 4722505.17 m ', Y = 508997.04 m' and Z = 551.2 m
'. Then run from the north boundary to the railway track where follows it in east with length of 1.352 m
'. Again, following the border line inter Fushe Kosovo - Pristina, takes direction from the north, passing
to the west of the village and continues along the road Orloviq M2 leaving Gazimestan slope of cheese
in it, then passes through the village of Lazar, Milloshev to inter-border meeting point with Obilic -
Vushtrri. From this point (the bridge near the village of Babin Most), directed from the west boundary
line following the course of the river to the point Llap between the two villages of Lower Stanovc and
Priluzhë. The border goes further and inserted within length of 1.400 m. From here, the boundary of
the FMR (NMF) area's surrounding cadastral areas: Gllavotin (Vushtrri), Bibolak (Vushtrri), Zhilivodë

In the decision, protocol number 02/57 dated 13.03.2009, the Government obliges the Ministry of
Environment and Spatial Planning to draft the Spatial Plan for this area. In this case, and also because
of the need for the drafting of this Plan, except professional officers on the staff of the Institute of
Spatial Planning is well established Inter-Ministerial Working Group (GPNM), with the initial
composition of MEM and MESP experts. Since the beginning of the process of drafting this plan, the
working group expanded with representatives from other sectors of the Government component.
Continuation of group work in the process finds it divided into subgroups, defined by challenges in the
first phase, namely the target at a later stage. Working groups continually expand even further with the
inclusion of other participants, representatives from outside government, other interest groups in the
role of experts and professional consultants.
In addition, based on the principle of inclusiveness and in constant search for relevant data, proceeds
an invitation to engage representatives from the wider public for the purpose of involvement and
participation early in the course of their working groups. Finally, in the open consulting discussions
and deliberations held for the public, was given the possibility of involving other representatives as
well as in the scheme presented in Fig. 1 below, when is achieved the target goal of inclusiveness
stakeholders.

PURPOSE OF DRAFTING PLAN




Development of the mentioned mining and production of electricity will cause major changes and
transformations in spatial and demographic structure of the area with special economic interests of
New Mining Field. While construction of power plant “Kosova e Re” lasts for 4 - 5 years and his use
nearly 40 years, the development of mine happen to pass through a longer term process of 4-5 decades,
during which period, the intervention of numerous activities, will change the current use of land as
their own natural landscape. With this plan, in addition to activities for exploitation of lignite mining,
manufacturing and supply of electricity, are proposals for future developments both in terms of spatial
environmental remediation as well as socially.
This plan is based on the Final Report of the Environmental Strategy and Social Assessment (SESA2's
report), compiled under the Technical Assistance Project for Lignite Power (LPTAP) in support of
MEM. There are given a description of existing social and environmental situation, assessed the effects
of the proposed project and its components of identifying the anticipated impacts of development
scenarios and proposed monitoring plan and mitigation of those impacts.
 The general purpose of this plan, which is being drafted by the institution with the legal mandate
(MESP - ISP) in collaboration with inter-ministerial working group, is to provide projects basis for
economic development in general and the specific area of interest in particular as well, also to inform
decision makers about the possibilities, options and implications of developments in the FMR (NMF)
area's.
    Also, this draft should define the clear target as:
        spatial implications of building the ``New TPP Kosovo`` and new mine development (the area "C"
        or field in village-center Sibovc)
        Framework based on spatial planning for development activities in the FMR (NMF) to be taken by
        the investor through a private company Project;
        Mitigation measures planned in the treatment of spatial effects in order to be eligible for socially
        and environmentally, and
        Instructions that can be utilized for the development of other specific areas and the municipalities
        involved in the treatment of this area in their future local plans: the spatial and urban
        development.




Spatial Plan for the FMR (NMF) area is a document which promotes the common interests of the
people of Kosovo for a rapid economic development in order to improve the quality of life, while
simultaneously protecting natural resources, biodiversity and natural cultural heritage.

VALIDITY AND PLANNING PROCESS


Legal Framework of Kosovo, for treatment, planning and development of the area of energy provided
through the "Law on Spatial Planning", which according to Article 12 of this Law shall be drafted -
Spatial Plans for Special Area - which require a special mode of the organization, designation and
protection. Also part of this framework is the secondary legislation on "Discussion Procedures for
Spatial and Urban" and Instruction on "The Fundamental Elements of the contents of Spatial Plans for
Special Area."
Spatial plans for special areas, compiled by the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP),
ie the Institute for Spatial Planning (PHI), in the role of provider and coordinator of the project. Before
finalizing the draft plan for approval, the same MESP shall make available, at least for 60 days for
review and comment as to the general public and for other governmental institutions and for
participating municipalities in the area of interest. Spatial Plan Area of Special Interest Economic 'New
Mining Area', after being finalized with the results of public consultation, will be submitted to the
Government for prior approval and which entered into force after approval by the Assembly. After
approval and publication in the Official Gazette of Kosovo, spatial plans for special areas will be taken
into account in spatial planning to the lowest level - from local / municipal.
Anticipated development of the energy sector, in addition to the legal instrument of the adoption of the
Spatial Plan for the Special Zone, should be subject to the Environmental Impact Assessment, under the
applicable law to the EIA. Based on this and best international practices for the construction of the
plant to anticipate and develop lignite mining extraction and reciprocal interconnections with
environmental and social issues, shall oriented to the requirements provided within the contractual
provisions of the Private Investor.

Institutional base
Ministry of Economic Development (MED) - is the main structure and part of the Government of
Kosovo, within the institutional framework, with the powers of government and is responsible for
developing policies and strategies derived from basic laws of both sectors - Energy and Mines. All
decisions, attitudes and studies relevant to these two sectors are proposed and undertaken by the
Ministry. First of all, the drafting of this document is based on the Energy Strategy of the Republic of
Kosovo for the period 2009 - 2018 (review of previous Energy Strategy 2005 to 2015), prepared by MEM
and adopted in April 2010 by the Kosovo Assembly .
In coordination with the powers of the Ministry of Economic Development, there are two established
agencies and independent regulators responsible for the quality of energy and mining sectors.
Energy Regulatory Office (ERO) - is an independent institution, established by the Law on Energy
Regulator Nr. 2004 / 9, which is governed by a board appointed by the Assembly. ERO's responsibility
is to oversee the energy market, protection of energy customers, energy operators license, etc..
Independent Commission for Mines and Minerals (ICMM) - Originally, was established by
Regulation with Nr. 2005 / 2 to 21 January, which then changed the rules of July 29 with no. And Law
No. 2005/38. 03/L-81 dated 13 June 2008 which provided for an independent regulatory agency for the
mining sector. ICMM, as an independent agency, which is in accordance with Article 119 (paragraph
5.) And 142 of the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo, run by a Board of Directors elected by the
Assembly and are accountable to its licensing " Mining operators. "
Kosovo Energy Corporation (KEK) - is a company which enjoys the status of public energy enterprises
and is licensed for mining lignite from the Independent Commission for Mines and Minerals and for
production of electricity supply by the Office of Regulatory Energy. KEK is governed by a Board of
Directors elected by the Government of Kosovo.
Transmission, System and Market (TSMO - KOSTT) - is a public energy company, licensed by the
Energy Regulatory Office and has the status of the Transmission System Operator and Market Power in
Kosovo.
Besides the mentioned framework and legal infrastructure and institutional development of the Draft
Spatial Plan for the New Mining Field, is based in many studies, surveys, reports and plans prepared in
advance, related to the spatial extension of projects for power generation Electrical and development of
the mine with other associated activities parallel.

Under the Law on Spatial Planning, is divided into two levels, the central and municipal / local. As
shown in Fig 2, at the central level of planning are drafted the spatial plans for the entire territory of
Kosovo and for special areas (with different specifications). Whereas at local / municipal level, are
drafted development and urban plans and urban adjustments.


The planning process
Preparation of the Spatial Plan for Area of Special Economic Interest "New Mining Field”, must pass
through several phases, during which can arise also different decisions or actions during the
development of this process, until to the Plan approval, for more clearly see fig. 3.
 On the initiative of the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) and on its draft decision to the energy
area, the Government takes a decision and announces, New Mining Area of Special Economics Interest
for the country. In this case, the Government has required from the Ministry of Environment and
Spatial Planning (MESP) specifically for Spatial Planning Institute (PHI), to draft Spatial Plan for the

This Spatial Plan for the area of special economic interest is a Strategic document for the energy sector
in Kosovo, and state-adopted document, featuring great achievement for the country. The
implementation and fulfillment of the Spatial Plan, will contribute to the overall Strategy for
Sustainable Development of the Republic of Kosovo.
Important role in drafting the Spatial Plan for the area with special economic interests have had the
institutions of government. Inter-Ministerial Working Group (GPNM), established to develop this plan,
consisting of representatives of various institutions has taken into account the sectional strategies, such
as Kosovo Spatial Plan, Environmental Action Plan 2006-2010, Strategy of Energy 2009-2018, the draft -
Strategy of Kosovo Mining, Strategy for sustainable agricultural and rural development in Kosovo, the
relevant documents on facilities and natural and cultural heritages and other.

Here are analyzed the strategies of all sectors that have interference to each other, whether in good
correlation interaction (synergistic strategies) or those that are in contrary (conflicting strategies) with
each other. All this is done in order to best possible achievements, such as minimizing the controversial
conflict and in prioritization and advancement of consentaneity interest in the progress zone "of the
New Mining Field" and the entire country.




STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE PLAN


The document, Spatial Plan of area of special economic interest 'New Mining Area', comprises from
textual and graphical part. In the graphical part enter all kinds of illustrations whether maps, pictures
(charts - graphs), tables and images or photography.
The structure and content of the PH "FMR (NMF)", is designed according to "Administrative
Instruction for Implementation of Law on Spatial Planning - on Content of the Main Elements of the
Spatial Plan for Special Area", Nr. Protocol 43 to 04/05, issued by the MESP. This plan, as stated in the
guideline represents the existing social situation and environmental consequences of mining activities
caused by coal extraction and electricity generation so far and the situation on the basis of forecasts for
the same activities in the future after land use of emptiness` mining rehabilitation, decommissioning,
dismantling and regulation of space around the plants.
Spatial Plan for New Mining Field is divided into five (5) phase and are likely to be drafted in a single
volume of five chapters (as in this case) or as a collection of five separate volumes and that under this
structure:


        Phase or Chapter 1 presents the spatial profile of the area of special economic interest FMR
        (NMF) and describes existing environmental and social situation;
        Phase or Chapter 2 presents the phase or the desired vision for the area with the principles and
        purposes of this Plan;
        Phase or Chapter 3 presents a proposed framework for future spatial plan;
        Phase or Chapter 4 presents the strategy suggested by the measures, activities and actions for
        implementing the concept for future developments, and
        Phase or Chapter 5 presents the rules and responsibilities for implementing the proposed
        strategy for spatial development of the area.

R      epublic of Kosovo its part of South – East Europe, extends in the Balkan Peninsula and has
       central position in the Western Balkan. It‟s surrounded by four neighboring states, being
       straitened to South-West Albania, Montenegro in the North-West, to Serbia in East and North
and Macedonia (IRFJ) in the South. As in the region, in the territory of Kosovo and in different areas,
are spreading the lignite basins, from which, with special potential is emphasized the Kosovo basin as
the largest one and it‟s located in the plains of Kosovo. From
the maps shown in Map 4, it‟s noted that areas with special economic interests " the New Mining
Field" is part of the Basin of Kosovo "and includes nearly half of it - the northern part.

 The Area of special economic interests (ZIVE) is limited to the Çiçavica mountains of north-west as
 well to the national –highways M9 (Prishtina-Pejë) in south and that M2 (Prishtina-Mitrovica) north-
 east. The southern and central area is marked by surface of land used for mining of Mirash and Bardh,
 landfills outside of enhanced wastelands, industrial area of “Kosovo A” location, and while in the
 north of the existing lignite mines extends the agricultural land.
 Areas of special economic interest "Field of New Mining ", takes almost central position in the territory
 of Kosovo and it is very close to the capital city - Prishtina, about 150 km ² (or more exactly 14,986 ha),
 lies in the central part plane of Kosovo. This area, with its center in approximate length and width of 21
 geographic °, 00 'ie 42 °, 30', the administrative aspect lies in the four participating municipalities:
 Obiliq (Kastriot), Fushe Kosovo, Vushtrri and Glogovac (Drenas ).

This area, with its extension to the west of capital city -Prishtina, as the current focus on electricity
generation for the whole country has Obiliq, while power plants Kosovo A and B are located near the
city - its urban area. Actual Mines within this area, in Bardh and Mirash, mostly spreads in Obiliq and
less in Fushe Kosovo.
External dumps of wastelands in south of the FMR (NMF) area's, are located mainly in the
municipality of Fushe Kosovo and partly in the municipal territory of Obilic, while the external landfill
in south-west of the area, which is located in Vasilevo, have its spreading in the territory of the Drenas
municipality.
Building of the Power Plant “New Kosovo” and opening “New Area” for surface mining in the so-
called Field of village-center Sibovc or "C" will be the extension of greater impact, especially in Obiliq
and will include about 13% of its territory, while in the municipalities of Fushe Kosovo and Vushtrri
this extension is partial.
Currently, the removal of soil or overburden, the extraction and exploitation of coal, has begun to be
realized in south-western corner by KEK and it is in the municipality of Fushe Kosovo near the village
of Lower Grabovc. While long-term expansion of new lignite mines, within the area of special
economic interest FMR (NMF)'s, expected to be orientated towards the north that will reach into the
territory of the municipality of Vushtrri, in the eastern part of the village Zhilivodë.
The location of Regional Sanitary Landfill of Prishtina, with extent of its use of 50 hectares for 15 years,
is located in north-east of the existing mine Mirash and affects in settlements around because their
central position is in the area's FMR (NMF).
Center network transformation and transmission of electricity that serves to transform the energy
produced in tension and adequate provider network or the distribution. The center from which
distributed electricity is managed by JSC KOSTT and located near the industrial zone of Kosovo B

Canal water of the hydro-system “Iber - Lepenc" supplies the plants Kosovo A and B‟ with non-
processed water, from the cumulative lake Ujmani / Gazivoda. This channel, which passes through the
area's FMR (NMF), is used by many customers and based on its ample capacity, can supply the new
power plant “Kosova e Re”.

1.1.3. NATURAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES
Morphology and topography of the terrain. The coal basin in the Kosovo basin covers area of about
300 km ², with the vertical extension of the average diagonal length of 30 km from north to south and
an average expansion in the east-west direction of 10 km. Morphology of the Kosovo Basin, forms the
extended valley, where differences in height over sea are not more than 80 feet. A central plain, which
stretches along the river Sitnica, followed by a more hilly terrain, mountains approaching Golesh,
Çicavicë and west almost to the Sharr Mountains in south-west. The land, on the environs of mine, is
used mainly for agriculture, with some small woods in the southern part of the basin.
Zone "of the New Mining Field" (FMR (NMF)), as in map 6, located between Sitnica River valley to the
east with an altitude of about +525 m and an gulch that expands to the south with an altitude that goes
to +750 meters, and on the west side continues to surround the River Drenica valley with an altitude of
expansion of about +550 feet.

Geology and Hydro-geology. Kosovo as in maps 7 and 8 with the area of special economic interest, in
geological terms, is constructed from sediments of Paleozoic, Mesozoic (Cretaceous, Jurassic and
Triassic) and Cenozoic (Terceira and Quaternary).
Paleozoic (Pz) - is represented by crystalline Snow- slip (which are represented by argil, phylete and
rarely snow- slip with amphibolites) and crystalline limestone (which in most cases lie on shale,
whereas the smallest among is found in the middle of the series shale). Crystalline limestone uttermost
are located in the western area, in the eastern side of Çiçavica Mountain, are distributed in the form of
multiple lens. In small groups of limestone are sophisticated as far as difficulty distinguished from
phyllite and quartz. In crystalline schist and crystalline limestone so far not been found, and for that
this fauna issue of their age is left open.
Mezozoiku (MZ) - is represented by Coil, Flitch of the Upper Cretaceous and limestone. Serpentines
and Peridotites appear in some areas listed in the NW running-and N-S-SE. Small measures presented
in the SW of village Sibovc, respectively main creep ine along which is formed the basin of Kosovo.
Cenozoic (Kz) - is represented by sediments and Quaternary Terceira. Terceira (Tc), represented by
rocks andesitic - Dace and clutch, and Neogen sediments (Ng). Quaternary (Q), the majority is
represented by alluvial sands and gravels.

The general conclusion which belongs to the hydro issues, within the area of special economic interest,
consists mainly of soil cover, over and within the coal layer. From numerous hydrogeological
investigations is concluded that groundwater meet very near the surface in depth of 3-5 m. There are
waters with free levels (freak). It is important to note that during work for water removal from mines of
Bardhi and Mirash, so often cames to the explosion of groundwater from the crevices of the coal
streak. With drilling and mining works is concluded that the main groundwater reservoir are alluvium
on both sides of Sitnica River, and alluvium of the river Drenica.

Much of this area is covered with yellow and gray mold, which is waterproof and prevents the
infiltration of surface water until the layers of coal, but the bulk of water from rainfall flows on the
surface to the beds of mentioned rivers, and in some temporary stream flowing on this area.
In geological terms, particular attention should be paid to lithological composition and granulo-metric
alluvial formations, and their hydrological properties such as coefficient of filtration, the opulent
source, the regime of groundwater level, conditions of food source, the amount of flow of water at
source and its chemical properties, etc..
In the contact between Mesozoic formations (Jurassic, Triassic and Cretaceous) and Quaternary
sediments, comes to the appearance of some natural water sources. These resources meet in the west
along the Çiçavica mountains. Such sources are located in the village Shipitullë, Grabovc, Sibovc,
Caravadicë (Palaj) and Zhilivodë.
Climate. The FMR (NMF) area's is subjection to the climate impacts by basin of River Sitnica and Ibar.
Has its own microclimate with specifications on chemical processes which have influenced
technological developments arising from the energy industry. Emission processes in this area have
extended their influences in aerosol and other climatologically elements. Due to technological chemical
processes, the area in which planned to build the New TPP Kosovo has a high relative wetness with
variety of 95% - 47%, while the normal limits are usually from 45 to 56%.
Air temperature is the variable where the average annual value is, see fig. 4, is 10.2 ° C (Celsius),
whereas the most cold month is January, -1.5 ° C while the hot month is August with annual average
temperature 20.5 ° C. Annual amplitude of air temperature is 21.9 ° C, where the extreme values and
other elements create a climate of transitional regime between the continental average of harshly
mountainous climate, when autumn is hotter than spring for 1.5 ° C.

 Hydro-Meteorological Institute of Kosovo in 1999 produced a study that shows the average monthly rainfall for a 25-year
period. The Institute is also providing monthly values for the years from 1979 to 1995. adding the values of the years 2001 to
2004, this data base has expanded to cover a period of 25 years (1979 - 2004). Data base is complete with a current estimate for the
period 1948 to 1978.

1.1.4. NATURAL HAZARDS


Seismic - Kosovo is subject to vertical tectonic movement and is in a seismic active area lying along the
Orogenyc Belt - Alpine - Himalayas. On the map below, as the map 9, are presented the scale of
seismic zones in Kosovo based on the magnitudes that were observed until now with the epicenter of
earthquakes recorded during the period of a century. Historical Records show that there have been 534
earthquakes, of whom 82 of greater intensity than 6 ° MSK (Mercal level categories), 12 intensity> 7 °
MSK, 10 the intensity of> 8 ° MSK and 3 intensity> 9 ° MSK.

Any new construction in the future, in the area of special economic interest "of the New Mining Field,
must be adapted to the norms and construction standards for seismic zones with over 7 ° MSK. The
FMR (NMF) area's extends on seismic zone that for 95 next years expected to be hit by the earthquakes
that would cause acceleration - hustle of land values in the range of 0:06 to 0:08 g, according to the
latest map of seismic risk for the territory.

Flood and erosion - The extent of floods more pronounced in area of special interest "of the New
Mining Area", presented both in map 10, and are constant problem in the territorial area here. Flooding
of land areas most commonly caused by the emergence of the Sitnica river bed and are evident,
especially in the period when the probability of multiple rainfalls is prolonged or greater - from
November to March. Based on integral analyzes, the current state of protection from harmful actions of
water is not affordable. Infrastructure protection (embankments, other regulatory acts, barriers or bio-
cultures for protection from erosion and streams), even just partially treated before, in recent years has
suffered great damage.

1.2.1. LAND USE




Map 11. Surfaces in use and owned by KEK. - Source: KEK / Coal Division



Within the area is important to know the share of land property. On map 11, are presented surfaces
that are under use and under property of the KEK, which comprise almost 20% of the total surface.
Meanwhile, ownership of the rest of the surface within the area is private and public, which varies
across the participating municipalities.
Obiliq, is the municipality most affected by power generation, surface mining, disposal of ash
overburden and also the relocation of settlements, that are under private ownership and use 54% (or
5683 ha) of land area, whereas under public ownership and management are 4809 ha (or 46%), from
which KEK owns 15%.


Land use for the mentioned area of interest has great significance and mean destination areas or type
of owning the space, respectively land surfaces under the ranking of sectors from which they are used.
The size of the listed values, expressed in hectares or percentage, represent the sectional report (eg
extension of the industrial area to area of residence or owning areas of the constructed surface, versus
to the areas with agricultural land and forest, etc.). Such information, except that are issued by the
highest priority users, also by affected ones and those with impact, will serve to compare also the
values according to destination, starting with the existing ones with those in the future from the
strategy implemented after the plan / project.

Areas of Agricultural potential –The agriculture, from data of Table 2 and Diagram 2, is the dominant
land use in the FMR (NMF). Agricultural lands occupy 55% or 8 080 ha of the territory and mainly used
for cultivation of wheat and corn, butalso other vegetables in a limited area. Soil type is alterable with
clay content, while the fertile lands are expressed according to the benefits, presented as follows, in
map13.
During the summer season and dry periods is unfavorable due to vertical cracks. Actual use of
chemical fertilizers and agro-chemicals is low because of high price and many areas were left
uncultivated.

Settlements / Housing - constructed spaces, for housing needs or action of the population in
settlements within the FMR (NMF) area, occupying about 11% of the total surface of this area
respectively extend to 1702 ha. City of Obiliq and Fushe Kosovo are both urban centers and also are
within the FMR (NMF) area. All other settlements, which are found in the area of interest, are primarily
of rural residential character, hereupon are inhabited populated villages mainly dealing with
agricultural activities.
Settlements inside the area of the New Mining Field, based on the influences that have and particular
way of handling that is required, the inter-Ministerial working group divided, as shown in map 14, in
three categories:
1. Settlements in the New Mining Area - that are required to undergo the process of relocation.
Here we are dealing with the settlements within the new field of mining, directly affected by the
extraction of lignite development and advancement of Mining and they are:
         Hade (by about 5.0 km ² and 2900 inhabitants) – M. Obiliq
         Leshkoshiq (Lajthisht with about 3.7 km ² and 1,300 inhabitants) – M. Obiliq
         Shipitullë (a neighborhood `Krasniqi by about 1.0 km ² and 100 inhabitants) – M.Obilic and
         Sibovc (with about 7.5 km ² and 2020 inhabitants) - M. Obilic.
2. Settlements in hot spots - preferred to submit to the relocation process. In this group, we are
dealing with the settlements that are within the triangle of degrading influences (between hotspots),
which directly are ffected by the facilities for generating electricity, ash dumps and outside folding as
well as the promotion of mineral development and regional waste landfill and highlighted are the
following:
         Krusheci (or Dardhishtë, by about 6.6 km ² and 2210 inhabitants) – M. Obiliq,
         Caravadica (or Palaj, by about 7.1 km² and 1.150 inhabitants) – M. Obiliq and
         Neighbourhood of `Berisha` in Lower Graboc– M. Fushë Kosovë.
3. Other settlements in the FMR (NMF) - affected by the expected developments. This includes all
other settlements within the area of special interest of FMR (NMF)- that are indirectly affected by the
impacts, whether from mineral development, the generation and transmission of electricity over the
transmission impacts of lignite or ash from the waste dump and external leaflets etc., and which ones
should enjoy special treatment and care of central government institutions and local where are counted
the following:
o New Obiliq– Municipal Center (with about 5.300 inhabitants) and Old Obiliq (with 1.500 inh.),
o Lower and Upper Mazgit– M. Obiliq (with 3.000 inhabitants.),

Areas of external leaflets of wasteland - Removal of the upper substrate and other layers of the earth,
for the discovery and extraction of coal, has resulted in the creation of a large area of wasteland leaflets
being significantly degrading the land surface primarily agricultural. About 8% of the total surface of
FMR (NMF)-based or area 1320 ha are covered by these external folding. Under the scheme prepared
by KEK, as in Fig. 6, soon begins the realization of the Project for the PRT.

Existing mining areas – existing opened mining of lignite in Bardh and Mirash (picture 2), occupied
area of 1061 ha or 7% of the total territory of FMR (NMF), of the area of special economic interest and
operating since 1963/64. Currently these two mines supply two power plants with approximately 7
million tons of extracted coal per year. Within this zone lies the regional sanitary landfill of waste.
Since 2006 within performed activities on mine Mirash is constructed a regional landfill and has been
used for dumping urban waste of the municipalities of Prishtina, Obilic, Fushe Kosovo, Podujevo and
Lipljan. Within this activity it‟s not done sorting and recycling of waste material.

Ash Storage - TC-the “Kosovo A and B” extend in a horizontal area of river Sitnica valley. Each TC has
a large ash landfills that are environmental impact issues. Landfill of Kosovo B” ash is consolidated
while from 2006, fresh ashes from production are transferred to the former hydraulic mining of Mirash.
Landfill of “Kosovo A” ash, as in picture 3, is expanding toward the south and also it‟s planned the
transfer of fresh ash from this plant, in hydraulic manner to the Mirash mining. The total surface of ash
dumps participation in the area of FMR (NMF)-is the 2% or 272 ha.

Industrial Zones - Power Generation - The location of TC-s 'Kosovo A' and 'Kosovo B' (photo 4) are
the only areas of industrial importance in this space. Also in settings of these areas in the vicinity of the
TPP Kosovo A` are Units of Gasification, Industrial Heating, Drainage, Separations and those for the
production of artificial fertilizers which are left out of use more than two decades ago. Today they
represent a major environmental problem due to contamination mainly phenols and other substances.
All of these industrial locations with all suit plant devices, present in the surface of total FMR (NMF)-
occupies only for 1% of the facility or 191 Ha.

1.2.2. ENVIRONMENT


Air
Sources of air pollution throughout Kosovo are provided in the document "Cadastre of air pollutants“6
while for FRM area, the sources of air pollution are considered the activities of surface mining use,
power plants, ash dump generated by burning coal, self-starter coal in mining, pollution from local
traffic and heating system. Also not so far from this area exist the mine and smelter of Ferronikel,
considered as potential pollutants. About 30 km north of the complex area of the mine extend the
Trepca as one of the pollution sources. These pollution sources emit mostly these pollutants: SO2, NOx,
CO, CG2, particles suspended in the air, heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cd, Mn, etc.)
Dominant winds in the area of interest are coming from N-NE based on chart "pink Wind" for
Prishtina, which consequently impacts on villages in S-SW direction, as the most affected by emissions
of TPP `Kosovo A and Kosovo B` , dumps and mining activities.
Reliable data on air quality in the area of interest are limited and non-systematic. Two monitoring
stations are present in the area, one in the town of Obilic and the other at the Institute INKOS, near the
`Kosovo A` power plant, but these only measure SO2, smoke-black and PM10. There are no continuous
measurements on the NOx-in. KEK, through INKOS-it takes samples from the deposit of dust in the
vicinity of the former separation facility near TPP `Kosovo A` and mining of Bardhi.
INKOS Institute, perform the measurements and submit the statement on the environmental situation
at some certain point, namely the concentration of emissions (primary pollutants) into the air,
including SO2, smoke-black, air and dust particles deposited (sediments), which are reported to the
KEK . In addition, the annual average values are presented for the years 2202 - 2005, as in tab. 3, the
following month as well as for the years 2006, 2007 and 2008 as in tab. 4 below.

            Sediments are analyzed according to the German standard VDI 2119 direction Blatt 2 (1972). . Samples
            are collected during a month, and the results expressed in mg / (m2d). Sediment samples along the
            quantitative determination of dust are used also for determination of soluble substances and insoluble,
            pH and content of soluble chloride and sulphate. Based on reported data, its summarized that: the
            allowed criteria are exceeded several times, the average values of 300 mg / (m² d) for 3 - 4 months
            during the year and the pH according to the WHO, while Inorganic and solvent substances are
            component part of total dust for the period 2006, '07 and '08.
            For the determination of airborne particles are used the gravimetric methods which is based on
            determining the amount of airborne particles from five samples collected during the filtering of certain
            amount of air. There are no criteria exceeded allowed during 2002 - 2006, but once more pronounced in
            December 2007 and 4 times during 2008.
            The most recent data available used in SESA received from Environmental Report KEK 2006, show
            significant contamination found within European standards, with the exception of the deposit of dust.
            However, those few sampling locations can not be considered as complete reflection of the true level of
            air pollution to the environment of sensitive receptors, population and settlements. During the public
            consultation with the community and household survey in the area during the drafting of SESA,
            participants reported numerous problems in breathing and other health symptoms that are attributable
            to environmental pollution.


            Hydrometeorology Institute of Kosovo (HMIK) continues to monitor the air in Monitoring Points, as
            the map 13, among them: 9 in Mitrovica, one in Prishtina (the location of IHKM) and 5 monitoring
            points in Drenas (2 in rural area smelter in the villages near the Gllabar, Qikatovë and 3 within the
            industrial zone Ferronikeli).
            HMIK, there is no monitoring station (points) arranged within the area of FMR (NMF)-, while refers to
            data from air quality of monitoring points in Pristhina. At this point, the measured NOx, SO2, soot and
            suspended particles, while in complex of Ferronikel are measured suspended particles and heavy
            metals.

In the absence of proper network and equipment for air monitoring, HMIK does not monitor all the
parameters that are taken as indicators of air quality, according to the Law on Air Protection, but only
the concentration of these parameters in the air: SO2, soot and aero-sediment (Total Dust Coats, pH,
electrical conductivity, sulfate ions, chloride ions and heavy metals).

Water
Own field of mining covers six reservoir area of smaller water areas, four of them flows in the direction
of Sitnica River toward the east and two in the direction of Drenica River to the west. Along Sitnica
River, lies an area that is flooded with water in major rainfall season, in which are located the two
blocks of industrial zone of TC's "Kosova B".
In the area of interest, especially Sitnica River is polluted by discharges in the course of his high
discharges from urban areas, besides them by effluent from power plants and mines of KEK Joint-stock
which discharged directly, without adequate treatment and streams of water from dumps. In addition,
the rivers receive large volume of organic substances from waste water; because there is not or very
little sewage treatment. The data compiled within the SEA's regarding the point of discharge and
receiving water quality samples, indicate that water of Sitnica River should categorized as Water of
Class IV, regarding the former Yugoslav system of classification (respectively, "water that can be used
only after special treatment ") and is far from European standards of quality.
Biggest users of surface water are TC-Kosovo A and B, which is using also river Llap. However, there is
not enough analysis on the treatment of wastewater discharge. Ordinary Water supply of TC `New
Kosovo`, is examined in the context of a particular study of water supply from Hydro-system Ibar.
Surface waters. The main sources of surface water, in the "FMR (NMF)” and which are belonging to
the Black Sea basin, are Sitnica river and the river Drenica, and several smaller stream flow of
permanent and temporary flowing .
Sitnica River, is the branch of the River Ibar, which from the source to the place of unloading in the Ibar
River, near Mitrovica, is over 90 km, with average flow 15 m3/sec 7. It is a Stream of small slope, wide
bed, shallow and winding, its characterized with small annual flow of water. During the summer there
is greater flow than 2.5 m3/sec, while during the winter and spring, when melting snow, this feed is 15
times greater, respectively, 37.5 m3/sec. During large water flows, the river Sitnica goes outside of the
river bed and overflow the working area of land around, causing major damage on agriculture. Sitnica
is considered as the largest reservoir of Kosovo plane in which are discharged the streams: Drenica,
Llap, Prishtevkë, Graqankë, Janjevkë, prrocka Trepča` and some with smallest impact. Potential
polluter of the river is the KEK, and the water from households, which discharged directly into the
river without being treated.

Sitnica River Alluvium. Alluviums terraces of river Sitnica have significant spatial extent along its
flow, and resources resulting in their formations. These resources could have importance for drinking
water supply, agriculture and industry of this area.
The thickness of sediments is different, so that near Vushtrri ranges up to 10 m, while the whole surface
thickness of Lypjan reaches up to 15 m, while near the village of Batuse thickness is amounts to 33 m.
According to data we have, resources near Vushtrri that are made in depth research work is found 2.7 -
7.7 m, during which its water-bearing level is free and has a level of 2.2 m, to the Lypjan the depth is
16.6 - 28.6 m , water-bearing level reaches 4.78 m, of the earth's surface. Any detailed research with the
installation of this field is not done in this alluvium.
Treatment of waste water (sewage)
There is not a system for treating waste waters, all water discharged untreated into the river Sitnica.
Sewage from the settlements within the area of FMR (NMF), in the absence of sewage discharged
system through open channels in water flow, which results in pollution of surface and groundwater.
The control and monitoring of the pollution degree of the river Sitnica is performed by IHKM and
INKOS- through monitoring network of about 17 points8.
Existing power plants possess the equipments for treatment of partial industrial wastewaters while
mines have no equipment for proper treatment.
Some parameters of some rivers pass maximum values allowed under European Union standards for
the river water quality. Many important rivers have shown signs of major pollution from organic
matter; they have a deficit in dissolved oxygen with high chemical needs of oxygen (COD) and
biological oxygen (BOD).


Quality of surface and underground waters


From the existing data on the quality of surface
water taken from KHMI (Hydrometeorology
Institute), we can say that the situation is not
satisfactory because it has exceeded the
maximum        allowed.    Measurements      are
analyzed for each stream at the entrance and
exit to the river and determined based on their
water quality. According to the monitoring
system of IHKM and INKOS, surface waters in
the area are polluted as a result of chemical-
technological processes and water without
treatment.
Groundwaters generally are of good quality at
the source. However, their quality is monitored
by 5 monitoring points of INKOS installed
within the area of special interest. Measuring
the quality of underground water is on a
monthly basis.

Land (Soil)
Type of soil that dominates in the area of FMR (NMF)-have been vertisole land, which are the basis of
agricultural production. Within the area of special economic interest, some areas of land are covered by
wasteland deposited by previous mining activities and dumps of power plants.
Currently, the environmental impact of agriculture is present due to the use of artificial fertilizers and
pesticides. With the development of rural economy, the use of fertilizers and pesticides will certainly
mark downs. Simultaneously, there is not much pollution from the industry due to lack of industrial
activity. However, previous sites of heavy industry remain a source of environmental pollution, since
they are still contaminated with waste water and contaminated with metals and various chemical
substances, which are flowing into surface and groundwater. Regarding the impact on the landscape,
there are seven landfills located in the northwest, southwest, south and southeast of the mining Mirash
and Bardhi, which cover an area of about 15 km ². Environmental damage caused by landfills located
outside the mining areas occurs mainly due to lack of management of landfills, questionable long-term
stability and lack of geo-technologic river-recuperation. In the Western of Mirash, drifting the
landslides occurred due to the instability of the banks of the landfill. Perceptions of the landscape
indicates that no more than 10% of landfills are external re-cultivated. These landfills present a
potential source of dust for workers in mining and the local population from the villages of Bardhi and
Hade, massively expressed during the summer.
Pollution and soil degradation. There is pollution of soil in the area of former industrial buildings
energy, in location close to the TPP `Kosovo A` and disposing of toxic waste production (waste of
phenol), storage of ash TPP` Kosovo A` and Mining of old underground workings. These previous
contamination are subject to a broad program of research within the project of cleaning and re-
cultivation of land (PPRT / CLRP) which, inter alia, aims to identify contaminations presented, provide
the limitation of the risks till to their eventual rehabilitation.
Main potential sources of contamination of soil and groundwater identified are:
          discharges of oily substances and other chemical substances, especially in locations to prior
facilities of gasification and nitrogen;
        acid rain, aerosol and suspended particles from power plants, mining activities and dumps
(previously there were storages of pollutants from the old plants gasification and nitrogen);
       previous and current storage of waste in the landfill of ash, especially in the ash dump at
Kosovo A and the old mine (regional sanitary landfill), and
        discharges of untreated industrial wastewater and sewage.
Based on the latest research on testing of groundwater and surface of free water of the research phase
of PPRT's location has showed the slightly increased levels of BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl -benzyl
and xylem) and PAH (aromatic hydrocarbons polycyclic ) in some samples. Metals are within drinking
water standards (WHO, EU) in addition to arsenic, which is found at concentrations (12 and 13
micrograms / L) slightly above drinking water standards (10 micrograms / L) in samples taken west of
Kosovo ash dump A. These concentrations of arsenic may be related to the natural presence of this
element in the geology of the area. The conclusion is that test results could not identify any
contamination of groundwater flows in the ash dump. There are verbal reports of contamination of
groundwater wells, which now seems likely related to the disposal of chemical materials in old mine
galleries but one such of thing needs additional research. Some shallow wells showed high levels of
electrical conductivity (from salts) that suggests the impact of dust from the ash or spills of water from
the ash dump9.

Research by the PPRT10 showed the presence of hotspots with high levels of phenol waste, phenol
waters and the presence of tar in landfill of “Kosovo A” ash; although the landfill it is not used on a
regular basis for the disposal of these substances. Two pools on top of the middle portion of the ash
dump of `Kosovo A` and some drilling along one of these ponds are identified as areas of landfill. The
total amount of these wastes is very limited and it seems that they are isolated in acceptable degree.
Ashes of ash strage in the landfill contain elevated levels of heavy metals, but due to the chemical
composition of ash for streaming potential are limited. Enhanced levels of some heavy metals also were
found at the overburden dumps, but the same were similar to those found in nature in that area. In the
area near Prishtina (Dragodan) surrounding overburden dump and ash dump near the `Kosovo A`, are
found many illegal waste dump of municipal waste, construction waste, other waste from power
plants, old strips of rubber, scrap metal, etc..
Geochemical analysis included analysis of soil samples taken at different depths (from 0:50 to 80
meters) in 11 new wells for determining the pH, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and metal.
To the west of the ash dump, about 200 meters from the village of Krusevac (Dardhishte), is used a
previous ventilation shaft for waste storage of tar and phenol. This same practice has happened also in
other former underground mines. In addition, open dumps do not have adequate clothing or other
equipment to protect the land and there is no measure to decrease the impact to avoid contaminations
of water spill from the rapid precipitation and storms.
While the survey results indicate the contaminated groundwater, it was not clear affiliation with waste
materials from the ash dump. Also, contaminated mining galleries can submit a serious risk to local
groundwater and water wells, but for this needs to be other researches.
Nitrogenous terrain of old facilities and gasification seem to be contaminated. According to the PPRT
is scheduled a new research in 2008, a study to identify the level of contamination.
Also, according to PSBT, investments for work upgrading to ash dump in landfills `Kosovo A` and
wasteland are included in the final draft of the project (April 2008). After formal approval, the
proposed measures of reforming, partial removal of unstable parts, coverage and planting of
vegetation should provide an adequate solution against the emission of particulates, possible
contamination of soil / groundwater and contamination of water courses.
There is no information available on the composition of the ash dump of Kosovo B. Hopefully it
contains other types of solid waste such as old tires and other industrial waste.
Ash landfills frequently have flooding. This situation probably caused the contamination of Sitnica
with exfoliation (sediments). `Kosovo B` ash dump, emits much less particulates than `Kosovo A`, but
has available a limited data on the state of local ground water. A research on this is needed.


Wastes and their influence
Wastes are reported in different forms and they are as a result of workings in mines, in power
generation and waste from the former production processes in chemical industry (Gasification,
nitrogen and Desiccation). Larger quantities of waste are the product of burning coal, which can not be
avoided, but there are many possibilities that they will be reduced. Existing capacities and former
chemical industry separated these remnants:
          Waste combustion of coal (ash and slag)
          Equipment and outdated materials
          Waste of water treatment



10In July of 2007 has started "site survey, technical organization, planning and determination of environmental impact" as part of
cleansing and land reclamation "((CLRP / PPRT), which aims to identify the level of contamination and improve environmental
situation in the vicinity of mines and power plants KEK, through the particular emission reduction (particles) from ash deposits
existing Kosovo A.

    Some wastes are safe for human health and ecosystems. At the same time they can be useful as
    recycling products (different types of metal and ash) while others, particularly from waste water
    treatment, are dangerous and should be managed with great care.


    Ashes. Ash is the biggest problem in terms of quantity and area occupied by the existing landfill,
    where the total amount of ash only in 2008 for both TC's (Table 5), was 1,161,171 t. The failure on
    treatment of these ash deposits poses a serious problem for social and environmental for the special
    interest area of FMR (NMF).
    Ash from electricity production in `Kosovo B` power plant is transported and stored in the space of
    Mirash mine with the new hydraulic system since 2006.
    TPP `Kosovo A` and `Kosovo B` are close to their dumps, which have created "new hills" in existing
    landscape. The total amount of ash is about 40 million tons, in both landfills. The following are the
    amounts of ash production during the period 2005-2008 by TC TC A and B.

Waste from water treatment. Waste caused by water treatment (chemical preparation of water
processor) is loaded with salts and different elements. Waste from this process is stored in dumps. The
chemical composition of these wastes is not currently known and need arises monitoring their quality


Chemicals and oils. Industrial chemicals and oils are not adequately stored and operated are in
irregular order. A problem poses in itself the old chemicals (expired), preserved for many years and in
some situations whose composition is not known in general.


Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) - The existing lignite mining capacity, Power Plants `Kosovo A` and
`B` and as well the maintenance services use large amounts of industrial oils. Only a small amount of
PCBs or PCB-substances that are used are reported in the current moment and their use is avoided as
much as possible. In KEK is shown willingness to avoid buying oils that may impact on the
environment after their use. Large quantities of PCB-containing oils are used before the conflict and
certainly are thrown in the ash deposits, but it should be ascertained.


Residuum from Gasification Unit. The process of coal gasification began in 1970 and continued until
1988, during which it benefited the thermal gas and waste heat, as concentrated phenol, tar, oil, refined
gasoline's, ammoniac water, etc., part of which are shown in picture 6. As a result of gasification of coal
are left these stored NUS products12:
-         Concentrated phenol................................. 850 m3
-         Unrefined Gasoline.................................. 113 m3
-         Water Phenol........................................... 113245 m3
-         Tar and medium oil................................... 753 m3
-         Di-isopropyleter.......................................... 78 t
Besides these substances that cause major environmental problems, this area is also characterized by a
host of other objects (drainage, air separation, etc.), which in itself contains various substances, but
their condition is not known. KEK is making efforts for resolution of this issue.

Radioactive substances. Within the gasification unit there is a secluded warehouse where they stored a
quantity of radioactive materials. These materials are isotopes of cobalt (Co-60), which have been
installed in the gasification unit generators. Bunker for storage of radioactive materials was built in
1988. In this bunker are stored three types of radioactive sources 13:

- Type I: 12 sources, with initial activity A0 = 3.70 GBq;
- Type II: 18 sources, with initial activity A0 = 0.74 GBq;
- Type III: 4 sources, with initial activity A0 = 1:48
Measurements made by KFOR14 provide the following information:
Within the bunker:
- Back part of concrete protector........................ 4-104.23 μSv / h;
- Frontoward of protector part ............................ 4 - 23.12 μSv / h;
Outside the walls of the bunker:
- Infront the entrance the dosage is 0.11-0.18 μSv/h;
These measured values are not dangerous for a short time of exposure, but not recommended entrance
within the bunker. Radiation around the bunker is the normal value.
Asbestos or materials containing asbestos are not used in TPP Kosovo B. At the time when Kosovo A`
was built was a common use of asbestos but most of it is replaced. The amount that is left it is enclosed
and will be a problem after the closure of the use of TC Kosovo A.


Noise
Noise present a serious problem for the health of workers and population. In some countries the TC
noise level sometimes exceeds 85 dB. The isolation of noise applied around noisy equipment. Workers
use protective devices in areas with noise is caused by the TC's. Factors like wind direction and
velocity, atmospheric absorption of air humidity, affect in the spread of noise. During the night, the
noise in the nearby municipality of Obilic, about 500 meters from Kosovo B, is above the level for
inhabited areas by Carl Bro15. In the absence of noise maps, Carl Bro has calculated the degree of noise
see in Table 7.

Table 7. Noise scale - Source: Carl Bro, 2002
Typical values for emission limits permitted by the nearest residence that are applied to EU countries
are 55 dB during the day and 40-50 dB at night.
In the vicinity of the ash folding are reported multiple sources of noise which affect the quality of life of
people living in surrounding villages. Were observed following noise sources:
- Excavators
- Means of transport (vehicles and conveyor belts of coal / ash)
- Operating Noise of power plants Kosovo A and B
- Operation of locomotives of the KEK.
Noise emissions from power plants come mainly from the conveyor belts, combination equipment,
bins, turbines, generators, fans, compressors, pumps numerous cooling towers and chimneys. In
different areas around blocks of power plants equipment, the noise level may exceed the value of 85 dB
(decibels).
Historically there is no data from monitoring noise level near the facilities and equipment, although the
level of noise for employees and for residents inside the energy zone, considered a key aspect to be
addressed in the framework of EU standards and best practices.

Landscape, biodiversitieti and natural and cultural heritage
In the Area of Special Interest FMR (NMF) -, so far there is no landscape that has been declared
protected under the legislation in force. As far as visual appearance can be said that in most of the area
is not satisfactory, except northwestern part of the FMR (NMF).
Surface of natural areas in the area of interest will increase after the completion of the project, in fact
after re-cultivation. In future plans, existing mining area, landfill of ash and overburden storages will
be cleaned, re-cultivated and planted, which will continuously improve the visual appearance of the
area - the natural landscape.
Biodiversity and natural heritage. Zone 'FMR (NMF), for which is drafted this Spatial Plan, it is
characterized by a high value in terms of natural heritage. In the mining area of the new alignment that
there are few natural monuments, according to the Kosovo Institute for Protection of Nature and that:
• The source of mineral water in the Upper Graboc
• Source / fountain-source in the center of village Caravadicë (Palaj);
• Timber of single lime tree (Tillie spec.) About 200 years old, in the neighborhood Nicak (Sibovc),
  and
• wood timber group (3x Quercus spec., 1x Quercus cerris), some 300 years, in the neighborhood of
  Megjuanëve (Sibovc).
Draft of Spatial Plan-Project of FMR (NMF)-shall not affect any strict protected area or natural habitat
(dwelling) protected for conservation of plants, fungus or animals that are threatened or endangered
by extinction.
Archaeological and cultural- historical heritage. Also, archaeological heritage, and historical
architectonic is very important to contribute in sustainable development, especially its participation in
diversity development of rural areas, which in fact is required for the FMR area (NMF). Integrity and
known familiar objects of this heritage are presented with their spatial location on the map of the area
of interest on the map 15, while other, more interesting archaeological data for other localities find in
the list below as Table 8.
"Castle or `Gradina`" of Bellaqevci - It is early medieval town with the decision number: EK 02 -
389/77 places in the list of monuments (buildings and sites) under state protection. It is located near
the village Bellaqevc (Upper Bardh) and extends over the nearest hill on its western side.
 The holy tomb of Sultan Murat I - it is laid up under protection in 1950 with the decision number: EK
245/50 and located in the 6-kilometer away from Prishtina, in the village Mazgit (on the left side of the
road Prishtina - Mitrovica). The holy tomb of Sultan Murat I or-meshed of the Hüdâvendigâr (in
picture 7), was built in XIV century and represents the oldest Ottoman work in Kosovo. For its cultural
values, historical and architectural monument was found and protected by law on cultural heritage.
Near `Holy Tomb`, in 1896, was built facility for its visitors staying overnight, called Selamllëk
(Selamlık). Holy tomb has been renovated several times before, but this most recent, in 2005, is
renovation more fundamentally and conducted by the Presidency of the Islamic Community of Turkey.

Lignite resources


Lignite is the most important energy resource of Kosovo, which supplies about 97% of total electricity
production. Total geological reserves, coal resources throughout Kosovo, evaluated according to the
Institute "INKOS" reach about 12.5 billion tons, of which considered that the amount of 8.6 billion tons
of exploitable reserves, from the economic aspect are advantageous to exploit. Lignite resources in the
Republic of Kosovo, with total area of 334 km ², are located in three main basins: the Kosovo basin,
basin of Drenica and "Dukagjini basin. Additional geological surveys are needed in all three basins,
with the exception of the Carboniferous of Sibovc field which is explored in detail, on which are also
supporting detailed technical projects for use in the context of Kosovo's energy strategy and "Project
generating electricity from coal "

The quality of coal resources in the basin of Kosovo is low sulfur content and the concentration of lime
(calcium oxide) useful for absorbing a portion of sulfur during combustion. Quality of lignite as well as
the relationship between the overburden layer and that of lignite which is very conducive makes
mining more attractive to use (see fig. 10).
Particular areas of economic interest extend in the active area of the mining lignite Basin in Kosovo.
Mining Surface Bardhi and Mirash (with annual output of approximately 7 million tons of lignite) are
nearly exhausted after 3 to 5 decades of operation and production. Therefore, they started preparations
for the exploitation of lignite in the so-called "field southwest of Sibovc" and mine of Sitnica. These
mines, firstly are a continuation of the mine of Bardhi, while the second extension of Mirash mine,
intended to provide short-term lignite supply to existing power plants, Kosovo A and B.

In Kosovo Basin are identified three potential areas for developing new capacity of lignite mining. To
use these mining capacity in the course of 40 years, could be built and installed new capacities of
electricity generation based on lignite reserves of these new mining areas, presented in their extend as

Lignite resources in the New Mining Field are estimated at about one billion tons and represent a
considerable asset in Kosovo that will provide energy output over many decades to come. Estimated
reserves of lignite as a natural resource within this area Sibovc based on an area of 19.7 km2, has
resulted in geological reserves of 990 million tones, of which 830 million tones are exploitable.
From preliminary research and studies made under the European Agency for the financing of
Reconstruction, are available two mining plans for the location of which see map 16.
Main Mining Plan (PKX) for New Mining in the area of Sibovc of the year 2005 is made to ensure
technical and economic electricity production in Kosovo and guarantee existing blocks and new
generating plants to supply them with coal for burning throughout their durability.
Additional Mining Plan (PPX) for Sibovc Area South-West of 2006, despite PKX for the New Mining
Field (Sibovc), focuses on the safe supply of blocks of existing power plants with coal combustion,
ensuring the required amount of 9 million tons / year, for the period of their durability until 2024

1.2.3. POPULATION, SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND SETTLEMENTS




Population
Development of the population is a very important area for future planning and development. All the
developments in the space should be made in the interest of the population itself. Therefore, analysis of
demographic developments is essential for proper planning of the area by referring to the demands of
the population and interest area for future development.
Now it is known that in Kosovo, since 1981 onwards, there was no census and the data are varies
depending on the organizations that received the assessment of population both for specific areas and
also for the level of Kosovo. The data used, which in this case are regarded as more realistic, are taken
from the assessment of UNHCR in 1998.
Number of population - in the area of FMR (NMF) live of approximately 55,000 inhabitants. While in
the strict area should be displacement of the population, about 7000 inhabitants. It is recognized that
population data are lacking not only for this area, but also at the level of Kosovo. The data used are
from various sources and years. For this area shall be noted that there are two cities with large numbers
of residents, Obiliq and Fushe Kosovo.

Density of population - in the area of FMR (NMF), are living about 360 hab. / km². This is high
density of population compared with an average of Kosovo. From Table 10 and Map 17 we can see the
following note that: within the area have significant differences in terms of population density,
settlements with a smaller number of people have a lower density, while in both cities is higher
density.
Population structure by age and gender - has great significance for demographic development,
economic and social development. From this structure of the population derive key contingencies that
influence the development of demographic and socio-economic development of a population.
This area is populated mostly with new population, though, in later periods of time, there are some
small changes with tendency to reduce the values of the new age group. Over 30% of the population in
the area are young age, from 0 to 18, while ages 19 to 35 years old catch value of about 30%, then the
age group 36 to 65 years include about 35% and age groups over 66 years amounting to about 5% of the
total population. These data, as in Fig. 12, show that this whole area as well as Kosovo has a young
population with about 60% under the age of 35.

The ethnic structure of the population - according to data of 1998, over 70% of the population were
Albanians, while others were Serbs, Roma, Ashkali, etc.. The data presented are the source of estimates
made by various local organizations and international organizations in Kosovo.
Migration of the population - today represent a multidimensional spatial problem, demographic,
economic, social and political development, while promoting a range of complex factors, often related
and mutually conditioned 17. Lack of demographic data in general and migration in particular,
represent difficulties to work and achieve accurate results on this area migration. According to various
estimates can be said that there is significant migration mainly from rural to urban areas. However, we
must not forget that we are dealing with migration abroad, which make up a large number of
populations. Causes that have conditioned these migrations are of different nature, including economic
and employment (improving quality of life), social, demographic, political. The economic causes and
employment are key factors that have conditioned these migrations, for the fact that a considerable
number could not find work in that area and the only solution to provide better conditions of living
was migration and employment in the foreign world.




Social development
Education - Education of the population is the foundation of a healthy society, which guarantees the
future prospects of social, economic, cultural and political life of a country. In the education system in
Kosovo, after 2000, there were significant developments in the implementation of modern curricula. In
2002, are created a new model for the education system in the country. The reformed structure
provides 5 years of primary education, followed by 4 years of lower secondary and 3 or 4 years of
higher secondary education. 5 +4 +3 model structure is replacing the previous 4 +4 +4. With the new
structure, the obligate education was extended for a year, now 9 years from the previous one in 8 years.
The organizational structure of the education system in the area of FMR (NMF)-that is organized into
four levels: preschool (5-6 years), primary (I - V), lower secondary education (VI - IX) and education
upper secondary (X - XII). Total number of school buildings is 28, including secondary schools. In the
educational process involved about 7500 students.
Nurseries and kindergartens for children aged less than 5 years within the area are three of them found
in the total and urban spaces (F. Kosovo and Obilic).

Primary education we can find in a considerable number of primary schools that offer one-year
preschool education for children aged 5 and 6 years old.
Student-teacher relation in school spaces average is around 20 students to 1 teacher with significant
differences from one school to another. Regarding the physical conditions of school buildings they
differ from one township to another. In terms of teaching-learning overall unsatisfactory conditions
presented to us in the remote rural settlements. To have more detailed analysis it‟s required the
essential information for each school separately.
Health - Health in Kosovo, in spite of large investments made after '99, is in poor condition. Kosovo's
health system has many problems, such as low funding, lack of opportunities for the treatment of some
complex diseases like leukemia, kidney insufficiency, cardio-chirurgic, Oncology-Radiotherapy
treatment etc.. But there are difficulties respectively in implementation of the organizational nature of
health law, the Serbian parallel structures, lack of health insurance, lack of sufficient staff, lack of new
investment in equipment, scientific research, not involvement of private sector in Institutional Health,
etc.. Currently in Kosovo health system is organized on three levels: a) primary level b) secondary and
c) tertiary level. Beside, whereas the public sector is organized in the private sector in a very wide scale.
 In the territory of FMR (NMF), in the public sector, healthcare is organized in primary level. Health
services are provided at 12 health facilities, two of them are the Main Family Medicine Center, which
occurred in urban areas while others are Ambulances and Family Medicine Center.
Regarding the physical condition of health facilities it is varies from one facility to another, but in
generally has a considerably situation. Also to be noted that in this area are provided the medical
services also from the private sector. This section provides surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, dentistry,
diagnostics, neuropsychiatry, cardio-services, etc..
Reorganization of the health system and investments in social infrastructure in general, particularly in
the health, impacts in improving the health status of the population. Good health status is highly
dependent from environmental indicators, primarily by air, drinking water, both in quantitative terms,
but also in quality, etc..
Unemployment and poverty - One of the main challenges for Kosovo's population is the high rate of
unemployment, which reflected many problems in society. The unemployment rate in the country is
around 44.4%18. This level of unemployment is highest in the region. It is estimated that 1 / 3 of the
population of Kosovo is under 16, while about 60% of the population are of working age. This high rate
of unemployment increases even more in females (58.06%), despite the very high rate of non-activity
for them.
According to research data on the territory of FMR (NMF)-for each dwelling-place, we noticed that
high unemployment is one of the most disturbing challenges to the population of this area. Number of
registered job seekers in the employment office, who expect to find a job, is large (about 12% of total
population), which does not mean it's real, may be even more fold greater, if all the unemployed
register.
 This high rate of unemployment has increased poverty. Poverty has affected almost all pores of social
life in Kosovo. Recent research talks about high level of poverty. According to these surveys bi half the
population (50.3%) live in total poverty, while about 13% of residents live in extreme poverty 19. The
low level of economic development, low level of education, destruction of homes, businesses and
enterprises from the last war in Kosovo ('99), led to increased poverty.
Poverty is a complex social phenomenon which is difficult to measure. For poverty measurement data
required as per capita income, education level, housing conditions, health, etc.. land-parceling , loans
not suitable for agricultural development, high taxes, seeds, artificial fertilizers, etc., are detrimental to
agriculture (farmer) to this and other reasons, the population has no interest in actively taken and
exclusively in agriculture, the sector which could reduce the rate of unemployment and poverty. Rural
areas with significant distance from urban areas, hilly mountainous areas, with low level of education,

the health of undeveloped, with not the best living conditions etc., are included in higher rates of
unemployment and poverty.




Settlements, housing and social serviles
In the space of FMR (NMF) are 26 settlements spread all over space which is being planned, two of
them are urban areas while others are rural areas. Settlements belonging to the municipality of Obilic
are total of 12, and 9 settlements belonging to Fushe Kosovo, municipality of Vushtrri 4, dwellings and
a dwelling in municipality of Glogovac.
According to the size by the number of population, smaller residence is Hamidi / with 280 inhabitants
and is the largest settlement in Fushe Kosovo (urban areas) with 16,225 inhabitants, whereas all
residences in the area could be divided into five groups:
        settlements to 500 people,
        Settlements with 501-1500 inhabitants
        Settlements with 1501-3000 inhabitants
        residents and settlements 3001-5000 inhabitants
        settlements with over 5000 inhabitants
Regarding the characterization of habitats, there are two types: type of concentrated settlements and
diffused settlements. In the first group are the large settlements, respectively entering the city of Fushe
Kosovo and Obilic and other settlements with large numbers of the population. While, in the second,
enters the settlements with smaller numbers of people such as village Hamidi, Nakaradë, etc. These
settlements (diffused) represent the totality of housing facilities and economic - agricultural producers
and also belong to the smaller categories of villages. Most of these settlements are located far away
from urban centers and rural areas, which are typical agricultural villages. Characteristic of these
settlements is the high degree of autonomy, small transforming, no good relationship with the urban
centers and more pronounced depopulation.
In most residential dwellings we have individual settlements, excluding urban areas of Fushe Kosovo
and Obilic, where we have mixed collective housing and individual. Settlements located close to urban
centers and those close to roads, development trends observed linear, followed by communication
lines, therefore housing facilities as well as those businesses lie in ordinal form. This is justified by the
fact that the population is constantly give-up from agriculture.
The largest number of dwellings is built in the flat urban areas, which is also inhabited space. For the
quality of construction material, building area and equipment in residential areas, this area also
possesses a quality fund of housing.
The circumstances during the war of 1998/99 year have caused destruction of many old residential
buildings and other ones. After 2000 started the construction of modern houses that made it changed
the traditional homes style. Housing facilities and grounds have significant differences depending on
the site, such as city, settlements near the city, mountainous settlements. Most residential buildings are
surrounded by walls, in yards and other facilities are distinguished also by other economic-
agricultural objects.
All residences that are located in the area of FMR (NMF)-have been affected by pollution and noise
created in the vicinity of power plants and mining activities of coal extraction (surface mining). But the
settlements that are affected directly and require a special treatment (for relocation) are: Sibovc, Hade,
Shipitullë and Leshkoshiq (Lajthisht). In these settlements are around 7000 inhabitants. During 2004/05
from the residence of Hade have been displaced 158 families (664 inhabitants) as a result of sliding
caused by mining activities.

1.2.4. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT


Economic development zone of special economic interest depends largely on electricity production and
development of mining activities that appear as key industries in the area, including activities in the
field of agriculture. One of the greatest potentials that help economic development of this area is also
the highways road M2 in the relation Prishtina - Mitrovica and M9 in relation Prishtina - Peja.
Property of the coal in this area which exploitation is controlled in the near future and which is
planned to expand at the same time will be followed by the gradual shift of settlements which are
located on reserves of coal.
Economic development of this area depends on sustainable development throughout the country that
primarily relate to the inherent potential of power generation. This means that besides the advantage
offering this industrial heritage primarily has its own problems regarding the needs for new
investments in the energy sector and mining, and as result also the relocation of villages within the
mining area.


Industry
Mining and electricity production are key industries in this area and we can freely say that this area is
exclusively industrial center, where are generating capacities of power plants Kosovo A and B.
Department of gasification, industrial heating and the fertilizer production that are in the location of an
industrial zone "Kosova A" are closed more than two decades ago. There are also two "drainage
system" for the manufacture and sale of coal to third parties, but these capacities are used only 3 - 5%.
KEK activities, which include about 5.100 workers, provide employment and primary income for most
residents of several villages in ths area.


Business/ Trade
Trade in this area has become the most active sector, especially in the last decade. Business has taken
off in its development in the form of small and medium enterprises. If you look carefully, along two
main axes that cross the area, road Prishtina - Mitrovica and the Pristina - Fushe Kosovo - Peja, it is a
concentrated number of business activities and commercial enterprises.
While most of the enterprises or businesses registered with the locations of the villages of this area are
small commercial businesses employing 2-3 people.
Based on spatial analysis of the municipalities located within this area of special interest drafted by ISP
/ MESP, the registration of business records show that after the trade sector, the dominant industrial
sector to other sectors is the trade sector.


Agriculture
In the area of FMR (NMF), the agriculture is traditionally held by large families and has been the main
economic activity outside the energy sector and mining. Approximately 60% of the population living in
this region is farmers who cultivate crops, mainly wheat and maize. Harvest and milling of grains is
mainly in the form of cooperative and arranged singly. There is a large dairy farm, but mostly small
farms and medium of sheep and pigs in the village Caravadicë (Palaj).
As businesses, the agricultural activities in the agricultural sector do not appear registered but it is
evident that they are among the primary activities of the family. Therefore, the area of FMR (NMF) is
characterized by the typical rural activities (agriculture and forestry) for around villages.
Land ownership varies according to the settlements, but most residents have owned land where they
live and a yard around the house being used for agricultural produce for their own needs. However,



           MESP- Spatial Planning Institute
                 The Spatial Plan for the Special Economic Interest Area "New Mining Field"                             69


the economic importance of agriculture in the area is declining. Today many areas of quality
agricultural land are left uncultivated and most produce only for home consumption.
Income levels in the villages surveyed are very low and most residents depend on extensive agriculture
for survival, for the most part of the food, if not all the food.
Other ancillary revenues, according to the surveyed families, created through other activities as Fig. 13,
by cutting trees and small farms.
About half of the population increase to 10% income from agricultural products (sales and milk
production, milk), while 40% of the population meet budget revenues from the sale of other
agricultural products by increasing the total household income for 20%. While 15% of the population
through meat products raise their income by 40%. The cutting of trees adds to the income for 10% of
family budget to 25% of the surveyed population

Tourism
Tourism in the vacant interest area has no significant of economic development. While the area is
considered to be one of the areas with the greatest chance of developing the industry that other sector
of the economy, the tourism sector development is limited. The exception is cultural tourism, but this
type of tourism has a very short season. One of the cultural monuments – with the great historical
importance is the "holy tomb of Sultan Murat II" in the village near Obilic Mazgit, the largest visitor‟s
capacity in May, of around 20 thousand visitors.
Mountain of Qyqavica which is located in north-western area of FMR (NMF), has the possibility of
developing the hunting tourism. Also in the northern part of this area, especially the natives of the
village Zhilivodë, illegally still dealing with hunting activities. Formerly, these reserves were visited in
an organized manner by passionate people about hunting from various parts of Europe, an activity that
has generated also best fund-incomes.

1.2.5. INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNICAL SERVICES


Infrastructure of Transport


Roads - Road transport to and from specific FMR area (NMF), is developed through easy access with
major national roads enhanced M2 (Prishtina - Mitrovica) and M9 (Prishtina - Peja), which are also
borders North-East and South-East (nearly half of the boundary line) of this area.
It is worth to note the direct link with the highway Merdare - Morine, that according to the newest
project of the Ministry of Transported and Communications - Telecommunications, as in map 19,
worked by ISP, will not pass through the area of special economic interest FMR (NMF), respectively
will tangent it in her corner of the South - East when meets the railway (industrial area Prishtina).
Other connections or major roads that pass across the area are regional roads R220, passing (parallel to
M2) in Priluzh, Plemetin, Obilic and Krusevac (Dardhishte) which binds to M2 and that separates into
two parts the mining area R120, which comes by M2 and passes through Obilic, Caravadicës (Palaj),
Hade, Grabovc Lower, upper Bardh and goes up in Lower Slatina, where joint to M9. As the regional
road R120 is disrupted due to mining activities in the northern edge of the existing mine Bardhi,
another road was built which has the substitute role.
Other roads are local, that connect settlements within the area of FMR (NMF)-with regional roads and
their urban centers and settlements closer to another municipality (inter-municipal). Here, at this level,
we can mention:
- Road North-West, around the new mining area, ranging from Priluzhe, Gllavotin and Bivolak, which
is allocated to Hamidi - Plemetin and Zhilivodë, Shipitullë, Grabovc, the Lower Grabovc to the Upper
Bardh;
- Central Street, passing through the new mining area that starting from Obiliq center connects to Palaj
and takes direction to Leshkoshiq (Lajthishtës) for Sibovc, Hamidi or up to Shipitullë or the other ne
allocated to Hade,
- South - East Street, in relation to the new mining area, connecting Obilic with Mazgit and Milloshevën
through Krushec with Nakarad and and Lismir in Fushe Kosovo, to continue through Kuzmin's to the
village Upper Bardh.


Railway - Two railway lines pass through the area of special economic interest. One is the line Skopje-
Fushe Kosovo - Mitrovica, with stations in Krusevac (Dardhishte), Obilic and Plemetin and the other
is the line Fushe Kosovo - Peja, with the railway station in Kuzmin, Upper Bardh, and the Upper
Graboc. It should be noted here that the locations of existing power plants Kosovo A and Kosovo B are
connected with railway lines.


Transport - Public transport, in both municipal centers, Obiliq and Fushe Kosovo, is located within the
area of FMR (NMF), and based on local bus and minibuses and supported with public transport and
taxi services in Prishtina . Transport links have not organized all the villages. From settlements with
access to public transport we can mention: Obilic (New and Old), Caravadicë (Palaj), Hade, Leshkoshiq
(Lajthisht), Sibovc Hamidi, Fushe Kosovo, Kuzmin, Vragoli, Bardhi Low, Bardhi Upper and the lower
Grabovc.


Post -Telecommunications - The area of FMR (NMF) is covered entirely by mobile phone waves.
Services offer only two operators of mobile telephony in Kosovo, Vala and Ipko. Unfortunately, the
same can not be said for fixed, because its network does not include all residences in the area of FMR
(NMF). Fixed telephony network extends to settlements: Obilic, Fushe Kosovo, Palaj, Grabovc Upper,
Lower Grabovc, Mazgit, Hamidi (secondary network from Plemetine), Plemetin, Kuzmin (not used by

Supply and quality of drinking water - drinking water supply of settlements in ZIVE (Special
Economic Interest Area) New Mining Field " is performed by operating units within the regional water
supply - KRUK Prishtina.
Operating Unit "Water-supply Obiliq" is the enterprise which supplies nine (9) settlements within
municipality, with drinking water supplies around 15,000 inhabitants, not only the city Obiliq20 but
also villages Hade, Caravadicë (Palaj) Sibovc, Hamidi, Plemetin, Krushec (Dardhishte) Mazgit,
Miloshev and Lazareve. Based on the data of this enterprise, regular water-supply of drinking water

capacity of the wells during the seasons of the year there is not.


Water supply from underground sources, wells or individual sources made in four localities of the
municipality: Shipitullë, Grabovc, Sibovc, Hamidi.
Within the area of FMR (NMF), in regional public water -supply “KRUK Prishtina” are included
settlements of the municipality of Fushe Kosovo, Fushe Kosovo municipal center and villages Lismir,
Kuzmin, Vragoli, Great Bardh, Minor Bardh, Pomazotin, and village Priluzh in the municipality of
Vushtrri.
Regarding drinking water quality, data from some operators and whic are confirmed by the National
Institute of Public Health (NIPH), the current situation in this area is as follows:
               Water quality that emerges from estuaries of the water treatment plant is in compliance with
               European quality standards21.
               It is not use the adequate amounts of chlorine for disinfection of water and none of the source
               of drinking water is not protected;
               There is a health risk in terms of drinking water contamination, including illness from bacteria
               that develop in water, especially diarrhea.
               Another source of contamination is the penetration of water containing parasites in connector
               pipes where these pipes are not under proper pressure
               personal equipment or semi-collective rarely designed and maintained properly and shallow
               wells often have no buffer zones around
Water supply facilities, appear to be in good condition and generally maintained, however,
contamination of water sources is observed.
Losses in the amount of water produced are:
                     -           In the manufacturer system - 5%
                     -           In the main pipes -          10-15%
                     -           The distribution network - 20-25%
                     -           Overall losses -             35-45%


Sewage Network - Under SESA, in the sewage system of waste water included the settlements: Obilic,
Obiliq old, Mazgit, Krusevac (Dardhishte) Caravadicë (Palaj), Miloshev , Lazarev and Plemetina (all
Obiliq) then Fushe Kosovo, Lismir, Kuzmin, Vragoli, Great Bardh, Lower Bardh, Pomazotin ( from the
municipality of Fushe Kosovo) and Prilužje from Vushtrri municipality. There is no accurate data on
the number or percentage of local residents, who have access to the sewerage system, but estimated
that the territory of the municipalities of Fushe Kosovo and Obiliq, is somewhere around 60% of
residents that have access.

Electricity infrastructure
Network transmission of electricity. - The transfer of electrical energy produced in this area is
provided by the Kosovo System Operator, Transmission and Market (KOSTT) JSC
Settlements in the area of FMR (NMF) have been linked to the network from local supply lines. On
lignite basin, or exactly above the new mining field-with center in Sibovc, within FMR (NMF)
planning, as shown in map 20, does not exceed a transmission line with regional importance.

The total length of transmission lines (400 kV, 220 kV and 110 kV) is about 1,100 km. Transmission
network in Kosovo, especially lines of 400 kV-s, was partially damaged during the war. While the
system of transmission lines is back in operation after repairs carried out since the war, also are built
new substations 400 / 110 kV (eg Peja).

1.3. AREA OF "FMR (NMF)" IN THE CONTEXT OF PLANNING


Area in the context of the Kosovo Spatial Plan
In relation to the draft of Spatial Plan, the area of special economic interest for FMR (NMF) is part of
Blue Area (Port of Kosovo) that includes a city of Prishtina, as reference city center and some
surrounding municipalities including Obilic , Fushe Kosovo and Drenas. Blue Space is characterized
by a set of spatial functions and goals of development focused on administration, education, health
care, services and trade, light industry, tourism but also agriculture outside the economy centers.
Areas with special economic interests "of the New Mining Field," as in Fig. 14, is located in the North of
Triangle Economic Development of Kosovo (TZHEK) as part of a European blue on the function that
represents the main center of development in Kosovo. TZHEK-was expected to be the economic
backbone of national interest, a source of revenue for the Kosovo economy, and a potential location for
potential foreign investors. Therefore, in the context of broad spatial development, the area of "FMR
(NMF)" represents the main supporters of sustainable economic development in general and in
particular is in direct support of Triangle Economic Development.

potential of agricultural development, so as such is treated in detail and has been the subject of
discussion in many cross-sectional meetings. Thoughts of all participants are that - in the current
economic circumstances, priority should be consolidation of power production for the needs of
industry before the use of this area for agricultural purposes. Under the plan, layers of quality
agricultural land will be removed, for recuperation and use as agricultural land, after the use of lignite,
which is located underneath. This is the procedure that will apply across the surface intended for
mining, which eventually will return to agricultural land according to the phases outlined in the plan
of mining.
The current conflict is expressed on energy production and its impact on the environment. Referring to
the data from various sources, current pollution caused by existing plants for some parameters exceed
the allowed international standards. Therefore, referring to the recommendations of experts in the field
of energy, it is planned that the new energy capacity strictly observes the required standards. Building
new capacity will create conditions that older plants will shut down, so that environmental impacts
will be minimal.

Area in the context of development plans and municipal analysis


The context of spatial development
Foreseen energy development and mining sector will mainly affect the municipality of Obilic. Will
strengthen the role of Obilic municipality, which would be as a center for generating electricity to
Kosovo with the respective effects on the economy and employment. However, at the same time will
have spatial implications for a long- time period. This will have a restrictive impact on land use and
other development options in the municipal area. Important developments in the future of the
municipality of Obilic will depend greatly on the situation and developments in the area of FMR
(NMF). The municipality of Fushe Kosovo will meet spatial differences, mainly positive impacts in the
medium term. Here, are considerable the area of agricultural land that are currently degraded, mainly
from existing mines Bardhi, which will be re-cultivated in the future. Surfaces covered with
overburden storage located in the south of the current zone have the potential to become agricultural
land or forest. While participating in two other municipalities in the area implications are less
expressed. While, in the municipality of Vushtrri, most affected by pollution, noise and landscape will
be the area around the villages - Bivolak and Zhilivodë in the municipality of Drenas, the implications
in space affected by the developments are smaller in the cadastral area of Vasilevo.


Plans and Municipal Spatial Analysis


Municipality of Obiliq in its municipal Assembly has approved development plans, municipal and
urban, drafted in collaboration with the winning company of the tender for this purpose.
Implementation of these two plans as a whole, or that municipal separately, must be in full harmony
with the Spatial Plan of the area with special economic interests - the "New Mining Field."
Spatial Analysis for the Municipality of Obilic, prepared three years ago by the Institute of Spatial
Planning (PHI), presents a document base and facilitating the preparation of municipal development
plans. The uniqueness of expressing it is covering the developments in mining and generation in the
area of FMR (NMF) in order to reduce impacts on affected habitats and to provide guidelines for
spatial development in the future. It also provided the guidelines set forth in land use in particular as
well as favorable conditions for development of the area.


Fushe Kosovo Municipality has started the drafting of the Municipal Development Plan, under the
Law on Spatial Planning, although available with Urban Development Plan, drafted earlier, but
according to the law. Fushe Kosovo municipality also during the drafting of the Municipal
Development Plan should be based on the spatial plan for the area of special economic interest - PH for
'FMR (NMF)-in'.


Vushtrri municipality has completed the Municipal Development Plan, which, as required for
implementation, must adapt and be in accordance with recommendations arising from the SP to the
area           of         special           interest         to           FMR           (NMF)-.
Spatial Analysis of the Municipality of Vushtrri was developed by ISP / MESP and undoubtedly
served as the basic document for the design of both development plans provided by Law of Spatial
Planning.


Drenas municipality, the municipality owns the two plans (MDP and UDP-on-in) which has also
received approval from the MESP and to implement the Municipal Development Plan should be
adapted to this SP for the area of FMR (NMF).

1.4. REPORTS AND SECTORAL STRATEGIES


Development of new mining
The area of special economic interest spread in the active area of the Basin lignite mining in Kosovo.
Existing surface mines, the Mirash and Bardhi (with the production of 8 million tons of lignite per
year), are nearly exhausted after 3 respectively 5 decades of operation and production. Therefore, they
started preparations for the exploitation of lignite in the so-called "field southwest of Sibovc" and mine
Sitnica which is mine expansion of Mirash, to provide short-term lignite supply to power plants
Kosovo A and B. FRM lignite resources are estimated to be about one billion tons and constitute a
substantial asset of Kosovo to ensure the production of energy during the next five decades.


Whereas, looking at the qualitative aspect, from 8115 samples obtained new mining area, about 92% of
lignite has calorific value of 8000-9500 kJ / kg (or an average of 8548 kJ / kg), containing very low of
1:01% of sulfur (in humidity of 45%) and small percentage of 14.7%. the remnant of grace. While the
rest, with only about 8% has calorific value of 6500-8 00kJ/kg.


Generating electricity energy
Generating capacity, technically Installed and available, see Table 11, both Kosovo A and B, managed
by KEK (joint stock company), would be sufficient to satisfy the basic requirements of the current
domestic consumption for electricity. However, due to age (from 24 to 46 years), degradation and no
investment in power plants in Kosovo during 1990-1999 and inadequate operation and maintenance for
years before and after the war, security and availability of equipment are damaged seriously.
Currently, the situation is slightly better, with all building blocks continuing operations, up to about
70% of installed capacity.

Most of the manufacturing blocks of `Kosovo A` plant are weak operating conditions and with very
small production (below the parameters installed), as a result of defects of unexpected breakdowns and
seniority of the blocks. Blocks A1 and A2 are out of order, and emergency repairs and overhauls and

capital are made in blocks A3 (in 2006), in A4 (in 2007) and A5 in 2008. The status of `Kosovo A` power
plant blocks will be based on the study of decommissioning (2010), Energy Strategy of Kosovo from
2009 to 2018, the building blocks of new power plant `Kosova e Re` and the decisions of the
Government regarding the provision of electricity supply to consumer .
In both blocks of `Kosovo B` decreased power assets due to injuries throughout the CTU turbine rotors,
therefore, in Block B1 net maximum power is 240 MW, while in the B2 280 MW. Production capacities
of these two blocks will increase significantly, up to level 290 to 300 MW, after being replaced the CTU
rotors in two turbines and the generator in Block B1 in 2010.
Hydro plant Ujmani (or Gazivoda with 2 X 17.5 MW = 35 MW), is the only and most important crrently
in the Kosovo power system that uses water Resource, which is managed by the Public Company
"Hydro-System Ibar - Lepenc "(February Ile HS). But, as far as other small plants, as in Lumbardh,
Dikancë, in Istok and Radavc, are developed reactivation activities or lease during the years 2004 - 2009


Total capacity of net production in Kosovo, about 970 MW at the end of 2009, were from TPP Kosovo A
402 MW, 525 MW Kosovo B, HC of Ujmani 35 MW and other Hydroelectric 8.5 MW distribution
network. It should be noted that during 10 years is observed pronounced changes in the structure of
energy consumption between different categories of consumers.




Transfer of Electricity Power
Transmission system is managed by JSC KOSTT (Transmission System Operator and Market)., Kosovo
operator for electricity. Kosovo is a contracting party to the regional Energy Community and is
connected to the regional system through interconnections with Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro and
Albania.
Kosovo also is located in the central north-south trajectory transmission network in the region of
Southeast Europe (SEE), and is important for energy power flows to and from Serbia, Macedonia and
Greece. The decrease of any segment of these transmission lines has a negative impact on energy flows
in the region of SEE. JSC KOSTT no shortage of investment due to lack of funding in past periods, and
now has enough transmission capacity to cover peak demand, during winter periods.
The total length of transmission lines (400 kV, 220 kV and 110 kV) is 1098.6 km with 2550 MVA
transformation capacity. The system of transmission lines is back in operation after repairs carried out
after the war, as are also built new substations (for example, as he 400 / 110 kV in Pec). Transmission
network of 400 NGOs and 220 kV power system within Kosovo is an integral part of regional
interconnected system of transmission.




Supply, billing and collection of electricity
The electricity network covers 100% of Kosovo customer demands for the power supply. Electricity
production is below existing capacity of the current requirements, so some of it is covered by imports.
Electric network in 2009 were 406.610 customers connected to 5.271 GWh gross annual expense.
The main challenges and prerequisites for stabilizing the power supply, attracting investments in
various sectors and economic development of Kosovo in general, are commercial losses, efficiency
billing,, and regular non-payment of electricity. Commercial losses (abuse and non-payment by the
Serbian minority) are still extremely high level in about 25%. This condition must be reduced and
eliminated by legal measures. Realization of payments billed of electrical energy is consumed at levels
of 81%. Failure of payment and abuse are around level 35%, or about 65% is realized the bill payment ,
comparing with energy available for sale.

For lack of sufficient development, network of electrical power distribution is in good operation, in
order to withstand the excessive supply of consumption with maximum loads, as in lines and
substations in winter periods. Technical losses in 2006 were 18.2%, while in 2008 they fall to 17.1%.
Commercial losses are still high with a slow decreasing trend over the years, which in 2006 were
29.18%, and in 2008 appear to be 25.8%.


Environmental Protection
Final Report of the Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA22) was completed in
November 2008, after consultations with experts and the public. In this report identified the strategic
level issues and environmental and social impacts associated with the existing situation and the
development of the energy and lignite in the wider region of the new mine plan. SESA's report
explores and examines the results of strategic solutions, which the Government of Kosovo (on the
objectives of the Energy Strategy) and the investor, in the future should take adequate steps in the
context of improving the situation of supply and development projects new capital in the energy
sector. The most important options of development of environmental and social perspectives are
examined and related to the location of new power plant construction, layout and dynamics of the
mine development, plant size blocks, selection and advancement of technology development project to
the demand level of energy production and remaining life of existing plants in operation and especially
the TC Kosovo A.
Referring to the Basic Environmental and Social Study, environmental studies and the current
situation, the report reaches the conclusion that the environmental situation in the energy area is very
complex for several reasons:
Environmental situation is profoundly affected by mining activities from the past, which have also
caused significant modifications in the field space;
       Air quality is poor due to emissions from existing power plants, built with old technology and
       standards that are inconsistent with current standards of the EU;
       sustained quality of soil and groundwater from the ash storage and other waste and Drainage
       activity facilities, gasification and Nitrogen in the past;
       Surface water quality is affected by discharges of untreated urban sewage and industrial (power
       plants, mining activities etc);
       Noise emissions from mining activities are annoying to people living near the surface mining;
       Lack and inefficient environmental control (or non-efficiency control) in terms of water and air;
       There is no formal procedure for managing (mosmenaxhim) of water in industrial locations;
       Poor management of regional waste landfill and outside environmental standards, etc.


Treatment of carbon dioxide emission (CG2). - Republic of Kosovo is committed to participating ratify
in the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol, since it now takes part in the post-Kyoto discussion. Support of
GEF / UNDP for MESP, which concerns the preparation of first national communications, that is
supported aso by MEM.
Kosovo is constantly committed to timely implement the obligation to comply with emission quotas
permitted by its power plant. It would require private operators of new generating facilities, to respect,
in line with market conditions, all the commitments that Kosovo will take part by participating in the
agreements mentioned above.

Agricultural land
Given the sustainable development of the economy and the Kosovo Government based on the
approved Energy Strategy has prioritized the development of energy sector by opening a new mine
and construction of New power plant `Kosova e Re`- New Kosovo.
It is evident that Kosovo can build a secure future by developing the energy sector based on the use of
coal while respecting the principles of sustainable development and preservation of agricultural land.
In Kosovo, energy sector development, should consist in addition to obtaining electricity from burning
of coal and use renewable energy resources such as water resources, wind, biomass, solar, etc. ..
New Mining Field, is characterized by the use of large areas of agricultural land to conduct mining
activities, which simultaneously causes the degradation of full or temporary use of land for agricultural
sub-sectors.
Actions and activities which will be held in FMR (NMF) that as a result will bring changes to the
designation of agricultural land are:
     Opening of the new mine (in the "C" or Sibovc center);
     Setting up equipment for the transportation of coal and plumbing pipes to transport the ash;
     Restoring displaced habitats in new areas of agricultural land;
     Pollution of agricultural land around the plant from the dust that comes out of chimneys, from
     acid rain and ash from landfills (which are estimated to have a radius of action in the agricultural
     lands around).

1.5. SWOT ANALYSIS




Based on current data on the existing state of spatial development, according to different sectors within
this area, is designed and presented in addition, the instrument or tool known as SWOT analysis (this
acronym in English that shows Strengthenes - Strengths, Weaknesses - Weaknesses, opportunities -
Opportunities and Threatens - Risks or threats) for the FMR area (NMF)-of. If we want to have the
abbreviation of this analysis in Albanian, when the downside - that are similar to the disadvantages,
the advantages - are the Advantages, Threats - Risks and Opportunities - are Chances, then analyzes of
the abbreviation would be called – “Analysis MARrSh”.
SWOT (MARrSh in Albanian) Analysis, built with the information arising from developmental profile
as the stage (or chapter) first, gives a clearer picture of the results on the existing condition of the area
and helps a lot to the next stage, planning developments, the process of drafting the Spatial Strategic
Plan.
The data listed and on the shortcomings / weaknesses and the advantages / advantages of the area,
are information arising from the internal point of view and influence, which inform the public about
the real situation and guide decision-makers and experts to guide Development Planning for the next
area of interest.
While the data come from the perspective and the influence of external or international one, are data
that inform the public and guide decision-makers and experts of planning, to care about the interests
that may arise in the form of threats and opportunities in case of non-enforcement or implementation
of future developments planned for the space of the area of interest.

1.6. EVALUATION OF INVESTMENT CAPACITY


Investments in the energy sector in the period 1999-2008
Capacity assessment of the potential investment is research and resources available to finance
development plans and policies for a defined territory for development. The results of these tests
should be used as the basis of data that will enable the identification of opportunities for investment in
the territory concerned. Based on these opportunities, is created a more realistic picture of the selection
of projects and programs that will be specific to the area. These investments consist of capacities: the
capacity of public sector, the private, public-private partnership (PPP), loans and grants, international
funds, donations, etc.
In the case of special interest area economic - "the New Mining Field”, in terms of investment and the
interest of overall development of the area, the situation is not definitive set accurately. Besides several
project-investment plans with clear values that come from mining and energy sector has not draft plans
from other sectors with the capacity or ratings specified investments. Clarity on the capacity of
investment in energy and mining sector, is based on research - and the obligations of previous research
conducted under the supervision of the Government as well as direct information from the Ministry of
Energy and Mines.
Naturally, because of the difficult economic situation, that is facing the Republic of Kosovo versus to
low level of its public budget, are planned developments carried out in partnership with the private
sector, which will cover mostpart of investments
 Condition of facilities and systems in the energy sector, inherited after the war, has required
substantial financial resources of around 320 million €. This amount has served only for activation,
correcting the situation created in the period 1990-1999, to continue the work of objects with reduced
capacity in the sector of coal, electricity and heat.
Since the end of 1999 to 2008, except their own means of KEK and heating companies, the energy sector
has received approximately 1.052 million € in the form of subsidies, of which € 459 million from the
Kosovo budget (BK) and 593 € million from donors (of which € 415 million from the European Agency
for Reconstruction - EAR, European Commission, KFW, etc.).. These funds are spent for: import of
electricity, operation, maintenance (the sector of coal, power plants, transmission, distribution and
purchase of fuel for heating systems) and elimination of consequences of the fire at Kosovo B Power
Plant and slippage of measures of coal mine overburden in Bardhi in 2002. Allocations of BK of about
70 million € / year, during the last three years constituted 11% of all expenditures. This financial
support has supported on extensive production and steadily increasing each year, thanks to the
production of coal (from the opening of the mine 'Sitnica') and electricity (from overhauls in three
blocks of power plant `Kosova A`).
However, as a result of increased consumption and poor performance of consumer control and
distribute energy collection, KEK, JSC, had negative impacts on public finances and business
environment. Whereas, the Kosovo Energy Corporation, because of inability to import electricity and
poor quality of services provided, to the Kosovo economy causes huge costs remain expensive burden
on the shoulders of the Kosovo Budget. Thus, in addition spent a considerable portion of donations for
Kosovo, non-regular supply of electricity, is often considered as the biggest barrier of foreign
investments in Kosovo.
The current situation in the Central Heating Systems is the same, almost entirely, as with the electricity
sector.
In Table 12, as follows, are given the costs incurred in the energy sector, overall and divided by the
investor, during the nine years from 2000 to 2008

Table 12. Total expenditures for the energy sector (in million €)- Source: PATEL / MEM

This support has continued in 2009, when costs for the energy sector amounted to 9.4% of the total
budget for that year.
Key Features of the energy sector in the period 1999-2009 is constructed facilities operating in the
period 1962-1984, the current standard of time and in different periods, which are not maintained and
are not revitalized during certain periods. Some of them are end of life (Kosovo A power plant, coal
mines Mirash and Bardhi), and several are out of operation and the undefined status (industrial
heating, gasification, nitration) and do not meet today's environmental standards.




Evaluation of planned investments in the energy sector for 2010 - 2020
In the framework of Energy Strategy for the period 2009-2018 and its Implementation Programs for the
period 2009-2011, the security of stable supply of electricity in Kosovo is a high priority of supporting
economic development.
Security of supply of electricity consumption in different periods, advance the development of the New
Mining for the supply of existing units, construction of new generating capacity for replacing the
capacity that arise from the production, social and environmental regulation are a key priorities of
Government of Kosovo.
Kosovo Energy Strategy identifies: the state of existing facilities, plans and actions with regard to their
status in different periods, the relevant development projects and the implementation period. Besides
maintenance of existing facilities, major energy developments in Kosovo, are also the realization of
capital investments such as the opening of the new mine coal, the rehabilitation of Kosovo B power
plant and construction of the New Kosovo and supporting facilities planned in the period 2010-2020 to
be constructed in a special area "of the New Mining Field."
 The project "New Mining and lignite power plant “Kosova e Re" planned to be built in phases, in
which the first stage 600 (2 x 300) MW and the entry into commercial work in 2015/16 which replaces
the production of power plant Kosovo A. Phase two other capacities of 600 (2 x 300) MW till the year
2020, eliminates import of electricity that meets the growing demand, supply consumption stabilizes in
the long run and significantly improves the environmental situation. The third phase with capacities
up to 1 000 MW, which depends on local and regional requirements, may be in operation after the year
2025 that enables the replacement of Kosovo B power plant after the end of his life, for long-term.
Implementing the project "New Mining of coal and power plant “Kosova e Re" means capital
investment and additional investment objects presented in Table 13.

Short description of investment by sector capacity present in the area
The agricultural sector in spite of abundant surface of arable land, there is no clear plan of
development. The reason is the energy sector and developments that are taking place in this regard.
These developments make it unclear and hesitant commitment to the development of agriculture. The
only information that relates to this sector will be the commitment to cleaning and Rehabilitation
Project of the Earth (PPRT) that is focused on folding of wasteland and ash dump TPP Kosovo A,
which will directly affect the growth of the fund agricultural land.
All investments required in terms of technical infrastructure will be part of accounts and plans that
should be envisaged in the project's TCKR. Additional investment in terms of infrastructure will be
realized by building roads needed to link the new settlements to be populated by villagers deployed.
Data on investment in social infrastructure (services, education facilities, health, religious worship and
other services), based on information are insufficient. Building new capacity will be achieved in new
dwellings, which will be created with the relocation of population from the mining area.
So far is not made any reasonable calculation that will help us extract the approximate cost of
investment in the realization of cultural and natural heritage as other matters which require addition
attention. Identified are several problems of which most of sensitivity worth is the monuments
deployment. So far, referring to the environmental situation in the area, but also from the information
available, is not making any substantial investment in this sector as one of the most sensitive.
Calculating municipal investment capacity - in the area of FMR (NMF) is difficult for the fact that all
municipal development guidelines are directed outside and as far from the area.

1.7. MAJOR CHALLENGES BASED ON PROBLEMS AND FOUND ISSUES


Based on to- date analysis on the existing situation, noted that problems and issues which have
confronted, in the area with special economic interests "of the New Mining Field," are numerous. They
are grouped and separated according to their scope, in the so-called key challenges on which continued
the work of the sub-working group in drafting this plan. This plan, in future chapters, will offer
possible solutions to problems grouped in these four challenges listed as follows:


1.       Providing electricity for the long term - grouped issues in this challenge are dealing with the
problems of investment and location selected for the New TPP Kosovo, the most advanced technology,
the installed production capacity to fulfill the requirements, etc.


2.     Relocation and quality of community life - grouped issues in this challenge dealing with
problems over the manner and methodology for developing implementation process for relocation of
the community.


3.      Exploitation of natural resources - grouped issues in this challenge dealing with problems on
the use of coal resources and water potential.


4.      Environmental situation - grouped issues in this challenge dealing with problems about
upgrading and rehabilitation of environmental elements (air, water and soil) and degraded areas and
other potential use of wind, gas, solar, biomass, etc.

2. VISION-BASED IN CHALLENGE, PRINCIPLES AND TARGETS


N      ew Mining Field will incur a high degree of transformation of space which will be used for
       power generation from lignite. The duration of these developments of at least 50 years went into
       developing long-term appointments in the region. The exploitation of lignite in the New Mining
Field, as long-term process, will be a gradual transformation of the high degree developed alongside
with the advancing mining and construction of power plant `Kosova e Re`. Parallel to these
developments, the popular activities during the process of mining and power generation should be
treated and provided acceptable solutions for social and environmental problems, which turn out to be
the result of such developments.
During the development of this part, the Vision, which is a realizable dream, where achieving its main
development challenges based on established international principles and targets constructed from
aimed -Target, which must be met with defined objectives and supported with government priorities.
These objectives should be acceptable in terms of social and environmental measures in line with
economic development, and with the development of energy, Kosovo.
Problems and issues encountered and grouped within the challenges, as the result will have the actions
(both measures, activities or projects) that contribute to sustainable development of the energy sector
(in mining and generation), displacement-resettlement acceptable to the community, and rehab
cleaning (photo 9) spaces from pollution and degradation of the past in full alignment with the rates
allowed under EU Directives.

2.1. MAJOR CHALLENGES BASED ON THE PRIORITIES OF THE GOVERNMENT
AND INTERNATIONAL PRINCIPLES


Future development of Kosovo, in the long term, is based on regional integration, on socio-economic
cohesion and territorial as well as cross-border cooperation. The Kosovo Future economic
development, bases in energy sector development through the production of electricity by exploiting
its natural resources.
Problems collected, are grouped and separated according to their scope, in the so-called Main
Development Challenges, on which basis has continued the work of sub-working group in drafting this
plan. This plan, in future chapters, will offer possible solutions to problems grouped into these
challenges listed as follows:
1. Providing electricity for the long term - issues grouped in this challenge dealing with problems on
   selecting the investor, the location for T CKR, more advanced technology, the installed capacity in
   “Kosovo Re”-TC, rehabilitation of `Kosovo B` and the development of transmission network for
   electricity in Kosovo.
2. Displacement and quality of community life - issues grouped in this challenge dealing with
   problems about finding ways and methodologies for developing satisfactory implementation of
   software processes for expropriation, displacement and projects that provide a more qualitative
   community.
3. The use of natural resources - issues grouped in this challenge dealing with problems over security
   and sustainable use of coal resources, water potential, wind, gas, solar, biomass, geothermal, etc..
4. Environmental situation - issues grouped in this challenge dealing with problems about upgrading
   and rehabilitation of environmental elements (air, water and soil) and degraded areas.




2.1.1. CHALLENGE 1: ELECTRICITY PROVIDE


Why and what is challenging?
Historically, energy and mining have been the pillars of the Kosovo economy, providing direct and
indirect employment, sources of income, export earnings, as well as inputs for the industries sector.
However, from being contributors to economic growth that is based on the low level of utilization of
coal resource potential in a source without renovation that so far only 3% capacity are used.
In addition, in the period 1999 - 2009 unstable supply of electricity has emerged as one of the main
obstacles to development in Kosovo's economy and attracting investment. Kosovo continues to suffer
from irregular cuts, electricity imports too expensive and that different research companies have
reported that the lack of stable electricity supply is one of the main obstacles to their functioning.
The problems and challenges which are identified through analysis of historical development and
trends of energy demand and its coverage in the future in Kosovo are as following:
    Economic development of the country, steadily increasing demand, outdated technology to
    produce electricity, power plant Kosova A very close to closing, the growth of electricity demand,
    replacement of old power plants, in the certain periods require a serious approach in planning and
    taking the decision for urgent construction of new units for production of energy.

                The Spatial Plan for the Special Economic Interest Area "New Mining Field"                             91


     Security of supply of consumer self-independent and by eliminating the import of electricity in the
     long run, can be achieved with the use of domestic energy resources where primary production is
     expected to be based on the use of lignite.
     In addition to building power plants, coal combustion with advanced technology, can be
     developed in parallel activities in the construction of HPP in Zhur by concession and other
     renovation sources.
     Pressure on the energy sector can be reduced by saving energy, its efficient use, building heating
     systems in urban areas, regular payment of electricity and heat, while also providing other types
     of energy for energy consumption in Kosovo.


What are the opportunities identified ?
According to studies carried out in a very long period based on the current state of the energy and
environmental situation, the recommendations are that the production of electricity in the future in
Kosovo shall be based primarily on the use of local energy resources while ensuring the sovereignty,
energy independence and security of supply.
Local sources of energy with coal, hydro-potential and other renewable sources can meet the demands
of Kosovo's electricity in the long term. With the construction of power plant `Kosova e Re`, building a
new coal mine to supply existing and new capacity, can ensure the disconnection of old power plants
at certain times and meeting the increasing demands, in view of economic development .
Results of SESA's Report of 2008 for the construction of power plant `Kosova e Re` up to 2,000 MW
recommend first industrial location near the TPP` Kosovo A` or location following the `Kosovo B` and
that simultaneously does not prefer the use of green sites .
Preferably in terms of technology use CFB technology (burning in the fluid layer) or PF (burning with
particularity in the form of dust) with sub or super critical parameters with high efficiency and
commercially proven technology..
Current state of the environment requires the clear addressing and implementation of programs and
projects to reduce environmental impact so that it does not become an obstacle to future development
of the energy sector. Protecting the environment during project implementation will be based
exclusively on the LPCD (Large Combustion Plant Directive or Directive for large combustion plants),
which directive currently used for planning and building blocks for new power plants in Europe.


What say international agreements related to energy ?
As Kosovo is a signatory to the Tractate of Establishing the Energy Community (ECT) of Eastern
Europe, in this context, the Kosovo Government is committed substantially to develop the energy
sector in accordance with the requirements of ECT.
Energy Community Tractate requires from contracting parties to implement important parts of the
acquis communautaire, provides for the creation of a single energy market and the mechanism for
operation of energy markets that was transmitted through networks


Issues identified:
     Unstable supply of electricity and security of supply
     Continued increasing demand for energy
     Selection and definition of technology with high efficiency, minimal environmental impact and
     technology commercially confirmed.
     Current location as suitable for the TC's building “New Kosovo”
     Price low to produce acceptable lignite and electricity
     Use of renewable resources
     Disconnection of old power plants at certain times
     Environmental obligations under the ECT.

2.1.2. CHALLENGE 2: DISPLACEENT AND LIFE QUALITY OF COMMUNITY


Why and what is challenging ?
 The expropriation of immovable property in the area identified as areas "of the New Mining Field"
presents a challenge that should be dealt with seriously. Assembly adopted the Law on Expropriation
of real property which explicitly set forth the procedural arrangements in dealing with expropriation
and also aims to respect international standards of relocation based on World Bank operational policies
412 (non-voluntary resettlement ) and human rights in general, through drafting resettlement policy
framework.
Relocation is a challenge in itself and so far it appears as a major challenge in treating this spatial plan
for the area of special economic interest. Displacement as a process in the past is presented as a black
hole in the development of the projects of interest to Kosovo. Kosovo has no adequate legislation on the
treatment of displacement of population, but the same is intended to fix by the relocation policy
document. Within MESP is drafted the Resettlement Policy Framework (KPZH) that is designed for
shift which reflects the practices and the best international standards for the protection 23, relocation
allowances and conditions of the population and will be implemented by the Private Project Company.
For each phase of population displacement is drawn up the Action Plan for relocation, which should be
in accordance with World Bank Operational Policies and Principles 412 Ecuador - PS Performance
Standard 5. Project Company shall be responsible for the transfer of financial costs on the
implementation of action plan for resettlement.
Challenge in itself is the definition of new sites, respectively, re-deployment in other areas
(approximately 850 to 950 residential units with about 4000 residents of Hade village, Leshkoshiq
(Leshkoshiq (Lajthisht)), Sibovc, and Shipitullë have to relocate by protecting all the specifics of the
community in the physical sense - the apartment building with accompanying elements, economic and
socio-economic development and social activities, maintaining family compactness etc.). Municipal
Assemblies areas affected by the project do not have enough public property to a destination of
construction because the land are owned by the former cooperatives and agricultural combines that
are now privatized and are owned by individuals since the period of 99 years, and also the properties
public utilities are in smaller quantities than many requirements that must be offered residents.
If is supposed to be transferred the displaced from Obiliq to other municipalities, is the same problem
with the properties and also would establish an un-balancing in demographic terms - reducing the
number of residents in Obiliq and increase the number of residents in another municipality that will
affect all spheres of development in the municipality or municipalities concerned


What are the opportunities identified ?
      To draft the laws on determining the methodology for calculating the compensation of the
      expropriated property and damages that have to do with the expropriation, in accordance with
      the law on expropriation of immovable property. These laws must develop the Ministry of
      Economy and Finance as an important precondition for adequate enforcement of this law.
      Develop special law which would address the issue of displacement as a whole.
      Include the Government on the quality of supervisors during the relocation process

Issues identified:
It is important to note that the expropriation of land and displacement are inseparable parts when it
comes to mining operations. There are high costs and is one of the most challenging and complex that
must be addressed. Immediate priority, which must be closed before the mine fields Sibovc can be
opened, is to perform the relocation of Hade village. This already is a priority of the Government, as
part of the village was being banged on Mirash mine as a result of mismanagement of previous mining
operations.
Expropriation and resettlement should be applied across all aspects of lignite mining and power
project. This would include the expropriation of land for mining operations and other associated
equipment, by including the land which would be required for offices, warehouses, raw material,
wasteland and road passing.
Some of the issues identified which will be affected by the expropriation and displacement are:
     Loss of land: when a part of the whole or significant soil is lost, the population will lose incomes
     and in many cases even supplying them with food (fruits, vegetables, milk). During the process of
     moving to another country will lose at least the fruit;
     Loss of houses: As loses home as physical structure, people will also lose other associated services,
     such as water supply, roads access and electricity;
     Loss of Business: Small businesses can be affected by the loss of business location and loss of
     customers, particularly regular;
     Loss of employment: If a business is affected by the closure then we have job losses and as a result
     of relocation to any other space people could lose their jobs because of the far distance that could
     be established;
     Loss of heritage and cultural services: These include loss of access to other facilities such as
     schools, clinics, mosques, cemeteries, war memorials, and other.




2.1.3. CHALLENGE 3: USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES


Why and what is challenging?
Kosovo possesses considerable mineral energy resources. In the longer term as a resource of lignite
mining will remain the main source for electricity production in Kosovo.
“Lignite reserves in Kosovo found in two larger basins, labeled "Kosovo" and "Dukagjini” and several
small basins. Geological reserves of lignite are estimated to be about 14 billion tons (including all
categories of reserves).
Kosovo Lignite is newone and has low sulfur content, relatively good concentrations of lime (calcium
oxide) to absorb a portion of sulfur during combustion process. Relationship between overburden and
lignite is very favorable, a fact which makes surface mining economically attractive for use with low
cost.
In previous studies in the basin "Kosova" are identified several areas of exploitation and development
that are ranked based on the amount and conditions of exploitation (ratio Wasteland: lignite).
Based on the amount and conditions of exploitation, for the basin "Kosovo" is defined Zone C ("Sibovc"
or "New Mining Field") that offers more favorable conditions for exploitation of surface.
Based on the analysis so far, the opening of a new lignite mine in Area C "New Mining Area" in terms
of economic, social and environmental is acceptable. For this, the beginning of opening and entry into
production of this mining has significant advantages.




                                                                                    MESP - Spatial Plannig Institute
      94                                      The Spatial Plan for the Special Economic Interest Area "New Mining Field"



The problems and challenges which are identified through analysis of natural resource development
and trends specifically required in the coal mines are:
     Increasing demand for lignite as a only resource for the moment for the generation of electricity,
     Rational use of resources of lignite,
     Coal price volatility and increased cost of production,
     Competition of the electricity market growing
     Conflicts over land ownership,
     Continuous improvement and completion of the legal and fiscal
     Preparation of capable human resources for management of open pit mining,
     Environmental protection,
     Increase safety of the workers in the mining sector,
     Recovery of exploited areas (see photo 10) in space conducive to adequate further use
     Continued growth of the derivatives Prizes of oil and natural gas in the world market and
     political implications


What are the opportunities identified?
Sustainable development is such development that satisfies the needs of today but does not jeopardize
future generations and their needs. Lignite resources in the new field area (area "C") of mine are
estimated to be about one billion tons and are an asset (wealth) of considerable Kosovo that would
enable the provision of electricity production at existing facilities and development of the new power
capacity to 2000 MW installed and their operation during the next four decades, and that this represent
only 1 / 10 of total lignite resources in Kosovo.


Identified issues:
     Irrational exploitation of natural resources-coal,
     The emission of dust particles and gases during mining activities,
     Not enough training of personnel for the management of natural resources-coal,
     Loss of agricultural land surfaces,
     Not performed the recovery of land damaged by mining activities, not done re-cultivation of
     current mining surface,
     Not implementing the legislation in the mining sector,
     Insecurity in the work of workers in the mining sector.

2.1.4. CHALLENGE 4: THE ENVIRONMENTAL STATE


Why and what is challenging ?
Concentration of capacity to extract, transport and storage of coal as well as existing power plants with
outdated technology for production of electricity with current emissions create a highly polluted area
of the environment. Surface extension of existing facilities and overburden dumps are huge and all
together have completely changed the landscape of the area.
In the vicinity of TC A-there is a old and abandoned industrial zone, where had operated drying
facilities, industrial heating, gasification and nitrofication until more than two decades. The impact of
previous activities (including drainage, gasification and Nitrofication) today manifested as
contaminated and infiltration of metals and salts in soils, resulting in contamination of rivers and
surface water. Thus, the actual contamination of rivers and surface water does not occur only as a
result of current activities.
Chapter of SESA's report on Environmental and Social Studies Basicly reaches the conclusion that the
environmental situation in the area of interest is too complex for some reason:
     Environmental situation is profoundly affected by mining activities from the past, which have also
     caused significant modifications in the field;
     Air quality is poor due to emissions from existing power plants, which do not comply with EU
     standards, due to awareness of lignite and particulates emissions from dumps, which constitute
     the main source of air pollution;
     Water resources are attacked by the impacts and competing demands for water to different users,
     which is reflected by the occasional interruptions in the supply of drinking water during the
     summer months.
     The quality of soil and land mass has undergone extensive deposition of ash and other waste from
     the operation of Nitrogen and gasification facilities in the past.
     Surface water quality has suffered serious impact from spills of untreated wastewater from power
     plants, mining activities and urban sewage;
     Noise emissions from mining activities are annoying to people living along the borders of mine;
     Lack and ineffective environmental controls or their inefficiency (in terms of water and air);
     There are no formal procedures for water management in industrial locations


Existing environmental issues should be handled with the highest priority
Based on the existing situation on the ground and according to the conclusions of the Final Report
approved by SESA-2008, one of the continuing challenges will also be the return of occupied
agricultural areas and areas inhabited ago to return to the re-use. Reclamation of land which are
already stored or gray wasteland occupied important place in the action plans and various projects for
long term. It is extremely challenging to restore a state of the front of this surface after the completion
of activities for lignite from mines that are still operational.
In chapter of basic SESA's report also discussed the issue of water supply as a potentially limiting
factor for the development of the project and also for the area of particular interest. Although water
supply is confirmed as ready to support the proposed project, Ibar-Lepenci system currently faces
problems of commercial losses of great foun water (up to 40%) in the main channel. If not resolved this
problem will remain so because of competing demands for water supply that is likely to occur in long-
term future. This condition imposes the development of a comprehensive policy framework,
institutional and planning for water resources management in the Hydro-system Iber-Lepenc.

Lack of accurate data on the level of direct emissions to air from chimneys of power plants Kosovo A,
which are in function of 26 to 48 years is quite challenging. Inefficient work of electro- filtrates of these
plants is found in almost every report, study or assessment of the causes of air pollution around them.
Slightly better condition of electro-filtrating is installed in power plants Kosovo B. For both these
complex energy systems is challenging the lack of continual monitoring of emissions at source. For
both plants responses to environmental staff makes calculating the specific emission level, in order to
provide information on emissions of SG2, NOx, PM10, CG2, the amounts of ash and water expenses
processor.
Air quality monitored by the Institute INKOS by simply manner (2 measuring points) and National
Institute of Public Health (with a measuring point). In all three monitoring points defined: SG2, dust
and soot as PM10
Waste in the Area of Economic Interest notified in various forms and they are as a result of working in
mines, in power generation and waste from chemical industry processes (Gasification, nitrogen and
Drainage). Smaller quantities of waste are the product of burning coal, which can not be avoided, but
there are numerous methods by which it is possible to be reduced.
Particular problem and extreme poses the regional waste landfill inmining Mirash (without selection
landfill of waste from households and urban areas and not good management).
Historically there is no data from the monitoring of noise level, although the level of noise as for the
employees and the residents in the vicinity of the energy capacity is considered a key aspect to be
addressed during the development of new mines and power plants.
Despite the fact that in the area of special economic interest there is no protected area or biodiversity
study, however, when considering the degradation of a surface as large, is considered disturbing the
overall changes that inevitably disrupt the ecological balance in the whole area.


Opportunities identified
     Improved situational and environmental monitoring and development of environmental
     management systems. Any increase in emissions in the air should be avoided before the existing
     TC-repaired in accordance with international standards and air quality to be improved;
     A system of air emission reduction should be studied and implemented in the power plant
     Kosova A and B together with the developments planned for the New Kosovo power plant;
     Ash disposal system needs to be done by TC Plumbing Kosovo A (in order to avoid impact on air
     quality that is associated with active disposal of dry ash);
     The banks stocks side of grace should flatten and the newly formed surfaces of the renewed
     vegetation in order to avoid further dust emissions.
     Installation of air monitoring, water, soil and noise for the entire area of special interest designed
     for development of energy capacities.
     Initiation of a study on noise to draw comparison with applicable standards and to ascertain
     possible incompatibility and the measures needed to protect workers and residents of this
     sensitive phenomenon.
     Regular review of policies and environmental practices.
     Preparation and implementation of waste management. Exploring the possibility of using fly ash
     (eg cement, road construction, etc..).
     Review of Regional Project mining dump Mirash
The best way to manage waste incineration is the use of ash as a substitute for sand, gravel and other
natural materials for cement in manufacturing industry, road building, filling the used mines and for
using it as buffer zone for the road. The second solution and also more efficient elimination of ash and
overburden is the return of their vacancies in existing mining surface.
Among the concrete projects which are working, is the treatment of waste from coal gasification
process which together with the return of ashes from the landfill Kosovo A and B in the spaces of

In this case, the Spatial Plan for the New Mining Field, except that rely on local legal and institutional
framework for its design, is in accordance with the principles from other emerging international norms,
especially those of the European Union.
General principles, which is consistent and finds support in the strategic plan for the protection and
development of the area of special economic interest of FMR (NMF)-, can be stated as follows:
     The legal framework on spatial planning in Kosovo. - Spatial Plan for the area of special
     economic interest 'of the New Mining Field' is the strategic plan that should undergo a strategic
     planning process.
     Sustainable Development and equitable in all the territory of Kosovo;
     Promotion of equal economic rights for all Kosovars and the protection of the heritage of
     natural resources. - In accordance with the Energy Strategy of Kosova, will be aiming to use
     lignite, as is the local resource for producing and supplying electricity to Kosovo.
     Balancing between urban and rural areas. - Increased Quality of life by providing dynamic
     model of sustainable rural development by developing and give value to key sectors within the
     area.
     Promotion of transparency and accessibility in providing data;
     The principle of inclusiveness;
     Promoting the democratic process-stakeholders- participation;

      104                                    The Spatial Plan for the Special Economic Interest Area "New Mining Field"



The fact that the area "of the New Mining Field" is announced by the Government of the Republic of
Kosovo as “SEIA (ZIVE)”, Special Economic Interest Area, orientates towards economic development
through energy sector by utilizing resources from the mining of lignite reserves available in the
country. Although, this economic development is necessary, should be treated within the sustainable
development, while not ignoring other associated developments both in social as well as for
environmental.
The concept of spatial development, with its name and identification mark "Trefoil and Propeller",
presented as in Fig. 16, implies and expresses the spatial future developments planned in the area with
special economic interests "of the New Mining Field." Scheme of this concept means that developments
mentioned are ongoing processes and symbolizes the four goals of the vision of the Spatial Plan.
While, on one side, the aim of the run progress (or delta) of continuous processes in the function of
insurance and supply of blocks with coal and the generation, transmission and distribution of
electricity, and it is expressed by the "propeller" (where the its axis keeps in motion rotation of the three
Elises.
Also, with "Alfalfa" (Clover or Lucerne) is expressed the best quality of life during and after
anticipated operation developments, including the planning of settlements with the relocation -
resettlement of population from new areas of mining and rehabilitation of environment and cleaner
ecology (with r e-cultivation of degraded areas) on the other side.
Generation Center with its capabilities (old and new ones to be built) for the production and
distribution of electricity, is located between the area of special economic interest, pointing at the same
time, the center of the FMR (NMF) and it is also a center "Trefoil (ecological symbol - natural plant
centripetal and" propeller "(character development push - centrifugal motor power).
Of course, even in translating on other foreign languages, will be called as "Alfalfa & Delta", and
associated in the same sense of the development of competitive processes - to increase the quality of life
along with increased vegetation and flow generating potential production and supply of electricity,
and will emphasize the framework of future fundamental spatial developments in area within "the
New Mining Field."


Through this concept is attempted
     Planning and development of spatial interconnected and coordinated between Thematic Areas
     based on the key challenges (summarized issues) included in the area of special economic interest
     Harmonization and coordination between the central to local government during the
     implementation of concrete projects and control of developments within and outside the border
     zone,
     Selection of activities according to priorities and implications for spatial, temporal and budgetary
     and institutional capacity and
     Achievement of the desired future development of spatial planning, in compliance with
     predetermined Vision for the FMR (NMF) area of (when the actions and activities arising from the
     concept of "Trefoil and Propeller" that are aimed)

3.2. STRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT ACCORDING TO CONCEPT


The concept of "Trefoil (Alfalfa) and Propeller", in the first case is the trefoil plant (clover or lucerne)
with its three petals that express the tendency for one much cleaner environment and ecological
potential in the area, whereas in the second case it is the propeller in constant rotation to express flows
push forward other powerful developments. Here, easily is distinguished activitie that will take place
during processes like those of expropriation, compensation, the relocation - resettlement of population
from the settlements in the new mining area, planning and control over developments in Kosovo basin,
the extraction and supply lignite-fired power plants, manufacturing and security of electricity supply
and rehabilitation of degraded areas and reclamation of land areas for the use of new agricultural and
forestry.
Obviously, the concept of future development for the area of spatial special economic interest "of the
New Mining Field" can be clarified, understood and more easily accomplished when the general
structure of its share (derivates) in some sub-structures, based in the challenges and goals, as follows.




3.2.1. SAFE PRODUCTION AND SUPPLIES OF ELECTRICITY AND HEAT


Energy sector development is a necessity for overall economic development and stable country. In
order to develop sustainable energy sector, the Government of Kosovo, in the absence of own
investment capacity, plans to involve the expertise and private capital from abroad. World Bank
through Project of Lignite Power and Technical Assistance (PATEL) 24, is supporting the Kosovo in its
efforts to lure investments for development of the project "New Kosovo". The orientation of the
development of this project is based on the demand for production and stable supply of electricity in
the energy sector strategies, as well as research studies to date in this field

 PATEL main objectives are: (a) supporting the Government in strengthening the policy, legal and regulatory framework that
24


enable new investments in the energy sector, and (b) supporting the Government to attract qualified private investors to build
power plant new lignite, based on the principles of high environmental and social sustainability.

           106                                  The Spatial Plan for the Special Economic Interest Area "New Mining Field"



For implementation as easy and functional the project "New Kosovo" is divided into sub-sectors or
thematic araes, of which are distinguished:
      1.    Development of the new field of mining to supply the two existing plants and new power
            Plant `Kosova e Re`
      2.    Building new power TC KR (`New Kosovo`)
      3.    Private Sector Participation in Kosovo B power plant
      4.    Construction of power plants using renewable sources
In 2009, the maximum load of domestic consumption was 1072 MW in gross consumption of 5,271
GWh. Average annual growth rate of consumption for the period 2000 - 2009 was over 7% and the
estimated loss (either commercial or technical) of 42 % of the amount of available energy for sale.
While, according to forecasts, with discounts up to 18% losses, local needs in 2020, according to the
following scenarios will arise in:
a)          1410 MW, in case of high economic growth of the country (or an annual increase of 2.1%) and
b)          1890 MW, in case of high economic growth of the country (or annual growth of 4.2%).
Efficient functioning of the network of distribution and transmission of electricity is of great
importance of exchanges in the system of interconnection and operation of the market in the region.
Construction of new 400 kV line between. Kosovo Region and Albania's Region anables a long-term
optimism also provides two complementary systems.
The project "New Kosovo", envisages the construction of new power plant, based on the use of lignite
reserves in the new mining area, to enable supply of blocks in the existing power plants by the end of
their life and in new power plants with maximum capacity up to 2,000 MW for a period of more than
40 years. Based on these assessments, capacity building more affordable is also examining possible
scenarios, under each option, by:
A.    The timing of construction;
B.    The size and location suitable for the construction of TPP "Kosova e Re”;
C.    The size of blocks for TC and the New Kosovo and
D.    TC Technology of blocks in the New Kosovo.
From the scenarios for the duration and manner of developments in building blocks, namely
generating units provided, are highlighted as:
I.    Rapid development, with construction and consecutive phases of the generation units (blocks),
      first 2 x 300 MW of installed construction duration and entry to work after 4 / 5 years, continuing
      with the construction and activation of two other blocks 2 x 300 MW of rotating up to 2020 and
      then rest up to 2000 MW in total after the year 2025;
II.   Periodically development with construction of the generation units (blocks), in every six (6)
      months from the 300 MW installed, depending on the requirements of local consumption and
      regional interest.
Based on previous studies and fulfilled criteria for selection of spatial locations for building new
generating units are identified these possible locations:
       In the industrial area near TPP Kosovo A
       In the industrial area close to Kosovo B
       In agricultural free zone near the village Bivolak
       In the natural free zone and near the village Graboc
Of course, selecting the most suitable location for construction of power plant `Kosova e Re`, is
necessary to define the appropriate manufacturing capabilities, namely the size of new units within the
center generating electrical energy. The proposals currently identified, the size of units (capacity of

                   The Spatial Plan for the Special Economic Interest Area "New Mining Field"                             107


generating units) to be used, are based on and depend from: the power system, modern technologies
commercialism certified and environmentally acceptable.
The sizes of the blocks are different, but, for Kosovo are preferred:
          -         300 MW Blocks and
          -         500 MW Blocks,
Both using the preferred two technologies, the CFB - combustion and fluid bad (layer) and the PC -
burning in the dust particles.
In principle, larger units are more efficient, but for the moment in terms of power system operation
with lower-cost units are more appropriate to order 300 MW, while in the next phases may also be
sized units of 500 – 600 MW.
Technology blocks, as may be referred to CFB and PC to order 300 MW units, which are planned to be
built at this stage, the new power plant, based on studies of POYRY. These technologies are preferred
with these features:
      Combustion technology in the dust (pulverized firew - PF) of lignite for power installed in blocks
      of 300, 500, 700 MW and net efficiency of the block up to 42%, and
      The technology layer of fluid circulation (circulating fluidity - CFB) power installed blocks 100,
      200, 300 net MW and block efficiency up to 39% .




3.2.2. LIGNITE USE FOR POWER PLANTS SUPPLY


From the evaluations and selections favored scenarios mentioned above, for the duration and location
of construction, capacity of units and blocks technology of new power generation depends on the
direction of development and speed of advancement of mining in a new lignite mine.
To enable the provision of sufficient production of electricity in the future, should open a new mine
from which will be provided necessary quantities of lignite for continuous supply of existing plants
and new infrastructure. Area "C" or so called "Mining of the Sibovc"25, and as a new mine provides raw
materials, that has total area of 19.7 km ², and within it, what to use lignite is 16 km ². This source of
lignite, which, as activities will be held for 4-5 decades to come, located in the central area of the zone
of FMR (NMF) and lies west of the town of Obilic and is the sequel to the north of the existing mining
of the Bardh and Mirash.
Meanwhile, for soften of the short- term effects for normal development of the new mining, KEK has
expanded its activities in the eastern part of Mirash, called Sitnica sector, where exploitable reserves are
close to 10 million tones.
Based in mining project to develop a new mine, with the aim of continuous supply of TPP Kosovo A
and Kosovo B, KEK JSC in 2009, has conducted a project at the opening of the new mining Sibovc at
South-West, where coal production will start in 2010.
In the process of mining developments continuously is required, primarily to be moulded the upper
layer of soil and the folding of this wasteland in-depth spaces in existing mines (Bardh and Mirash),
where subsequently continued excavation and issued by the transportation of coal as well as directly to
power plants. Of the transferred amount of lignite from the mine, a small amount is reserved for
drying and serves as a reserve, close to productive capacity.


Siboc Village, located in the center of the FMR, in previous plans was the name I borrowed mine for the new mining




                                                                                       MESP - Spatial Plannig Institute

However, for unobstructed functioning of the process of mineral development should be taken
preliminary measures and activities, the release of a site, for work plan prepared by mining. So earlier
measures should be planned and other activities necessary for inventory, expropriation, compensation
and relocation - resettlement of the population with accepted material and spiritual benefits of their, as
well as relocation of infrastructure facilities.




3.2.3. POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR POPULATION TRANSFER


In the space of the area of interest of FMR (NMF) are the 26 settlements, which directly or indirectly are
affected by expected developments in the construction and operation of generating units, the transfer
and disposal of ash, in advancing mining and transport of coal as well as transmission and distribution
of electricity etc..
Settlements located on reserves of coal, and directly affected by the process of mining developments (in
the mass of overburden displacement, coal extraction and transfer) are: Hade, Sibovc, Shipitullë and
Leshkoshiq (Lajthishte). Besides these also is the village Krushec (Dardhishte) that directly impacted by
the effects mentioned and Mirash regional landfill. If the actions prescribed by Spatial Plan (SP) for the
FMR (NMF) area do not provide the results of improvement of the environmental situation in the
village then there is the option to avoid displacement as well as four settlements first. These five (5)
settlements, which required special treatment because they will be subject to the necessary process of
displacement, belonging to the municipality of Obilic. Therefore, are given the problems that faced the
Government (central and local) during the relocation of a portion of the village of Hade, it is
recommended to be taken some preliminary steps before continuing with the process of relocation and
resettlement of population in new settlements.
Lessons from the past show that the relevant institutions (government, municipality, KEK, etc.) should
be much more prepared with concrete plans of action, in order to progress the process.
In the meantime, is being finalized the draft "Policy Framework for Relocation”, expected to be
approved by the government, separately or along with this plan, to avoid concerns of residents
relocating settlements. Therefore, the same provides that, for the realization of the process of relocation
- resettlement of population, should follow some concrete steps, such as following:
    Involvement of key participants in the process - the main actors in this process to be included
    are: affected residents, representatives of central and local government, KEK, foreign investment
    company, supporting organizations, etc..
    Meetings with the public - such discussions with the community and stakeholders involved in
    the process are necessary since the beginning of the process until its conclusion. These discussions
    enable the public notice at any time and directly inform the community about the situation and
    ongoing operations of the process.
    Completion of appropriate legislation - is required at the beginning of the process to be
    completed legislation for expropriation, agricultural land, building, citizens' rights to
    compensation, etc., in order not to allow gaps and ambiguities in legal terms during the process.
    Creating a database - this database will serve to introduce, storage, processing and development
    of data for different indicators for the territory affected by separate issues under the relocation
    process and beyond. Preferably, the designated institution will be responsible for the creation,
    maintenance, classification, preservation and development of all data in one place.
    Identification of property and real estate - it is necessary to identify, and therefore should
    establish a commission to identify the true owners, evaluation and compensation of real estate and
    property.

    Establishment of “Independent Commission for Claim Review” - responsible for covering all
    aspects of the project. This committee should consist of representatives from relevant sectors of
    government, municipalities, communities, KEK companies, MWSW and investors, so that any
    interested parties not to create undue favors or dissatisfaction. In order to decrease (facilitation) of
    the concerns of residents, the same commission is established for covering all aspects of the
    project.
    Assessment of property – The project company will do the valuation of the property and set up
    the sum for compensation, creates a mirror as the correct evaluation and compensation of
    property, organizing research that will identify the property and its real value, on criteria that will
    develop and release results for the assessment of each property or real estate (whether residential,
    warehouse various attachments or even the surface of forest, farmland, etc.).
    The method of compensation - Determination of compensation will performed by means of
    Project Company, based on the needs and demands of the community, the resettlement policy
    framework and the law on expropriation, where are defined and distinguished these possibilities:
    a ) Payment of money (cash) on hand, b) Compensation of land with land, and c) Change of
    building construction. Valuation and method of compensation will be reflected in the resettlement
    action plan which will be approved and monitored from the Expropriating Authority.
    Determination of the place and develop plans of rialocation - Selection of location for the
    restoration of the displaced population first of all must preceding research and analysis which
    highlight the interest of residents to their next relocation. It is imperative that after determining
    the preferred locations of required development of regulatory plans for those areas. Here may be
    preferred the built areas (existing settlements in the municipality of Obilic) in many cases (density)
    of objects or even construction in vertical (in canterbury) within settlements (eg Obiliq, Mazgit,
    Miloshev and the Graboc Upper), in order to preserve agricultural land. In collaboration with the
    community and relevant authorities will be decided on the shape and position of objects of
    worship, monuments and cemeteries as the most sensitive matters, which are also part of Urban
    Regulatory Plans to be developed for sites dedicated for restore the population of displaced
    settlements.
    Establishment of advice-talkie office - the office should be established to Obiliq the beginning of
    the process of relocation, in order to offer advice to various community about the procedures and
    timing of relocation, issues locations, type of compensation, benefits and conditions of
    employment, access to infrastructure and services, transparency of investment (accumulation and
    consumption) of the fund for the displaced, etc.
    Fund Establishment of the displaced community – Taking into account the difficulties faced by
    displaced residents from the settlements (the loss of property and other material goods and
    spiritual), it is necessary that by a decision of the competent authorities to establish the "Fund for
    displaced communities”, in order to raise living standards. This fund with its advantages, should
    work at least for the next 10 years.
    The dynamics of displacement - Depending on the dynamics of the mining advancement, should
    also drafted a detailed dynamic plan for relocating action and restore the population of the
    settlements under the relocation process
The Investor drafts new mining project which must be approved by the ICMM (Indipendent
Commission for Mines and Minerals.
The general displacement of the population is based on the development and promotion of the new
mine according to the project approved and under the Dynamic Plan for Relocation, with the time
frame and responsibilities set, compiled by the Investor in cooperation with the Government.
Until 2020, it is necessary to relocate the entire remaining part of the village of Hade and Shipitullë
village that lies in the new mining area, based on the license issued for mining and spatial coverage of
this plan. But after 2020, depending on the development of projects, may continue the shift of other
settlements in the new mining area, the village Sibovc and village Lajthishte (Leshkoshiq) ..

3.2.4. ENVIRONMENTAL REHABILITATION


It is imperative that the area of interest of FMR (NMF), to start immediately with appropriate action in
favor of improving the environment. Throughout the development of mining processes, the generation
and the relocation - resettlement of population in the new settlements, and after their completion, will
also develop the ongoing process of environmental rehabilitation of used areas.


Air


Emissions into the atmosphere - the new plant should be fully in accordance with EU directives,
especially LCP Directives for large combustion plants, which would mean the following steps of
limited emissions release since the start of operation for:
      1.    SG2 sulfur dioxide                  - 200 mg / nm ³
      2.    Nitrogen oxides Nox                 - 200 mg / Nm ³ and
      3.    Particles of dust                   - 30 mg / nm ³
Regarding the products of combustion and emissions levels required in the atmosphere seems burning
CFB (Circulating Bed of fluid) can fulfill emission limits of SG2 and NOx at the exit of cauldron by
using injection of lime, Brener for low NOx and electrostatic for capturing the flying ash. In this
particular case, because that coal contains significant amounts of lime CaSO4 and the percentage of
sulfur in fuel is low, can be expected that emissions of sulfur dioxide will be permitted limit by using
the lowest level of desulphurization. In case of application of PC technology to reduce emissions of SG2
will be applied with lime washing of gases where lime obtained. The grace and power plant produced
by CFB and PC technologies will be transferred to existing mine by plumbing transportation.


Decommissioning of power plant Kosova A. Appointments of entry into work new blocks of TC
`Kosova e Re`, consumer demand, security supply, reduction of electricity import, dates of
rehabilitation of the `Kosovo B` blocks, goal of the Kosovo Energy Strategy 2009 - 2018 and also
obligations which Kosovo have for the Tractate of Energy Community (by which is required also the
respect of Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 23 October 2001 on the
limitation of certain pollutants into the air from Large Combustion Plants) recommend to TPP `Kosovo
A` work by the end of the year 2017 with proposals for overhauls and good maintenance in reducing
emissions.
Liaison Office of European Commission in Kosovo has supported the Study "decommission of the
power plant Kosova A" which was conducted in the spring of 2010 and states that decommissioning
activities begin immediately to develop in stages. The study recommends strategic decisions for the
Government of Kosovo and the dates work for the extraction of the remaining three blocks to work
(A3, A4 and A5) eventually by the end of 2015.
Implementation of the decommissioning of TPP `Kosovo A` should be based on the activities of three
working groups established for following purposes:
      1.    Working Group to complete the necessary studies for the decommissioning, (Chairman MEM
            and other composition of MEF, MESP, MPMS, MEI, KEK).=
      2.    Working Group for Social Issues (Chairman MLSW and comprising MEF, MEM, MEI, KEK.,
            Company Union).
      3.    Working Group for providing funding and performance of decommissioning (MEF Chairman
            and comprising MESP, MEI, MEM, KEK).

Water


Inelaborate water that will be needed for steam cycle systems, cooling, desulphurization, and ash
transport, firefighting, etc., depending on the capacity that is installed and applied technology in the
New Power Plant Kosovo. Requests for inelaborate water from the water channel of Hydro "Iber-
Lepenc", about a block with installed power of 300 MW and annualy full of 7,500, are about 0:21 to 0:22
m3/sec or 5.5 - 6.0 million m3 / year. Annual requirements for raw water will be defined more
precisely when it is known, except installed capacity, applied technology, also the dynamics of
building blocks.
Although the lignite reserves of exploitable mining of new area, except the existing supply Thermo-
Plants (Kosovo A and B) by the end of their durability, enables the construction of new power plants
with final capacity up to 2,000 MW.
In the study of Pre -fisibility "Water supply from Hydrosystem Ibar - Lepenc for Proposed Power
Plant" Kosova C ", about the size of the plant, built with installed power of 2,000 MW is needed 1:52
and 47.93 million m3/year m3/sec. Currently theK”osovo B` power plant, is supplied by the main
channel of water of this Hydrosystem by 0.5 m3/sec and 15.77 million m3/year. This system, managed
by Public Enterprise HS Iber-Lepenci, established for this purpose and does not require building an
additional channel, as the existing channel passes through village Bivolak and terminates at the
location of the `Kosovo B` power plant. In case of construction of TC's " NewKosovo ' in different
location, you must also build additional channel within this system or other sources may be used, if
sufficient for its supply with water.
Basin of water reserves. For security reasons the operation of power plant `B` and the `New Kosovo` at
the end of the main channel of hydro Iber - Lepenc will be build a water basin for reserves regarding
Plant operation about two weeks without interruption.


Land


Land use in space of the area of interest should be limited, by category and by type / type of use,
which are not sensitive to pollution of land, this may be part of oriented spatial planning for the entire
surface of the rich environmental with the Lignite Resource.
The extracted fly ash in the electrostatic will be collected in the pneumatic manner (Bunker) in the
plant blocks. From balancing reservoir will be transferred to another tank where the mixing of ash with
water will be in ratio 1:1, from Suspension pumped to the ash dump in Mirash, where such mixing
precipitation, will gradually ingrained under water surface which will be drainaged and turn on the
power plant. This system of transfer is common suspension as fly ash and for soot, which comes in
tank furnaces particularly, where, after cooling the particles continues to tank mix.
Taking in consideration that a large number of waste, harmful and not harmful, are produced in power
plants, proceeds the need of building such waste landfills with the necessary equipment. Waste will be
stored and processed in an orderly manner in accordance with the legislation in Kosovo and EU
guidelines on waste and bury them.
Project of Cleanup and Land Reclamation (PPRT). Project in implementation, by WB donations from
the Netherlander Kingdom, designed and implemented by KEK, according to the following
components:
        Rehabilitation, shaping and reclamation of ash dump TPP Kosovo A. It made the
        rehabilitation of some areas around the ash landfill (Flattening and coverage of the valleys,
        potholes and gaps) and improved infrastructure for the establishment of better access and
        other needs of the project.


                                                                                    MESP - Spatial Plannig Institute

        Establish a system for hydraulic transport of ash. It is tender to perform the plumbing system
        installations for the transportation of ash. Now is the stage of selecting the best company to
        perform.
        Removal of dangerous materials and waste in chemicals separations from industrial areas
        of TC Kosova A. The report was prepared for the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), for
        which was organized the public debate in Obiliq. From BB preparations for the announcement
        of tender for the project "Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste from the area of
        gasification plant in Obilic" after receiving environmental approval. MESP has received the
        application from KEK and after comprehensive analysis, issue environmental consents under
        the conditions and legislation applicable to the treatment and removal of 20,241 tons of
        hazardous waste which are located in reservoirs, not provided with protective walls and risk of
        their flow.
        Reshaping, reclamation and regulation of the slope in the outer leaflets of wasteland. It is
        planned that in the summer to start the rehabilitation of the Vasilevo overburden dump which
        is considered one of the landfills with lower stability field. According to the scheduled plan,
        the work on the landfill will be completed in 2011.

3.3. SCENARIOS ASSESSMENT BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT CONCEPT


3.3.1. ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS FOR SELECTION OF LOCATION FOR THE
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW GENERATION CAPACITY
Among the possible scenarios as the most preferred options, based on preliminary studies and research
that will be analyzed and evaluated as potential locations for building the New TC's, we emphasize
four of them:
Scenario A:     Building of TC `NK` in industrial location TPP Kosovo A;
Scenario B:     Building of TC `NK` in industrial location Kosovo B;
Scenario C:     Building of TC` NK` in the green area in village Bivolak and
Scenario D:     Building of TC` NK ` in the green area in the village Grabovc.
During treatment the four scenarios is made by examining the effects of multiple spatial indicators,
environmental, social, economic, infrastructure and various services related to the area. In order to
simplify the work, first the common features are extracted, and between following are the specific
design criteria (which in itself may contain some indicators) for assessment of each location separately
and eventually collected values is making comparison between them to distinguish the most suitable.
Characteristics common to all four scenarios
Proposed scenarios A, B, C and D, presented as Fig. 3.2, are best treated and analyzed, and the
estimates are categorical and stated the facts as common features::
        Area of FMR (NMF), continues to be generating center for electricity in Kosovo, where local
        lignite resources are used efficiently and knowing that:
        TC existing blocks are far from the international environmental standards, because their
        operational life is limited, based on claims arising from the new Directives of the EU;
        TC `Kosovo A` should be closed eventually, by the end of 2017 or even earlier, due to aging
        blocks and operational security issues;
        Rehabilitation of contaminated zone at the site of `Kosovo A` power plant's to be
        accomplished with the project and local staff under the supervision of investment and the EU
        supervision;
        The two units-blocks of `Kosovo B` power plant's, must undergo rehabilitation during the
        planning period 2016-2017;
        Removal of ash deposited or arrangement in its location of TC's Kosovo B will be applied by
        local staff under the project and investment and oversight of the EU;
        The first Block-unit of TC `New Kosova`, will have to start with the operation, before closing
        the TC's `Kosovo A`, the first block at the end of 2015, while the second block in the 2016.
        Available coal reserves found within the FMR (NMF)-have been sufficient to supply both the
        existing TC-up at the end of their operation and for the next 4-5 decades and enables
        construction of new TC with maximum capacity up to 2,000 MW;
        Advancement of the mining plan developed according to the development of installed
        generation capacity;
        Relocation of settlements within the new mining area, is the same for all scenarios, whereas
        scenarios C and D provide additional displacement of settlements;
        The possibility of employment will be the same for all scenarios;
        Transformation of land surface area of mining recovery after exploitation of lignite reserves
        within tëFMR (NMF), is long and continuously process, which run parallel with the pace of
        work and progress of mining;
        Re-cultivation of existing external leaflets overburden is being implemented by KEK
        respectively DPRT / DPQ;
        Filling and reclamation of existing mining areas Bardhi, Sitnica and Mirash, remain addicted to
        mineral development and disposal of ash from TC's;
        Rehabilitation of existing ash dumps in all scenarios is the same as the practices and standards
        with international best practices;




                                                                                    MESP - Spatial Plannig Institute

        Evacuation of power from all the blocks in the new power plant in the four scenarios will be
        realized in the transmission of voltage 400 kV.


Specific criteria for evaluation of scenarios
In an attempt for selecting the most suitable location for construction of new power plant blocks (TC
`Kosova e Re`(`New Kosovo`, ) were designed by specific criteria (special) assessment, emerging from
the social aspect, economic, environmental and technical infrastructure. To compare the effects for
about depending on the location of proposed or better expressed for each scenario separately, are given
values appropriate, the criteria listed in the aspects mentioned, see fig. 18 and table 14 below.

The Selected scenario - “B”


This scenario, based on existing infrastructure in the initial phase allows the construction of 2 x 300
mW. Continuation of additional capacity building in this location requires performing some
preliminary work prior to construction of TC's' New Kosovo ', which means the removal of part or all
of the ash dump in the industrial complex of TC's' Kosovo B 'as well as providing protection and
generation facilities from the risk of flooding that occurs in the area due to flood of Sitnica River.
This scenario because of its proximity to the center of FMR (NMF) and the transmission, provides
transportation to the shortest distance to and from new generation capacity, using all the existing
infrastructure for moving coal and the energy generated. These new buildings are not required to
supply the necessary infrastructure, communication and circulation (roads, bridges, railways, new
channel for the supply of water and fresh ash removal, etc.) and also contributes to the preservation of
agricultural land and private properties.Whereas, multiple social and environmental impact is lower
because the reductions in air pollution emissions, although the lower level will affect the new mining
area, from which the displaced population settlement is found there without additional displacement
of any settlement as in other cases or scenarios.
Selected scenario has advantages and disadvantages as follows:
Advantages:
    1.    Reduced Impact of air pollution from power plants Kosovo B and` New Kosovo ` rehabilitated
          built according to standards of best global practices in settlements around (in the area under
          the relocation process) by the emission of gases and particulates under the direction of winds;
    2.    Using the free space within the existing industrial area (brown field);
    3.    Protection from exploitation of new areas of agricultural land;
    4.    The existence of the necessary technical infrastructure, communications and transport (roads,
          squares, railway, river, storage, transformers, network transmission, distribution, etc.).
    5.    Use of existing facilities and infrastructure of administrative workshops and services that meet
          the requirements and needs for new buildings of this type;
    6.    Location for construction of new generating capacity has only one owner and that is KEK as a
          public institution;
    7.    The closest distance to the center of FMR (NMF), the ease and possibility of using existing
          facilities for transportation of coal to New Kosovo TC,
    8.    Removal and regulation of the ash landfill near the Kosovo B, the minimization of pollution
          and improvement of the situation;
    9.    There kyqjes point and in the vicinity of 1 km 'the channel to supply plants with water from the
          existing system of Iber-Lepenci;
    10. Acceptable Distance for the potential impact to the capital Prishtina and International Airport;
    11. Inclusion of a new power plant at the existing plant and transmission network in Kosovo and
        interconnection (400 kV and 220 kV) located at 1 km 'distance of the site;
    12. Smaller impact on the heritage and biodiversity in comparison with other scenarios;
    13. Forestation of the green belt, for more consolidated protection.


Disadvantages:
    1.    Concentration of power generation in the future with only one manufacturing location
          (Kosovo B + New TC) for the period of fifteen (15) years.
    2.    Site is located in risked area of flood by Sitnica River;

3.3.2. SCENARIO ASSESSMENT OF NEW MINING DEVELOPMENT


Latest Mining Plan, drafted by Vatenfall Europe and DMT, are given the possible options (or scenarios)
for the manner and direction of development and progress of mining in the area of new mining known
as 'C' or village-based field Sibovc, as in fig.19.

The scenario selected for the mine development - “A”
By analyzing many scenarios, is made the selection of scenario "A", as well as the economic
environment, the favorite to open the new mine. This scenario is oriented to mining development,
starting from the mines part, for which KEK owns the mining license issued by the ICMM, the so-
called south-western Sibovc. This sub-area is located in north-western part of the existing mine Bardhi
and near the neighborhood `Berisha` of the Lower Grabovci and belongs to the municipality of Fushe
Kosovo. Advancing mining will continue towards the North, always passing through the territory of
the municipality of Obilic, including the neighborhoods of settlements to be moved (Hade, Shipitullë,
Leshkoshiq / Lajthisht and Sibovc), up near the village Bivolak in the municipality Vushtrri.
Having adopted this scenario are gained the following advantages:
 o   Using existing positioned infrastructure
 o   Using open space for disposal of overburden, ash and lime
 o   The length of the overburden transportation systems will be smaller
 o   Coal transportation systems will use existing track belt highways and in some cases, existing
     devices.
 o   Favorable conditions for the start of the adjustment of spaces in existing mines
Overburden folding measures implemented by using existing mining areas which will gradually fill
up, also based in the same document. So in the final stage of coverage, when the quotas will be
achieved +607 m 'height above sea level in the west, then continue filling in the east following the
terrain.

4. COMPETITIVE (BIDDING) STRATEGIES

4.1.    STRATEGY BY TREND (OR ZERO )




T    he Strategy `Zero` or the so-called `Size Trend`, which means strategy, enables the continuation of
     the current trend of developments, by way of uncontrolled interventions in space and the
     individual's own investment of Inappropriatemanned and unplanned. This strategy does not lead
to the harmonized development and perspective since there is no orientation organized by a group,
organization or institution. In addition, future developments are not based on any planning activities
based on any study, research or design plan in advance with timeframes, budget implications and the
necessary institutional framework for implementation.
In the case of the FMR (NMF) area, the failure of local consumer demand for electricity may be
necessary under current demand and manufacturing of non-building new generation capacity, will
continue the dependence of electricity supply for the long term from imports of countries. This, also, is
the result of delays in decisions to build new generation capacity and not providing favorable
conditions for sustainable economic development of the country and raising the quality of life.
Zero Strategy in the area of FMR (NMF)-will have the consequence:
        Continuation of reductions in electricity;
        deadlock in the country's economic development;
        deterioration of life quality;
        An increase in unemployment;
        Closing of the obligation of the existing TPP Kosovo A and Kosovo B "according to a
        predetermined time period;
        Removal of foreign investments in the energy sector and mining;
        increasing the import of electricity from neighboring countries;
        High cost of electricity from imports for local consumption;
        Do not use coal reserves;
        Do continuous monitoring of environmental conditions;
        Continue the development of uncontrolled space;
        Loss and degradation of agricultural land and environment around.

4.2. STRATEGY ACCORDING TO THE DEVELOPMENT CONCEPT


Authorities of central institutions in collaboration with external donors interested shall take
appropriate measures toward the use of local energy resources, reserves of coal for generating needs
and fulfilling the requirements of EU for renewable energy sources. Directly to the development of new
energy capacity will enable secure supply of electricity in the long term and sustainable development
(environmental, economic and social). Obviously, this is the basis of previous issues and safe for
investment, domestic and foreign, in all areas of weakened economy of Kosovo


The Kosovo government has clearly, in a very close time period, taking into account the dynamics of
the rapid developments in the region and beyond, especially care to climate change as consequence of
global warming, global financial crisis will be very hard on the further exploitation (extraction and
burning) resource of lignite to produce electricity.


Building new power plant at the location selected, rational and efficient (with more advanced
technology blocks) of lignite reserves, providing regular blocks for the production of certain plants,
which together with work on energy transfer in the interconnection and construction of new 400 kV
line between Kosovo and Albania, increase safety, operation and optimization of energy system of the
Republic of Kosovo.
Small area of land required for construction in the area of industrial complex "Kosovo B", just so long
as the building blocks needed for new 2 x 300 MW TCKR's.
From Mining Company will be required to do rehabilitation, as to fill the holes, the existing mining
Bardhi and Mirash and that of Sibovc. The mining company will fulfill the plan for r e-cultivation areas
used. The plan is approved by ICMM and will be in line with the main mineral mining plan, and
owner will be - managing KEK.
Fund dedicated to community development will be 10 million euros. This fund will support
community development programs for development impact of mining and generation. The fund's goal
is to help the community to improve their lives, improve social and physical environment in their
training and participation in decision-making process.
Generation company will build and operate the water basin, in order to provide security of water
supply in case of any failure in the water channel. The Kosovo government will expropriate the space
which is needed for construction of the basin, and the same space will rents generation company for
construction and operation of the basin. With the conclusion after expiration of the rental, the basin
water will pass to ownership of the Government. The basin of water will provide water needed in the
event of termination of the total flow of water in the channel, due to repairs of the canal or for any
other reason (human or natural). In order to ensure two-week supply for Kosovo B and TCKR,
estimated that the basin needs to be built with a capacity of 2 million m3.
Development of the relocation - resettlement of population from the settlements in the new mining area
also has special significance, even more sensitive. Restoring their new dwellings, requires planning and
control in density and expansion of existing settlements in an cleaner living environment. This is
achieved with the design of urban regulatory plans, and are acceptable when carried out within the
area of interest or even within the municipality of Obilic.
Will be determine and implement of the surrounding belt, washed green and other barriers aimed at
protection of the population and the environment in settlements around the affected area at risk of
degradation, pollution, noise and vibrations.
Ongoing process of environmental remediation (waste disposal and recovery of contaminated areas
within the industrial area of TPP Kosovo A, cleaning and removal of ash at Kosovo B, rehabilitation
and reclamation of ash near the TPP Kosovo A and external leaflets wasteland), is expected to be
achieved with various projects prepared by the locals to their implementation. Meanwhile, to realize

these projects, interested should seek and gain international donations (like the case of Project Land
Clearance and Rehabilitation - PPRT), environmental policies and programs of the EU, whether foreign
investment or grants or to Recent joint well-funded with participation of the Government.
 Development strategy under the concept, expresses the following maps, presented as Fig. 46, which
means selecting the best possible development of the proposed scenarios. Here are evaluated and
discussed the preferred options, processes and highly developed area related to special economic
interest of the New Mining Field.

4.2.1. STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT ACCORDING TO THE DEVELOPMENT CONCEPT
Development of a strategy, based on selected scenarios under future development concept, clarified
and understood more easily, recalling the pyramid scheme as in figure 13, over derivues through the
process (the opening) according to the hierarchy, from the overhead vision to end to the action.
Specifically, the development strategy being broken down into four goals (or general purpose), which,
each of them, continue to be derived further in several specific objectives. Also these objectives, each of
them continues to shared actions (measures, activities and relevant projects).

A4.G5. MANAGEMENT AND EXPLOITATION OF FRESH ASH IN CONSTRUCTION NEEDS
(2010 – 2020+)
Environmental legislation and European technical standards consider the using fresh ash as raw
material for providing some profitable products with particular emphasis on construction (cement and
concrete). The role and benefits of fresh ash are very widely known in the literature and highly studied.
Therefore, this objective is based on the exploitation of these industrial waste in order to directly assist
in improving the environmental status of the area and the possibility of the creation of new jobs for
area residents and it`s economic development.
Taking into account that in Europe the destination of the use of fresh ash is as follows: construction
industry (46%) environmental regulation (43%) Saving as a temporary backup (6%) and filling of
potholes and road space (5%), the target tends to be achieved through measures / projects / activities

4.3.    FORESEEN USE OF LAND FOR 2020


Changes in space encountered in the envisaged use of land for 2020, as below in Figure 48, the use of
land as in 2009, are due to development and progress of the processes generating, mining,
rehabilitation and relocation settlements.

From here, is noted that there is a reduction of industrial zones, two of them as they were in a single
and for more reduce the air emissions from and under the direction of the wind, because of the use of
advanced technologies and relocation of population from the settlements in the central area (or direct
impacts).
Moreover, decreased areas of landfills and quantities of ash, which already after his transfer and
clearance area in `Kosova B` and the rehabilitation of the area close to `Kosovo A`, already has other
treatment. Fresh Grace is able to be used for work on roads or basic layers for the production of strong
and insulator elements in construction. Obviously, the reduction of open space mining comes
automatically, because it will remain open only new mines, but holes in existing mining will be
eliminated by being filled with new wasteland foldings.
Maps in follow, as in Fig. 49, represents the possible extent of air pollution in the area of interest by
emissions of sulfur dioxide (SG2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from TC `New Kosovo`, based on current
research.

4.4. EVALUATION OF STTRATEGIES


Of course, to ensure the strategy under development concept of the Spatial Plan for the area of special
economic interest FMR (NMF)-that is good and positive, have to face any other strategy devised by
comparing them through the recognized criteria for evaluation of strategies.
In this case, since we have no other strategy prepared in advance, makes a comparison between two
strategies elaborated in this chapter as the fourth stage of this document. Evaluation and comparison
between the "Strategy according to the concept of spatial development" and "Zero Strategy (under
development or trend), which implies continuity of the development of unplanned and uncontrolled, is
made and presented in Table 15, as follows.

CONCLUSION. Every action development, development strategy within the concept of advanced
(and advancing synergic sectional conflict mitigation), as is planned, controlled, and conducted by
government institutions to support the legal framework, it appears to be more successful and
organized for its implementation under shared responsibilities unsuccessful actions against
individual strategy within the trend, with disorganized in application development (investment,
duration and control) properly.

          The area within the evidentiary special economic interest has an area of 14. 986 ha (hectares).
          Space within the new mining within the basin of Kosovo should be preserved exclusively for
          mining activities.
          Opening of the new mine to be developed gradually on unfolding lignite at the same time
          covering used spaces.
          The settlements must be removed, according to advance based on the master Mining Plan
          developments, municipal authorities take a decision on the prohibition of new construction
          after the inventory of real estate.
          Construction of new housing in the period after the decision by the municipal authorities on
          the prevention of their building, before the relocation process, are considered illegal
          constructions and not compensated.
          Regulates land surfaces, after the rehabilitation of degraded areas pass to the ownership of
          the municipality for further r e-cultivation and use as agricultural resource.
          Due to land slide potential in this area even after the land restitution process, not provided
          the establishment of new settlements on these areas as well as the mining pits Bardh, Sitnica,
          Mirash and after re-filling and return to them in space flat;




5.2. PROVISION FOR CONSULTATION, COOPERATION AND
    PARTICIPATION

          Preparation of this plan is based on the use of all consultations to date scientific research and
          valuable discussions with senior public cooperation and participation in meetings that are
          initiated and conducted by the Office of Technical Assistance of Project Power from Lignite
          (PATEL) for preparation of various reports and SESA for FMR (NMF) Development Plan .
          Inter-Ministerial Working Group, formed since the beginning of the process of drafting this
          plan (only two ministries in charge of MESP and MEM), which is expanding very quickly
          with representatives from other relevant ministries and interest, and little time subsequently
          met with representatives from participating municipalities and KEK (Kosovo Energy
          Corporation, a joint stock company).
          The working group (IMWG) must also meet when requested revision or drafting of the new
          plan because of the experience and qualifications of participants.
          Participation in consultative meetings consist of participants from all stakeholders.
          Comments from the public meetings (be they discussions, consultations or public review), are
          taken into account and join the Plan.
