Background and Reasonsfor Restructuring

3.     Kosovo declared i t s independence on February 17, 2008. The United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), which was established o n June 10, 1999, s t i l l acts
under the United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1244 but has started i t s
drawdown. National authorities govern under the Constitution o f the Republic o f Kosovo, which
came into effect on June 15,2008.

4.                                                         n
         On July 10, 2008, Kosovo applied for membership i the Bank Group. O n June 3, 2009
(i) Board o f Governors o f IBRD adopted IBRD Resolution No. 597 approving the terms and
    the
conditions o f KOSOVO'S    membership; (ii)   the Board of Governors o f IDA adopted IDA
Resolution No. 221 approving the terms and conditions of Kosovo's membership; (iii) Board
                                                                                   the
o f Directors o f IFC adopted I F C Resolution No. 249 approving the terms and conditions o f
Kosovo's membership; and (iv) the Council o f Governors of MIGA adopted MIGA Resolution
No. 83 approving the terms and conditions o f KOSOVO'S      membership. O n June 29, Kosovo
became a member o f the World Bank and the IMF, signing the Articles o f Agreement o f both
institutions as well as the Articles o f Agreement o f IDA and IFC, and the MIGA and ICSID
Conventions.

5.      As a member o f the Bank, Kosovo will assume legal responsibility for the various grants
which have been provided by the Bank/IDA (in its own capacity or as administrator o f grant
funds) to UNMIK, for the benefit o f Kosovo. This will be done through two bilateral
agreements: (i) bilateral assumption agreement between the Bank and Kosovo; (ii) one
                 one                                                                    and
bilateral release agreement between the Bank and UNMIK.

6.     Activities for which Kosovo will assume responsibilities include six IDA grants, two
IDA additional financing grants, eight trust fund grants, and two closed but s t i l l disbursing trust
fund grants. While grants impose no repayment obligations, Kosovo will assume the fiduciary,
reporting and implementation obligations associated with grants.

Proposed Changes

7.       The proposed changes will result in Kosovo assuming formal responsibility for
implementation, reporting and fiduciary obligations associated with the grants involved. The
Government o f Kosovo will assume all responsibilities and rights f i o m the Provisional
Institutions o f Self-Government (PIS G).

Analysis

8.      The proposed changes do not significantly affect the original economic, financial,
technical, institutional or social aspects o f the projects as appraised. The proposed changes do
not raise the environmental category o f the projects involved or trigger new safeguard policies.
The restructuring does not involve any exceptions to Bank policies.




                                                  3
Expected Outcomes

9.      Two IDA Grants, Lignite Power Technical Assistance Project (IDA H2.540) and Avian
Influenza Control Project (IDA H2720), mention in their PDOs support and assistance to PISG.
As a result o f assumption o f responsibilities by Kosovo o f the two IDA Grants, the Government
o f Kosovo will assume all rights and responsibilities from PISG, which will result in a change in
the PDOs. . N o other project objectives and outcomes will need to be revised as a result o f the
restructuring.

Benefits and Risks

10.      The proposed changes ensure that Kosovo formally assumes all responsibilities for
activities that have been or continue to be implemented in Kosovo. As Kosovo i s already, in
practice, responsible for most implementation arrangements associated with the continuing
activities, implementation risks are limited. The proposed changes will not incur new financial
responsibilities for Kosovo, since the activities for which Kosovo will n o w assume responsibility
include grants exclusively. A new Interim Strategy Note, to be presented to the Board in January
2010 and covering FYlO and FY11, will include efforts to ensure that implementation
arrangements, including fiduciary and procurement systems, are strengthened further as the new
strategy will assist Kosovo in building an efficient, accountable and fiscally sustainable public
sector.
